I've been reading the Psalms during the pandemic and I'm going through them and this Psalm I read day was the Psalms 105 and I was beautiful beautiful I'm reading it through the passion translation and it's about but the Covenant and the promises and that's where King David goes through the promise to a burr I know and and through the struggles and deliberations and freedom people cry out to him and so I it just really feels hope this morning whether the wonders he has performed is reversed before [Music] okay I think what are the wait oh she's back hello everyone thank you for being here today dr. al released and I represent 36th congressional district here in California we are joined today by Jarvis Crawford executive pastor resina Shepherd Jan hi Dixie Miller Wayman Fuhrman Troy strange Bishop caffee on Sheppard Jerry Crawford a pastor Ronnie Crump senior pastor says Ron Carter Deborah Franklin Master Sergeant Edward Bracken's I want to thank each of you for being here today to lead discussion on such an incredibly important issue that's very much weighing on all of our hearts and all of our minds we come together today experiencing a mix of emotions mix of hurtful motion sometimes there's anger there's sadness there's injustice with fresh wounds causing pain and suffering and we are hungry for faith love and hope hope in action and hope and change just over the last few weeks we've watched the unprovoked shooting of Ahmad Harbury in Georgia the harassment of Christian Cooper in New York City's Central Park and most recently the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and these just happened to be the incidents that were caught on camera not to mention the names of Brianna Taylor Eric garner Michael Brown Tamir rice Freddie gray Alton sterling and the list goes on there have been generations of racial injustice --is that black Americans have endured since our country's founding I am heartbroken and outraged that so many horses are excusing validating and even encouraging these abhorrent behavior still today and I believe that silence is complicity it is not good enough to merely oppose hey I believe that people in positions of power must actively listen learn and advocate for change but let me be clear when I say people in positions of power and I want to tell those people in power and I want them to know that power is derived from the people and it is clear that as a nation we are in desperate need of healing of change compassion unity and leadership and that starts with listening they start with elevating black voices and

also am the founder of the man division Christian Nash group and my institution also I am the vice chairman of the Coachella Valley Association of Governments of Public Safety Committee and one of the biggest things that catapulted me into law enforcement where my interactions negative interactions and I figured the best way to counteract that is was to become one and I think I've been successful but it takes more than one person it takes more than one community and we're seeing that now that it's going to take our whole nation to stand in solidarity with us to fight these deep deep rooted racial injustice is that we have in our country and sometimes it's a it's not a comfortable situation or should I say conversation but it's needs to be had and I think this is great and I just

bring it back to the valley I'm a former city councilman in the city of Indio worked in various cities city of Desert Hot Springs I was there for seven years and economic development redevelopment the city of Evo alums there for two and a half years and I worked with many home builders and development and marriage projects throughout the valley I'm a descendant of John Nobles John Nobu's was one of the first black settlers in India and the valley and he settled a community behind them all it was a community that was there for several decades and which as african-americans came into the city into the area that was a place they could settle because at that time the city would allow african-americans to settle in other places and had access to the water that was available to the city so he said

listen listen intently and and to really help in fostering this conversation as co-host that I'd love for you to kick us off in a conversation if you want to get started if you want to ask a question yes whichever you want to do Thank You congressman so we all know why we're here congressman in this introduction spoke on the the injustice is of African Americans we're not just gonna say injustice from the least brutality but just in justice from society and the way the system works over the past few decades we'll just say it that way you know since the past since passed the civil rights movement we have seen change in America but it hasn't all been positive we recently witnessed a death of an african-american man to the to the knee not to the hands when to the knee of an officer and so we're just going to start the conversation right there your thoughts what we can do as a community submersed your thoughts and then the second part of that question is what we as a community can do and if you can do this just raise your hand up or just begin to speak and then I'll try to listen to see which person I heard this peak person and we'll be away for that person to speak why don't we call on Wayman Furman why don't you go ahead and lead us off Wayman okay I am I'll start off by cinema condolences out to the Lloyd family and folks with and victims of these in justices I think what we're seeing here now as our generations begin to pass some of our generation since I've forgotten I want to say desensitized but used to seeing some of these acts and we have a new generation now who are seeing these things happen not only on television but social media because they're being recorded and I watched alongside of my 17 year old son traumatized I watched mr. Lloyd's life lead right in front of my eyes as he begged for his mother and I told the officer she couldn't breathe and not only as a black man but as a human being that was traumatizing for him me and my son but as a law enforcement officer while I watched this happen happening I was begging and pleading for the other officers to intervene and pull their partner off of his neck knowing the dangers of having someone down on the ground like that and by the look in his eyes and his demeanor and in natial on about mr. Lloyd it troubled me and I started to think maybe that's a cultural thing in that department and I knew that if those officers weren't arrested all four of them our country was gonna see something that we haven't seen ever or in a very long time and I'll go ahead and pass it on now because I could keep going because it was so traumatizing and things like this we cannot forget or erase out of our minds and also it takes us back to when we've had incidents like this or it's happened in our own communities and as a not as an elected official so thank you Thank You councilman Furman mom you know what congressman you've got a better view my phone only shows me a certain amount of people so if you don't mind congressman going ahead and reading off the next day okay I will I will and if I could just remind folks to knew to eliminate the background noise and then and whoever speaking unmute yourself as well but I just wanted to follow up with Wayman Wayman you said you watched it for your seventeen year old son what was the conversation with your 17 year old son like well my son is like most young young adults are young people they're on social media and they're engaging with their their own friends and they felt a lot of anger fear and I wanted to restore some hope and tranquility I'm not only with him and with the community because right now as as we continue to grow our community has a young active progressive young base and they want answers they want some hope and that's why it was uncommon to me not only as an elected official but as a father and a black man to try to get in front of this and bring some tranquility to the conversation and these youngsters before they're still steered in the wrong direction and he was traumatized when you watch that in and every day too since since the incident we've spoken and we talked about it as even Seewald in our country great we've been joined by Dixie Miller president of desert Highland gateway community thank you for joining us Dixie if if you want to if you want to say a couple words of who you are your full name your role in the community everybody had a chance to give a couple of minutes of remarks at the very beginning and an introduction if you'd like to have a couple minutes now introduced seeing yourself please please go ahead Association I've been in the community for 40 silver 40 years I've been in Palm Springs over 40 years and I'm I'm just I'm glad that the posttest is to stay in place but I would like them to be peaceful because I'm on the also one of whom survived V port and I am see a lot of same what if they had body cameras a lot of issues amongst the community and the police departments would be more we would see the truth and it wouldn't be he say heard the police have one side and community have another side be on camera and it would be you can't fight a future just like that guy with his me on that point mr. fuller like that all right the whole world and that's what I am this host Ben Affleck's with police the community he didn't into it and the committee being abused and said this is wrong don't do this or get punished for what they're doing they may get punished but they don't get punished to where they should be punished they get fired okay they can go get another job and keep on living while someone else to die so I just feel that the protesters are good long as they're peaceful and I feel that they should go on until we put some things in place not yes in this instance where the police's are in jail for 30 degree murder but I would love to see something wrote into the law protecting the community the different minority communities and I just have to say that if people would listen to : Kapernick years ago when he kneeled down and was trying to fight for the cause of this happening right now we're being a better position it may not even happen really because it would be things would have been put in place can we follow his lead and city a lot of us jumping and saying that he was wrong and doing this but he was absolutely right hey and I wouldn't you see I don't mean to cut you up we've given each person to minute oh thank you congressman if you want to go ahead and just remind her of the question that I had asked the beginning and Dixie you kind of asked re but it's what killed him what is it that we can do as a community so I wanna know who's next on the the Q Congress you know why don't we go with Reverend Carter Reverend Carter [Music] all righty yes thank you I mean I uh I mean I definitely feel the same way in regards to I mean no one can look at the videotape and not feel something you know I'm not to the point of boiling over anger and I saw four angry but I am totally hurt and bothered even by the it looked like the officer knew that he knew that he had impunity so he can do what he wanted to do even though he was being filmed he didn't even care and neither did his partner care about being filmed because they had the attitude of being for free from being judged by this and so that that greatly bothered me and burdened me and so for you know the conversations that I have you know is that and yes laws needs to be change and what regulations need to be in place but that doesn't change change the person you can change all the environment change the laws change the regulations but the people hearts are still the same it's so affords the church we address the real issue and the issue is the issue of the heart we pray what we must pray for then we do pray or for our people or for our black men for our young black men I mean we pray for those who are commissioned I put to protect of course that the Lord would change their hearts too and fix them because you can have cameras on it and they still gonna do whatever they want to do so if they're not changed on the inside you can put a restraining order don't stop a person from coming getting you if they don't like you so the person has to be changed if the church is called for to address the real issue the issue of the heart and yes we do need those changes and I yes I mean even from a you know from a practical sense because everybody wants something done but there's nothing really clarified about what that is you know everybody want to be heard of course there's injustice yes but what exactly what practically can we do and you know and our part this is and we can keep going yeah we want to give everyone else the chance to speak so congressman if you could please move onto the next person thank you thank you very much our well we'll come back Reverend Carter because I think you were you were right about to to speak to some very important ideas because we you know we want to give hope and we want like hope in action and we want that hope and change hope without action it's simply hope right and so and so we want to realize that we want to live that hope so we'll come back to to that conversation Debbie Debbie Franklin your thoughts and what's going on in words you'd like to share right now to people across the nation I just spoke to Brooklyn this morning my cousin and I've talked to my son-in-law in Virginia and I know there's a lot not disappointment because it goes past that point and we've talked about what can we do I would say that the first thing that comes to mind is both people need to get out and vote people need to be educated mobilized but everybody who is qualified should be out there at the ballot boxes because it's not just our local representatives but it's across the nation and I can't tell you enough how people have said you know people my age have said they would be out there protesting the main thing we've all talked about is everybody who is able has [Music] so what are you experiencing right now Debbie in the community there the San Gorgonio Pass with friends your family what how is this affecting the community well in the local community it really has affected most people because you know we're a senior community and a lot of people are not able to get out and protest but I've spoken to several people who have said if they were younger they would be out there protesting and they are very dismayed that people are not not the destruction as much as knowing that this is still going on they know it goes on they've seen it you know I've had a gentleman asked me is there still rape this isn't in the United States and I have to tell them I have encounter it every day but the main thing people are saying they they want to get on the rolls to get out and I'm sure you'll call us but they want to pick up the phone encourage everybody they know to have an informed vote come November and then we need to keep it up you know when with National Council of Niger women we need to have a full army of people who are able to talk to other people's education because it's not just a boat but to know who you're voting for thank you mrs. Franklin that was to ministry marks congressman if you want to go ahead and choose the next speaker absolutely I wanted to ask Reverend croon Reverend croon can you say a few words please yes I felt the same frustration everyone else felt um and I have to say I was kind of angry I had to really pray and just just kind of deal with my own heart before I could even deal with anybody else you know but I will say that that I just think that we we know that please brutality is nothing new it's people have been crying about a desk that's what you know many groups that were formed even the Black Panthers back in the day they were formed just to police their own communities or so police brutality is nothing new but I think I agree with Debbie we need to be able to vote not just or not just vote for the presidency but also vote during the midterms you know we have we a lot of us are absent on the midterm elections and we need to be able to vote down ballot you know down ballot as well and so I think that's the only way we're gonna be able to impact change and so I'll try to I try to encourage my congregation and community vote you know their votes and you know I try to use the platform that I have to to try to encourage people to vote now I can't tell you who to vote for because we're nonprofit but but I can tell you that we need to vote and so those are the things that I try to do to impact the communities as far as that's concerned but I felt the same frustration but America is throwing up you know a lot of those hidden sands and they're being thrown up yeah and we're seeing the manifest a people maybe and you mentioned Bodie and there's different layers of voting of course there's the national federal policies set by Congress and there's the state and then there's a local in in terms of police departments or law enforcement those decisions are at the local City Council city mayors if they have their own their own their own police departments or it's voting in the sheriff elections for a County a countywide so I just want to stress that that change happens at the ground as well as at the state and federal level so it's also important to just to just under that City Council mayors have enormous roles in setting policy for their local Palm Desert departments they they hire their police chief and of course the elected law enforcement officer here is the is a sheriff sheriff of the county so those elections are very important but the other the other thing I wanted to say is you mentioned that before you win out to counsel others you had to check your own heart and you had to check your own anger how did you do that oh I just had to focus not on individuals you know focus not on the person as much as what caused it you know so what what was causing it you know cuz sometimes it's easy to it's easy to blame a person and say hey you know what I want to go out and I want to do something to all white people you know that wouldn't be right you know because but you have to focus on the real issue is the underlying issue and so that's what I had to do that underlying underlying issue is there's a systemic racism that runs through the veins of America and so we had to you know that's where I had to focus instead of focusing on an individual or individuals and so I had to check my heart and make sure that that map then I'm focused on the right things and not you know against certain people or whatever you know so thank you pastor Baylor would you like I like what uh Jakarta alluded to you can pass all kind of law religiously extensively and meticulously but at the same time you cannot regulate a person's heart and I think what's happening is you have a lot of hatred and individuals who are who was supposed to be protecting and serving us so one of the things that should be considered and it may already be in place but - I don't know to what extent is the someone needs to police the police obviously this gentleman who took the life of George Floyd had a serious problem and if something would have been done maybe the first or even the second or maybe even the third incident maybe this could have been prevented and so I think it the there should be something put in place that allows the community to police the police and every time there is an incident that comes up that is questionable that person needs to be brought before them to be and explain who happened and and and and you know why did you take this course of action with this particular case and then the other thing to consider is I saw and I don't know to what extent the initial process of bringing individuals in truth the police force to take a look at their psyche to take a look at the psychological way of thinking and how they believe in and get a better I still a better idea of how they were raised because a lot of times you have individuals coming into the force and they got issues they have psychological problem so now you've got a loose cannon out there on the streets that's not being policed the kind of think that that come to mind and again going back to what pastor Carter alluded to is you you can regulate all day long but you you know you come you can legislate or delay but you cannot regulate a person's heart rate incarnate that was to you two minutes thank you ain't one just FYI that that buzzing that ring mean I think it's Jarvis is a timer that's right so that you know is is not Jarvis is not by accident I think I think he's just put a timer up just to kind of give people an idea of the timing we have and and now uh you know I'll do some follow-up questions and stuff that we have you know I'm an asked necessarily Ned with Bracken's to speaker then next I'm gonna go to judge arbre Master Sergeant reckons okay well trust him my two minutes everything everybody said it's perfect and I agree with it I also had to do a little self healing before I talked to other people a lot of students that I've had over the last 20-some odd years and I hear their conversations on social media and it's disturbing at times because what we don't have enough there's a lot of places we get started when you start with the education we don't do nothing in education to kind of get people understand the conflicts that have gone on historically we've missed a lot of things that we just had an anniversary a terrible anniversary of a hundred years ago where a whole community because they happen to be african-american were destroyed simply because of that they called it a race tribe but it's not when it's only one side it's not a race riot the other things back to what they said about legislation and stuff those things important the hearts gonna be tough because that's something that hasn't happened at all this time I don't know if there's ever gonna change training is one thing I hear that there's a gentleman who goes out and teaches people how to kill without any regret and if you train people to do that and go out there you're gonna have what you just got over and over and over again somewhere has someone has to talk about what the training is and what kind of training goes into it yes people walk in to a job like that if they're not ready for it same thing in the military why are you going in the military you're going in a purpose to kill versus protect and serve there's a different process to go through we got to somehow find out what the training is prior to someone coming in there's a lot of things that I'm trying to keep myself under two minutes but yes yeah like we gotta finally training what's that transparency in the training as well transparency expectations should not be that you can kill without any regret because what happens to your conscience after a while if you got that ability to absorb that much maim and killing people and not having affect you there's a real concern concern for your psychological makeup but we got it we got to find a way to get through this process and defer to the the people who want to do it from a religious standpoint I love that grew up in the Pentecostal church and that's my cue all right thank you thank you so much hi Jerry so after listening to everyone's statements on this I would just like to say on behalf of the young adult community I think the reason why we are really stepping up is because I personally feel like after the civil rights movement as black people just got stagnant and we just started accepting the systemic racism when that is not okay I know many times during that my mom and my dad just told me that that's just how it is and that's just how it's always been and we're tired of that and we won't accept that and we're now seeing that it's not just african-americans who were witnessing it and personally and I think that education is the first step I have many people who in the beginning of the school they didn't even understand what we were fighting for and they didn't understand that it was deeper than her exploit it was deeper than Brianna Taylor deeper minutes Angela it list goes on and I think that although it would be a good idea to start it you know get into the police system and scientist insurgency I feel like that is something that is going to have to happen and down the line and we need change now and personally I feel like that starts with how much we push on police complaints I feel like that's something that we're granted as citizens to complain and complain about police but nothing happens until I feel like the first step that we can take is push on consequences need to happen after a police maybe has to risk a complaint or if you need to get here she needs to get another evaluation based on the complaints that are made in regards to you know race and I just feel as though we we have to get to be more proactive and I think that the protest although many people and a fan of the violence I feel as though in our generation that's how we feel like we can be heard because as other one said you know Martin Luther King with the people protester and they still shot him so I feel as though we have to be open minded although we don't want violence although we don't want to tear down the best a country that we built we have to take any avenue that we can to allow people to maybe there's like being gentle being okay Jarvis you kid da-rae you can you can take it up with your dad afterwards next I'm gonna ask at Roy strange and effort Roy I'm gonna ask Jen PI just beat Roy uh-huh well thank you and listening to all the comments in responding to the first question of how I felt when I saw and I didn't watched the video I saw the steel kitchen that was enough I didn't want to turn a lot of the trauma because black people we have generations of trauma that we carry with us and I believe that that trauma treats some of the fear and some of the anxiety that we have in our communities so I decided I didn't want to take that on and I chose not to see the video and it's entirely but I did see what was going on this weekend and it really disturbed me so I had to step back and and we got it myself so that I can focus on solutions so we its commitment to the solutions because we all know the problems the problem had to change and they continue from hundreds of years ago so for me I think there needs to be a frame weight and how we deal with those solutions because it's a systemic process systemic racism that causes a lot of these issues for example dealing with the system of how we're educated or miss educated is important also housing policies gentrification many of our communities that once been there for many years are being disrupted and so many of our people aren't being dispersed throughout various communities and don't have that network and as you know we're voting typically the only position that we vote on that's not based on geography in this country is the presidency everything that those we vote on is the based on where we live and so we have to build strong communities so that we can lift our voices without that we have long political power or economic power also we have to deal with that system of police brutality you know the law enforcement as well as access to capital we've been red line loans that we did are predatory those type of things are important to really begin to address the issue that we had them lastly the criminal justice system mass incarceration these are the five kind of parameters and there's more but these are the five parameters I believe that he can kind of pony and on and focus in on as we deal with Bowie and we talk to the elected officials of those who are running for offices say how do you address these systems how do you address these issues in our community these are things that we are striving to improve and to overcome so that we can have a better way of life and conditions in our theme Thank You Troy mr. Firman you stated that I think you said 96% of the police officers are good police officers when and we saw that video it was a bad thing but I've seen in person the videos and that's what the young people don't understand we seen it live now with respect to what you can't change it can't change my thing is if somebody comes to me wrong that's an opportunity to educate and I know that God is inside of everybody and sometimes I can't talk to them I have to talk to the gardener now so far is how I got one here it was because Cain from LA and I thought somebody should be on the police commission that means there are more things than just police we have health care we have a bunch of stuff and what I think we ought to do is go back to the Pledge of Allegiance and where it says and justice for all I'm done Thank You Jane Thank You Jane follow up with her because it's real important what she said and the reason why I used that metaphor of 99.9 percent because that 1% that Goldberg we can't afford that there there are professions that we can have that at 1% for instance if you're a doctor that 1% can be vital if you are a law enforcement officer that goes rogue that 1% could cost someone their life and add to the those issues so the reason why I bring that up is because right now we need the other 99.9% to step up and speak out not only against it but prevented with also training and also policing themselves it was spoken earlier that you can't change someone's heart but when you are in any group or congregation you know who your people are and it's up to those officers to also stand up I've had many of my colleagues many folks from our community at wall races reach out to me because they heard me and one of the things I always tell folks is I belong to a lot of circles and I say what if that was my face you seen under that car and my neck was being nil done and I died would you speak up and I made them think and that's why it's important that all folks need to stand up because our youngsters Sanders and my godness Crawford said earlier they're not having it and now in our generations we're all kind of connected now you know whether it's through marriage if it's to children if it's through our churches we're all kind of connected specially in the Coachella Valley so we we are connected and we have to stand together for solidarity to combat these injustice Thank You Wayman I want to ask Bishop Shepherd and then executive pastor Shepherd as well to speak mr. Shepherd you want to go next oh he's being interviewed probably I'm here I was like I was looking for the noose look I think you pretty sure your video button - oh yeah there we go they just left from over here so okay I'll back okay there we go yeah I was angry initially when I saw it and I had to remember the scripture in Ephesians 4 where it says anger gives a foothold to the devil and in order to keep the enemy from doing what he wanted to do through me I have to turn off the television like many others I have not watched a complete video I do believe that one thing we can do to help change is we have to start holding the media accountable in a sense because that imaging can cause PTSD and just triggering in this valley I was born and raised in this valley and I've had several unfortunately in law enforcement not having committed a crime just having to be um just perceived as a threat and when I see those when I see that imaging and that triggers some things inside of me and we have a ten-year-old daughter at home who doesn't understand and so to her if we start to explain those things to her it's in her mind it's I can't jog I can't be resting it at home I can't you know I can't be charged with a misdemeanor I need any interaction I have a police ends up in death and so we have to show her from that but what I will say is there's two things that we can do to kind of I guess kind of kind of stop this this madness the first thing I would say is don't let them get the narrative they're moving the goalposts in the media now suddenly the looting has taken stage and I see more people upset and frustrated with polluting than I do about the fact that just nine days ago the world watched a man lynched on national TV with three officers on his on his back and then one other two it is back one in his neck and one watching standby we have to we can't let them forget that the reason why and ballooning is unfortunate the violence is I'm not for it I don't that's nothing that's not a part of my core values but you have to understand that there that's a reaction let's go back to the action and treat that action and then secondly the thing that we need to do we need to protest and protest is not just going outside with with signs of marching down the street where protest link means it's an actually expressing disapproval so we need to we're showing that we disapprove of these actions how do we do that we do we hit the streets we protest with signs we do but also we mentioned we alluded to voting and I love how to I said go all the way down to your municipal the city elections and put these people out of office you don't bring change them out of your community to make sure that this stuff doesn't happen where you are okay that was just two minutes yeah yeah I heard him and I backed off Christina in an agreement with all of the comments have already been spoken it is heartbreaking for me too do you have seen what I what I saw on that video I wish that I did not watch the video and its totality but I did and I'm seeing that it it blew my mind and I don't know if I should have been had my mind blown at that time or not but it did it blew my mind that an officer could do that but that other officer would stand by and allow that to take place I have been with my husband during one of the incidents where we were profiled and for me as a black woman is not the same as him as a black man and it was disturbing for me thank him about that if you may sure we were in Indian Wells we had just went to dinner at where was it done Esmeralda Esmeralda at the Renaissance Hotel and we were coming back we were on our way home and we have pulled off onto Highway 111 and you're just driving at even a little bit below the speed limit and an officer pulled behind us and pulled us over for what reason we have no idea still other than the fact that maybe this was years and years ago that maybe our car look like it didn't belong in the Indian Wells neighborhood maybe we don't know why he pulled us over but he pulled us over he asked my husband a ton of questions as to what we were doing out at that time in that in that neighborhood and so right then and there I had to put my hand my hand on my husband's hand just because I knew he was upset and it broke my heart for him that he would be pulled over as a black man and as a black couple because we look like maybe we didn't belong in that particular neighborhood he did not give us a ticket there was nothing to give us a ticket for he can answer the questions as to why he really just over other than the fact that to him we look like we didn't belong so that was the incident that I was there for and I'm gonna go back really quick before my time is up the things that I think that we need to do is some of the things that they understood vote from the local level all the way up to the presidency get out and vote encourage other people here safe however right in the midst of the police department something needs to be done there the police psychological evaluations I don't know how often they happen but maybe they should happen every six months because we know we have no idea how this is building up and building up and building up and where these people come from do they have a psychological evaluation once before they get on the force and then another one in three years how often is that done mr. Andre said that she believes that they should actually be held accountable and they should actually have someone saying hey once something happens once or twice now we need to come back and do another training other evaluation it needs to go on it cannot be swept under the rug by the police department it cannot be excused they cannot just get a pat on the hand and say okay you're on three-month leave and then you come back I hate lead they committee murdered that man that police officer murdered him didn't go off this time but I give you a little congressman if I can interrupt I think everyone had a chance to speak yes okay and I took basic notes I'm sorry I got I was trying to multitask but you know yeah we've heard from from each person here on you know what do we and the question was what can we do you know and how do we go about this and you know and and we've got different answers from making complaints you know sometimes we don't we don't do that as a as a black community we have this thing saying oh we don't snitch well as not snitching it's telling meaning that we we didn't get rid of saying we need to tell we need to make these complaints and and and it was also stated that we need to make sure that areas someone policing the police you know that's that's a great thing that needs to be done Bowie was was number one many folks say you know Bodie needs to be done a lot of folks stated that they also needed to look at this their self before they even reacted you know some people went out and just reacted hence the reason why we got the riots that are going on now but I mean that was what was built in there we also talked about folks that you know who are dealing with this situation with their own children you know with their sons and daughters and walking through them through this I also got some comments that stated that you see where I met here um some type of law in place Dixon some type of law in place towards police and minorities you know we need to put something in law to states that hey if you've done something towards a minority then guess what we know it's gonna be it's gonna be a harsh law just like they did back in the 60s and 70s when it came to find it in a way to lock our people back up so they said hey you know let's put a high time limit on marijuana or or heroin you know but put a little time on cocaine unless it's mixed with with a different base to make it crack cocaine and then make it higher for crack cocaine than cocaine because African Americans are using these drugs so how about for the police something like that be put back into place so that was a good statement as far as putting something in place for the police towards minorities I know a Councilwoman Jan PI stated you know we need to lead we need to listen to what our nation's Pledge of Allegiance is some of those things that we seen before games and it needs to be adhered by all recess and not just just just to say for Americans but for all there is this needs to be fair across the board and so those were some of the notes that I took from this I know we have some of us have other things that we're doing but for the sake of time congressman if you want to go through this again and with another list of questions with another question if an answer one with everyone here we and we give everyone in two more minutes we can do this in about 30 45 more minutes yeah I think I think we'll we'll start to close it'll be less than 30 minutes just out of respect of people's time I think we we have about 15-20 minutes and and I'll open it up to a question I'll call on some folks the the question I have you know we we talked about some concrete ideas some real concrete policy ideas and I want you all to know that these conversations are happening in Congress right now terms of legislation that we can introduce in the House of Representatives in the federal level that will help direct this issue as a solution throughout our country however you know I've always said that we should never wait for Congress to act and we should never wait for an act of Congress that you know solutions also began in our own communities in our own cities in our own counties and in our states as well so so I think that what we're seeing is a lot of empowerment happening and the question you know is how do we move that empowerment into into local positive action troll you mentioned you know you didn't want to internalize the PTSD the anxiety the stress of watching a black man with a knee on his neck crying out that he can't breathe and in his last words was mom on through you know I think that that that internalization is something that is misunderstood by a lot of people who haven't experienced that or don't identify with the people with people who who who experience that kind of violence and so how do we go from internalizing this they're too externalizing hope with constructive action how do we do that and I want to I want to ask Reverend they lurk you know how do we and I'm gonna ask several of you including you Jerry how do we move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope in action Reverend Baylor well I think one of the things is you start by meeting with the law enforcement sitting down on and talking with them and sharing your concerns and your thoughts and to come up with viable solutions to problems and I think one of the things that should be considered is the recruiting process how individuals are recruited and to the police force and to examine that thoroughly and if necessary re-examine it because obviously it's not working [Music] coming from South Central LA I was raised in LA and I know how the LAPD operates they operate off of codes I don't want to get into that but I think the most important thing is to to meet with law enforcement and share our concerns and to try to work with them in terms of resolving some of the issue that concerns and again I can't stress this enough congressman the the policing policy whether the policing policy is done by the City Council or the mayor or the community but these offers just need to be policed on a monthly basis think about it if that individual who who took the life of that man had been addressed on the third incidence we probably wouldn't be having this conversation because they would have found out that he is not fit to be a police officer he needs to find another line of work thank you so I think if we worked with the law enforcement and see where the problem is and work together it's on resolving the problem and having the community have a more active role I would like to be actively involved in regards to this incident that took place two weeks ago as an example okay that way I know and that I can share with others hey this person does thank you you know Jan Jan was speaking to how she got involved she took it upon herself to get involved in the Commission and to get and then she's in City Council she's she's actively actively searched those ways Jan any advice you can give to move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope in action and in the way that you did for others one way is to become educated and when you go to be educated here the person you're talking about there's some people that don't know how our police office say Desert Hot Springs is government visit the police we have a Police Commission I've been the only one on the Police Commission where the rest of you when and not right now but you can do ride-alongs with police we had a person that did wrong he's not funny the next day it wasn't two or three times find out get educated Thank You Jerry you know being in college and having friends that are out there protesting and doing you know and in my mind the Lord's work and bringing about change how do you what do you say to your peers to move from internalizing despair err to externalizing hope and absent I'm so honestly I would say for us it's coming together I think when we're looking at a plan here in the Coachella Valley I know that there are numerous different african-american committees but I feel like right now we need to come together rather than being different subdivisions there's power and members and I feel moving on from just after this conversation we need to come together and organize a group listen to everyone's ideas you know the way that we're treated here in Desert Hot Springs is different than in India difference in an Indian Wells difference in a Cathedral City so looking at what is the next step from here this meeting today I think that we need to come together we need to compose a meeting and basically just put a few bullet points that we want to see and then we go to the police chief we go and talk to our mayor's and let them know this is the change we want to see you let us know how we start you let us know what we need to do because I think many times you know people Ella Titian and our mayor and police chief it's too much work for them and they want to do a job that their pay for is nothing more than that which is okay but let us know what we as a community we as young people older people what can we do to get this show on the road because like you said I don't want to wait for Congress I don't want to wait for anyone I want to start the moment we can so speaking of what we can do right now it would be to come together and devise a plan thank you I think coming together you're speaking about all communities correct yes yep okay yeah so in terms of just focusing upon the Coachella Valley you know we do have the black history committee as well as that the Negro Women's Committee and that she mentioned in Rome on their band and so I'm just thinking about here kind of close to where we are let's start there you know get us together here in the valley and then work our way up into different communities you're you have an organizers heart I want to ask Dixie I know you have grandchildren and they live in the neighborhood they're North Palm Springs and we talked a little yesterday about what you talk about at home so if you were to speak to two grandchildren throughout the the community what would you say to help them move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope in action and don't forget to unmute your phone I would say to get educated school and make a difference get to know the police department the police's that come out there and cause havoc get to know them and I would tell them to not get caught up in what they saw with joy because really you can get mad as well yet but it's really much you can do legally unless you have your voice heard in the face of the right people that means no to the police department go to council meetings don't do whatever you have to do be educated on what's really going on what is like what is really going on here because we know we have seen this all the time we hear about black people getting shot we hear about him getting killed in some shape on investments police stance and so I just tell them to mainly get educated and stand away of the police thank you and I went one of the things I stress on really hard is because of in the community I live in we need the police officers with body cameras because we complain you ever mean every month we complain every month about the police department and they come the police department is there every month and we see little change the same poll Mel back at the same police officers that we complain about right they'd be right back out there next day and I don't think that should happen so I just tell to not be angry because anger makes you do things you don't want to do and it's easy to do something regretted and get in trouble and things like that I tell my grandkids pastor Shepherd how do we move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope in action with change obviously being a liberal purging my hope is built on us and so we continue to such great is this nation and his community in prayer from a practical standpoint it's already been alluded to before our community and I do advise you to get involved with your community because Minnesota is not our community those are hot springs we're having a community police forum on Tuesday where our chief and a couple of officers will be there it's open to the public and will be discussing amongst other things one what can we do to safeguard our region from having that kind of problem happened that happened in Minnesota we're a firm believer in getting to know our officers and vice versa to the escalation techniques why why is this a scene what lethal force happens to be the first and only option that one of these officers goes to three the the blue wall when the police come to these forms they always tell us help us out if you see something say something well we depend on the police to have the same thing when you see something say something that blue wall Coster says I have to cover my brother six and we understand that but that's a life or death situation your brother's fiction I mean you're gonna overlook some things that are better illegal or unfair or and then just and then finally my wife alluded to it is one of others ongoing psych evaluation I served as a chaplain for the Delta hospice police I did ride alongs and a lot of times when you're when you're riding along officers will speak they'll talk to you know they'll kind of let you know how their day went they stuff where they go through trauma sizing experiences all day every day and I can only imagine without a psych eval or not without psychiatric here periodically how stuff just builds and mounts and so we want to put in a reform to say no these are these officers need to go through some type of psych evaluation at least annually because there's there's things that they encountered but and I'll close with them as I'll never forget one officer kind of explaining what it felt like to see a dead body of a child laying in a bit of the street and to imagine you know caring in that for the rest of your career without having it released without seeking help they're not going to see come upon themselves it may need to be mandated so those three things but we're going to start with our local police community forum well Tuesday we're gonna build from there Pastor Shepherd those are some very wise were we actually held roundtables with local police departments in the sheriff's office and and the representatives and leadership it's precisely about mental health in the force and it's it's been documented through studies that law enforcement agents suffer PTSD many of them do it's also documented that they oftentimes don't get the care that they need for many different reasons it's also documented that law enforcement first responders have three times higher suicide rate then than the general public and I and I believe that your heart of gold is is to address this through compassion for them to heal themselves as they did ensuring that that that their whole themselves as people and so that also helps the interaction with with community members and I think that's an important piece of this puzzle will definitely take that back as well a troy you you you were the one who initiated the internalization of this of Trump and then you gave a good list of concrete next steps you know and and I know you in Jarvis and I'm gonna ask Jarvis next you work a lot with the youth and you spoken with with a lot of the youth that are in our community so what what do you say how do you counsel our youth or community members and move them from internalizing that anger internalizing despair to externalizing hope in action for change well first I would say let's reimagine our communities because one thing I've noticed with our communities have been gentrified that same community 5 7 8 years later it looks different because someone came in with a different vision and so we have to not only see what is there in reality but imagine it in the way that we want it to be and then we had the tape too time to reinvest in that community whether it be our time whether it be dollars and resources again we have to work to revitalize I think our youth and ourselves you have to identify what is our purpose I believe that we all can do this time and place for reason there's no accident that we're here at this point in time and I think we need to identify why am I here what is it not supposed to be doing and as we identify that then I think we need to take those skills those experiences and utilize though to address the issues that we're facing right now I think one of the things for the valley we need to look at what skill sets do we have here locally that we can take a different tutorial of and identify how do we put these individuals into groups teams to begin to focus on some of the things I've mentioned early as far as police brutality mass incarceration in the criminal justice system gentrification mis-education access to wealth and capital those type of things to where we can begin to be a base an economic and political base for an african-american until the african-american community can be able to take power in those areas will forever be reaching out looking and hoping for things to happen we have to do that for ourselves and then we get others to help us but first we have to identify what is it that we want you know the problems are one thing we want to get rid of those but when those things are done what is it that we want in our community how do we want to live what do we want for our children what does that look like so we have to create that vision that idea and then we move forward but first identify the skills of what we have available Thank You Troy Jarvis you know you're you've been you've been active you've been you know counselor I seek your advice often because you're always involved and you do a lot of good work with with youth so what do you how do you speak to this issue with the youth that you work with at the Highland Center in the Unity Center and and and how do you move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope in inaction with change each yeah someone please put a two-minute timer on me okay over the past couple of months it's been hard to reach out to the youth because we haven't been open our community center has been open so it's kind of hard to to see where they're at to even reach out to them let leave my staff because we've been closed we have been reaching out to the youth and just seeing how they do with their schoolwork and you know if they need any assistance from us what we can do but it's been hard because of the coping 19 to really reach out to them right now I personally this past week the last three four days that I've been here I'll go out to the community I reach out to some of the folks in the neighborhood and tell them hey ma'am and you see your kids when you talk to the youngsters you know let them know this let them know that I gave a strong a strong word to the community to some of the they used in the community telling them hey you know I know you guys are seeing what's going on in these big cities and you know that's that's that's it a protest needs to be done I said well when the protest turns to a riot that's when you're putting yourself in danger and so I encourage them you know hey let's not go out to these protests that night if you if you think that your mentality isn't well because you're you try to be there for a peaceful protest and then something sparked you so that was the things as far as what's happening recently I wish I had more contact with our youth I wish our community center was open but like I said because of 19 I can't but to piggyback off what mr. strange was saying you know there needs to be things put in place to where we're educating our youth it was even stated but you know in the beginning mr. strager said no there's been a lot of missed education to our community and it hasn't been we need to be the ones educating our community ourselves and not letting someone outside of our unity educate us and let us that our youth know programs and activities need to continue even though we're dealing with this Koba 19 crisis and especially right now we need to find a way so reaching out to the youth like my daughters are great you know we need to find a way to reach out to the youth now to give them some some insight to be the one to say something Dixie said it playing you know I was able to reach out to my grandchildren directly so we need to find a way to reach out to our youth and to share with them what's going on it's been hard over these past couple of months to get out to get the word to them so the best way I say I've been doing it is telling telling a family member are some of the hopes of the community to spread the word thank you pastor tresina artistry can I make one quick go yet you're and in all those things they are critical but one of the things I find is that you have in local organization small organizations you have very few people trying to do a lot of work I think if there is some planning grants and funds so that you can provide administration to where these games can be tell you didn't care because not only people run in some of your small organizations they're working for time jobs and it happens so those resources will be important to help provide the administration for those actors thank you I just wrote that down I just want to say thank you because this is actually helping me a lot right now and mr. ivory I commend you and I thank you for all that you have said and shared with us I am we have a ten year old and so where she is a 10 year or two years old we're sorry and and her peers are totally different thing so to have these forces come together of all the city cities come together is an excellent idea I do believe that as individuals we we want to think before we speak I think that's very important and especially to mine our surroundings we have huge voices especially with social media and when we put our voices out there and social media we have to be very careful and we have to think before we speak we have to pray before we speak because a lot of our voice is carried and so if we put something out there as as Jarvis just mentioned to spread the word if we're going to spread the word let's spread the word with love let's spread the word with education so that people out there we know that they're always going to be people who are going to act before they speak but we want to be that the change that inspires the hope and so if we speak with love if we speak with intent then therefore we can draw people in to the light instead of the darkness because we're responsible as individuals as as human beings are responsible for one another so let's be responsible and do responsible thing I'm grateful for our community form for the police but we you mentioned a congressman that you had the sheriff's involved as well and I hope that we will get there because it's important because a lot of Desert Hot Springs is not policed by Desert Hot Springs police so the sheriff's are involved in a lot of different areas so I think that's important as well but speak whole that's a great thing to do is speak hope it has been like this for a long time but with young people eyes are very with people that are involved like all of you all it doesn't have to stay this way it doesn't have to stay thank you very much and whatever I can do if I can step in in an area where I'm needed I hope somebody will give me a call and say hey we need you over here thank you because my husband's been out there forever in a day and it's time for me to get out there as well I know I still have a little girl but I do have some time that I can't thank you thank you we have one two three four big J and many it's not all that moved from internalizing despair to externalize in action for change I think I'm gonna echo some comments that were said already but uh I'm gonna echo it from not only law enforcement side of it but as a black man and also a policymaker education is key and I don't mean just in school I mean and how the system works every Police Department is a private entity so every Police Department has their own individual use of force policy so if we're not engaged with our local council members and local elected leaders it's hard to accomplish missions because every use of force policy is unique to that city now where legislation becomes important is when we have legislation is passing through Congress or being introduced such as HR 4408 which was brought forward by representative Jefferies prohibiting chocos by police officers that's nationwide so that's gonna blink it every police department we need legislation that's gonna blanket every Police Department because every Police Department is private every Sheriff's Department is private to that County so that's important part of it the other part important part I want to push the point is be active and engage with your local elected leaders and police chiefs because they're the ones who make decisions culture starts at the top I mean you could go to any law book or any use of force policy and just because something's on paper that says it's right doesn't make it right and if you're not engaged within we can't get policies change we have access to use before policies with every Police Department ask your police chief for a copy email him and see what needs to be changed in address because some of those policies I dare to say go back to maybe the 50s and 60s where it was okay to be openly racism bias against folks of color so we have to be engaged and also that aspect now when it comes to incidents such as what we just seen recently we need to have independent review boards that consist of community leaders not just law enforcement for instance we do have internal affairs right pertinent right so hip nature these folks work together we work together with each other we work together with the district attorney's office so we need to have independent review boards where there's community leaders and folks from community who have a voice and an action on that and before before I finish something that was brought up by this Dixie and I'm glad she brought it up for instance saying that there's a concern of body cameras in the city of Palm Springs you know what I'm the perfect person to talk to I have a great relationship with chief rate I can address that with them I'm on the Public Safety Committee which other by the Association governments and that's how we have to work asked be dialogue so we can move forward and so that we could prevent any of these further incidents that are happening I could go on but I'm not Castleman a Jarvis on bigger than you menu pastor Croom how do we how do we move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope and action um to be honest you know like I said I'm like anyone else I'm kind of like with you guys you know policy is a must change is a must and then just encourage you know sometimes our youths are discouraged by what they see and they feel like that they they they they they feel like they they would never see change so they won't become a part of the change because they felt like there's what does he used to me getting involved because it's just gonna remain the same way so we need to give them some optimism give them some optimism and that comes from those of us who are preachers and councilmen and things like that say hey you know what you guys have to carry on the next generation so we're not gonna be able to scene forever so let's start preparing them to take over the next generation you know and encouraging them to get involved and then secondly and I'll say this a little different I mean it may be a little differently what everyone I said but we also have to encourage if there's a if there's a disparage or if there's an issue between the police and the community then on the police side we have to become involved in policy but on the other side we have to also tell our young people listen don't do anything that will cause any extra burden that's already being levied at after that's being levied against us and so I think it has to be on both sides okay if you're doing something hey you know don't don't do it you know you doing something that can cause something don't do it but at the same time we need to also work on the law enforcement side as well so I think there needs to be a balance working between both the police okay I'm done it was very important to be said Master Sergeant Edward Bracken how do we move from internalizing despair to externalizing hope and inaction for change I think pretty much everybody thought he said it but I started just getting mad get involved they've already talked about a number of ways you can contact a local state and just get involved one thing we don't want to do with this incidents and all other things that extracurricular activity it takes the eye off the focus of what what really the protest is about and what you don't want to do is allow them an opportunity to dismiss everything that you're trying to obtain everything you're trying to change by letting that become the the idea as opposed to being what you're trying to change so I echo everything everybody else has said thank you for having me involved in this process III did what kids I'm a different in a different way in the school setting but we do talk about things like this whenever we can so thank you thank you Debbie Franklin and then we'll close with Reverend Carter and we'll have a quick prayer closed circle with Pastor Shepherd again so Debbie Franklin okay one of the things I'd like to see and what we need to promote is more people active in city council meetings and Commission meetings parks and recs these all to meets these are meetings you can just go listen because one of the things that I found out in the six years that I before I got to the council you go to the meeting just the fact that you're at the meeting you can be sitting and writing a note to the person next to you makes the people that are sitting at the dais pay attention why are you there what did you want and when you start going to the meetings you become involved you listen to the reasons why decisions are made so you're not coming after the fact the decisions been made and you don't like it you've had a chance to voice your opinion anywhere along the way and it gives you some sense of acknowledgement when they see you at a meeting over and over again people are not willingly separating themselves I'd say that for the majority of the people they're not willingly separating themselves from the public but they do by the nature of their jobs get very isolated and if they don't see you you don't exist and if you just start with just go to the meetings you don't have to say a word you just go to the meetings and have somebody if it's too much for you to go to every meeting you rotate and you have different people go to the meetings and then share their notes because it's great to have a separate meeting for this particular incident but this is going to get old a month from now it won't have the same impact for some that it has now but you know and I think the person who stopped and spread-eagled on the ground with his children watching for the person oh well you can finish that sentence for anybody who has incurred encountered the prejudices or the social profiling that's what where you need to start when you say I'm going to call the chief then they listen Thank You Reverend Carter Reverend Carter how do you move from from internalizing disparity external izing hope in action for change thank you again and uh you know I had alluded to it when I had my opening comments you know of course people are asking for change asking for something to be done you know and I'm just a problem solver I just I just would say as a suggestion for the actual issue here is a police brutality and so for Furman and for this he talks about the but the body cams because that came under the Obama administration it went far but we need to go far further in it where I feel like in football every touchdown is under review I believe every arrest of a black man or a Latino of need to be under review before how the body cam on it and it and and if the officer don't have the body cam and then that arrest is void and I think some action like that needs to take place at the root of this particular problem not pushing a social agenda education on all that's important but the specific problem is that for the body cams need to be a part and we need to go further and four is every arrest in order to be a valid arrest needs to be under review and not just from eternal before it needs to be some kind of for folk but people that we vote in our office some council you know in that particular because of the human nature because human nature is not gonna invoke justice it's gonna always you know afford whatever bias a person may have but at least if this can it won't stop the murders but it will bring justice because this video camera for the videotaping of this particular four incidents it didn't stop the murder but it will bring justice and that's the whole purpose of the body camp I'm forced to bring just ultimately to bring justice of course in the plan for the in situation that is perhaps unjust and so that's radical but I think something radical needs to be done for is for every black man heavily to no man need to be for every arrest needs to be under review but unless you have a good day Reverend Carter let's take our petitions to the great judge now to the judge of justice with our prayer one who throughout the ages have shown which side he's on and he's always on the side of justice it's too late so if we can close with a prayer pastor Shepherd will go full circle the review and after this prayer will will end this this gathering this listening session congressman's destroy again at one question well we have additional dialogue and actions to really address these issues or is this the no and maybe with Jarvis or whomever will keep you reaching out again yes yes this won't be the last the last event we have okay all right well I pray I just want to know I don't know if y'all got the notifications but they just charged the other three officers and the first officers charged was moved from third degree to second degree within this last hour so I saw that ain't bad and then I saw that yeah let's pray father we just thank you we ladies petitions at your feet right now God you are the god of justice so we cast all these anxieties on you as the word says Lord in exchange you said that once we do this and we and we start to think of things that can bring hope and praise that you give us peace that passes all understanding so dad we speak peace amongst this group we speak peace through our respective communities and families we speak peace through this nation right now Lord you're on the throne your ways are above our ways your thoughts above our that's so God we no longer wants to meddle in your business we just want to be able to walk into peace and be the change she called us to be or let us leave this call then let us leave these meetings being a salt and light that's you that you explained that we should be to this world because somebody needs to know that you're in control and we give that to you right now God so we just thank you and the matchless name of Jesus but something that we've said today become a light for some fantastic in Jesus name we pray amen thank you everybody I think that there would be some of you who Wayman you got last word to say hey we got a close soon my friends when I invite everyone to the candlelight vigil we're holding in do I should I work with my committee do it we're gonna do a Tuesday please find me

that we didn't get to that will open it up for for some of you Waymon pastor Shepard and and will will continue these conversations because many of you identified that dialogue and leased a better understanding and a better understanding leads to empowerment and that's how you know we can put hope in action and realize some change that we need for all of us thank you so much thank you welcome

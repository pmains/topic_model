I was appalled as you said you were to read the accounts of the inappropriate actions of some GSA employees outlined in inspector general's report of abuses connected to a regional conference held in 2010 this conduct on the part of these few federal employees is an unacceptable abuse of the American packs taxpayers trust it's unconscionable at a time when our national debt stands at more than 15 trillion dollars individuals within the federal government completely ignore our country's fiscal reality and behave in ways that reflect an attitude that the funding of their particular agency belongs to them rather than to the American taxpayer what is the extent of the problem that this at GSA that this report covers is this the the sum total of the problems that you see at this agency or is this more of the proverbial tip of the iceberg senator it is one event as an IG we produce reports that we can verify every which way and it's totally accurate we did the report on the western regions conference we have a number of ongoing investigations we have not produced reports yet on the number of ongoing investigations and there are many other ongoing investigations can you quantify that the magnitude of the investigations that you are now conducting it's a little difficult because as I said my opening statement every time we turn over a stone we find 50 more and you know we find other instances you know even even today we found out that the wife of the regional commissioner had a parking space throughout the entire year of 2012 at the federal building and you know we just find one thing after another and it's difficult for me even now to say to quantify it mr. Miller you indicated that there's been a referral to the Department of Justice do you expect other referrals we're working with the Department of Justice every day we're working very closely with them when i say referral i'm um specifically being nonspecific tell me what you mean by the word referral okay i will tell you what happens in the normal worse and that is that when we do an investigation generally we will have a matter we may have one individual we may have a number of individuals and they may be related that it may be a scheme it may be a conspiracy they may be related in many different ways we bring the entire matter to the Department of Justice or to the US Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice it will either accept or decline the case and and then we will do further investigation and what we hope will come out of it is indictments against individuals an individual or more than one individual as a result of the criminal conduct that is is the highest criminal charge that is the most readily provable by the evidence any suggestion in your investigation when you talk to GSA employees or the management in the region that this is there was there a defense that kind of the this goes on everywhere all the time kind of thing either within GSA or outside the agency yes many of the witnesses we talked to said that this conference was similar to previous western regions conferences and they cited a number of them that occurred in Oklahoma New Orleans Lake Tahoe and the witnesses we talked to said this was along the same lines that each of the so called hosts for the conference tried to outdo one another and the regional commissioner for region 9 for this one said I want this to be over the top I want this to be the best and most lavish sort of conference

now tomorrow the Intelligence Committee in the Senate is going to have their next open hearing on the Russian attack and the issue of whether there were American Confederates who helped the Russians in that attack the committee will take testimony tomorrow on other countries in Europe that have dealt with Russian attacks on their elections and how it's affected those countries how those countries have responded to slightly unsettling things and we think about how other countries how they've responded it's slightly unsettling that the response so far to the attack on us at least by our executive branch the response is basically limited to top White House officials securing the services of private defense counsel that's pretty much the only thing they're doing to respond but that's where we are that's what they're doing in the executive branch the Senate at least is investigating what happened and joining us now tonight for the interview is Senator Mark Warner he's the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate which is investigating the Russian attack senator it's really nice to have you with us tonight thank you for taking the time thank you Rachel thanks for having me so you've said that your committee is at a relatively early stage in your investigation we mentioned tomorrow's hearing on how other countries have dealt with Russian attacks on their election should we expect to see a series of public hearings more public hearings through the summer well I think you will see more public hearings we've gone through initially reconfirming what I think most of us believe that clearly the Russians intervene in our elections in a massive way all of the intelligence community believes that frankly all of the senators that I know Democrat Republican lead at the one official in Washington that still says it's a witch hunt or a hoax or whatever term he uses depending on the day seems to be the president we've shown that 21 states were had their election systems attempted be hacked into we're trying to get make sure those 21 states are fully revealed only two states have gone public Illinois in Arizona we think the country is not made safer by keeping that information secret and obviously I wish we were further along in terms of talking to some of the Trump affiliates and associates some who we've talked about tonight but none of us could have predicted that the president would have actually fired the guy in charge of the investigation Jim Comey so we had to bring him before our committee as well as the Attorney General who as you've also reported as had to recuse himself because he didn't disclose as well some of his connections in Russia I play a couple moment ago from Senator Dianne Feinstein he's on your committee he's also on the Senate Judiciary Committee she expressed in very strong terms about a week and a half ago her concern that she felt like the president was going to start firing more people that he might try to stop he might try to fire robert muller that he might try to fire the Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Steinle the president has publicly attacked that would also obviously start going through the the ranks of the Justice Department instead of who was still in charge we've also seen this week conservative media just in the last couple of days really starting to train their fire not just on director Comey and robert muller but also on Andrew McCabe who's the deputy director of the FBI and I don't know how much conservative media Telegraph's the president's actions but do you share senator Feinstein's concerns that the President may be gearing up to not just discredit these people involved in the investigation but to fire them well I would hope that would not be the case but I also thought this administration couldn't surprise me anymore and then they went out and fired Jim Comey and they talked about firing Bob mower Bob Muller who uniformly Democrats Republicans alike when he was named special counsel got rave reviews and I think special counsel Muller is going about this in a methodical appropriate way and my hope would be the Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein who has said that he would not fire Mahler unless we're going to see a repeat of a Saturday night Massacre type Watergate approach I hope and pray that would not be the way the president would go about this let this investigation go forward let us go through our effort which is a fact-finding counterintelligence investigation but in that special counsel Muller go he has a different standard a criminal standard he's got a lot of a lot of threads to follow we've still got a lot to follow and we've got to do this in a way that I still hope and pray at the end of the day we'll have a bipartisan consensus because there's an awful lot of facts that we need to get out to the American public and so I want to get your reaction to tonight's news that the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort today has retro actively registered as having been a foreign agent he's registering for having been the agent of a foreign power between 2012 and 2014 what's your reaction to that particularly reaction to the timing here obviously this is a declaration for something that ended three years ago why now oh great question it's why we have got a request for documents we received the first round of documents from mr. manna fort I think we're going to ask for more but there does seem to be a pattern here whether it's all manna for not disclosing ties to a Ukrainian government that was very close to the Lattimer foodie or Michael Flynn not disclosing ties to the Turkish affiliates or perhaps others but there seems to be a pattern of folks that are not coming clean in terms of their ties to Russia we've now got Flynn fired we've got the Attorney General recuse himself and obviously mr. manna port now coming forward why it's taken in so long those are the very questions me and other members of the committee want to ask so now I want to ask you a question about the way your investigation works and I don't mean to I don't mean to cast aspersions on the way I'm asking this I'm actually asking at a position of complete ignorance on this subject so don't don't don't hate me for asking it this way Rachel you say in complete ignorance and you in the same sense I'm not sure I'm going to fully by that or your audience not going to buy that but fire away all right this is about this is about banks and money and real deals and money laundering and we've been trying to follow this trail for example just VEB bank that undisclosed meeting with Jared Kushner ties to this Trump property the other the ties that it's got the direct ties it's got the flat amir putin in the russian government we've looking at this money laundering stuff this case involving deutsche bank the enjoy to bank loans to trump and those the undisclosed loan to jared kosher we've been trying just as observers to follow the money trails here and it's hard as just an observer to do it into your committee staffed in such a way that you've got the kind of expertise the kind of professional staff that you need to be able to follow those very complicated nitrus well first of all Rachel the Russians have a playbook and they we've seen this in other countries where whether it's officials of the Russian government or in the case of Bibi a quasi Bank or quasi agent of the Russian government or in certain cases Russian oligarchs that may be close to mr. Putin who in other countries have found ways to try to gain influence by investing in or investing with individuals where they then hope they can lure people into some level of financial compromise we've got questions in terms of some of the individuals affiliated with the mr. Trump and we made requests to the Treasury Department who has responsibility it's called FinCEN and we've received over two thousand pages of just recently that we're reviewing and there'll be an additional tranche as well I believe we have that expertise if we don't we will obtain it to make sure that we can go through this in an appropriate way when we're talking about something this serious we've got to do it right and if it takes a little bit more time then frankly I would like or others may like getting it right is better than getting it done correct and getting it done quickly and I think we're we're proceeding ahead Senator Mark Warner who is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee vice vice chair of that committee mounting this investigation sir thank you very much for talking with us I hope they'll come back and keep us updated I will as a lot but you know we've got it the main thing is end of the day we've got to get the facts out in a today is well we've got to prepare ourselves because the Russians will be back the one thing we know is that this was not a one-off event they will be back in 2018 2020 and it's why we need to hear not only from the president but frankly from this administration a willingness to take this issue with a level of seriousness that unfortunately we not see so far Senator Mark Warner of Virginia thank you sir I appreciate it

[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell and I'd like to welcome you to the latest edition up to the point here in the United States we tend to get caught up in the circus of federal politics as a former New Jersey State Assemblyman and mayor of Paterson New Jersey I can personally attest to the importance of local and state politics in contrast with the hot-button issues of Washington local and state politics of the potential to impact our lives on a daily basis it is imperative that we follow the news of state and local governance and understand how it affects us and I'm sure that my guests will agree these turbulent times demand principled leadership and moral courage from our elected officials remember those words please in choosing a new governor last year the jersey saw a strong voice a voice to tell this White House that if it pushes policies that harm the Jerseyans like us we're going to fight back Governor Phil Murphy was born in Newton Massachusetts attended both Harvard University and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005 it was asked by governor Richard Cota to share a committee intended to propose changes to New Jersey's pension system big issue on a state level and federal level and the following year he was appointed as the National Finance chairman of the National Democratic Committee just three years later he was named ambassador to Germany we're very proud of him he was a President Obama named into that position and in November 2017 Phil Murphy became governor Murphy winning a decisive victory governor I thank you for being here today we're honored to have you welcome aboard I'm so happy to be here congressman thrilled to be with you as always governor my first question deals with the tunnel I was on a committee for 14 years that went to Newark usually once a month yep plan with the regional authority Planning Association with Democrats and Republicans at the meanings and I thought it was engineering ly solid yet politically solid financially solid it was a good project but it was a necessary project this now this is not make work right and you saw what happened the former administration shut it down after it started with talking about four or five thousand jobs there yeah and we need to get done fourteen years out the window because that's how long it takes to plan but you saw what happen in in the budget recently we passed the Omnibus Budget Bill in that bill is money we could we got seed money to start this thing and we're on solid grounds regardless of the threats of the administration how important is this tunnel to be built now yep in fact maybe it's good that it's being built during the Murphy administration but why is this so important to the commerce and industry of our area and the entire country amen again it's great to be with you as always we're honored I'm honored and thank you for having me and you mentioned the cancellation of the prior tunnel which we call the arc tunnel even its critics thought you know what it may not be perfect but it's a huge game-changer as you mentioned years went into the planning the amount of money that was rounded up at the federal level took years to get as you know better than probably most and the prior administration precipitously canceled that and as you suggested congressman it not just cost jobs in the here and now at that point but the long-term implications we haven't had a Tunnel built under the Hudson River in over a hundred years so along comes the Gateway project which is the successor to the arc Tunnel hats off to you and your colleagues for including as you said that that seed money in this omnibus spending bill over the objection of the President himself and the secretary secretary transportation and by the way frankly they should look in the mirror and ask themselves what the heck are they thinking they know how important this is because your question was how big a deal is this this is a big deal this is a big deal for New Jersey in New York clearly to allow folks the simple at the simplest level to get in and out of New York safely and on-time right to work if that's where they work to increase that Trans Hudson commerce that is so vital to both of our states but it's beyond that it's a Northeast Corridor imperative which is why you saw and you saw this better than I did both sides of the aisle in a whole bunch of states stood up it so we want this right I think it's a national economic if not a national security imperative so the facts are with us which is the great thing and at the end of the day thank God after a period of time or at least a mistake we're digging out of a time when facts and science didn't matter making decisions as you all did in Congress based on fact in science I'm confident with this seed money will get this Gateway project going and then ultimately it'll take many years to finish but it'll be worth it we got to move people in product regardless no Carol Eisenhower who was the Republican president a few years ago stood up courageously within his own party you know and fought for the interstate highway you bet though people laughed at him at the time yeah this is this a local issue a baloney never get anything done this is an interstate issue that he built he started to build the highway system which we are were you know which we believe or no that's that's correct otherwise name is on it all right yes that's absolutely true this this should not be a partisan issue this is something that's affecting all of us but he built the highway system for the main reason not only to help commerce very critical yep but this is a homeland security issue no question you got to move people and when you need to move people you better have the highways we know our roads are clogged every day you know that but and they spill onto the local roads you bet and and this is causing a major major major problem I'll give you another one it's got a big positive environmental impact if we get this tunnel built more people will feel confident about taking a train as opposed to a car that's good news for the environment it's good news for our roads that'll free up you know this better than I do there's a lot of shenanigans a lot of a lot of a lot of craziness going on with this administration right so I give you all and your colleagues including by the way both sides the aisle Rodney freely house was a chapel here going on and you guys did a great job pushing back let's make decisions based on facts a lot of thought me I went over to Lee and congratulate him after we passed the budget bill and he says you're congratulating me bill and and I said yes I am he says maybe I don't go back to the blurting this all day and I said no I'm very serious about you know Ronnie Ronnie did a great job while he was here I don't agree with his politics all the time and that's immaterial yeah yeah this leads me to the second issue where since we're talking about transportation and moving people the transit system yep our own we we badgered this administration the former administration on this issue your safety yep something is wrong yeah and when I stood at that crash in Hoboken I was just coming back from Washington they took me right I said the governor asked me to be in the pageant no no no I didn't come here for a photo op yeah I'm gonna look at the accident yeah and I looked at every one of those end points in the where the trains come in none of them come were solid they were rusted out yeah we leave these things to chance yeah a woman was killed and that and then train went right up on the platform where where do you see the transit system is it's it's it's savable yeah it is definitely savable the good does good news here but we're digging out it's a mess it's a mess it's as good an example as any I can think of that describes the narrative of the past eight years of leadership in New Jersey you know gutting government stripping it bare using tax gimmicks so you can set and raise taxes sounds good right ripping our progressive ideals to the right and Jay transits a poster child for that so the last administration didn't have leadership in there that was experienced in transit they cut the state support by ninety percent at one point nine zero they took money from capital budget to make up for the operating shortfall which probably impaired not probably absolutely impaired our safety and they by the way while whether they were doing all that fares went up 36 percent in eight years so I used to say to people by the ways your commuting experience I'm 36 percent yeah so what are we done one is we've started an audit to figure out how they how the heck they spent that money we put new leadership in place a new executive director a new chair they're confident I'm very confident and thirdly we put in a record amount of funding from the state right in our budget has two hundred forty-one million dollars going into NJ transit which is a tripling of the support now money can't buy everything right so that's why you need that leadership as you know better than I I think that combination will allow us to get back to that place it wasn't that long ago you and I've had this conversation offline NJ Transit was a national role model absolutely right as a commuter rail Vegas public transit system in the country it's one of the big ones right if you neglect it you know you're hurting a lot of people no question and by the way one other comment we speak and I'm guilty of this myself disproportionately about rail we also remember the bus system in our state is hugely important particularly in our cities you know Paterson is a great example and so we got to make sure both sides of that equation are punching at their weight it won't be overnight and what I'm confident we'll get back to what we need to be I think I think it's so critical people have to understand this and and unbe aware of what the present federal administration is saying about how we're going to get money into infrastructure yep which we've neglected yep our roads our bridges our airports our underground infrastructure water clean water swords etc etc etc yeah that doesn't fall out of the sky doesn't it governor no it doesn't we got to figure out a way to pay for these things unlike what's been happening in the past yet we don't pay for them and it's on the on the backs of our kids and our grant what but the thing that you need to understand is that this administration is recommending that we turn around how much one is going to come for the federal government and how much money the states are going to have to put up in these projects it's like a 70 turn around about a percent this is impossible when those governors understand okay with your blue state red state green state yeah and those in those states when they figure out how it's going to increase taxes in their particular States particularly property taxes we should wipe this idea away and get rid of it you know and unfortunately it's there it's there so listen I I when Trump was when he got elected which I still can't believe happened but it did he talked a good game on infrastructure and for all the things I disagree with him about I thought that was the one area where I had common ground I again thought it spoke about that I was down there a month ago I spoke to him personally I spoke to his team their view of how you approach infrastructure is in a different place than our world so as you said that they see a very modest role for the federal government a big role for state local and private capital earn everything back to the States amen not just transportation everything education turn it more back to the states and more burden in and listen I'm on the one hand I'm gonna say particularly this administration states will have never mattered more governors will have never matter more I get that but there's no replacing the federal government in infrastructure in healthcare in public education so philosophically we've got to hope that these folks come to their senses but the longer it goes the less confident I have to say I am you saw the battle we had at the end of last year over the tax cuts yes again another bumper sticker reaction to a very serious problem we hadn't had tax reform since 1985 when our own senator Senator Bill Bradley led the way done this and we got something that was not just tax cuts it was reform to the system now they promised us would be able to make our taxes out on a postcard this is the worst situation we've had I've talked to the guy that helps me do my taxes yeah I said you know if nowheres near postcard and next year be worse in the air after need a shoebox of postcards yes right we fought over the state and local taxes that tax deduction goes back before the coal to the Civil War yeah and the reason why he came into view and became a reality was during the war we had to raise money yeah for the effort yep could defend the United States of America at that time so what we're talking about here is trying to protect local governments and the states so that they have enough resources so the federal government does not prey upon them yep and and and this is 1865 I know not talking about 1915 we're talking about 1865 we fought we lost the issue we got a little bite people ten thousand dollars of their property taxes that can add up but the the average property taxes injuries between eighteen nineteen thousand dollars so there you are it was a real jolt to New Jersey no question New York Connecticut a lot of states around here yeah about particularly nine ten states but other people use that deduction in other states that are not as greatly effective you've been what are we doing about that and where do you see us going and you know darn well if a miracle happens next on but this coming November that's we're gonna try to turn that around you bet people are hurting no questions so that's first well they're a bunch of points to make and I don't want to take up too much your time first point is elections have consequences having big success this November in the house and the Senate allows us then the opportunity to turn back some of this stuff secondly we're joining other states and challenging the legality of this going to court owners we're going to court hundred percent with New York Connecticut California as you mentioned it's about a dozen states I think they're all blue right that's not a coincidence issue and I know right so we're going we're challenging the legality of double taxation the constitutionality of it right thirdly we believe the IRS has put out there in precedent in thirty-three other states the opportunity to claim a charitable deduction Horace Blaine yes so in thirty-three others the IRS has blessed charitable deductions in many not not all many if not most cases it's because somebody had a problem with public education right and they wanted to send their kid to private school right and get the same deduction for the tuition that they otherwise would have got from that portion of their property taxes that would go to public education IRS has blessed that in thirty-three other states good news congressman a lot of them are red states so we're saying you know what with all due respect towns should be able to set up a parallel payment structure instead of paying your property taxes in two bucket a right pay it in two bucket D right a new new Co as they say and get a charitable deduction for that people so intimate the IRS may not go for that I say yeah but we believe and this is our theory that if they undo our precedent they're gonna have to revisit and/or undo the precedent and the other so we don't have that definitive answer we do not yet but will the defendant advance your coming from the courts or the IRS my guess is first from the IRS right and then we'll battle it I would guess not a lawyer but I would believe would battle it and ultimately the courts right now there's one last thing we've done with our own budget in New Jersey with you I put forth our budget address two weeks ago we've raised the cap in New Jersey from $10,000 to $15,000 yeah how does that gonna work well that that'll impact a lot of property tax payers I think five hundred and something thousand Wow very taxpayers in New Jersey will be will be drawn into that that right under that limit from ten thousand and fifteen thousand how is this this is the state tax correct now if that's the case let me ask you let me ask you this tough question yeah yeah you're a tough governor so let me ask you a tough question how is that gonna what is that going to do to the revenue for the state I'm concerned about that we scored it out that's actually not a crazy amount of money I think it's something in the magnitude of ninety million dollars a year that's on a thirty seven billion dollar budget that's not it grows over time compared grow it doesn't grow a crazy number if we could do more listen we've inherited a state which is fiscally a train wreck if we could do more and keep raising that if we get ourselves stabilized financially we'll will consider doing that how did you get to the how do you understand the magnitude of what you inherited at what point was it before the earth but was it before the election was it before you got sworn in was it after you got sworn in was it I went after you got sworn in he said oh my god and I showed you the books my lord I'd say I'm proud of the fact that our team had a pretty good handle from the outside during our campaign and what to expect but you never know until you're on the inside and I would say for the most part fiscally the surprises have been overwhelmingly negative we haven't really we haven't uncovered a pot of gold hiding somewhere and don't expect to your your election I think was critical for a lot of reasons we try to keep this program nonpartisan as much as possible yeah but you're inheriting a situation unlike the former governor you're inherited situation where both houses are democratic yep that helps a little bit if everybody's on the same page so that's one situation the other situation is lasting effects on the people of our state are always done best with bipartisan no question how do you how do you tie the two things in together the first part the second I think you can it by the way it's a it's a big focus for me personally it always has been so on the one hand I'm a proud Democrat I got my democratic principles I grew up my dad didn't get out of high school my mom did we grew up outside of Boston as Kennedy Democrats that's those are the most important moments of my life in terms of how I've been defined I'll never give that up the money did not fall out of the sky it did not fly by a longshot but by the same token we get there long we stay longer we get there faster and it's stronger if we do it together right it's so right out of the box blocks in transition I sat with the assembly Minority Leader Bramnick the Senate Minority Leader Tom Kane jr. expressed my keen interest in working finding common ground I make it a regular part of my daily outreach to reach out to folks on the other side of the aisle whether they be a legislation mayor's do a lot of Mayors not one and done I don't think it can't be and you know that you know that's so well you know we talked about gateway I spent a lot of time talking about him publicly speaking with him privately and encouraging and supporting Rodney Frelinghuysen right efforts is the Republican chair of the Appropriations Committee in Congress a guy you and I already spoke about earlier so I believe there is the philosophy is we should try to get there together if we can we should never do that if we have to give up our principles right and our core beliefs but I think you can do both I think you could have it both ways I think you can keep your principles and still find common ground and that's what we're committed to what do you what do you you know you got to the job obviously and you serve certain amendment we don't know when this will be shown on the air but it's the it's still timely what's the big surprise you have a big surprise since you got sworn in I'd say the big surprise as a budget is that these we as the budget that we presented was that there were very few surprises so we didn't we telegraphed yeah how we can't do in campaign how we transition actually between your campaign and what the budget reflects yeah which is unusual yeah I mean I I'm crazy to make promise campaign well we're good at it in the Congress not all I listed we won the primary handily and thought in the general election somebody said hey why didn't you attack to the center I said because what I said in the primary is what I believe right and then they asked again well you're not going to put a budget together that really talks about the more money into ad or pre-k or Community College or higher at or infrastructure energy transition actually we are going to do that secondly I would say there's a great responsibility with the job and I anticipated that it's very humbling to be the governor of this state and you know I've seen it in things big and small of the first seven or eight weeks we've had a bunch of storms I've had to declare a couple of states of emergency you know to two of our citizens were killed by touching down pyre powerlines one literally and one whose car was incinerated making the decision is the did declare a state of emergency did declare a truck ban and I just spoke to a trooper this morning who saved someone's life off the Parkway last weekend so it's I say all that because while I anticipated it there's nothing like being in the seat your hand on the Bible and saying okay now you're there and that responsibility is is great and I'm humbled by your you're a very progressive thinking person and yet you've taken up the mantle of the police of this state state police as well as the local police sheriff's departments and you have built I've seen I've seen and as chairman of law Law & Order yes they said but as the responders our responders in the in the house and a Senate you understand what these guys and gals go through every day yep how did you see that relationship and how important is it to you being the governor of the state of New Jersey listed it's hugely important I have a caller me for what it is I've got a soft spot an emotional connection with first responders with veterans those are the groups that I would say that I'd say you know what they either are or they have put their lives on the line every day I now have the great honor of being with members of the State Police 24 hours a day right and they were extraordinary yes but as you also mention it extends beyond that to state and local I mean I grew up again not with much but with a lot of respect for teachers coaches police fire veterans are groups that my mom and dad when we were growing up you know that they were always held out as special folks for us my folks were in the greatest generation so they had a lot of their friends and siblings who went to war and fought for their country when it comes natural we're spending a lot of time lately and the fed on a federal level to deal with pensions yep to look at the pension of the public worker and to look at the pensions of the private worker and those pension plans have been shrinking yep we've got this challenge in New Jersey probably more so than any state in the nation I think our pension system is rated the weakest in the country and that's largely due to 20 years of basically the state neglecting or not standing up not in addition not putting its but I mean those those bargaining units got the money in a hundred percent yeah I don't like imposing on people yeah what the new pension system is gonna look like I think that's got to come to a conclusion listen I'm a big believer in collective bargaining and and that's the that's I always say it's the Intel chip inside of the whole notion of organized labor but I think and I feel strongly that unless the state ultimately meets its full obligation it hasn't got the right to sit down and say okay yeah because what people say right now well why don't you just get them to do some other I said let me ask you a question if you were left at the altar for 20 years in a row and on year 21 you heard hey by the way if you make the following concessions next year I'll be good for it you'd say you know what take a hike so I think we've got to restore our trust and credibility right as a state then then I think you're sitting out at citizen bear now we're finally made whole how do we take it from here right and I found the interactions to be very reasonable for folks who have been left at the altar for 20 years we have a lot of things we can talk about I wanted to get into health issues about how how you responding I mean what the one the last administration at least got it half right they extended Medicaid yep and and and that was very important no question important for that many states did not get an enduring parallel right now over this plus the administration in Washington has cut back on subsidies now how we're gonna stop premiums and going for that roof yep that's a big big issue yep very big issue and as you know this the Trump administration has cut the signup period in half they've cut the budget to advertise the signup period we've said you know what on that one we're gonna compensate for that and we're gonna make sure everybody in uncle knows about when that period is coming up and that there we're advertising in all branches of government well but what I don't see from your office is yelling into the air and throwing your arms in the air no what I want to commend you for stand it up it's not gonna be easy yeah you just got here I don't hear from anybody that I distrust this guy yep I don't see anything like that which is a healthy thing to be amen even if for the people that didn't vote for you amen so you got a beautiful family thank you that's the most important thing in your life not gonna live and knock on wood we wish them well thank you so much gonna be an experience for you I hope you're here for eight years God willing and and people in Jersey trust that you're gonna do the best you can Thank You Man that's a great spot to be in thank you for that governor thank you always a pleasure my man and always a pleasure it moved quickly god bless you loved every minute of it and have a great great great turn you bet you thank you thank you we're here for you all the time thank you for watching and we'll be seeing you soon on to the point [Music]

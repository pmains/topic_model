welcome back to taking the hill on MSNBC I'm Patrick Murphy this past week the Labor Department released its annual veterans employment report good news for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans unemployment fell one point eight percent last year now it's down to seven point two percent and it's still far too high and well above the national number joining me now is one man who is working on that problem Democratic congressman mark Takano remember of the Veterans Affairs Committee on education in the workforce congressman thanks Jordan is here today hey Patrick thanks for having me so congressman so we got some good news first and what do you think drove that nearly two percent decline last year well I think it's the overall improvement in the economy and California things are looking up and you know as I talk to constituents even in the Inland Empire where I represent Riverside County which usually lags in the economy things are looking up so I'd have to attribute some of that to the fact that we've seen an overall improvement in the economy yeah so you know I'm a big believer that veterans when they come on their civic assets their leaders in their community but also the same ethic of leave no one behind the unemployment rate though is a lot higher for post 9-11 veteran than it is for overall veterans is that just a matter of them being younger and trying to enter the workforce during the recession or there are other factors do you think that our play well you know when you think about an eighteen-year-old sometimes even 70 year old young person entering service they haven't gone through the normal paces that a young person goes through whether it's going to school having that initial job after high school or if in midway through university they leave the military often without that private sector experience and that adjustment is somewhat considerable I'm pleased that our programs out there such as in California we have something called work for warriors which directs directly placed Durin's and service members departing service members into jobs and I'm pleased that a program like that can do it for you know five hundred dollars per person rather than the ten thousand dollars that the other programs do and Congressman Paul cook and I are trying to make this California model uh something that would go national and I know you just introduced that act now how do you convince employers at military experience is actually eat though we're all the job training well many employers out there already know that veterans bring with them considerable considerable leadership skills they'll often had training in the military that can that is transferable whether it's driving a a truck you know a large vehicle that can transfer readily to me transportation companies like UPS whether you've been trained as a medic you know that can transfer into you know whether you're going to move into a private ambulance care or become a paramedic these are all these are all transferable skills we have to do a better job of making sure that there's a seamless transition for our service members into civilian jobs and certifications and no doubt that that certification program would really help let me switch gears congressman demos sacred duty of a member of Congress is whether or not the declared war now we know that Isis a terrorist organization you know President Obama has asked the congress to vote on a new aumf authorization for use of military force when is the Congress going to get after it and bring it up for a vote well I can't tell you when i'm still a junior member i have been among I think those members of Congress very early on to call for an amf debate the fact that we haven't done that i think is an abdication of Congress's duty to be involved in such authorizations I personally believe that the that the AMF language that the president is submitted to Congress should be debated very very quickly it is as you say one of our most important duties and I am among those who believes that the languages although the President himself review his language as somewhat restrictive and indeed many of the Republican members think that the president's AUMF doesn't go far enough yeah there's no I know Connor you have been fighting that to make sure we get a vote on it but from my viewpoint Congress needs skin in a game here the political class of our country needs to weigh in whether or not we're sending American men and women and back into Iraq and into that war well especially when you think that it could mean a protracted involvement an involvement of billions if not trillions of dollars and American lives on the line the American people need to have the choices laid out before them in a democracy we simply must have public sentiment behind whatever major a challenge that we face and militarily and without it it simply will be history shows disaster for a country without having the American people vested in a decision of this magnitude no doubt congressman probably my last question timewise you know this week the new president of afghanistan is making his first official visit to the White House what do you think needs to happen to repair the u.s. Afghanistan relationship well I believe that you know a good start is that we have a partner in the new Afghanistan Afghani president that doesn't view I think the president with a huge amount of distrust we need to build a stronger hopefully the president's able to build upon that that beginning and you know I just hope I wish them well in in this meeting yet so real quick you know we're expecting to see a timeline for withdrawal that might be significantly extended in Afghanistan do you realistically expect the American presence to look different in the future I said again you expect what do you think that as far as our posture do you think the fact several thousands close to about eight thousand right now in Afghanistan do you think that will change in the future will we extend it will we keep 8,000 will we still continue to decrease it well I think I think given what we saw happen in Iraq I think the president is probably being very cautious about how how much more quickly we draw down forces in Iraq so I would expect to see you know cautious posture in terms of how much quickly we draw down although eventually I do think that we do need to draw down our presence in Afghanistan yeah it'll be interesting to see what comes out of the tuesday meeting at the White House Congress thank you so much for joining to take in hell I look forward to seeing you again soon thank you

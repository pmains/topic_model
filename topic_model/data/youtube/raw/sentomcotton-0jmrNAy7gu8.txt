joining us here in Washington Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton member of the armed services and intelligence committees and author of the brand new book Only the Strong Senator welcome back to Fox News Sunday thank you Shannon it's good to be back on with you okay so let's talk domestic a little bit for some interworkings of the GOP uh you had leadership elections this week there was an open challenge to Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell by Florida Senator Rick Scott um I understand the meeting was a little contentious but this is what Senator McConnell said when he emerged I'm not in any way offended by having an opponent or having a few votes in opposition as everyone has said we had a good opportunity to discuss the various differences you understand from a couple folks who were in there it was hit at times that there are fractures within the party how do you move forward reassess what happened in 22 is you got to already look at 24. well Shannon I saw some of those stories as well about the tents or angry tone of the meetings I gotta say whoever were the sources for those stories have a very low threshold for attention and anger I've seen into a couple of them and they said it was not Kumbaya I've seen much worse in my days in the Army I thought it was a very Frank discussion we had a disappointing election obviously we wanted to win the senate in addition to winning the house but one thing we all agreed on is that we needed to have the elections this last week and then move forward United to make sure that we help elect Herschel Walker in this runoff because although we're all looking forward to the next Congress we still have one more election on the books in the 2022 election and there's a big difference between having a 50 50 Senate as we've seen over the last year and stopping some of the most extreme policies and nominations from Joe Biden and having a 5149 Senate so a lot of folks are already fast forwarding to 24 including former president Trump he's in um what do you make of his entry in and by the way back on Twitter if he wants to go there Elon says you're welcome back you know uh Shannon and I opted out of being a candidate in 2024 so I don't plan to be a strategist or a pundit for 2024 the former president announced this week has suspect more candidates will be announcing in the months ahead but again I want to keep our focus on the final chapter of the 2022 election and making sure that we do all we can to elect Herschel Walker next month in Georgia let's talk about China the president just back from a meeting with President XI it's no secret that you've been a vocal critic of China this is what the president had to say after their meeting I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan and I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all what do you make it are you as convinced of the what the president is that there's not an immediate threat regarding Taiwan no I'm not Shannon I'm concerned that as early as next year our Xi Jinping could decide to go for the drug dealer this has been a very important year for him in China he just secured an unprecedented third five-year term he's made it clear that by the end of that five-year term in 2027 he wants to invade and Annex Taiwan back to Mainland China I think he may see a window of opportunity to do so in the next couple years in the same way that Vladimir Putin saw a window of opportunity to go for the jugular in Ukraine earlier this year even if President Biden believed that an invasion is not imminent I would suggest that it's not helpful to say that publicly because it might invite more adventurism from Xi Jinping what we should be doing instead instead is working with Taiwan making sure they're armed up to prevent any such Invasion you're also worried about Tick Tock you told people if you got the app delete it if you can just get a whole new phone you're worried about the collection of data the FBI warning about that this week as well director Christopher Ray but Tick Tock says this in a company statement we store all tick tock U.S user data in the United States with backup redundancy in Singapore our data centers are located entirely outside of China and none of our data is subject to Chinese law number one is that a lie is that are you calling them a liar and if so what can we do about it yeah those are false statements Shannon there have been reports reports indicating that that data is accessible in mainland China that Tick Tock a Chinese company is subject to communist China's laws and that Tick Tock is one of the most massive surveillance programs ever especially on America's young people that it's not just the contents you upload to Tick Tock but all the data on your phone and other apps all your personal information even facial imagery even where your eyes are looking on your phone that's why I've encouraged urged every American if they're using Tick Tock to delete it from their phone and if they can to get a new phone altogether so another foreign policy Hot Spot Saudi Arabia this week the bind Administration got involved in a federal lawsuit here in the states they were asked to weigh in on whether or not they have a position on whether the Crown Prince has sovereign immunity they did through the state department say that there is sovereign immunity in this lawsuit regarding the death of U.S based journalist Jamal khashoggi Fred Ryan publisher and CEO of the Washington Post said this President Biden is failing to uphold America's most cherished values he's granting a license to Kill to one of the world's most egregious human rights abusers you know President Biden had talked about making the pariahs when he was campaigning then July the visit the fist bump all the things that have happened do you agree the president is betraying American values by weighing in to say sovereign immunity what the administration decided this week in granting sovereign immunity to Muhammad bin Salman is in keeping with the practice of custom of lawsuits involving foreign heads of state it would have been a major break of those Customs to not grant that kind of immunity what I would say is that Saudi Arabia is far from the world's worst abuser of Human Rights you look at what's been happening in Iran for the last three months for instance and the way they've massacred protesters in the streets or what China does to harvest organs or to commit genocide against religious and ethnic minorities look if we didn't have allies and partners who don't always share our political systems or our cultural and social sensibilities we wouldn't have any allies and partners Saudi Arabia has been an important partner of the United States for 80 years presidents of both parties have worked with them unfortunately President Obama and President Biden have taken steps to try to ostracize and alienate this important partner what we should do is work with them to protect our interests in the interests of our allies in the Middle East but how do we how do we rate these things if you talk about China and Iran and other places Saudi Arabia has got a lot of accusations regarding human rights abuses this is you know a us-based journalist I mean somebody who was our intelligence agencies say murdered by the Crown Prince at least knowing about or being okay with the operation we can't just toss that aside Shannon the way I look at it is what matters most about governments around the world is less whether they're Democratic or non-democratic and more whether they're pro-american or anti-American and the simple fact is Saudi Arabia has been an American partner going back 80 years that doesn't mean that we Overlook or excuse countries that are pro-american and we can even help Midwife or or nurture them into Democratic countries like Ronald Reagan succeeded in doing in South Korea and the Philippines but to protect American interest of course we have to partner with countries that don't always share our political system and our cultural and social sensibilities Administration didn't have to weigh in here they chose to they chose to take this step but it's a lot like overlooking you're happening well you're right they didn't have to weigh in but again it would have been a major breach with customary practice and international law to not weigh in in every case going back decades cited in the state Department's own statement heads of state have been given sovereign immunity now in 1970s we changed the law for pursuing foreign governments that's why for instance American citizens have been able to sue governments that have sponsored terrorist attacks and terrorist victims can get retribution but when you're talking about individuals who are at the head of a foreign government it's been customary for decades to grant them immunity so it would be a major break and another effort in the campaign to alienate and ostracize Saudi Arabia not to recognize this traditional kind of immunity all right Senator cotton thank you for your time Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family thank you Shannon Happy Thanksgiving

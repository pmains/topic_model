Hi, I'm Virginia Senator Mark Warner and
I want to update you on my work to address the increase in black lung
disease that we're seeing in Southwest Virginia and all across coal country.
Black lung cases are at a 25-year high in Appalachia, and unfortunately
Southwest Virginia is ground zero for this latest outbreak — particularly for
advanced cases known as complicated black lung. That's why I teamed up with
my friend Tim Kaine and my colleagues from West Virginia, Shelley Moore Capito
and Joe Manchin, to introduce legislation in the form of amendment to help address this crisis. Our legislation will improve early detection of black lung and help
break down barriers that prevent miners from being diagnosed and treated. The good news is, this week the Senate passed our legislation — which was part of an
amendment containing this black low black lung provision. And I'm hopeful
that President Trump will sign it soon into law.

I plan on going one of the US House of Representatives in January I get there I need a las that's why your vote this November is so important I need you to vote in my conservative allies across the city across the county across the state I need you to vote for John colors I need you to leave here because I my goal vote you're a hater you're good I need to leave here to pass on our message to those who may not be listening who may not want to listen I need you to convince them people vote for all sorts of different reasons sometimes the single issues sometimes it's about personality or charisma I vote based on governing principles I think a lot of you do where our governing principles I was looking for ways to explain that to people because when I asked you to go and talk to people and convince them need some simple ways to talk to him about it I think we're for sustainable policies versus short-term fixation I think where they do good party not the feel-good party I think we trust in the people to self-govern versus trust in a small group of Washington experts to govern for us we believe in local problem solving versus centralized power in federal bureaucracy the protection of our laws and our border versus an all-out assault on our sovereignty we believe that the recognition in the recognition that we are a melting pot unified under one flag in three colors the red white and blue and one set of ideals on a multicultural salad bowl of different identities we believe in liberty and opportunity versus power hierarchies and redistribution we believe in results versus resistance we've been hearing that a lot lately right resistance resistance to blood the lower taxes in a regulatory environment that is the best economy in decades resistance to common-sense desires secured an open border resistance to nominate qualified constitutionalist to the Supreme Court resistance to more choice in health care and an end to burdensome regulations on doctors may be resistance to real reforms to our entitlement programs they got our spending back on track and save programs like Social Security and Medicare to go bankrupt otherwise resistance to strong national security helping our veterans we're building our military what exactly are they resisting those seem like pretty good things to me but instead they label us as deplorable or joe biden came up with a new one recently the dregs of society really [Music] on the right we are a movement with real ideas in a coherent governing philosophy based on sustainability and self-governance so we take our role in this world seriously we look out for our military and our allies like Israel because we because we have the wisdom to understand what is good and decent in this world and our role of protecting it because if America doesn't stand up for it doesn't stand up for what is decent and the proven values of Western liberal democracy that no one will be conservative of the champions of sustainability a radical change for the sake of change itself it's a word we should use a little more often sustainability because that's what responsible government is opening our borders the world may make us feel good in the short term but is not sustainable over 400,000 apprehensions on the border just last year is not sustainable either for law enforcement our courts are civic institutions of our cultural fabric taxing the rich may make Democrats feel good but it does nothing to help the poor the strong economy in the free market economy and reducing burdensome occupational licensing does handing out more health care coverage may feel good but does nothing to improve access when record numbers of doctors refused to work in an overburden system any longer expanding the rolls of Medicaid they make us feel good because we tally more numbers on the list of people covered but it's not sustainable it never will be Medicare for all may appear deceptively simple but the costs will never be sustainable and the notion of simplification is a false alarm the reality is that instead of a third-party insurer controlling our healthcare admittedly not ideal it will just be a government bureaucrat instead even more undesirable the Democrats favor short-term irresponsible policies that are going to bankrupt the millennial generation my generation a time of health care cost and entitlement spending or skyrocketing we need responsible representatives will stand up and rein in spending politicians are still the truth about our fiscal irresponsibility and do something about it I actually believe that a new generation of conservatives is ready to make the hard decisions decisions that'll tackle tough problems like retirement form and pursue these problems to the lens of personal responsibility sustainability and long-term planning I think this new generation will begin again to understand that a society is not sustainable without a sense of personal responsibility not sustainable without a sense of trust and local self-governance and not sustainable without freedom and individual liberty we know the importance of constitutional government and pushing the power of government down to the local level where do you want your problem solved by unelected bureaucrats or local representatives that you can actually see in here if my opponent if congressman Anderson's opponent if all of your opponents actually care about Texans they wouldn't be supporting an ideology that seeks only to gain more power more rules and regulations and centralize it in Washington of course that's not how they put it is it they just want more power but to do good things well what kind of good things who decides whatever they say it is that's what if you dispute them they'll shut down your speech they will attack your intent they will call it malevolent as conservatives we think carefully about policy and the implications of using the power of government to make impulsive and far-reaching changes we think carefully about how we use the most powerful federal government that ever existed we limit its power so that the real power to solve problems the real power to create solutions remains with each and every American and a quote to abide it again so for too long in this society we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community like Karl Marx said something pretty similar to that yeah Jo that is right we do celebrate the power of the individual because we figured out a really long time ago and in order for our diverse people to live together in a complex society we must empower the individual not divide people in the tribal groups personal responsibility must be rewarded not punished civic institutions like the church should be in power not swept away in favor of a more powerful federal government our country is a miracle of freedom and prosperity precisely because of these principles where individuals can live and work in peace without fear of large government telling us how to work how to spend our money how to run our businesses are worse what we can think or say these thing in the world is to be captivated by this idea of resistance like a lot of teenagers know there's an innate sense when you're growing up the things are just wrong they just feel wrong they need to be changed a sense that everything you were talking about your parents is bad and outdated we've all been there the language of revolution is captivating and it just feels right but it's not right because America is actually a compilation of the best ideas throughout history it is the ultimate conservative experiment in this sense the conservative show natural gratitude and appreciation of the past trials and tribulations Jerusalem taught us about a purposeful moral existence under God Athens brought us philosophical political self-awareness brought us the gift of Reason Rome taught us the importance of laws and respect for founding virtues London taught us that all men are subject to law even Kings that balance of power and checks and balances are power to Liberty the lessons of Jerusalem and Rome and Athens and London during the Enlightenment were encapsulated in Philadelphia the Declaration of Independence in the US Constitution remain kind of finally understood there are inalienable rights existed and that the government's Persis purpose was simply to protect them I changed them we're Patriots we believe that the ideals that our country was founded on or the right ones that doesn't make us perfect we don't always live up to those ideals and we work to do the left does not see America as good as it found it upon something good according to them when we aren't perfect when we don't live up to those ideals the only course of action is to undermine the very values and ideals that America was built on tear apart history and instead look the secular socialism as the answer that's not America and that's not Texas our values are simple we believe in a pluribus unum that we are united under one flag our mission should be to protect that flag and the ideals that represents usual even liberty and the freedom to live our lives and pursue our happiness and we believe in the statement in god we trust' because we know where our virtue and our morality comes from and we know that we cannot live in a free society without those moral foundations we know that the US Constitution was wholly inadequate for any other than a virtuous people so when you leave here and you talk to your neighbors you tell them why we are so passionate about voting for Republicans this November you tell them all those things I have copies of this you tell them we are the party of responsible government sustainable government limited government and the freedom to be anything you want in this country if you're willing to work hard and live with virtue we are voting Republican because it's the right choice in the future of our country is at stake our country is of depending on you to deliver that message thank you [Applause]

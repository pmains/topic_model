uh congresswoman dean uh thank you so much uh for being here uh and we are of course glad that you uh and all of your colleagues made it out safely uh after those riots last week and we have learned of course many additional uh terrifying details quite frankly about just how organized this protest was so i'm hoping you can take us behind the scenes of the conversations that you're having with your colleagues on the democratic side inside the democratic caucus about how best to proceed with this but also if you've spoken to any of your republican uh colleagues who may be willing to sign on to something that you're doing here to an impeachment article and and to vote to impeach this president after what happened on wednesday well casey thank you for having me and i was thinking about you and your colleagues i don't know who from uh your among your colleagues was up in the gallery where i was but certainly there were press in in the gallery when all of this went down uh it was an incredibly frightening time absolutely terrifying uh it seemed ungodly and otherworldly could not be happening and of course it was happening so to you and your colleagues i hope everybody is safe and working their way through it thank you uh our colleague our colleague haley talbot was up there with you and i know that several of you were very helpful to her so we thank you for that as well please go ahead uh so uh in terms of uh where we go from here we're in such unprecedented doesn't even begin to touch it anymore we have a president of the united states who is so out of control who incited by his words and his deeds and his actions and those who he put around him a storming of the capital literally an attack on our democracy an attack on that precious temple of democracy uh and attack on all of us as we see more and more of this reporting what you probably understand is those of us who were evacuated from the capitol from the gallery and put in a secure holding we did not have a television in front of us so when they told us that some people had reached the capitol and that they were as close as the rotunda at the time we were evacuated that we put our gas masks on because tear gas had been deployed that we get down and seek cover i thought it was only maybe a handful of people it wasn't until i got to a television in the ante room of the room we were being held in that i saw the gravity of this this president must be held accountable i signed on immediately uh called for the resignation of the president called for the invocation of the 25th amendment by vice president pence i still call him to do that that would be one thing he could do to redeem some part of his public service we know the president never sought to uh never was hoping for public service he was hoping only for self-service but vice president pence should call and invoke the 25th amendment shy of that we will impeach this president so congresswoman my question and mcconnell has laid out mitch mcconnell in the senate this obviously if you impeach it will head over to the senate there would be a trial jim clyburn the number three democrat suggested perhaps it would be wise to hold those articles not start a trial for fear that a trial might overtake the first weeks or months of joe biden's incoming administration and potentially serve to derail his agenda or divide the country what is your opinion should if democrats in fact impeach this president and the votes do seem to be there to do it should they send the articles to the senate right away uh and i failed to answer your question about speaking to republicans i did speak to some republicans at the time we were being held and to say do you recognize that many of your colleagues have gone too far they've brought such shame upon themselves uh i what i love about my caucus is that we have extraordinary minds extraordinary men of history who understand where we have been and that is uh jim clyburn he was a former teacher of history so i very much appreciate his suggestion that one of one possible wise course would be to hold the articles of impeachment and bring them later i am of the mind right now because of the urgency of the moment and the anger that i feel that we must we must put down an indelible marker impeach the president and swiftly try him in the senate that is my hope i understand the wisdom of the other opportunity but this is such an extraordinary moment that we must meet it with extraordinary speed and do it well we can have a an impeachment vote you see us bringing it to the floor very quickly bypassing our judiciary committee i'm in favor of that the evidence speaks for itself america has watched in horror as this president incited insurrection and an attack by uh people of our country against our country we can have an efficient uh fair trial in the senate and i hope that the senate says we have to participate in this we have to make sure that we shut this down so you mentioned your republican colleagues uh one of them said that uh somebody told them in confidence that they voted to overturn the electoral college votes because they were afraid for their own personal safety and the safety of their families uh what's your response to that decision to vote to overturn the election because of that fear and do you think that republicans will join you in impeaching the president if you do it this week i hope that we will have republicans join us you saw we have already i think 205 or so co-sponsors i was an original co-sponsor early on i hope republicans will join us this is a defining moment shame on those who brought up uh the challenges as you know pennsylvania was challenged and i had the chance to argue on the floor shame on those who brought those challenges and even greater shame on those uh who after the insurrection and the attack on the capital continued the lies and the arguments on the floor as i witnessed as we were arguing for people to vote based on their safety that's simply wrong we vote based on our oath of office surely we're all concerned for our safety we have no idea how deadly that could have become and it was deadly five people have lost their lives a capital police officer was slain i worry for my safety but that can't change my vote i have to vote what is correct i have to vote what is constitutional so that's a silly excuse for how they cast their votes i didn't feel safe today so i voted the wrong way that's not how it works all right congresswoman madeline dean uh thank you very much for taking some time with us to explain your perspective and your experiences on wednesday again we're glad you're safe thank you for the time thank you casey ahead here the debate in both parties over how to hold the president accountable for urging on the mob that storm

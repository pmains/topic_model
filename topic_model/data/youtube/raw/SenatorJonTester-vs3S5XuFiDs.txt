my name is Michael moderator we are in the University of Montana veterans office my name is Shirley and I'm the program coordinator for the vet's office here at the University of Montana retiring 21 years well my name's Alan Vargas I'm primary force my name is Toni Lynn zazen from 2005 to 2013 and I was in the United States 24 so the vet's office is the liaison between the student the University and the VA what we do is we process the students request for certification to the VA to ensure that they receive their monies from the VA for their service or their family members service well that's actually one of the reason I came here because other universities their veteran centers weren't very friendly and here it's we try do a lot of one-on-one like talks with students and the student is need to help financially we do everything we can to help since I started school because coming out so it was colder that office has been providing the information needs to get done or certified and useful as benefit we actually have people Doozers come in and just kind of hang out because where we are a transition office as well it's not just about benefits and education its support you know that to that connecting with your fellow veterans is very important and understand how to navigate the system because it's not easy it's not easy at all I think the first step for any event you know which can be a hard one is to ask for the support you know you're taught in the military to be self-reliant self-sufficient and to get the job done with less and sometimes you know it can be hard to ask they they serve their country and they were you know deserve every one of these benefits and they're out there to help them so I'm gonna making a lot of progress but there's still things that need to be done and I look forward to the next iteration of things you know that we're going to be doing to help our veterans in their education

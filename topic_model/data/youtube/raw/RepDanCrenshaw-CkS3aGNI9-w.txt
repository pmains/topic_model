we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks another special episode of uh watching hearings with uh your congressman so um i know you guys aren't all on c-span all the time watching what we're doing i do try to post this stuff on uh social media but people see like what looks like a zoom meeting and they just tune out i get it but you're listening to my podcast and you gave it five stars so we're gonna play um the uh the hearing we did in the energy and commerce committee with uh big tech and um now the democrats wanted to call this hearing because they also hate big tech but they hit big tech for different reasons see they think big tech spreads too much conservative thought that's what democrats think now they don't call it that what they say is it's spreading misinformation but when you listen to what democrats are saying what they really mean is it's spreading conservative opinions they don't like that now um i that that's a point that i don't think we bring up enough you know we we all like to yell at big tech um we're concerned about censorship and the conservative bias of the censorship that they engage in which i think is definitely true um but there's a much deeper threat than that okay you gotta you gotta appeal it back another layer why do they even why do they have this bias why do they feel pressure to have this bias uh i look the the truth is jack dorsey mark zuckerberg they didn't start these platforms with that intent they didn't i mean i was there when they started it i was i was i was uh one of the first schools in 2004 to get facebook it was open twitter was twitter was open the early days of social media had pretty vast engagement and over time they moderated content more and more and more algorithms started to drive you more towards what it thought you wanted and this has a ton of consequences i heard more and more and more people to to be sort of the arbiters of these algorithms and decide what would be censored and what wouldn't and continue to tinker with those things and of course people have biases and the vast majority of people who work at these tech companies um are are left-wingers that's just just true we can we can measure that based on donations things like that um but again let's peel back the layer real quick it's what causes that culture it's leftism and it's the democrat party that embodies it which what i noted from this hearing was how much the democrats think big tech doesn't censor enough that's their that's their issue our issues that you censor too much although we do have a lot of republicans concerned with online bullying children getting on in on these on these platforms and sort of having their brains rewired uh in certain ways that that is concerning as well um i i do tend to think i'm not so sure i know what i want big tech to do about that i i do know that parents need to you know be very careful about what they're letting their kids uh engage in on these online platforms uh because as human beings i don't think we figured out how to communicate this way uh effectively and in a healthy way yet i think that is true and that's a worthy conversation to have uh republicans also voiced a lot of concern for for a lot of illegal activity that continues to be prolific on a lot of these platforms human trafficking uh drug trafficking things of that nature i focused on something different i focused on the cultural problem we have where there's a growing number of people in this country that do not believe in free speech and free debate and um i wanted to give i i i kept the the hearing on all right i kept my attention on mark zuckerberg um just because i only get five minutes right and you know i i would have liked to ask jack the same thing you know do you even believe in these values and he emphatically said yes and i'll be honest i believe him i believe him i actually do uh and everything i've noted about him in in the past confirms that belief is he a liberal yes but i think but but i think he might be an actual liberal like that you know the kind of liberal i disagree with on a vast majority of things uh but that still believes in that that free speech while it's messy while it causes a lot of frustration and confusion and problems it's still better than the alternative which is authoritarianism and we we got to stop pretending like like uh like the freedoms we have in america are normal in western society they're not people being jailed in canada because they misgendered their daughter um in the uk piers morgan was investigated by the government because he got a bunch of complaints in because he criticized meghan markle this is 1984 authoritarian nonsense it happens in many other european countries too they don't have free speech they don't have a first amendment their right to free speech has long been protected by the culture there's just been the cultural agreement and and precedent that you would just that you would that you would value this thing we call free speech but it's never been protected in their constitution we're the only ones who do that's a pretty big deal but our constitution can only last insofar as the american culture believes in it that's a fact we've changed the constitution over time usually for good things uh remember women couldn't vote according to the constitution then we changed it because the american culture decided that this was no longer relevant this was no longer valid so we had to change it don't think that we can't change the constitution again if the american culture stops believing in the first amendment and there's a growing number of people who don't and i witnessed an entire political party speak out against the first amendment speak in favor of political of censoring their political opposition now democrats know that they can't do that they know that that the first amendment protects you from them but they've also found out that there's a really powerful entity out there unlike any entity before and that's big tech now again a lot of us all conservatives like big tech the only reason you're hearing this right now is because of big tech the only reason you hear a lot of what i tell you is because of big tech so look i i i i'm a little bit more careful than a lot of conservatives when i just go bashing big tech big tech is our best weapon against the left because the left has managed to infiltrate mainstream media and the education system far more than we ever did so you know does it need some reform yeah and i've laid out in past past podcasts on what kind of reform is needed and i lay it out at the end of um at the end of that hearing too but let's be really clear on who the real enemy is the real enemy are the people pressuring big tech to do their bidding and to infringe on the first amendment on their behalf because they can't do it themselves that's what's happening guys that's what i pointed out here and i wanted to let them know i wanted to let mark zuckerberg know i'm on your side if you actually believe what you just told me you did believe so i asked him those very pointed questions i asked him do you believe that you're the arbiter of truth for political opinion he says no and look i'll be on during that hearing him and jack dorsey both pushed back a little bit on democrats when the democrats were like why won't you censor this why would you do this and they and they didn't give them much okay we have to continue to foster that we have to continue to say look we're the ones who believe in these platforms we just want them tail we just want them to be more fair okay we want them to be more transparent we want a real appeals process when people get banned and we want the and look you can make up whatever rules you want for your platform but they need to be clear and they need to be applied equitably and i shouldn't be able to easily find examples where they're not applied equitably and all of us can find those examples all the time i brought up one uh during this hearing you know where and i watched both of those videos the project veritas video and the cnn video they're exactly the same right it's a reporter with a microphone it's labeled it's not some secret recording and they're just going and confronting somebody at their home now you can argue that that's again i would be really annoyed if somebody confronted me in my home so you know again that's not to say not to say it's not really really obnoxious but um if we're talking about things that get taken down then they should both be taken down now i don't think either one should be taken down but that's what we're talking about that's what i wanted to make clear to to big tech i i think it's an impos it's an impossible job to to try and monitor and regulate so many forms of speech hate speech being one of the most annoying ones you know and and i looked through their definitions of of hate speech um some of it's not so bad it's um oh maybe maybe i'll just read facebook's twitter's is actually pretty is much um shorter but um the thing is is i'll read some of it and then you can be the judge so facebook we define hate speech as a direct attack against people on the basis of what we call protected characteristics race ethnicity national origin disability religious affiliation caste sexual orientation sex gender identity and serious disease we define attacks as violent this is important because yeah because what does it mean to attack somebody we define attacks as violent or dehumanizing speech harmful stereotypes statements of inferiority expressions of contempt disgust or dismissal cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation um i would point out it's not over but let me just point something out here um not just this week uh senator tani tammy duckworth said that she wouldn't she wouldn't vote for any nominees who were white so if she posted that on facebook i would assume facebook would take that down of course would they no this is the problem and should they no they shouldn't i want to know what she's saying i want to know the garbage that's coming out of people's mouths i would let now what i would suggest to facebook is list words list words that you can't say again facebook has every right they are protected by the first amendment and my goal is to get them to adhere is because they're protected by the first amendment to to transfer that protection to their users to the greatest extent possible i get that it's not going to be totally free speech as per the law under their platforms that's their right to do that but in the spirit of the first amendment i would encourage them and hope for them and i've told them this try to match it as much as possible be as clear as possible what's right or what's okay and what's not okay on your platform they go on to say we consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic okay we also protect refugees migrants immigrants asylum seekers from the most severe attacks though we do allow commentary and criticism of immigration policies similarly we provide some protections for characteristics like occupation when they're referenced with the protected characteristics we recognize that people sometimes share content that include someone else's hate speech to condemn it or raise awareness in other cases speech that might otherwise violate our standards can be used self-referentially or in an empowering way our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech but we require people to clearly indicate their intent if intention is unclear we we may remove content well i mean there's a lot to unpack there i i think the main issue is it's vague it's vague like i i still stand by i i don't think hate speech is a real thing um i think in sentiment to violence incitement to violence is a real thing and uh it can be defined rather clearly now they they sort of define it that way um you know they say we define attacks as violent but then they say dehumanizing speech now what's dehumanizing go through the comments on my social media there's a lot of dehumanizing stuff i am constantly berated for having one eye constantly they never take it down you know should they i don't know i kind of want to know how garbage human beings think i mean i can take it i have thick skin i also have the ability to turn off comments if i really don't want to see it so look i i'm a bit more of a free speech absolutist that's just that's just who i am um but i but i think these i think this description is far too vague for for any group of people to properly enforce and fairly enforce so they do this to themselves they make they give themselves this impossible task of trying to regulate speech there's a reason that we don't do any of this in law the re there's a reason that in law you have to clearly show intent and action um when you're talking about an incitement to violence which is which is not protected political speech um on twitter what do they have by what they say on hateful content says you may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race ethnicity national origin cast sexual orientation gender gender identity religious affiliation age disability or serious disease that's a pretty reasonable statement that's a little bit more clear you may not promote violence against okay that's basically incitement to violence it may be more detail that that is more in accordance with current law wouldn't be a terrible idea um directly attack threaten okay those those are clear words i'll give them that now is it applied clearly uh a lot of people would disagree that's the problem um this is also a problem says we also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories well um antifa hamas the ayatollahs i mean come on now i guess antifa uh is just against conservatives and according to this political affiliation is actually not one of their protected classes so i guess that's how they get out of that one but on all of these i would think antifa antifa um content would have to be taken down i mean they're basically a domestic terrorist organization they're constantly engaging in criminal activity uh i don't have it in front of me but there was a longer version for facebook and it clearly said um you know anybody who's promoting criminal activity we take down but again why isn't why are there antifa accounts at all again by these standards they should be taken down and i think that's what drives conservatives crazy um is is the fact that it's just not applied equitably and um look if it were up to me i would say yeah antifa stays up i want to know what antifa is doing i want law enforcement to be able to track antifa on social media as they're doing all their crazy things so i'm more of a free speech absolutist on this um these things are just are just far too difficult um to actually enforce which is which is the point we're making and i think i think big tech can do a much better job uh getting to the right place on that and um actually one of the one of the better um suggestions that we'd heard and this came from zuckerberg mostly who who more actively advocates for reforms of section 230. and i think i think deep down where he's coming from is he just doesn't want to deal with it anymore um and uh they've talked about sort of an industry standard an industry group the the same the same way that um you know it was agreed upon that in in cable television networks uh certain words um and and pornographic images would just be banned that was decided upon by by a sort of um industry standard and maybe something similar is required here that again is more standardized more transparent and there's just less guesswork because it's the guesswork that's driving everybody crazy i i look you you can't have a platform that's a total free-for-all even parlor is not a total free-for-all it's important for people to know that they moderate content you have to there's the user experience would be pretty bad if you didn't moderate any content at all but at the same time you moderate too much and you lose trust in in the users and also you're selling them a false bill of goods and i think that people feel like they're they've been they've bought into these platforms and um and then when these standards are not applied equitably that their their rights as consumers have been violated i think that's a fair that's a fair statement to make that's the approach that i personally take to all of this and um but more importantly like i said the real threat here is that there's an entire political movement that wants to weaponize social media platforms to infringe on the first amendment we can't let them and um and we have to let the social media companies know that as long as they resist that we have their back if they don't resist it they're the enemies of liberty that's a fact okay that was a long build up uh without further ado here's the five minutes of fame uh on this hearing i hope you enjoy um take a listen look i've been on social media longer than anyone in congress i think it was one of the first schools to have facebook back in 2004 and it seemed to me that the goal of social media was simply to connect people now the reason we're here today is because over time the role of social media has expanded in an extraordinary way your power to sway opinions and control narratives is far greater than the us government's power ever has been so i noticed a trend today there's a growing desire for many of my colleagues to make you the arbiters of truth see they know you have this power and they want to direct that power for their own political game mr zuckerberg since facebook was my first love uh i'm gonna direct questions at you and this isn't a trick question i promise do you believe in the spirit of the first amendment free speech robust debate basic liberal values yes absolutely yes see my colleagues can't infringe on the first amendment the american people in their speech are protected from government as they should be my colleagues this administration they can't silence people they disagree with no matter how much they want to but i do think they want to just in this hearing i've heard democrats complain about misinformation by which they clearly mean political speech they disagree with they've complained today that prager university content is still up i've heard them accuse conservative veterans of being tin foil hat-wearing extremists and that opinions on climate change that they disagree with should be taken down this is quite different from the republican complaint that illegal content needs to be addressed so the growing number of people in this country that don't believe in the liberal values of free speech and free debate i promise you the death of the first amendment will come when the culture no longer believes in it when that happens and it becomes okay to jail or investigate citizens for speech like has happened in canada and throughout europe their culture turned against free speech you all sitting here today as witnesses are part of the culture you can stand up for the spirit of open debate and free speech or you can be the enemy of it your stance is important because it's clear that many want to weaponize your platforms to get you to do their bidding for them mr zuckerberg do you think it's your place to be the judge of what is true when it comes to political opinions uh congressman no i don't believe that we should be the arbiter of truth thank you and lord i promise you this as long as you resist these increasing calls from politicians to do their political bidding for them i will have your back you don't you become an enemy of liberty and long-standing american tradition you might all agree in principle but what i just said mr zuckerberg you clearly do and i appreciate i have a feeling the others would answer it as well i just don't have time to ask everybody but the fact remains the community standards on social media platforms are perceived to be applied unequally and with blatant bias mr dorsey in just one example i saw a video of that from project veritas that was taken down because they confronted a facebook executive on his front lawn but here's the thing i can show you a video of cnn doing the exact same thing to an old woman who was a trump supporter in her front yard i've looked at both videos it's an apples-to-apples comparison cnn remains up project veritas was taken down i'll give you a chance to respond to that i have a feeling you're going to tell me you have to look into it i i i don't have an understanding of the of the case but i would imagine if you were to take a video like that down it would be due to a doxing concern private address address was blurred out look at that you don't have it you don't have the case in front of you i get that the point is if there's countless examples like this i i just asked i just found that one today there's countless examples like this so even if we agree in principle and everything i just went over you guys have lost trust and you've lost trust because this bias is seeping through we need more transparency we need better appeals process more equitable application of your community guidelines because we have to root out political bias in these platforms i think and i've talked with a lot of you offline or at least your your staff and i think there's some agreement there and i haven't heard him hearing anybody ask you what you're doing to to to to achieve these goals so i will allow you to do that now maybe mr zuckerberg will start with you sorry to achieve which goals more transparency more more feeling that the better appeals process for content taken down more equitable application of community guidelines so for transparency we issue quarterly community standards enforcement reports on how like what prevalence of harmful content of each category from you know terrorism to incitement of violence to child exploitation all the things that we've talked about how much of it there is and how effective we are at finding that and um and stats are on that for appeals the biggest thing that we've done is set up this independent oversight board which is staffed with people who all have a strong commitment to free expression for whom people in our community can ultimately appeal to them and that group will make a binding decision including overturning several of the things that we've taken down and telling us that we have to take them that we have to put them back up and then we respect that so there you have it probably could have talked to them for another hour um and grilled them on on i think a more productive conversation about look how are you going to get better transparency how are you going to improve the appeals process when people feel unjustly censored or de-platformed and how are you going to ensure that these extremely vague standards on hate speech that we went over before can possibly be applied equitably and you know and i would have continued to ask them because i only got to have zuckerberg but i wanted to ask jack the same thing like do you think you're the arbiter of truth um he probably would have said no in in that in that particular hearing but then it's fine good i'm happy we agree in principle that means we're allies but don't make us enemies by by not living up to that principle resist the left man that's what i tell these that's what i tell these tech ceos resist the canceled culture left stop letting them threaten you right they threaten you with advertisement polls uh you know they they they threaten you with public pressure the same with all ceos when you stand up to the woke mob i i've never seen anybody who's who's regretted that you know goya being a great example everything got sold off the shelves when they stood up to the woke mob that's that's just what happens um it's worth it it's worth it just for the sake of americanism for the sake of the spirit of the first amendment if we lose the culture of the first amendment we lose it all and i want to believe that these guys up top at these uh companies at least started off believing in that and uh it's important that we let them know that if they do the right thing we've got their back if they do the wrong thing we don't but uh we need them and they need us so let's keep fighting the fight out

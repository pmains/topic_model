thank you madam chair good morning commissioner and panel I attended the prayer breakfast this morning and seeing the Commissioner here in the special time of season reminded me of lost two certainties of death and taxes but you know I think they're made like to know where the tax part of that I'll leave that one alone but there may be a third part of there may be a new certainty in life and that is that your personal identifiable information is going to be stolen at some point when the current yup authentication framework was being developed the National Institute of Standards and Technology informed the IRS that a taxpayer identification number was an acceptable form of an identification I'm going to get real acronym heavy here because as slow as I talk there were many time to answer if I if I didn't use these afternoons in August 2015 NIST inform TIGTA that a TI n is now not an acceptable government identification number for the purpose of authentication RS agreed with this update and indicated the agency would take steps to conform to NIST standards so my first question is when and how to NIST initially inform the RS that at ein was acceptable it was accessible with acceptable I was acceptable again when the programs were developed in two thousand eleven and twelve it was part of a general framework I'm not aware of a particular NIST approval this sets out standards that we're obligated to and and do follow it doesn't necessarily that I'm aware of do reviews and respond to particular questions but we did through the IG understand that NIST view by last summer was that by that time because as you noted so much in personal information has been stolen and in hands of criminals by itself a taxpayer identification number was no longer acceptable and by that time we had taken to get transcript down alright so those in 2011 he said when it was two thousand eleven and twelve when we designed the system taxpayer identification numbers and auto wallet questions were are being used by or range of financial institutions and others for authentication so what steps if you or they are is taken with this communication you've had with tigta to conform to than this standards or your youth in you're not aware that there no we are agree all right we've in light of that and our experience have taken down to get transcript application the IP pin application we are in the process right now of testing a multi-factor authentication process that will require taxpayers to identify themselves through an additional factor they will have to will communicate with them with their cell phones or smartphones or other devices that we've not had access to before and they'll have to come back through with a pin an identifier reinforcing all the other information they'll still have to provide us that system we hope to have up in the next two or three months perhaps earlier and that will in fact be at the highest level in the appropriate high level that nish now has out there it's called multi-factor authentication okay and mr. george is the current e'l'ith authentication framework compliant with this standards and if not does that mean that other online services such as online payment agreement direct pay and where's my refund are more vulnerable to compromise they're vulnerable to compromise but the impact on the taxpayer is not the same if someone wants to find out where their refund is it won't affect even if it's an important impersonation type of situation that won't affect the amount of money involved here hide it I mean they might get additional information that ultimately could be misused if one of the factors that to authenticate who the taxpayer is what was your refund last year but you can bet you can't access the app without knowing what the refund was there basically it's a good point because authentication depends on the nature of the risk when our assumption is if you're going to pay us on an online payment agreement you're unlikely to be a criminal criminals usually don't send us checks if you're checking for a piece of information like where's my refund you don't get in you have to actually know what the refund is that you're asking about you can't just go in and say if I got a refund coming you have to put all of your personal information in and you have to identify the exact dollar amount of the refund to find out where it is we had about 250 million hits on that app already this year those people used to have to call now keep in mind also and this should have been stated at the outset there's the figure of 700 or four hundred thousand eight hundred thousand that number is not accurate because if someone gets access to information under the get transcript application when it was up and running they also have access to dependent information and and spouse information so that number could be exponentially higher in terms of potential victims of identity theft or or some any other taxpayer myths mischief and then ultimately again and i'm not i'm glad that the Commissioner in a hit and his staff have been extraordinarily cooperative congressman but the IRS simply misjudged the risk of the processes that they had in place when they first instituted the get transcript program they thought it was a very low risk endeavor and it obviously turned out not to be the case he'll back madam chair

last year during 2020 we had about 400 000 people uh die from coven across the country but at the same time we had over 80 000 people die from substance abuse uh now that that's that's a horrible number to think about 480 000 people dying unnecessarily but and and the ratio is five to one between deaths of drug overdose and coving but the american government has made an absolute commitment and i'm proud they but they're spending 750 times the amount of money to deal with covet as they are on substance abuse even though the ratio is only five to one or is it five to one it's 750 so and we also know according to johns hopkins it just came out with their study that said the seven day rolling average for daily deaths has actually been decreasing in america during this period of time so but at the same time drug overdoses have not been they're continuing to rise vivitrol has been a proven treatment we know about that numbers of you they know that's a competing product but the supply and demand has made it difficult to get so thank you thank you for stepping up the world when you when we needed you for covid developing a vaccine but i want to know whether any of you are is equally committed to solving this substance abuse problem getting us a treatment the equivalent of a vivitrol that we might be able to deal with it because as i said the covet is going to go away but not the drug abuse

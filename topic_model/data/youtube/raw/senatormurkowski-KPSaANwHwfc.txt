mr president request that proceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with we're not in a quorum call mr president senator sullivan and i are here this afternoon on the senate floor and we're here with heavy hearts joined in the gallery by friends of alaska because last friday our congressman congressman don young the congressman for all alaska and the dean of the house who served our 49th state ably and faithfully for the last 49 years passed away as he was flying home flying home to be with the people of alaska seated next to his wife ann he passed peacefully and left this world there is no doubt there is no doubt that congressman young lived a a large and a full life he was 88 years young and we always referred to him as young not old he accomplished an incredible amount across the many decades that he served alaska and served his country but that doesn't make the loss any less sudden or any less devastating and it doesn't change the fact that we are now left with a whole the size of alaska in our congressional delegation mr president we were a team we were small but mighty you've heard me on this floor talk about the last grace great race the iditarod and no dog team no dog team can make it without the leader we all know that but you got the swing dog and you got the wheel dog and we've all kind of taken different points on that team but it's always been with don young i was home over the weekend i spent the weekend there reflecting on don young's life and on his legacy i had a chance to speak with with his wife ann over the phone i talked with his daughters joanie who we know well and and dawn sister talked to a lot of friends who shared some stories about our congressman many of those stories are probably not fit to print in the congressional record but lots of reliving of the of the life and times of don young's but for those who didn't have the privilege of knowing congressman young as so many alaskans did he he was really he was all of the things that have been written about all of the things that have been said about him these past several days he was all that and he was more he was larger than life we keep saying that larger than life he was colorful as colorful as they come he could be tough he could be gruff he could be very feisty but he was also he was warm engaging he was charming but most of all he was passionate he was a passionate man about alaska and alaskans to his very core and he was loyal he was loyal and devoted to his family to his friends to his staff who served him and loyal to the people that he loved so dearly so we we think about dawn as as forever being alaska but don's life didn't begin in alaska he grew up in california working on his family farm his father would read jack london to him at night and that inspired him later on to head north he served in the army with the 41st tank battalion and then after graduating from chico state college he answered the call of the wild he eventually made his way north to the village of fort yukon just above the arctic circle and he tried his hand just about about everything he was into construction he was into mining he taught at a bia school in the winter he was a tugboat captain in in the spring in the summer he hunted he fished he trapped he he took well to alaska and alaska took well to him by then dawn had fallen in love with alaska and he was also head over heels for his first wife lou who was a bookkeeper from a respected gwitchen family they married in 1963. he was elected mayor of fort yukon the next year didn't spend much time as mayor moved on to the house of representatives the alaska state house of representatives and then in our state senate but where he would where he would really make his mark was at the federal level as a member of the house of representatives which he joined in 1973. and initially it didn't start out so well he lost the election in 1972 to nick begich only to win it in a special election in march of 1973 after congressman begich went missing after an airplane accident but once once in office don young never stopped winning for alaska in his first year in office congressman young helped authorize the transalaska pipeline which has been the economic backbone of our state ever since not long after his colleagues chose him as their freshman congressman of the year there are so many many legislative accomplishments over the course of the congressman's life too many to list here but just to highlight a few in addition to the pipeline authorization he helped establish the 200-mile fishing limit and contributed to the magnuson-stevens act which has allowed alaska to maintain its world-class fisheries he wrote the national wildlife system improvement refuge system improvement act which guides the use of millions of acres of those lands congressman young passed legislation to open a small part of the non-wilderness 1002 area in the arctic national wildlife refuge and he did this a dozen times before we steered it into law in 2017 and believe me congressman young reminded me every time how many times he had actually got it across the finish line in the house but don never ever gave up and given the way of the world now his commitment to energy security should be more appreciated than ever he enacted important measures as chairman of the resources committee and a landmark transportation bill safety lieu as chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee and he was a strong strong champion for alaska native and native americans don was pretty independent he was independent in his thinking he was not afraid to to vote his conscience to help alaska just just before he left washington d.c this past week he was involved in the reauthorization of the violence against women act and it helped considerably with the tribal title in that act i also credit him seriously credit him for garnering enough republican votes in the house last year to ensure that the bipartisan infrastructure bill could finally move across the finish line he knew that that measure was good for alaska and he said not only am i going to give my vote but i'm going to work to make sure that we have the votes over here to sign this into law there's a a lot of stories on this in this body about our former senator senator stevens being legendary pretty tenacious in his pursuit of federal dollars to help build alaska but just know that congressman young was right there every step of the way making sure that alaskans received what what we consider to be our fair share on december 5th of 2017 alaskans were just just filled with pride for congressman young when he became the 45th dean of the house as its most senior member at the time i gave him a little gift it was it was a star designated in his name um you can actually get a certificate that says this star up there is designated to you but it it was was given um as a sentiment reflecting his stature as the north star of our delegation and our northern state but when you think about when you think about this remarkable journey that don young had from teaching fifth graders in alaska running dog teams guiding barges along the yukon river to becoming the longest serving republican member of congress of all time of all time and the most senior member of the house of representatives for all all that congressman young accomplished for all that he did for alaska you have to know this was no easy task this was no easy task for 49 years he stood alone in the house of representatives as the sole voice for alaska we only have one congressman for all alaska only seven states have just one congressman and of course alaska is further away from washington dc than all of those states bigger than all of them combined and our vast amount of federal acreage means that we have more issues and perhaps more complicated issues that have to be addressed as well but none none of that mattered to don young he took the long trips back home in stride he would use his time on the plane to meet people to talk to them to just have conversation try to understand their priorities and concerns but he was he was making friends and he did the same here in washington he worked tirelessly here to build relationships build alliances that would would help him help alaska help address our state's challenges and it wasn't as if he was seeking out bipartisan relationships necessarily don was just the kind of guy who would make friends the record shows that congressman young was one of the top legislators of our time he was the primary sponsor of 123 bills that became law you go over to his office and you will see pictures on the wall of 10 different presidents that signed into law different measures that don had participated in and again recall don young was one of 435 voting members of the house and the only one there to represent alaska and he was repeatedly named one of his chambers most effective members don young was old school because his relationships really ran on both sides of the aisle starting with speaker pelosi leader mccarthy spanning the spectrum of all who would work with him and he really did work tirelessly to do what was right for alaska because at the end of the day that's all he cared about and he was pretty open about that being a congressman for alaska requires every last bit of you it requires tremendous sacrifice from you and your family if you don't just that if you doubt that just ask just ask anne walton young since they married in 2015 she has been by his side literally every day in the office traveling with him she knows she knows the work ethic of this man she knows the heart of this man and she knows how hard he worked for all of alaska but from his first day through his last day 49 years and 13 days don young gave it his all and as a true man of his people he was just the right alaskan to serve in the people's chamber senator sullivan and i are going to have a lot more to say about our dear friend our partner our our team leader in the coming days and weeks we will have a number of occasions to honor his life and legacy including on march 29th when he will lie in state in statuary hall for a well tribute for today however our reality is that for the first time in 49 years alaska does not have a congressman in the house of representatives for the first time in 49 years alaska does not have don young there to defend to advocate and to legislate on our behalf and i'm heartbroken and so are countless alaskans and individuals across the country whose lives happen to intersect with this legendary legislator on saturday morning i got a text from a former staffer he left years ago young man and he said in his text he says don young was the only congressman for all of alaska for all of my life i will miss him we have lost a giant who we loved dearly and who held alaska in his heart always we thank him for everything he did for us to build our state and fulfill so much of our promise we owe his family his wife ann his daughters joanie and sister a debt of gratitude for sharing him with us for so long together with them we mourn for our late congressman alaska's champion and our dear friend don young

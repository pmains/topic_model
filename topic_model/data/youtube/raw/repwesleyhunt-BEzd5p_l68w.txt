hey Sergeant thank you so much for your service that gentleman right there represents the best of us all and the fact that we're having a political political conversation about this is actually wrong the only thing that we want to do is recognize the best those brave men and women they're willing to give their lives and a sacrifice for us to be able to convene the day in a room like this I am one of those people I served in combat I'm a Westport graduate I am the kind of person like that gentleman is sitting right there that's wanting to die for this country for us to sit here together and offer just a little bit of homage to those that are willing to do that I think it's not it's not nothing we shouldn't be doing is actually necessary you see that flag represent the deaths of thousands of men and women 14 of them actually my West Point classmates and every day that I get up I look at that flag and I thank God that we are here so the fact that we get to sit here together and have this conversation based on the sacrifice of that flag and the gentleman that came here said today should speak volume so how we should conduct ourselves moving forward in the future quite frankly you are correct sir we should be saying the Pledge every single day every single morning and every single committee because when I was in elementary school that's what I did and I worked my butt off to be sitting here right now in this room and the least we can do is to pay amateur the sacrifice of those that have come before us to say you know what democrat or republican we are in this together that flag is the one thing that unites us let's just take 30 seconds to put all of our differences aside and say we can agree that this country is wonderful this country has done outstanding things and that brave men and women were willing to die for it and that's what sets support from every other country in the entire world every generation stands up to die and fight for that flag the least we can do he said the Pledge of Allegiance I yield back thank the gentlemen the question is

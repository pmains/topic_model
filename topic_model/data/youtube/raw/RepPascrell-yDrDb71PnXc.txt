my chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey Mr Speaker I rise today to honor Larry Doby a sports legend a pioneer of American civil rights a man who proudly served his country a fellow native of the streets of my hometown Paterson New Jersey where he was a star multi-sport athlete at East Side High School well known for his character I want to thank chairman Issa for the work that you did tirelessly trying to get enough signatures both last year and this year great job and I know the brothers and sisters in Ohio are very proud of you and I want to thank Maxine Waters who made it very very possible to bring this to the floor today my deepest deepest thanks he did serve in the United States Navy in the Pacific during World War two and after an honorable discharge in 1946 he returned to New Jersey to pursue his career in baseball with the Nord Eagles after being scouted at Hinchcliffe Stadium in Paterson now hence Cove stadium is now in the historic district of Paterson the same field I played on as a kid which gave me the delusions of making it to the major leagues almost but not quite we were proud that Larry Doby achieved that greatness and in 1946 Larry helped the Eagles win the Negro World Series championship over the legendary satchel page think about that and the Kansas City Monarchs Larry Doby hit 372 with one home run five RBIs and three stolen bases World Series many believe Larry dough would be the first to break the Major League Baseball's infamous color barrier we know what happened on April the 15th 1947 Jackie Robinson took to the field and Ebbets Field and in July 5th 1947 Larry Doby integrated the American League with the Cleveland Indians and 71 years ago last week 71 years being second the NA makers challenge any less difficult there is courage any less remarkable Larry was also treated to horrible racism even some of his teammates shunned him Larry Doby took that abuse whatever he went imagine that burden imagine the courage it would take to stand in front of that every day and yet he handled the adversity with bottomless strength and poise and dignity there was no interleague play back in 1947 and certainly no ESPN baseball fans for the America league only areas like northern Ohio Michigan and around Washington DC would never be able to see Jackie Robinson play so as Larry Doby who integrated the American League parks the poise in the courage of Larry Doby was a spore source of inspiration for so many I know his family very well as well as Larry he knew it - Larry once said I knew being accepted was going to be hard but I knew I was involved in a situation that was going to bring opportunities to other blacks unquote besides being a pioneer Larry Doby was no slouch on the diamond played 13 years he led the in the instead of their last World Series in 1948 and I Ryan I remind mr. Renee she at that point they're due he was voted to seven all-star teams when it was all done he finished with 253 home runs a thousand RBIs a cool lifetime batting average even when he was retired labradori continued to break barriers as mr. Rene she pointed out in 1978 became manager of the Chicago White Sox he became only the second American african-american major manager of a major league team his play on the field might have been good enough by itself but in his he had his ability and he had his courage Larry Doby was rightly elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 I made that trip tomorrow at Cooperstown as many folks from Ohio and many people from Paterson New Jersey did I was filled with pride watching this product the Paterson has sent to the Parthian of America's game but even after it was finished in baseball Larry Doby wasn't finished he continued to make significant contributions to his community he served as the director of community relations with the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets where he's deeply involved in building several inner-city youth programs this was a special special person mr. speaker this bipartisan bill will posthumously awarded Larry Doby with a Congressional Gold Medal the highest award bestowed by the United States Congress on extraordinary individuals it is write recognition for Larry Dobies athletic feats his courageous leadership the opportunities he created for others and the inspiration he gave to millions so HR 1861 the Larry Doby Congressional Gold Medal Act with my friend Robert representative Jim Rene see is a big deal I also would like to thank the Senate sponsors of the companion legislation Rob Portman Bob Menendez Cory Booker sherrod Brown Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham since coming to the Congress I've tried to support the legacy of Larry Doby we passed an act of Congress to name the post office of Patterson after him we worked hard to make sure he was recognized by the postal service what a beautiful postage then we are fortunate to have heroes who inspire us to achieve our best and lead our communities towards the positive change these areyou nighters in our community and that's what we need more of today we are proud to recognize Lawrence Eugene Dobie as one of those heroes I thank you mr. speaker and yield back the balance of my time

gentlemen I remember should this bill pass and become law which it never will it will tie us to the 2003-2008 guidance which the Farm Bureau has described as a hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories and will result in and is resulting in increased delays and cost the public at large that's why we're here today everybody agrees that we need clarification but you are excluding them from using the judicial decisions any document that was used in coming up with this problematic rule and saying you can't use any of that so basically we are stuck with the 2003-2008 guidance which prior to this grandstanding over here everybody agreed needed to be fixed well now we're going to be stuck with it forever instead of using a legislative scalpel you pulled out the giant sledgehammer here sometimes it's harder to be a legislator actually get into the guts of something and figure out what's wrong what isn't wrong and mr. Bishop has done that this cannot they cannot expand the scope beyond those waterboarded waterboard eat water bodies covered prior to the decisions of the US Supreme Court in those two cases it cannot be inconsistent with the judicial opinions of Scalia Kennedy and wrapping house this is not judgmental stuff this is clear legislative restrictions this would be taking and putting walls around their rulemaking and saying no you stay inside those rules in an addition to that you would ink you know they can't increase the regulation of ditches they can't eliminate any historical statutory regulatory exemptions for agriculture which do not exist under the 2003-2008 rules and there are questions about ditches under the 2003-2008 rules they're interpreted different in all parts of the country so you're going to bind us to something that doesn't work because you want a grandstand and pretend you're doing something for people who have legitimate concerns sometimes it's harder to say to them this is a difficult complicated question because Americans want to preserve the clean waters of the United States we don't want to go back in time but we also want you to be able to farm and to rain it and do other productive activities that's hard to do those times and there isn't what this bill before us today will do it'll bind us to the problem general spin question is now on the amendment offered

yes I may respond to this discussion about jobs in my district to the chairs questions Cheryl and waters my district knows firsthand about what China has done economically the the very industries you're talking about pork deal Mills Patrick Patrick yarn for yarns Saunders they know first hand was happened to the textile industry because of what China has done and bad trade policy by the American government has enabled this let's not subsidize the Chinese let's not subsidize the Chinese so they can compete with us and take our jobs my district has been ground zero for job losses in textiles and furniture and you bring up Hickory Springs but the better example of CR Lane to compete for furniture industry jobs against China my district has done a fantastic job and they've felt the worst of the effects worse of the effects of giving China the most favored nations status which was bipartisan and bad and every sense of eroding our sense of national security economic security that china is enabled so let me tell you something about my job the jobs in my district they understand the threat of China economically they have felt it the examples you use with these textile firms the reason why they're here is they're innovators there are innovators that's why we have American jobs in textiles directly as a result of American innovation and ingenuity to compete against the Communist Chinese so let's not use their tax dollars to subsidize loans to back loans help the Chinese to take art to take jobs from us so textiles and furniture industry jobs I've been fighting for this since I got elected to Congress for those jobs and I've spoken out consistently against Chinese economic aggression and Chinese national security aggression this is not new to me this is not new to me so that's why I offer this of substance we can talk about jobs in my district absolutely I'm game for that

  MR. MCHENRY, VICE CHAIRMAN OF  THE COMMITTEE AND SPONSOR OF   THE LEGISLATION. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA  IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MCHENRY: I WANT TO THANK   THE CHAIRMAN FOR HIS KINDNESS  IN WORKING WITH ME AND MY TEAM   ON BRINGING THIS BILL TO THE   FLOOR TODAY. I WANT TO THANK HIS STAFF AS   WELL.  WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS THE  PROTECTING CONSUMERS ACCESS TO   CREDIT ACT.  A BIPARTISAN PIECE OF  LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE BOTH  REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN   THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF, AS   WELL AS DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS HERE IN THE HOUSE  OF REPRESENTATIVES.  THE ISSUE WE'RE DEALING WITH IS  ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES  FACING OUR COUNTRY.  WHICH IS THE DECLINE OF LENDING  TO CONSUMERS AND SMALL   BUSINESSES AND SMALL TOWNS AND   RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES  I REPRESENT IN WESTERN NORTH   CAROLINA.  IT'S THE SAME ISSUE FACING SO  MANY IN URBAN SETTINGS AS WELL.  THIS TUTCHTS ALL OF AMERICA. -- TOUCHES ALL OF AMERICA. BUT THE STORY IN RURAL AMERICA   IS BLEAK.  COMMUNITY BANKS ARE CLOSING AT   A RAPID PACE AND SMALL   BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO   FIND LOANS.  MANY AMERICANS DON'T HAVE THE  SAVINGS TO COVER A COMMON  $1,000 EMERGENCY LIKE A CAR  REPAIR.  THAT'S INTO THE JUST -- THAT'S   NOT JUST A RURAL ISSUE.  THAT TOUCHES ALL AMERICAN  COMMUNITIES. THE GOOD NEWS IS AFTER THE   FINANCIAL CRISIS, INNOVATIVE   COMPANIES AND BANKS PARTNERED  TOGETHER TO FIND NEW WAYS TO   HELP HARDWORKING AMERICANS AND   SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THEY CALL IT FINTECH.  THESE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES   PARTNER WITH BANKS TO HELP   SMALL BUSINESSES GET A LOAN. THEY HELP YOUNG PEOPLE GET OUT   OF STUDENT DEBT. THEY HELP EVERYDAY AMERICANS   FIND THE FINANCING THEY NEED TO  LEAD BETTER LIVES. NOW, THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING  HERALDED BY BOTH PARTIES.  SHOULDN'T BE IN A PARTISAN   ISSUE. SHOULDN'T BE A LEFT OR RIGHT,  CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL. IT'S A GOOD THING THAT'S   HAPPENING WITH INNOVATION AND  DIFFERENT MODES OF LENDING AND   BORROWING IN THIS COUNTRY. WHILE THIS ERA OF FINANCIAL  INNOVATION IS BRAND NEW, THE   ACTUAL STRUCTURE SUPPORTING  FINTECH IS BASED ON ONE OF THE   OLDEST BEDROCK PRINCIPLES IN   AMERICAN LAW.  THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IS   CALLED VALID WHEN MADE.  VALID WHEN MADE OR WHAT THE  SUPREME COURT REFERRED TO IN   1833 AS QUOTE, THE CARDINAL  RULE, END QUOTE, OF AMERICAN   INTEREST RATE LAWS PROVIDES A  LEGAL FOUNDATION FOR ALL   FINTECH COMPANIES PARTNER WITH   BANKS. I DON'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH THE   RANKING MEMBER OR OTHER MEMBERS  OF OUR CHAMBER THAT BANKS ARE  HEAVILY REGULATED. IF THEY EVEN PARTNER WITH  ANOTHER FIRM, THIS, TOO, IS A  REGULATED THING. YET ALL THAT CHANGED WHEN THE  SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO HEAR   THE CASE OF MADDEN VS. MIDLAND   FUNDING. IN MADDEN, ACTIVIST JUDGES ON A  FEDERAL APPEALS COURT BROKE  WITH THE LONG-STANDING LEGAL   PRECEDENT OF VALID WHEN MADE   AND HELD THAT THE 1864 NATIONAL  BANK ACT DID NOT HAVE A  PREEMPTIVE EFFECT ON LOANS   CREATED UNDER THIS FINTECH BANK  PARTNERSHIP. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN   AROUND ALMOST FOR 200 YEARS AND  THE PARTICULAR LAW THAT WE'RE  DEALING WITH HAS BEEN AROUND   FOR 150 YEARS. ROUGHLY SPEAKING.  THE DECISION, THOUGH, THIS   DECISION HAS CREATED   UNCERTAINTY FOR FINTECH  COMPANIES, FINANCIAL   INSTITUTIONS AND CREDIT MARKETS  GENERALLY. ACCORDING TO A STUDY FROM  COLUMBIA AND STANFORD  UNIVERSITIES, MADDEN   SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED CREDIT   ABILITY IN THAT AFFECTED   REGION.  AND THIS MATTERS FOR ALL   AMERICANS BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT  IT'S HAVING. WHAT WE SAW IS LOAN VOLUMES  DECLINE. THE AVERAGE FICA SCORE FOR   BORROWERS TO GET A LOAN  INCREASED. THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE ON THE   MARGINS OF SOCIETY, IT GOT   HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR  YOU TO GET LENDING.  IT'S A BAD CASE. SIMPLY PUT, THIS SHOULD NOT BE   HAPPENING. IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT   FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR ALL  AMERICANS, WE NEED THIS BILL   TODAY. A BIPARTISAN BILL. WE NEED IT.  IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT   MODERNIZING OUR FINANCIAL  SYSTEM, WE NEED THIS BILL  PASSED INTO LAW. IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT HELPING   EVERYDAY AMERICANS NOT JUST THE  FORTUNATE FEW, WITH UNBLEMISHED  CREDIT, WE NEED TO PASS THIS   BILL.  I'M PLEASED THIS LEGISLATION   ENJOYS SUPPORT FROM MY   COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE  AISLE. I WANT TO THANK REPRESENTATIVE   MEEKS, DEMOCRAT OF NEW YORK,   SENATOR MARK WARNER, DEMOCRAT  OF VIRGINIA, AND SENATOR PAT   TOOMEY, REPUBLICAN OF  PENNSYLVANIA, WHO WORKED HARD  ON THIS BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL  LEGISLATION. IT'S IMPORTANT, IT'S NEEDED. WE'LL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON  PEOPLE'S LIVES.  ALL ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN   MADE ABOUT THIS BILL, AGAINST  THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR DON'T   ACTUALLY FOCUS ON WHAT IS  IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY ABOUT  THIS LEGISLATION. HAVE A POSITI  THEY ARE STRAWMEN THAT DON'T   HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE   CONTENTS OF THIS VERY SIMPLE   BIPARTISAN PIECE OF  LEGISLATION. I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE F

recognized thank you madam speaker i rise today in support of h.r 8351 the formula act i appreciate mr blumenauer and his willingness to work with me on this bipartisan effort to address our nation's infant formula shortage the formula act makes infant formula more accessible and affordable by allowing it to be imported duty-free through the end of the year make no mistake mothers and families should never have to experience the extreme despair of worrying whether shelves will be stocked with the formula they need for their infants as a father of two including a one-year-old i think i can speak for many others across america that nothing is more important than the health and well and well-being of our children and yet the biden administration knew of the looming infant formula shortage for months and yet failed to develop a strategy or adequately respond while we wait for domestic production to fully resume families should not have to pay additional taxes on imported formula to feed their little ones i will continue to work with my colleagues on the ways and means committee as well as the full house to use trade tools to strengthen critical supply chains like infant formula thank you

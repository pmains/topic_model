statement thank you madam chair uh great to see you great to be here and a really great issue to address uh i do want to welcome everybody to this today's hearing on the role of ferries and improving mobility i especially want to welcome kyle godard the county engineer from calhoun county illinois mr godard is my constituent and has been working with my office to resolve an issue that calhoun county which is a county that is a peninsula that sits between the illinois and mississippi rivers but they have a problem utilizing its ferryboat program funding my hope at this hearing is to draw attention to this problem so that we can finally get the federal highway administration and the army corps of engineers to come together to find a solution at this time madam chair i'd ask unanimous consent to submit for the record my letter that i sent to both agencies five and a half months ago requesting coordinated technical assistance in resolving this issue so ordered and five and a half months is a long time and and it's pretty frustrating when you know we we don't get responses from the federal agencies that we send letters to uh i would ask if we continue to not get responses madam chair if you and i can maybe do a joint letter to uh to let these agencies know we just appreciate a response i would be happy to join the ranking member in such a letter thank you thank you very much under current law the subcommittee authorizes two programs that provide federal funds for ferry transportation the ferry boat discretionary program is administered by the federal highway administration and the passenger ferry grant program is administered by the federal transit administration the senate's bipartisan infrastructure bill includes two new ferry boat programs and gross ferry program funding the funding levels from 550 million to 2.3 billion dollars ferries serve diverse areas of our country much like our highway and bridge network from urban to coastal areas to rural america as much as i mentioned earlier i have a ferry in my district that actually multiple ferries that operate uh from illinois across the mississippi river to missouri and also we have ferries that operate interstate between greene county between greene county and jersey county illinois over to calhoun and that's what mr godard is here to discuss the importance of that ferry to the community it serves cannot be understated which is why it is so important to resolve mr godard's issues while ferry service certainly is not a solution for each state it is important to understand the role ferries play in quickly connecting people and communities through water crossings it's also important to understand the needs of ferryboat and facility owners and operators addressing these needs as those here before us today will testify is critical to improving our ferry operations i look forward to hearing about ferry ridership technological innovations and challenges ahead and proposed solutions identified in implementing ferryboat programs with that i want to thank our witnesses for joining us this morning and i look forward to hearing their testimony i yield back

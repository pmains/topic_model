we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody to probably the greatest podcast in america at least that's what a lot of people say uh jesse waters is our guest today i think you know him i'm not sure he needs a lot of introduction he is the host of fox news's waters world it's a very entertaining show jesse uh and so thanks thanks for being on i think i've been on your show once but uh now you're on the greatest podcast ever so welcome well thank you i i can't believe you're talking to me instead of fundraising i thought all you guys did in your spare time was fundraise congressman well i do a lot less of that it is what a lot of congressmen do um i do a lot less of that than others do um i look this is a serious uh and actually you know what another podcast gets asked the same question and in hindsight like i didn't really answer it so you've asked the question so now i'm going to answer it um it is true that there's a lot of members that will spend hours of their day making phone calls cold calls and i hate doing that i don't like doing that i'd rather spend that time being somebody that you would just voluntarily donate to and so and so like that's just just amplifying the conversation like pushing forward the right agenda it's one of the reasons i do this podcast because it's the only place where we can have like meaningful policy discussions or meaningful cultural discussions which is i think we're going to have today you just came out with a book today called how i saved the world i'm curious how you did so you saved the world already i mean this is this is a past tense title this is quite the statement jesse i mean how did this how did this happen well my wife came up with the title so all credit goes to her emma and we wanted something in the title that was going to be provocative and arrogant and we thought that this was completely on brand for jessie waters and just in a deeper sense i saved myself and a part of that process was writing this book and reflecting and getting remarried and getting into a place where i could write this book some would call it a memoir others would call it a confession so um we're here now i have saved my world because you know it is my world congressman but i think if everybody could stop trying to save other people and looked inside themselves and try to save themselves first instead of trying to annoy everybody else and trying to fix everybody else the world would be in a much better place yeah it reminds me of one of jordan peterson's 12 rules for life which is i'm not going to get it exactly right but it's like before you go saving the world get your own house in order get your act together and i actually had to do a speech after jordan peterson at the turning point summit a couple years ago yeah charlie kirk put me on to follow jordan peterson me that's not yeah not easy no it was uh it was like political speak for dummies when i came up there but it was an honor to have to follow that guy i remember i remember that particular event actually um he spoke for like an hour and a half i mean yeah i did a good 30 minutes after that yeah they wouldn't give the rest of us more than 30 minutes you know only only the great jordan pearson gets it well deserved he's one of the smartest guys he's i i've ever met um okay so so but tell us what it means then to to to save yourself uh what what did you what exactly is the book about how did you decide that this book needed to be written well i wrote the book for money congressman to be perfectly fragmented and it'd be weird to write a book for free yeah no author will admit that but i will admit that but i also got to a place where i'd balance my work schedule i'd balance my personal life you know i was over 40 i'd kind of come up as a scrappy producer than a man on the street interviewer an ambush guy and then they'd put me into the studio five days a week i had the weekend show and i wanted to say this is who i am this is where i came from this is why i'm here where are you from my yeah i came up with liberal parents who i think yeah you know oh so where are you from i'm from philly really and my parents are very liberal their education and they'd raised a conservative so i wanted to tell that story um and o'reilly as you remember used to send me out to these liberal bastian san francisco and cannabis festivals and the upper west side and i used to go talk to liberals all the time and so i studied them and kind of found out their mannerisms and their insecurities and their defense mechanisms and i wanted to share my observations as kind of a cult cultural anthropologist of the left and thought that now was the right time to do that don't you think what's always struck me is interesting is that the left knows very little about the right now i i think we know quite a bit about how they would answer a question what their opinions are generally their their general demeanor and that's been proven to me over and over again i mean i i've been in liberal bubbles consistently just in in my education uh most recently when i did my master's degree after the military at harvard and and i would also say that static like from the data that's also true there's there's a there's a lot of data that shows um and hundreds of thousands of interviews where a liberal will be asked what would a concern how would a conservative answer this question and then the opposite a conservative has asked how would a liberal answer this question and overwhelmingly conservatives get it right much more and liberals almost always get it wrong and and i think that's because they like to build caricatures of us well and it's convenient to do that because it's not requiring any sort of intellectual rigor if you just label your political opponent racist or sexist or bigoted you don't actually have to do the hard work and the heavy lifting of understanding the policy differences and that's where we are today so you're not really getting a robust debate in this country about policy about taxes about the implications of open borders about anything you're just getting the left saying you guys are mean you guys are nazis and we don't have to give a platform to nazis why would we make hate available to the masses why do we even have to lower ourselves to debate hate and that's just the quick kind of easy excuse to get out of debating because that's just easier and the liberal media lets them get away with that and i think it does a great disservice to the country i i think that's that's canceled culture in a nutshell right it's like shorthand for bypassing debate and and i'm not even sure conservatives always get it right when it comes to us talking about cancel culture so i try to define it a little bit more for people and i think it's i and i think the best way to define it is the cancelling of someone in order to bypass debate and more importantly that the cancelling of someone for something that should not be so objectionable right that is within the realm of normal debate or normal behavior or canceling someone for what is truly an accident right like an unintended bad joke and unintended bad bad comments that maybe that person doesn't really believe or didn't really mean to hurt someone's feelings for it's important that we we say that because i think oftentimes it gets it gets misutilized but but it's in because it's important to identify correctly what the weapons of the left are well it's a power grab and i would agree that they'll take anything and if you are coming from a place of hatred which they say we are then anything we say whether it's a joke a proposal anything is deemed hateful and nasty and deserves cancellation and they've set these rules up where they're only the ones benefiting we don't benefit from canceled culture they can say 10 times the things that we say doesn't matter they get excused for it so we're playing by their rules when we submit to cancellation and if everybody understands that then i think we can kind of create a a system where we don't go down over a bad joke um we could just refuse to go down for it because there's really not a lot of people clamoring to cancel someone for an off-color joke it just doesn't exist except on social media well and the hard part about it is is like you can't cancel me he can't cancel you you know i i don't think we're in the cancelable domain the hard part is the people who are get canceled are the people who aren't really in the in the fight so to speak so like a corporate ceo who maybe wants to do the right thing but is also terrified of just a thousand angry twitter comments or or the college professor who wants to teach the right thing but is easily cancelled by a mob of students like they're not they're not in the arena the way you and i are and so you know and i get this question all the time like how do you how do you defend these people how do you give them the resources they need to be able to fight back that lonely student who's just trying to speak her mind and a to a liberal college professor they're the one they're the real victims of cancel culture right because we have the infrastructure to back us up i have a very strong powerful corporation that's not going to bend the knee you have your constituents so they're always going to have your back and if they don't they'll put someone else in there but some teacher or some mom and pop store owner they don't have that type of firepower behind them so what's their reaction to the mob that comes for them they have to either just stand their guard and let their customers decide or let their community decide whether or not they're going to bow down and a lot of the times it gets too intense because they're not used to that type of intensity in their normal lives so they can get inundated with you know social media responses or they get a few calls from the local affiliate and that's it yeah they're scared and they and they go down without a fight and it's the intimidation factor and if i have a theory if you can withstand the mob for about i'd say three to four days mob's move on to another target but it's that it's that initial storm that seems so confusing and furious that a lot of people just just they just they just go down early and they don't they shouldn't do that they should fight at least three days at least three days timeline if you could withstand that i think you're gonna you're gonna slide through i actually think that's that's exactly accurate it is about three to four days and but like comments are terrifying people feel them in a very profound way on social media and you know you shouldn't um but but but they do um so wait you and i are the same age right we're like what are we what you do late 30s early 40s what are you i don't know we're elder well elder millennials i'm 37 yeah i don't want to ride okay so i'm a little older than you damn it um do you remember when we were growing up if there was ever a controversy in corporate america they would have a letter writing campaign and people would write letters right angry letters okay how many letters were there 100 letters so the ceo wouldn't even get these letters they'd be sent hard copies of letters to a mail room and the mail room guy may hand a few letters to the corporate communications officer and it was ignored now you can get same amount of people 100 people on social media and put a company on blast and that will pierce right through to the head of corporate communications and the next thing you know corporate communications is in the meeting room with the ceo and they're game planning a pr strategy to deal with a hundred people it's the same 100 angry people that made a big deal about a slogan 30 years ago and they didn't do anything about it then but now they're reacting to it i just think you're too sensitive to it now yeah and i think one of the other problems is that that person that pr person you're talking about is is generally a young person uh inculcated in in progressive culture from university and they tend to just care about what a hundred angry leftists say and they tend to dismiss what a hundred angry conservatives would say and look and i think you should i think you should dismiss both just to be clear because they're just angry people online you're right you always but you what about the ten thousand people that are your loyal customers exactly you're gonna see a thousand loyal customers for a hundred angry non-customers that's just bad business practice but people do it it's it's it's very frustrating what do you think about the conservative ability to activate one thing like i haven't been in politics long um you know i wasn't political in the military i i was kind of i've always been sort of a policy nerd uh it's what i studied in school uh and but but politics is you should separate politics from policy to some extent obviously they're related but the but i but i only got into politics the day i ran i mean that was that was like my first time in politics and but but looking at the the general environment it seems to me that the left is has a lot more practice being activists than the right does um and there's a lot of history of activism on the left the u the labor unions are very good organizers they've been doing this for a long time there's entire books called rules for radicals that have been prevalent on the left for a very long time they've really got a system in place and it's very organic right it's not like it's taught from the top down it's almost like it's part of their culture and conservatives are sort of are sort of developing their own but it seems very recent and and therefore like we don't always get it right in my opinion like i think that i think there's good strategy to activism and there can be but i'm not so sure we get it right because it almost feels like we're it's in its infancy on the right what do you think about that there's there's a professional class of left-wing activists and you're right it involves the labor reunions it involves the street activists and involves even corporate america but they don't have anything else to do except activism a lot of conservatives they have regular jobs they're parents they don't have time to be focused on these little details and once in a while and it's happening now once in a while there will be an ignition of a kind of a conservative grassroots activist based that will be organic and you'll see it manifest itself right now it's manifesting itself through the objection to critical race theory in schools where people like yourself had never been political before just but now regular moms and dads are starting to participate in these school board hearings and upset about this and that's the majority of this country you saw it before with the tea party movement the massive bailouts the massive spending the takeover of the health care system that was completely organic but then when that dies down conservative grassroots kind of goes back to work they go back to their homes they go back to their jobs they go back to life democrats are professionally engaged in this political warfare and it's tedious because they never stop unless we stop them and so they're just much better in terms of sloganeering communications or even fundraising um and it's very tiresome but i think we're in the majority i agree with that but yeah and you're right they they do put in the hard work i mean like it's not popular to say but if you look at what happened in georgia stacy abrams just put in the hard work years of hard work like getting little changes made that allowed them to you know in the the registration work that they did like we have to take that into account i will say like republicans in california they put in the hard work that's why we won back a ton of seats in california this last election and it like it it needs to be said hard work does pay off but it's tedious it's so tedious that door-to-door stuff that registration of voters i mean it's very very tedious it has to happen um i when we were looking at the internal numbers in terms of registrations coming into the 2020 election every data point i saw said the republicans were registering more voters and that made me a lot very very optimistic even two to one in some of the russell state republicans and in texas we did a lot of it too yeah and that's why it was so surprising um the way the things shook out the way it did perhaps that was um the ground game on the left may have been more made of come into fruition in the summer when barack obama and all the democrats in washington said listen you go outside if you vote and you go to a polling station you're going to die from covid so they got in early on that fear card the scare tactic is we have to register early because we're not going to be able to go to the polls because we'll catch covet and croak that i think that was early voting and the mail-in ballots i think may be out were able to out organize some of the some of the registration gains that republicans got i think so and then there's we lost the suburbs i mean this the suburbs did not did not vote for president trump the way we would have liked them to we unfortunately saw that one coming um because i'll never forget like my volunteers were coming back and and terrified uh before the election they're like we're not gonna win and i'm like we're gonna we're gonna win we're gonna win they're like no we're not gonna win like we have republi these people are supposed to be republicans and they're and they're saying they're not gonna vote for president trump and there's there's just door after door after door and this is the suburbs of texas and of houston this is my district now and that is what ended up happening president trump barely won my district only by a point you know well you gotta look at that as the china virus the china virus just swept president trump out of there if that wasn't there you remember in february before that sucker hit he had just beat impeachment he had i think over 50 approval in gallup he had a fat war chest all the democrats were fighting amongst each other and wages were up i think five grand in three years hot economy hot stock market the guy was cruising to a landslide everybody knew it i agree with that i agree with that january 2020 that is 100 percent true yeah i mean just totally destroyed him and and it was a shame the way that shook out because of operation warp speed i mean he got that thing fired up pretty fast and ended up ended up saving the country in the uh in in biden's first 60 days right there alone well okay well let's actually talk about that and relate it to sort of the theme um of kind of taking personal responsibility i guess if i'm trying to understand the theme of what you wrote about it's sort of taking control of your own destiny personal responsibility the pursuit of your happiness if you will somebody wrote that in some document some time ago i think we just celebrated that holiday like two days ago you didn't come to my party jesse not sure what's up with that it's fine you got better things to do up in the northeast i suppose but all right next coming next it's good it's gonna be cool so um but let's relate it to that theme i mean in all of your man on the street interviews and all of the kind of interactions you've done well i think a common theme you probably find is this desire from the left to control others like it's not enough for them that they get to live their lives they do believe that others should live it accordingly and that's the story of covid right that's the story of why the left and the right reacted so differently to covet i mean i have talked and written about this so much because i find it so fascinating that reactions to covet and covet related policy fell along liberal and conservative lines it's weird that that happened but that's exactly what happened and i think that that one reason is that need to control others that's what i found during my interviews throughout the country is that liberals have a hard time controlling their own lives so they project that need for control over other people i'm not saying their lives lack meeting congressmen or you know things are crazy at home but there is an instinct from the left to say you know what you're not doing it right i know better and here's what we're gonna do to make you live this way this way this way and i think that's rooted in the fact that america has been so successful without that type of control capitalism itself is the flourishing of individual freedom you can exchange goods and ideas with other people and then that just blossoms into a great capitalist society liberals did not have a big hand in that and they feel almost guilty perhaps ashamed that they didn't necessarily politically participate in all that great success that this capitalist country has had so in order to assert themselves insert themselves into the picture and kind of maintain their relevance they have to then push here push their tweak this regulate this and that makes them feel useful it makes them feel justified in their being and that that button never turns off so it's not like something liberals are going to say oh yeah we're going to come and we're going to fix this no liberals never actually go in and fix things because once you fix something you don't need liberals anymore they go in and they control things control is permanent and that's what they're even after with this new bill you're familiar with it they want to they want a permanent power situation where they get rid of the filibuster they federalize elections they turn texas blue through open borders you're never going to have a republican in the white house again with the electoral college republicans don't have taxes they have nothing that's what they're seeking permanent power permanent control and it's rooted in their deep-seated insecurities as human beings a feeling of moral superiority in a profound way i would agree with that it's almost like classism and we get a lot of snobs out here in in manhattan congressman you're probably not familiar with that as as i am um but there's a humility down south there's um there's people are more down to earth people help each other they're not putting their nose up at other people there's uh there's an instinct here on the left especially in the northeast to look down on people and they do that through how much money they have um they're educational elitists i'm sure you saw a little bit of that at harvard they're all about their resume what degree do you have what neighborhood do you live in you know what kind of car what club do you belong to there's a lot of snobbiness and again it goes back to an insecurity factor that they're just not comfortable in their own skin so they have to kind of project this moral superiority and it has disastrous consequences because it divides the country it's that's for sure one of the one of the interviews you did you talk about it is uh spring breakers and uh that's probably a lot of fun um together just see what people because they're you know they're kind of in their element right there they've had a few drinks they're probably being very honest it's a young it's a young uh sample size uh so i mean what do you learn from that because like you mentioned the word humility and i i closely tied to that as a sense of gratitude and one thing i talk about a lot is the sense of gratitude gratitude for our country and a sense of humility about what government can accomplish and a sense of humility about what you know just about policy or about how our country is founded about history and again you know when you and i were growing up we did not sit together with different friends based on political affiliation hell i went to a very liberal college i mean what college isn't super liberal but i don't remember people wearing politics on their sleeve and i graduated in 2006. like and that wasn't that long ago but i don't remember politics being in my face that is not the case for young people today so they're forced to be taking a side and and when so when i go to high schools and i talk to kids i'm like the number one piece of advice i can give you is be okay with not knowing something there's no shame in ignorance but there's a lot of shame in believing you know more than you actually do there's a lot of shame in having very strong opinions that are based in ignorance okay i don't remember which philosopher said it if it was aristotle i don't remember but he said what he said knowledge is knowing what you don't know and that's the kind of humility that we need in this country because i did a lot of spring break stuff and it was sec schools and i was down in the panhandle and i was fine with that and they were great kids and they were not snobby and they were not that politically left but they were kind of brimming with ignorance in their in their in their assertions right but but it wasn't mean-spirited i think you get a different sense from different universities in the northeast but the sec schools are great because i think they they have a strong foundation of what makes this country great and they respect the institutions of this country but they will wing it and you've seen people kind of you know what do they say um success and like half of when you fake it till you make it they will fake it until they make it and you clash the question and they say oh yeah and like they know i was doing a man on the street interview the other day and i said well what did you think about the summit last week and the woman looks at me and she said well that was a great summers you know really everybody got together i said do you know what summit i'm talking about she said no she just started laughing but that's it they'll learn um and and you know you remember how oblivious you were at that age i didn't at trinity college in west hartford connecticut i didn't have any politically active friends there was no politics at trinity now i can't imagine what it's like to be on campus and walk outside and there's a a transgender protest mixing with a an israeli apartheid protest mixing with a white supremacist protest i mean i'm just trying to make it to class on time and my class is at 10 a.m well it and it it puts these kids in an awkward situation where they're forced to feel like there's a crisis bubbling up all around them which just isn't which just isn't true um that there is so back when our parents were around they had the civil rights movement the women's rights movement they had vietnam and even before that they had world war ii and the great depression that was a real struggle they don't have real struggles anymore we have ipads we seamless we date on tinder everything's air-conditioned and life is good now people are looking for a meaning in their lives because they lack meaning because life is so soft so they create these little fake dramas fake controversies like microaggressions or you know the war on christmas or whatever critical race theory because they need to become crusaders against this you know this new evil these things aren't really that big of a problem and they're creating problems so they can come in and act like righteous crusaders because they lack that um they lack what other generations have had which is a real struggle and everybody else just thinks these people are annoying and so we placate them and say okay okay here give you this give you that and the next thing you know these politically correct people are calling the shots and they're cancelling people and then they're in charge of things and you know this country has to just say no you're a are you a father no you no when you you become a father when you have fun with that um you're you're gonna learn how to say no and saying no is probably the best thing you can do as a father or as someone in charge because sometimes people just need to hear no and they just knock it off and this country needs to start saying no well this is a this is a line you can steal it if you like but i say often that well if you steal it though you gotta give me credit for it okay i will i will give you some rule but um you know i i often say we should be treating the american people like we love them and because think about how you would treat your kids if you didn't if you didn't really like your kids you would honestly let them do whatever they want you would tell them that their bad grades in school aren't their fault you would tell them that they don't really have to stick to rules and that you know you'll take care of them and you'll cuddle them and you won't teach them the things they need to know for their life that's what you would do to your child if you didn't like your child but if you love your child you tell them no and you put rules around them and you tell them that there's consequences to their actions and it's tough love i suppose i don't know if it's tough love i think it's just love and maybe we should treat the people that way well i think today they'd call it tough love but when you and i were growing up they'd call it love and i don't need to steal the lawn because i've said it before on the five and you nailed it what kind of father would let their son just become a junkie and live on the street like that's what they're doing in san francisco you just let them decay what kind of person would let someone go loot a store and then drop charges just no consequences steal something light a building on fire and then just there's no consequences for that i was raised there's consequences uh there's deadlines there's no deadlines anymore you can do you can do whatever you want when you wherever you want it show up whenever you want there's no deadlines you can you can basically hurt someone and get away with it now in this country and you can you can waste away and it's like what they're doing on the border think about that they're savaging these border towns the border towns can't afford it the police department can't afford it these municipalities can't afford it you're just jamming hundreds of thousands of people into a community that just doesn't have the capacity to deal with that that's not something you do out of love you wouldn't overwhelm a system that you loved right you shouldn't you don't treat america like that and and i think liberals treat america like they hate it why bill de blasio lets people pee on new york city why would you pee on something you love congressman has anybody ever asked you that question well i was i could make a lot of funny jokes about that that i just won't do uh cause like you know this is a proper podcast jesse we can't talk like this you are a politician now you can't make like that um you know but you know we have a lot of fun as politicians i'll tell you what and um i i think especially on the republican side we've really transformed what it is to be in politics in a really cool way and and so it makes me it does make me optimistic about our ability to reach young people um and you know that's kind of my question for you too are you optimistic or because you know it feels like there's a lot of pessimism in this conversation but i guess you know how do we how do we become more optimistic and how do we reach young people in your opinion um and are we doing a good job of it what can we do better well i mean you republican party can always do better at reaching young people traditionally it hasn't been the demographic that they they go to to turn out and win elections with but i think trump uh activated a younger demographic just by his swagger uh people especially younger people respond to attitude attitude is everything in politics i've done tons of interviews across the country this is not like you a policy wonky country this is a country that responds to attitude responds to fairness and responds to things that feel right trump felt right in 2016 because he was up against such a rigged system and such corrupt politicians that people like that underdog the outsider and he really embraced that and and capitalized on it you know you get a lot of misinformation out there and the left is just very potent with misinformation they will smear anybody who starts attracting an audience i talk about in my book how effective humor is jon stewart probably the most influential media person on the left and maybe two decades just by ridicule he was able to move the needle just through ridicule alone and a lot of this stuff he did was out of context but people watched that show because it was funny and entertaining and they thought they were getting a little news in there today people watch either waters world they watch the five they watch gutfeld exclamation they watch tucker and these guys are funny no one says news you know news doesn't have to be boring yeah so as long as you as long as you're authentic and honest and and charming and funny i think the younger demographic will respond to that because they can sniff out a phony pretty well and it's really that's what it's to me it's about phoniness they'll sniff you right out i think that's a very accurate statement authentic real authenticity that you know sometimes people get that wrong and they think authenticity is sort of just yelling at the camera i mean look i think that's authentic but i also think it's annoying um and i think humor humor is really right humor is really important you you use a lot of humor on your show greg gutfield is absolutely hilarious and um it really hits people i mean when we did the the some of our videos in the past um it is the the ones that hit the best are the ones that are just fun and and they're not like overly politicized like and i think that what you know on our side our activists can take some notes on that sometimes and be like you don't have to you don't have to scream it you don't have to talk at the viewer you know you don't have to scream the slogan like you can you can delicately get them on your side with some humor with some persuasiveness um and it doesn't have to be full on red meat because red meat's not persuasive you know we've got to think more often times about like what would persuade somebody who doesn't necessarily agree with us but isn't necessarily super left either and uh because it is possible and i think we're i think we're learning that more and more i know i know we try to do that um from from both my campaign and official side it's and also you know what it's fun right and you use the word persuasion and that's the key word is that this is this is a all about persuasion you're not going to convert people through facts and statistics god i've tried and you really you know how many times i just tell juan williams juan this percentage of the border you know the crimes it it's in one ear and out the other so it's it can't just be it can't just be about the facts and and it can't just be about red meat and sloganeering you have to do it in a in a way it's almost casual like you're having a conversation with someone you have to maybe slow it down take a breath you're not trying to just jam it down everybody's throat and when you pause and people listen and you have a little smile on your face maybe you make a little joke here or there it tunes people in and we do that on the five that's one of the reasons the five is so effective because it's a conversation and we use humor we make fun of ourselves i think conservatives could really learn a lot by making fun of themselves liberals don't do that at all you know liberals you cannot puncture the because for them they're experts and everything and once that credibility is shot their whole their whole reason for being is gone because remember they have to be in charge of everything if you rock their credibility you won't put them in charge of anything but if you're if you're self-deprecating and the book how i save the world is very self-deprecating people say i have the most punchable face in television there's a reason um you know it makes liberals very angry because i make fun of them i make fun of myself i keep it light and fun but also substantive and that's very important for republicans to do yeah and entertainment's whether we like it or not that that is sort of the language of reaching people is it's got to be entertaining and you're more like sophisticated conservatives they they bemoan this fact right they don't like it and i'm like look i get it because i i too love the intellectualism of conservatism like i'd rather just be about policy i wouldn't mind if our legislators were all really boring and just knew a lot about tax policy i wouldn't mind that but i also understand that it doesn't work and like what it would you can divide members of congress into two categories legislators and performers and if you're just a performer i think you're i think you're doing probably more damage to us than good but you also have to have some performance because nobody would accuse me of not being a performer like clearly i do performance stuff i have commercials where i jump out of airplanes so like clearly i do that um but if you mix the two here's here's my thing as a conservative i like the intellectual guys i like the performers i like the guys in the trenches i like the warriors i like them all i think they all play a role in the movement and i don't want to put down this type of conservative that type of conservative i don't want to put down people like that i think it's like a living breathing organism or maybe if to use an analogy it's like it's like a military force you know you have your marines you have your airmen you have your strategist you have lots of people in the movement and everyone kind of plays a role and and when we win when we're all kind of working together right yeah yeah but i'm speaking specifically about congress though i agree with i agree with that statement about because like we have like comedian conservatives that just do that right and it's it's great like it's it's funny but i'm talking about members of congress like your whole point is to you got to be a legislator as well and um sometimes that doesn't always happen but um but but but my broader point is whether we like it or not people want to be entertained and you know whether it's through humor or through just having fun and that sort of happy warrior mentality is is extremely important i think when it when it comes to the methods of persuasion uh gw did it uh we've seen very popular conservatives catch fire just through personality alone see it on the explosion of podcasts and all these radio shows it's just phenomenal um but there's so everyone's so distracted now they have there's there's so many options on your phone i mean this thing how are you going to keep someone's attention when you have this thing you can't and you have dating apps now you have netflix it's all it's all available anything you want is at the tip of your fingertips so in order to break through you got it you got to you got to be a little entertaining and and that's a challenge for people um people don't like that but that's the reality you live in so you got to play that game i want to ask you about uh just what it's like being in news in the media maybe kind of pull back the curtain for us a little bit if if you will i mean so like so you talk about juan williams are you guys good friends off off camera like what do you guys have like real like political discussions off camera is it just for sure like how do you script these like how do you plan for these conversations in these shows that you guys do well we don't plan conversations and and i i have gone drinking with juan off the clock and juan can put back tequila man guy we were at a black eyed peas concert till about 3 a.m during the super bowl weekend we had a blast but no for the most part juan and i don't don't hang out off camera not that i wouldn't but you know we just kind of live separate lives and he's in dc now but uh my i'm not allowed to play with gut filled my mom won't let me uh do you ever have one of those friends you weren't allowed to play with back when you were growing up yeah i was that friend yeah you were that friend i was that yeah our parents don't let us play together but um you know pre-covered there was a lot of fun to be had you know people were going out drinking and there was more travel and that was more fun but you know we're trying to get back in the swing of things and uh and hopefully that happens but in terms of what you see on the five those conversations aren't scripted you know we'll get our rundown which is like the show runner for the day at about 11 o'clock and we get five topics six topics and we get our reading material and we brief ourselves we come up with a few snappy pieces of commentary and do our research and then we go out there and we try to light it up for you guys and keep it real one question i get asked a lot is is this is probably a question from not just moderate voters honestly it i get the question from conservative like fox viewers as well and and they'll ask me okay where am i supposed to get news from because it feels like when i watch fox and cnn like it's totally totally different universe there and it's just definitely true and you know you kind of just you you're attracted to one universe or the other i mean i think the things set on fox are generally true and i don't think much of what is said on cnn is generally true but there is sort of a hunger and i say sort of a hunger because i'm not sure that again viewers say things but i'm not sure that they would watch it and therefore make this a profitable endeavor but this this sort of hunger for like a just the news kind of boring walter cronkite kind of news is there space in america for that at all would it even make money how do you get to that point well i don't see an appetite for it number one so there is a profit motive there that's that's lacking um i don't honestly think that there is a desire to see a tv presentation in in those terms right now with the explosion of the internet you can go on and you can get you can get relevant documents to the latest case you could go and read transcripts of hearings you can go to c-span and you could watch videos of of hearings we've never been able to have that before they were declassifying memos during the win i couldn't believe we were getting like fbi background materials and and now you're seeing these legal briefs come out you can go on and you can read epstein briefings that never was available before you can go up and you can punch up the latest border statistics you know three months in a row of you know 20-year record high border apprehensions we would never be able to see that before so if there was a person that could go on the air and they could read some you know that kind of factual information they'd have to do it in an extremely compelling way but here's the thing congressman what you choose to show and then what you choose not to show that there's bias in that too yeah 100 so you know you could do a whole hour on one topic that may seem totally jacked to someone that's not interested in that i mean it's all about priorities and who sets those priorities as a human being with biases yeah yeah and i think that's what people need to understand it's like no matter what kind of news show you're watching it's most it's going to be it's going to seem biased to somebody you know it would have to be constructed so carefully where it's like well one side is saying this the other side is saying this here's our analysis take it or leave it um and who's to decide what's the important issue of that day well that's it yeah that's there was some recent controversy in fox for for that particular um uh local fox here here in houston for that particular reason and but yeah part of it's like yeah how how do you decide um it's a human being it's a human being and they are and they are deciding deciding based on viewership i'm not sure how you would fix that and like you know we have uh pbs um and you know npr you know with these sort of government organizations but but then they just get infiltrated by the left and they seem biased so it's like there's it's hard to find a solution there but it's actually a great ecosystem to be in right now as a news consumer because you're having more choices than you've ever had it used to just be the big three broadcast networks then it was just cnn and fox then it was msnbc now you can watch i go up to people sometimes and say where do you get your news people tell me al jazeera so people can go wherever they want now they can listen to the dan crenshaw podcast they can listen to azil uh what's his name uh dan bongino's podcast mark levin's podcast they can listen to hannity radio they can watch tucker they can see anything they want they go on breitbart and newsmax and not drudge anymore he fell off cliff but they can they can find out what they're looking for and and it's all right here in this stupid little iphone what do you think about um i guess the the the role of influencers in the media game uh you know people there's so many 18 year old kids that sort of get together and build these like meme accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers and then kind of related to that question what do you think about conservatives moving over to other platforms like parlor and rumble i mean it's not something i ever did mostly because like we just don't have the bandwidth to create yet another social media account and try to manage that and post that and the other reason i never did it was because i don't understand the point in going into a separate room with just people who agree with me and only talking to them like the whole point of me being on social media is to have a wide reach so i never i never really saw the point and and plus we just don't have the bandwidth they're not to do that extra work but i don't know what do you think about all like this sort of different ecosystem platform you know all power to him i mean that's how this country was built but you know twitter's dominated by about 10 and that 10 does all the talking and all the tweeting and that 10 he actually ran a demographic analysis uh leans women uh leans uh white college-educated atheist uh left-wing women yeah those are the that demographic dominates twitter i don't tweet that much because you know people don't get my jokes on twitter and i don't want i don't want to cancel myself even though that there's no risk as you said but um i listen a lot on twitter and i follow it but you know they do dominate that game they do dominate the social media game trump dominated facebook and but the left has twitter just under lock and key right now and you know if people want to bail because it's overwhelmingly left wing they can bail and and you know i don't even know if twitter's making that much money so yeah i just think it's hurting the country yeah i mean i don't think twitter influences the public very much either yeah i've never when i when i'm on twitter it's really just to talk to the political class in the media class right my voters are not on twitter they're on facebook and instagram so i mean that's and i think conservatives do you know we're always talking about how we're we feel like we're losing all the time and i don't think we should feel that way i think we do rather well on facebook and instagram i think um i think there is bias uh in their algorithms and i think there's probably some censorship of course and we're working on you know the right way to tackle that from a policy perspective it's a whole other long conversation but a lot of the times it's not happening the way people think it is and we need to realize we do rather well i mean if anybody was going to be censored it would be somebody like candace owens and her engagement is so unbelievably high it's it's astronomical and you know it's worth noting little things like that and we do rather well and i there's i think there's some signs of optimism there well i think the biggest personalities on twitter are conservative the biggest people in your business podcasting obviously talk radio and fox news they're all conservative personalities so that says something that there's a real appetite for conservative thought and analysis but you did touch on something and you said i think it's very important for your audience to understand we are winning and conservatives sometimes feel under siege when you go on these little platforms when you read the newspaper you think the sky is falling you know this is this country is a center-right country you dominate all of the state houses uh you know the the senate's gonna flip and the house is gonna flip in two years if if history's any guide and joe biden's a placeholder he won because of kovid because a lot of crooked factors came together in social media the china lobby wall street to kind of take trump out and and that's fine and that's how politics works but this whole recovery that we're in right now trump built that foundation the american people built that foundation that foundation was built through tax and regulations the enterprise and a lot of these deals that were getting squared away with mexico canada and china so i i don't give a what is joe biden really done what is he doing that's really moving the needle in terms of policy success he's not doing anything yeah he's he's he's keeping us he's keeping us down you know he's hurting gas prices you know he's he's hurting our ability to to to keep our allies safe and and keep our men and women serving overseas safe i don't see i don't see joe biden being a consequential president he's going to be an asterisk he's going to be an afterthought in the grand scheme of things i think that's accurate um they're not getting their major pieces of legislation through and we can thank joe manchin for that uh primarily and uh he doesn't appear to be budging on his on his refusal to torpedo the filibuster so that's that's good news they're they're i think they will lose well look we could always screw it up but i think they will lose the house and in a year and a half um you know i think the biggest concern i have with the biden presidency is the border because they have total control over that and until we take back the white house you know it's just it's a jurisdiction issue and if the president doesn't enforce certain laws they they can create that lawlessness and and we need the american people to rebel a little bit more against that i know we like you talk about it a lot i've talked i've created an entire documentary down at the border just telling people what's going on it is turning texas more red i'll tell you that uh you know we're winning elections where we shouldn't be winning elections in mcallen for instance and uh you know those those places are trending more conservative because like they they they're tired of being called latinx people okay first of all like let's let's let's get that out there uh it also like yeah they're latino but you know these are multi-generation texan families texas texas has that kind of history and and they and they're american and they still believe in borders okay and and so they're they're waking up down there and in a really good and strong way so i yeah i think we should be optimistic i don't think by i think bind can do some damage and they are especially via regulations like they're they're really constricting our economy unnecessarily and that's that's worrisome but i'm also optimistic that they can't get through they're really damaging i think they can get through some damaging spending and waste a lot of money but i don't but policy luckily i'm optimistic that they can't get through some of their most damaging uh policies so the two deadly components he's going to break the bank and he's going to break the border you touched on the border the border is broken i agree that it's turning texas red momentarily but i i'm nervous about the long-term trend there just in terms of the massive influx usually first generation immigrants vote democrat and i think that's his strategy is to turn texas blue in the long run in terms of the bank i mean you can't spend 6 trillion in a fiscal year and then double the fed double its balance sheet and expect no inflation so things are just going to cost more and it's going to hurt the middle class it's going to hurt the lower middle class and you're going to have high gas prices it's like three nights it's 339 here in the northeast to fill up your tank 339 we haven't even really gotten into driving season and that's going to hurt people it's going to just weaken the dollar they're just going to have less money to spend on what they need and and the the gains they're getting through wages or through you know is are just going to get wiped out through high gas prices so those are the two things that i'm most concerned about and that and the crime issue the republicans aren't really um it's not a republican issue yeah we don't have it yeah we don't have any control over it it's frustrating no control over it you get federal prosecutors once in a while that can take charge but they never do you know they never jack any of these charges up to federal beefs none of the gun charges ever rise to federal so i think that's just the democrats destroying themselves killing each other and uh and opposing any any agenda that's going to fix that just so they can be um different than what republicans are proposing so i think those three issues uh inflation uh the border and crime and you add cr critical race theory into that i think that's going to really awaken a grassroots movement here in this country in 2022 that republicans are going to benefit from big time i think that's true um we're we're coming up on an hour here pretty soon uh what would you add what did i miss that you that you wrote about what's maybe a takeaway that you'd want somebody to have from your book listen i i got sent to survival schools by my liberal parents so i learned how to survive in the wilderness you know they give you a stick a book of matches and a knife until you'll see in three days so some of those stories are provocative if you want to see me suffer and what i've learned about conservation and global warming that maybe aoc hasn't maybe for young kids you talked about 18 year olds 20 year olds i got fired from about five jobs before i got set with fox and there's just i was a bellhop i was uh a waiter i got fired from my job in finance apparently you have to a big grasp of arithmetic to handle millions of dollars of other people's money but so i kind of found myself coming up and then just o'reilly stories people are going to love everyone loves bill and me going out there and interviewing people at you know mushroom festivals and going to the south side of chicago and hearing some crazy war stories and then you know hanging with trump dinner at the white house chilling on air force one just some ridiculous ridiculous stories from from the former president that are very entertaining and just my basic takeaways about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and what makes liberals tick and how to beat them well sounds good sounds good i appreciate you uh coming on appreciate all you do jesse um great show people should tune in uh and watch it again it's entertaining it's informative um and um we're out there fighting the good fight so hope it's going well with uh with the book and um you guys uh hope you survive manhattan as long as you can listen if i can survive in the grand tetons i can survive manhattan thank you very much congressman and get me an invite to that party next summer okay it's july 4th every year forever houston texas can't cancel july 4th i'll talk to you later all right thanks jesse bye

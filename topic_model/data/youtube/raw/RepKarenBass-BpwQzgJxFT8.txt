congresswoman karen bass who represents parts of los angeles was on capitol hill amidst the chaos she joins us now on the phone congresswoman good morning yes good morning good morning tell us where you were at the time this mob stormed the capitol are you and your staff doing okay and what was yesterday like for you well it was a an extremely sad day and i was in the chambers i had watched i was watching the proceedings and i walked away to go back um to another building about five minutes before they crashed in and so fortunately i was not there uh when it happened but i will tell you that it was just a tragic day aside from being extremely angry it was also just a sad day in our history this is the type of thing we see that happens in other countries not here i will tell you that i was very worried about the protesters and told my family not to worry about me because i was going to be in the safest building in the country in the capitol it turns out i was in the most dangerous place to be we just heard adam kinzinger your republican colleague is calling for the invoking of the 25th amendment we just heard that within the past few minutes senate democratic leader chuck schumer also calling for president trump to be removed from office via the 25th amendment he says if that doesn't happen congress should impeach president trump as he put it quote what happened was an insurrection against the united states incited by the president do you have a reaction to those statements well first of all i absolutely applaud my colleague in the house representative kenzinger who has been quite principled over these last few weeks i mean personally what i feel is that i would love to see the 25th amendment invoked however in my opinion president trump is like a cult leader and members of his cabinet are in his cult so i have no expectation that they would have the courage the background or the backbone or the patriotism to stand up and protect the country and in terms of impeachment i was in the middle of impeachment i'm on the judiciary committee we know what would happen to impeachment in the senate i do believe that both of my colleagues majority leader schumer as well as representative kissinger are concerned because what is the president going to do over the next 13 days and i'm with them lockstep with that but i don't see the point of doing two things that we know are not going to be successful we just need to get through these 13 days so that he can be removed from the white house and the healing of this nation hopefully can begin mob rule is not how this country operates and last night seeing congress back on the floor saying they wouldn't be intimidated by an angry mob how important was it for congress to show the country and the world that they were back to business last night to count electoral votes oh well there was no question to me that we weren't going to finish our work i mean i think we adjourned around 4 a.m and we've certainly had plenty of all-nighters here but you know i think it was important for the world to see that a group of criminals was not going to subvert the democracy that we have in this country and that even a president who attempts to incite a riot well not attempts he did incite a riot but attempts to incite a coup will not be successful and that we will stand strong but i just can't i just can't help but saying the difference between how these protesters were received how unprepared the capital was versus how they have responded when it's a black lives matter protest was just absolutely shocking there are some who are suggesting that republicans who carried out this false narrative of election fraud whether it is the the house minority leader kevin mccarthy or our local representative mike garcia who said he was going to object to the electors that there should be some accountability for them including the sacramento bee who's suggesting that they should even be brought up on charges do you have a thought about that well i think if anybody's brought up on charges it's the president frankly and then i think that the voters are the ones that should hold them accountable so i don't know what kind of charges you would bring people up on because they were irresponsible in terms of saying that the election you know was not valid so i i i don't know the uh the point of that but their voters should be the ones to determine that and we see your tweet there with a picture of president trump i want to ask you about election integrity four years ago it was russian interference it made people doubt the results 2020 it was false claims of widespread fraud how do we get to a place where in 2024 we don't find ourselves back here again well you know i think it's going to be a real test for us because what is going to happen on january 21st will the media continue to cover trump 24 7 when he's a private citizen you know he said the fight is is going to be on to make america great again i mean that that's what he has said so i think that's going to be really important in terms of we have got to turn the page on this chapter of our history we really do i mean the other thing about yesterday you know that was a super spreader event right seen those thousands of people that were running around without mass vandalizing the capital you know a percentage of them will be sick representative beth if anyone knows anything about you it is that that you are about bringing people together you you believe in consensus that's how you've always governed and i wonder and and you have great relationships across the aisle as opposed to other folks who who may not um how will you move forward in this next congress and are you optimistic about progress in terms of actual legislation that's going to get done to help the american people oh yeah i really am uh optimistic and i will tell you a couple of things first and foremost the news yesterday should have been about the fact that democrats now control the senate and that mitch mcconnell will be minority leader and those over 200 bills bipartisan bills that have been sitting on his desk for the last two years might actually be able to make it to president biden's desk so i feel very positive about our ability to govern but i also feel positive about many many of my republican colleagues because i think they want to be freed of this man uh also and i think you will see more atoms step forward and step up now i will tell you i wish they would have been doing that all along but so be it um you know i will be optimistic that they will be able to get to the business of governing as opposed to being intimidated by a bully congresswoman uh karen best we really appreciate your time and being with us this morning we're glad to hear you and and those you were with yesterday are doing well thank you so much thank you

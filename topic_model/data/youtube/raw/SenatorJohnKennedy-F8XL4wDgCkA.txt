here's a story i won't keep going about a transgender couple from washington dc who've recently had a child congratulations now the biological mother though wants to be dad and the biological father wants to be mom now this is america and people can call themselves whatever they want these days i get it but they can't fool biology the baby has been able to latch but i've not been able to produce any milk it's okay because we're going to supplement the feeding with formula so that my baby is still getting the the nutrients that they need but i'm still feeling hopeful now i'm i'm not a doctor but even though we have nipples men cannot breastfeed even with a good solid latch according to science milk for babies does not come from men here now louisiana senator john kennedy senator your reaction if you would well um i guess from one perspective i agree with what you said pete this is america and you're entitled to sure to believe what you want what i find curious is why so many of the social media platforms will allow that but won't allow other things um in term and i'm talking of course about censorship um you know what social media is no longer a level playing field i'm not sure it ever was but what we're allowed to see and what we're allowed to say on social media is being censored and the people censoring it are the people who run social media and in many respects they have turned social media into a killing field for the truth well senator uh you're on to it this this video the reason we found it it was promoted on facebook watch without a label and how is this video not an example of say they love the word misinformation medical misinformation it since science facebook has decided to be arbiter of truth and science why wouldn't they look at this video and say uh it doesn't pass muster well yeah i think that's the problem i mean i don't have a problem if somebody wants to put a video like that on on social media i'm going to watch it i won't watch it but what does bother me is the fact that the people who run social media are controlling what we're allowed to see see and what we're allowed to say now the people who run social media are very smart i'll give them that so was the unabomber the people who run social media say in terms of their censorship that they're being fair and objective and impartial and if you believe that you'll never own your own home if you believe that you're like a rock only dumber i think it's just the fact that the people who run social media or in my opinion this is america nauseously woke and and i i trust them like i trust bill cosby as the bartender um now they're entitled to have their political beliefs don't misunderstand sure but given the status of social media the fact that it has penetrated virtues at virtually every aspect of our lives given the status of the social media and for legal theories i'll go into if you want when these people who run social media act on their political beliefs in their censorship they're violating well-settled federal law and the united states constitution that's my point i'm okay if they take the position look we're not going to censor anything with that that's it i i this video can run anywhere as far as i'm concerned without a label as long as if i run a video about hydroxycork when that could run too like it's it seems so easy but of course their woke lens prevents them from that view it's it's the censorship it's the censorship if they want to run a video of a rooster laying eggs or allegedly laying eggs i'm cool with that too that's not the point you're entitled to believe what you want and you can post what you want but the the the head of social media because their political beliefs should not be allowed to say you can see this but you can't see that that's right i just hate to see a good latch go to waste senator thank you very much i appreciate it you bet you got it

hey I'm out here with Nick Sims from the Corps of Engineers and we're at the Comey diversion construction site right now to remind you the Comey diversion is a project is about half a billion dollars it's going to dig a channel approximately 12 miles from the comet River over to the west to the Mississippi River um so so Nick right now we're about a we're about a mile to the West uh of the commute river is that is that right that's correct we're about a mile from the Comey and what you're looking at right here is channel segment four and this is about a one and a half mile segment of that 12 mile channel that you mentioned as you can see a lot of construction going on here we've got the riprap down the Channel Side so a lot of good work going on right so you said that this section is one and a half miles and obviously we can see it's under construction but this isn't the only segment that's underway right now that's under construction right now correct we've got multiple other segments under construction uh Channel segment two is under construction right now we've actually got a lot of bridges under construction also you can see right down here is the McHugh row bridge and these Bridges have to be constructed because as you see we are digging a channel right here and we've got to keep that traffic flowing so we've got a number of bridges that are being constructed like you said you can see the McCue row Bridge right back there so so to put in perspective uh a year two years ago this was all just solid land or a field so there was no channel here at all correct and to date there's been somewhere around 1.6 million cubic yards of material 1.6 cubic yards 1.6 million cubic yards of material removed that's correct and you can see a lot of that spoil here on the sides of the channel what we're doing is digging it up and putting it placing it on the side so a lot of dirt being moved 1.6 million cubic yards and a lot more to call and so to put that in perspective 1.6 million cubic yards we're uh we're we're probably past maybe one third of the overall excavation yep I'd say we're at about 40 right now yeah so so put that in perspective 40 of the excavation this was a field none of this was here um and so pretty amazing what's going on we were earlier went and looked at where Cypress Bayou comes in and ties in now we're near whites Bayou where it comes in um and so how is all that how's all that water that's going to be draining from north of here how does that work when it hits yep so we're actually building what we're calling drop structures and we've got the bayous to the north we're going to go in and clear and snag those bayous help with the local drainage there and all that water will then be funneled into these drop structures and it'll make its way into this channel right here and so then it all goes over to the west to the Mississippi River it drains in there where there's excess capacity therefore helping to provide flood relief for all the parishes that drain through the Amite and the comet river which ultimately is everything pretty much south of Saint Francisville on the east side of the river correct yeah so so here we are half a billion dollars of your taxpayer money at work providing flood relief for East Baton Rouge Livingston and Ascension parishes

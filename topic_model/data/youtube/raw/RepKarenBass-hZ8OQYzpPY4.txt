[Music] state lawmakers about to consider a new bill to prevent 911 callers from making potentially harmful false accusations especially ones based on hate ab1775 is a commitment to everyone in this state that you can live your life without being threatened with deliberately false accusations that could result in bodily harm or death that's assembly member reggie jones sawyer of huntington beach he authored the bill he said those calls divert police resources from actual crimes joan sawyer is proposing harsher criminal penalties when that false accusation is based on racial religious gender or other types of discrimination in may a house judiciary subcommittee heard from survivors of the tulsa race massacre of 1921 where more than 300 black people were killed by a white mob the same subcommittee is also studying reparations for descendants of millions of slaves and recently advanced a bill that would create a commission to study the lingering effects of slavery do you think reparations will ever come to fruition no no well yes i do and i think that uh the question is whether that bill if and when it will be voted on the house floor we voted it out of committee we haven't had the debate our vote on the house floor and sending it over to the senate but what you're seeing is you're seeing states cities counties uh universities that are all looking at reparations right now i mean the tulsa massacre is case in point now there are just a couple of people alive today that experience that massacre but their descendants are alive and they still live in tulsa and the wealth that was robbed from that community that happened in the last century a part of the notion is we can't look back at slavery because it was so long ago um but the the uh the bill around reparations is just a bill to study the issue the issue has been demonized and trivialized to it essentially being african-americans that are looking for free money from the government and it's anything but that and so as our consciousness has grown for example in la county the county board of supervisors looking at bruce's beach you know a land that was stolen from african americans in los angeles that's a perfect example of what we need to do to rectify the um what has happened in our history whether it's local state or national joining us now is democratic senator alex padilla of california he previously served as the secretary of state of california and senator padilla in your role as secretary of state of course you're closer to the voting process than most senators have ever been what was what where do you believe the senate has to go now and and again let's be let's be honest about this this was a show for two democrats it was a show for joe manchin to prove to him what the republicans would do uh it was a show for senator cinema to prove to her what's really happening here we're going to have another show apparently on the john lewis possibly voting rights bill where the republicans will also block that and apparently some time after that senator merkley says then all 50 democrats will get together and really try to convince these two to come along to change the rule uh well lauren it's good to be back with you uh first of all let's talk about what happened today uh was it disappointing yes was it shocking no and it's certainly not over uh you know what we saw today was uh you know the american people saw one party stands up for fundamental voting rights for all americans and one is scared of a debate what are they scared of and the reason i say it's not shocking it's a you know look at how the year started with the deadly instruction of january 6th and just a few weeks ago by not supporting an independent bipartisan commission to get to the root cause of that republicans clearly walked away from the notion of a peaceful transition of power and now they're walking away from our fundamental right to vote so yes our democracy is on the line now we're going to go back in history for a moment to talk about the little rock nine this is a group of nine black school kids in 1957 during the civil rights movement movement their attendance at their high school in arkansas was the site of forced desegregation after the u.s supreme court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional three years earlier president dwight eisenhower federalized the arkansas national guard and sent them to in to escort the students into school it was a pivotal moment in our history and our serena sandoval shows us how this group influenced one politician right here at home serena this is a picture of jefferson thomas he was part of the little rock nine back in the 50s i'm serena sandoval in sacramento and i'll tell you why this picture means so much to one l.a legislator this picture is the reason why assembly member reggie jones sawyer shows up to work at the capitol each day this is the pole that they came and got my uncle at and these are the crowds in the background his uncle jefferson thomas was part of the little rock nine nine students who faced violent mobs in their fight to integrate an all-white high school in 1957. every day somebody would like to kick him spit on him do some of the most worst racially damaging things you could possibly do to a human being and every day he went back his uncle's high school years ended up changing the assembly member's whole life i was born when he went through that the reason we're in california is because the clan called my grandmother and said get your son out of school or your grandson will never make it to school that was me that grandson was me jones sawyer is a usc graduate and has completed a prestigious program at harvard university and to this day he uses his education to fight racial injustice i've been advocating that everybody at least one person every day do their best to end racism from this day forward he's chair of public safety and has been working on criminal justice reform since 2012. the assembly member says he was destined to do this work and after the death of george floyd he says he won't stop pushing until there's change i was born in the civil rights movement and i'm born for social change and now maybe it's the time maybe this is why i'm here my purpose it's not all culminated right now with all my expertise to finally get racism out of the criminal justice system he says now more than ever at least one person needs to stand up to end racism especially after what happened to floyd like those cops in minneapolis if just one of them had just grabbed that law enforcement officer off of that kid's top of that man's neck we wouldn't be where we are right now jones sawyer stays inspired by his uncle jefferson thomas one person who took a stand for his own rights wow thank you so much for that piece serena the civil rights act of 1957 was signed into law by president eisenhower aimed to provide federal protection for african-american voting rights while it had limited impact on voter participation the act did establish the u.s commission on civil rights and the department of justice civil rights division congress later passed a far more effective civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965. hello everyone hello hello hello congresswoman karen bass they want to welcome you to our virtual town hall with two of my very esteemed colleagues in the legislature one in sacramento and one in washington d.c so i am joined by senator alex padilla an assembly member reginald jones sawyer and i have to tell you i sure enjoyed seeing the news coverage of both of you that was a great story reggie i did know about your family but seeing it in that context was great and i have gotten used to seeing california's newest senator as a matter of fact i was just watching him on msnbc maybe about an hour ago so uh senator padilla i know that you're in washington because the senate is in session but we still have a another week and uh for both the senator and the assembly member you know i love doing town halls and i do look forward to the day that we do a town hall in person again and we think that we might be able to do that in um september or so i think by then we'll be able to safely figure out how to do an in-person town hall and when we are there i do want to invite the senator and the assembly member back especially uh senator padilla now we've known uh alex for a very long time but he's in a new brand new role much bigger role and so we are going to want to hear from him this evening and then assembly member reginald jones sawyer has played such a leading role in the legislature on criminal justice reform and we're going to look forward to hearing from him as well so i know you know the senator but i want to tell you a little bit about him um he was born and raised grew up in los angeles but did you know he graduated from mit with an engineering degree we've known him as an elected official for a long time but once upon a time he thought he was going to be an engineer and maybe figure out how to engineer the senate so that we can get voting rights and a whole lot of other things done well when i was in sacramento i went to sacramento in o5 and alex padilla who was the president of the city council and i remember when he got elected to city council i don't remember how old he was barely old enough to be an elected but i know he was the youngest person ever elected to the city council um well after he was up in the state senate uh for a while he ran to be california's secretary of state but i'm going to tell you something that i bet a lot of you uh don't realize about the senator and that is when you go to a restaurant and when you look at um your menu and on your menu you have the calories now i know most of the time i like to see it but you know if it's something i really want i kind of hate to see it but i think that was a monumental change toward making california healthy and i remember when he led that fight in sacramento and needless to say the restaurant association acted as though the um restaurants were going to all go out of business because of this but that was a change that i think has impacted all of our lives in a healthy way and i remember very well when he led that fight because it was quite controversial when he was in sacramento but then when he becomes the secretary of state he's in charge of voting for our state and it's one of those many reasons why we're so lucky that we live in california because we don't really have to deal with i mean i know there might be individual acts of voter suppression that we have to be concerned about but what we don't have to be concerned about is our state legislature passing crazy voter id laws nor do we have to worry about our secretary of state's office passing crater crazy voter id laws because if anything while uh padilla was secretary of state he expanded voting the first time ever mailing all of the ballots out uh in california so let me go on to reginald jones sawyer and i think i just received a note that said the senator is in budget negotiations okay and so he'll be joining us a little later uh so after that long introduction my good friend and colleague reginald jones sawyer and again i know people know reggie but i'm still remind you about his background and one of the reasons i'm doing this is because there's like over a thousand people on the zoom right now and so i might know him many people might know him but there are some that don't well i want you to know that the assembly member has had a lifelong history of public service i remember when he was the assistant deputy mayor for the city of los angeles i bet a lot of people didn't know that he was also the chair of la county small business commission the vice president of sciu labor background los angeles professional managers association and the statewide secretary of the california democratic party he holds a degree from usc go trojans and a certificate from the harvard kennedy school so he's been in the assembly for nearly nine years ready wow it goes by fast she does he's focused on many issues that are important to me and many people in the district numero uno is preventing and addressing homelessness the number one issue in our city disrupting the school-to-prison pipeline and helping people come home after incarceration and you know that all of those issues are interrelated and so that uh is having the assembly member play a very very important role well he has chaired the public safety committee for a long time and for the first time his senate counterpart is also chairing the public safety committee as two african americans chairing public safety so i hope that means that we're going to get a lot of criminal justice reform done reggie well i want you to know that today was an important day but i think i'm going to let him talk about senate bill 2 uh going through his committee and then today ab-89 both two very important bills i'm not going to go into details because i'm going to let him do that so assembly member reginald jones sawyer why don't you take it away tell us what's going on in sacramento and i am so glad the sacrament has all that money tell us how the people on this call are going to get some of that so i i i will tell you that um but let me just start with i've known both uh alex padilla and karen bass for a long time in fact i was their landlords at one time i was director of real estate for the city and i helped community coalition buy the building they're in right now and when alex padilla was president of the league of cities i evicted him so this is for young people be careful how you treat people as you're on your way up because they want to make one day they may be the most powerful person in congress and a junior us senator one day and so i uh i always kid alex about that but we've known one another for quite some time and worked together on quite a few things uh and when i got elected i was the first group to get 12 years and uh i remember talking to congresswoman um bass about when she was speaker of the california state assembly and they had no money matter of fact they didn't have a population they had nothing and she was she said i am so jealous because every day since i've been elected we've had nothing but surpluses and this year we have historic surpluses like over a hundred billion with a b in dollars in surpluses um you know the gov i have to interrupt you when i was there the budget of california was 120 billion and it was reduced to 83 billion dollars we had to cut 40 billion dollars out of the state budget okay reggie what's the statement you just said with the serp we had no surplus right we're over 200 billion dollars and that is because of the work that you did in making cuts and then when we came back uh governor uh governor brown made sure we didn't overspend and because of the cuts you made and the wisest you made were able to put like 30 billion dollars away in a rainy day fund think about what i just said 30 billion dollars in a rainy day fund just in case bad times come and we paid off the debts that was created during that time and it really was because we started smart budgeting and we started doing one-time monies instead of bloating the the budget with uh ongoing costs and that has done as well to this day and so uh what we're doing right now is almost like we're oprah winfrey you get a car you get a car you i mean it's it is it is unbelievable i can just tell you just in in in my district alone uh for example kedran which is a medical facility mental health facility which is in south l.a which has come on um not hard times but the buildings are dilapidated and so now we're getting we're i'm able to give them 30 million dollars to upgrade kedran mental health center so we can send the homeless there we can send people with mental health problems heck we may have seen law enforcement there with with mental health problems right there in our own neighborhood we don't talk about it enough uh reverend lawson who's a legend in the civil rights movement there's 15 million going to him to to rename the the labor center and do renovations for the ucla rape labor center and it's going to be named the reverend lawson labor center there's just so much that we're doing and in addition to the billions and billions of dollars that you mentioned for homelessness and so that people don't have to worry about the money we just have to be able to get it done it's really like i tell people it's not legislation it's implementation if anything has shown us anything is the amount of money that we're now pouring into homelessness and housing it's about being able to implement it much better than we have before and because it's not a question of money anymore well um reggie will you talk about i believe the governor made an announcement today about uh rent back rent um i don't know if you are aware of that but if mark would care what he actually said so if your rent and you can provide proof of that the pandemic really affected you adversely um we will help you pay your rent the state of california will provide coverage in addition we will also help landlords to get through this hard economic time with financial the state is allocated by 5.2 billion would it be uh to provide renters and landlords with payments uh to get them back on their feet this is an unprecedented act that was needed to put our state in really in full recovery mode uh in addition we extended the states and this is probably more important to your thousands of people who are listening or hundreds of people listening the stacey vixen moratorium has been extended to september 30th 2021 so during the summer and into the fall no one has to worry about getting infected during this time you know that is so important because oftentimes i mean and obviously we're concerned about all of the renters but i think sometimes we forget that most of the landlords are just small mom and pop landlords that's not a triplex or might have a duplex and so um their needs are really important sometimes landlords we make the assumption that it's big corporate entities and and it's not and so that is just tremendous well i see we have been joined by our senator senator i just told everybody all about your life a few minutes ago all of your accomplishments but you know what i reminded them of one of your accomplishments because i remember this so well back when you were a state senator long time ago uh and you did the menus you did the menus you remember everybody was so upset about that i thought it was great i do get mad at you though when there's something that i want to eat and then i see it's like a thousand calories but i think that was like a huge accomplishment for public health and so anyway i already introduced you so you just take it away you just came from budget negotiations tell us what's going on all right well thank you uh congressmember bass has been uh great to partner with you both in the legislature now we're both here in congress uh over the years and of course to see my friend reggie jones sawyer who i've known since in my days in city hall los angeles city hall uh great to be with both of you tonight and yes on that menu labeling that made me pretty unpopular with some of my friends and i got to remind a whole lot of constituents look i'm not telling you what you can or cannot order just making sure you have the information so an occasional splurge is okay but uh knowing that conditions like type 2 diabetes is especially prevalent in our communities you know we just need to be mindful of it trying to eat a little bit healthier get a little bit more exercise for the sake of our health and that of our families but uh you know it's uh so i don't have breaking news to report other than uh hold on this is a building suspense here we have a deal uh congresswoman you've heard anybody's been paying attention to this infrastructure negotiations news knows that a couple weeks ago uh on the senate side some of my democratic colleagues and republican colleagues about 20 22 in total announced an agreement on a bipartisan infrastructure deal and there's a lot good in that right a lot of roads and highways and broadband investment etc but uh we've known all along that uh that figure of 600 billion is not nearly enough to tackle all the needs of our nation whether it's in the uh the infrastructure transportation water systems etc but also the investment in families that president biden campaigned on and suggested when he announced the american jobs plan and the american families plan so uh senate democrats have gotten together at least the members of the budget committee together with leadership and we're going to have a 3.5 trillion dollar plan that we'll be announcing tomorrow uh so we'll share all the details tomorrow we take that 3.5 trillion together with the the bipartisan package of about 600 uh billion and it's going to be about 4.1 close to the number that the president first suggested on a comprehensive infrastructure what it really means we're investing in job not just in infrastructure but jobs in america and american families in a way that emphasizes inclusivity and equity right we know for uh far too often in our nation's history we've had these big bold investments in in programs and infrastructure and our communities have been left out we're going to be prioritized in this infrastructure plan in terms of where the projects are cited who gets the jobs and of course who disproportionately benefits when we're subsidizing child care or extending the earned the the child care tax credit you know when we're uh funding universal preschool all the kinds of things that we've been talking about and working towards and so it's not it's not at the finish line here tonight but i think it's a huge big step in setting in motion critical votes over the next uh month or so to get this done and you know the the the american rescue plan that we went on a few months ago was the stop gap emergency funding for governments for families for small business owners because of the coveted 19 pandemic this infrastructure plan is really to help boost our economy for years and years and decades ahead in a way that's inclusive like i said of all communities so uh sorry i'm late but it's for a good reason and you'll get a lot more information when we unveil the details tomorrow we are glad they're advocating on our behalf and we know you were and let me just tell you i mean i know it sounds like a ton of money a trillion dollars one of these days i'll figure out how many zeros go but uh but a whole lot exactly but you know one of the reasons why it's so important what the senator just described this because senator when i got there all we were doing just like sacramento was cutting i mean we had the sequestration that we all had to figure out and we watched over the years defense spending continued to rise even though it was supposed to be sequestered uh but yet when he went into spending for domestic things and for needs human needs family needs then all of a sudden we don't have the money and so the idea that we are going to put this bipartisan package together is really you know sweet justice because it's bringing us back to where we should be even though i know that some of our republican colleagues are painting it as though it's a waste of money they had no problem at all spending a trillion dollars when they were giving themselves tax cuts and i say themselves because i don't think the three of us on this call qualify in that tax bracket that benefited from those tax cuts so i appreciate that and alex you haven't been there very long and so tell everybody what committees are you on what are you working on yeah i appreciate that so uh for those who might have tracked uh the initial appointment announcement back at the the beginning of the year uh the you know good news for california when our own kamala harris was elected vice president of the united states that uh you know she had to formally vacate on january 20th when she was sworn in and so that created a vacancy and by state law uh the governor of california appointed her replacement and i had the tremendous honor of being named the new senator for california uh so i've been in this job for about six months uh and in that time yes assembling a staff and you know coming up to speed on a whole lot of issues but you know part of the role that we play is serving on key committees that helps us advance the agenda for california so i do sit on the homeland security committee and that helps you know deal with some real-time immigration issues cyber security issues those sorts of things i said on the judiciary committee so if you care about you know police reform and voting rights or immigration reform that's the committee of jurisdiction i also uh karen just got here but i already chair a subcommittee the subcommittee on immigration which is a big big deal and of course no no state has more interest in that than the state of california i serve on the environment and public works committee so you know all the talk that you've heard in california about addressing climate change environmental protection environmental justice and of course investing in things like public transit and things like that that's the committee that does a whole lot of that is a big part of this infrastructure negotiation from california's voice on that committee i'm a member of the rules committee uh that's the other one that deals with voting rights because it's jurisdiction over federal elections and so my prior experience as california secretary of state couldn't be more timely you know in california we have a good right you have multiple ways to register to vote online same day registration uh that sort of thing and multiple ways of being able to cast your ballot you can vote by mail you can vote in person you can vote early but that's not the case in every state you've heard the news about what's happening in georgia in arizona and now in texas and other places so i get to bring my elections experience to their in the rules committee in the united states and of course i'm on the budget committee so again just came from that budget committee uh negotiations to announce this uh democratic deal so i've been here six months i'm busy uh but all for good reason and let me also point out that you know you say you just came from the budget committee negotiations but it is 9 30 there but it's 9 30 there so uh anybody that thinks that you know life of a senator is kind of easy and and uh spectacular uh he's still at work he's still in his office and it's just 6 30 here well reginald how about your committees i know you're in public safety you care public safety but um tell us about those tell us about what's going on uh on public safety i'm really excited because as you mentioned earlier we have two african-american males that are charged of uh public safety on the senate and the assembly side there are very two important public safety bills that went through our past today out of public safety senate and public safety assembly one is the peace act that's the peace officer's education and age conditions for employment act where we're making the mandatory age that they have to be 21 because as as most women will tell you most men don't age until they're 30 but we settled on 21 and they have to have some kind of educational requirement and a a where they have critical thinking sociology psychology uh critical race theory so that when they go out into the field they're not just just an empty vessel we want to fill them and what we think is the new way of policing what did what did uh your colleagues say um clyburn uh we keep looking at these bad apples we need to look at the root of the tree this will change the root of the tree so that we bring in people that are better educated more mature and we found from research that college-educated law enforcement officers have the lowest amount of police violence than anyone else they do better grades when they get through and they're able to move through the system the other one which i'm really proud of that that came to my committee that i was able to shepherd through with senator steve bradford to decertify police right now a police officer can can can perform some kind of violence on someone leave the department go to another department and start working and doing the same kind of damage there we're not going to take away their license to be a police officer we do it for a long we do it for lawyers doctors we do it for everybody else but we don't do it for them it passed out of my committee today and it will go to appropriate into the floor this will you know in some ways i'm embarrassed for us as californians 46 other states already have decertification bills that have passed and laws that are in place think about this we're last we're supposed to be the leaders in public safety and so i'm glad that we're catching up but most important i'm glad that i have a partner on the other side that we can work together to change law enforcement permanently permanently into the kind of law enforcement that we all want uh and and stop talking about it let's actually do it and make a change well uh reggie i i have to tell you that i think i'm gonna have to make you come back to dc because i mean the things that you just described are in the george floyd justice and policing act and we actually have the peace act that's a part of the bill but our peace act is different it's it's really focusing training on de-escalation and you know you raise a good issue around age because i wonder if you look at officers who are younger than 25 where they fall in terms of exec except excessive force because one thing that we do know about the age of 25 is that the brain is developing until then an executive function which is your decision-making process um doesn't mature until later and you are impulsive before then and i just wonder if you do have more excessive force in the younger ages it would be an interesting thing to see we we do have data that show that but just just just anecdotally just look at it you give an 18 year old a badge a gun and a license to kill that doesn't make sense on any level whatsoever and so that's why you've got to raise the level the age the maturity level because that's i mean we got to look at law enforcement almost like doctors we we've got to stop going for quantity we need to go for quality and when i hear about law enforcement saying that these laws in california are forcing people to leave maybe we need them to leave because they don't want to do the new policing maybe they know the way that they're behaving the way that they've been been a law enforcement officer is not a peace officer i'm trying to create and we're trying to create california peace officers people that show up and de-escalate they want to keep peace they don't want to enforce we're not in african-american latino communities we don't want a force coming in to keep us under control it's about it's just a different way of policing and and i do have to say you said 18 and with the gun and it made me think of our military because we actually don't have a problem with that but you know it's time to begin to rethink some of these things and so you you talked about uh what we described in the george floyd justice and policing as a national registry you know tamir wright who was killed when he was 12 years old i guess he was so threatening at 12 he was a child well the officer that shot and killed him in ohio had just been fired a few months before and he was fired because he had a propensity for violence and was viewed as unstable and what happens in a lot of places i don't know if it happens in our city but it does happen in a lot of other cities where these officers just bounce from one department to the other and so the george floyd justice and policing act is over in alex's house and i know he's working hard trying to get the votes together and i've been working diligently with senator tim scott and senator corey booker and uh fingers crossed they will have a product by the end of the week so that when i get back there next week we can actually say do we have something to vote on it passed out of the house so a new bill that will be created in the senate that then will have to come back to the house so fingers crossed because frankly if we don't get it done before the end of july i think we're going to be in trouble because we will be in august recess and now the narrative is beginning crime is ticking up as it does in cycles and so now some people are saying well we shouldn't do police reform because the reason why crime is ticking up is because we've tied the hands of police which of course is completely false senator a number of people in preparation for this call wanted to know about voting rights and what better person to ask than the former alex padilla who did amazing work in his time and talking about democratizing elections i mean sending ballots to everyone that was done as one of your last acts as secretary of state if i'm if i'm not mistaken and again i think and unless you agree mr former secretary current senator in california we don't really have to worry about voter suppression i know we do in isolated pockets but in terms of our state leaders and all you know i mean you guys don't have crazy voter suppression laws in sacramento that would probably even ever see the light of day so maybe you could talk a little bit about uh voting rights the idea that hopefully you will vote on it in the senate where we are and where we stand in california right now appreciate the question it's it's personal to me as you said i was california secretary of state so uh no uh reggie jones sawyer and his colleagues did not have to walk out of the capitol to break quorum to keep bad things from happening uh that's you know it sounds funny but that's what's really happening in the state of texas right now because they want to uh just one small example among other things that they want to do to make it harder for eligible people to vote ban drive through voting not that everybody takes advantage of it but voters with disabilities rely on that when they're you know going to the polls to cast their ballot or to drop off their ballot and it just uh is an example how cynical uh voter suppression uh and how extreme voter suppression efforts are not just in texas but in so many other states so it's really sort of a good news bad news answer i have for you karen in california the good news is we leave the nation both on election security and access to the ballot uh right voter fraud is extremely rare uh every study every investigation every commission has demonstrated that and at the same time we give voters multiple options for how to uh how easily to register on paper form if you want online if you'd like you know automatic registration through the dmv or if you miss any deadlines that used to exist you can show up on election day or during early voting register and vote same day there's secure ways to do that california offers all those options for casting your ballot same thing you want to vote by mail that's that's become almost a default uh doesn't get more convenient no pressure of a line behind you at the polls and you feel like you have to hurry you do it at the comfort of your own home you can mail your ballot back you can drop it off in person you can drop it off at a county ballot dropbox you have all these options if only i could say that was the case in every state in the nation uh in a lot of state cities they're moving in that direction but in too many states you've heard the news georgia texas iowa alabama they're going backwards on voting rights and so i think this gets to the gist of your question what's happening not just in congress the house has already done its part right you passed hr one already to protect our fundamental right to vote has it passed the senate yet because of this i'm going to use the f word the filibuster you know the filibuster rule of the senate requires not a simple majority but a super majority to be able to pass laws so that's why this voting rights bill the john lewis voting rights act hasn't passed the senate the the for the people act hasn't passed the senate so as i've been saying uh since the beginning of the year look we either need to get rid of the filibuster which we know this is which we know over the years has been used to obstruct and it goes back to the jim crow era or at least we've got to carve out an exemption for laws that will protect our fundamental democracy our right to vote doesn't get more basic than that to be able to get that done with a simple majority because we have the majority and we need to make sure it means something our voting rights are under attack in state houses across the country and so uh congress needs to act we haven't done it yet uh but we're we're gonna have to uh find the pressure points to get this done uh soon because the 2022 elections will be here before we know it absolutely well thank you thank you so much for that and again we just are are very fortunate that we don't have some of the issues but you know i mean i do think in some areas like central california orange county i am concerned that there won't be ta that there will be tactics to intimidate voters at the polls one of the things that we promote before every election at least i used to when i was secretary of state is in california we went a further step you know all the things are common sense for us to be codified in state law you can google it there's a california voter's bill of rights right and statutes so it's enforceable by the attorney general or anybody else and included in that bill of rights is the right for a an eligible voter uh to cast their ballot free of any harassment or intimidation and i know that my my successor now secretary of state shirley weber is an equally passionate defender of that right to vote uh in their lead up to every single election the state sets up a a voter hotline i think i still remember the number it's only been about six months 1 800 345 votes so encourage any voter with any question any time of year frankly to call the secretary of state's office the elections division ask your questions report any issues report any problems uh they're ready there as they're standing by to you know look into any uh bad experience that you might have had uh and to initiate in the investigation if it's warranted thank you thank you thank you again we are very very lucky um reggie one of our constituents and we share constituents since our district's overlap uh has asked the 500 000 question the edd the employment development department what are we doing to fix it and then also maybe you can tell people how to access if you know i i know the announcement was just made so you might not know but but when the governor made the announcement about relief from for renters how do they actually get the money for their back rent so two questions edd and back rent if you know the answer for that uh you're muted you're muted reggie i believe i have staff on the line right now that can get you the number uh to for for the rental assistance and we'll do everything we can to make sure you you you get those numbers um as my grandmother used to say oh lord today when it comes to edd uh i think if edd may have been a problem when when you two were here yes and uh edd for for one let's just start with the technology they probably have the same technology that was here when you two were here in this senate and the assembly and so obviously technology as the mit grad will tell you changes almost every five years and so obviously we got to upgrade the technology we had that was probably put in in the 90s in addition um fraud was a was a significant um failure during this time and it really showed us covet showed us the the frailty of that system um when and this is where i came in when you find out that people who are incarcerated um that are in cdcr that are in prison were able to receive i think scott peterson who murdered his wife was able to receive an edd assistance check that tells you that we have a lot of work to do and one of the things i've noticed is you know systems sometimes work in silos especially in government but you never talk to one another and this is one of those cases where if they had just shared information they would have found out there was a problem almost immediately but in government we want to have our own thing and we're going to have our own silo and so assemblywoman um wendy carrillo is now over sub 4 which handles local hands state government and that department and she's vowed to start working with the new um uh secretary for edd to make those changes that are needed right now obviously we have the funding we can make sure that happens but she also wants to look at systemic problems within the department uh because quite frankly there's the morale is extremely low um they're they're overworked and and i think a lot of it is because they're not working smart and that's that's exactly what the assemblywoman has told me that she wants to go ahead and make those changes so that so that we don't have these problems um with with what's what's going on right now uh and so there's there's been additional staff that's been brought on to help us in the in the assembly uh we my friend my staff was handling more edd calls than doing assembly work you know what what people had to do it it was overwhelming but now because of her leadership we now have more staff so we can help make sure that that the the funding and the resources that edd provides get to people not only quicker but actually get to them some people have been waiting for for weeks at a time we're going to reduce those times over the summer so that eded is working the way it should be and i i honestly believe that uh the assembly woman uh probably won't rest until that gets done well you know um i do remember uh edd having major problems um when i was there and i remember from the speaker's office having to give edd money because they didn't have enough money to hire their workers so it's been a long term problem and we have to figure out what we're going to do long term well in a minute uh senator i'm going to ask you if you could talk about some more really good news the child tax credit that everybody is beginning to receive not everybody everybody that's eligible it will begin to receive a check soon but before i asked you to talk about that uh joel bellman is asking about the country's mental health system and i couldn't agree with you more he's basically raising the question that we have an important moment right now when we really should look to do what should have been done back in the 70s when we shut down the major mental health institutions we promised that we were going to be build a community based system we never did and so now what we have done in our country is we have basically by default decided to incarcerate people who are mentally ill and then i know after george floyd was shot and i was looking at officer involved deaths over the last year a huge number were police responding to mental health crisis and i don't think anybody goes into the academy to be a police officer with the idea in mind that they're going to come out and their primary responsibility is going to be rounding up people who are mentally ill and so in the george floyd justice and policing act that i am working on not to build it past the house but the bill that we're working on in the senate one of the things we want to include in that is several hundred million dollars into the department of health and human services for co-responders so that when a family member is in crisis instead of calling the police and then you have to sit there and pray that the police don't kill your family member that you actually call a social worker very similar to child welfare when the child welfare worker goes and removes a child from home it's not the police don't go in and and and descend upon the house the social worker goes in the police officer is there if needed but that's not who uh deals with the family but just think about this if we provided proper health care to people who were mentally ill they wouldn't deteriorated to a crisis period and so we do have an opportunity now we let our mental health system collapse in my opinion and kedran i love kedran but kedran there needs to be 20 kidrons around the city at a minimum we just don't have the capacity in our country right now so we absolutely have to rebuild it and another person uh in the chat asked about the international affairs budget i serve on foreign affairs and uh fortunately we are restoring the budgets that were cut under the trump years and we didn't even go along with president trump's uh uh budget cuts but you know what he did we would restore the money and then he just wouldn't spend it and so now we are trying to rebuild our international reputation and part of that is rebuilding our budget so senator can you talk to us about the child tax care credit and uh um talk about the fact that families have already should have started receiving checks sure sure and before i do that just a kudos to you for everything you said uh when it comes to mental health it's a personal passion of mine not just but especially because it's a personal passion for my wife angela she's a mental health uh advocate uh based on her family's experience she's got her own nonprofit foundation that helps with a lot of advocacy i won't go down the rabbit hole of parity and insurance and you know police officer training all those things but i will make a plug for overcoming stigma i mean get to the policy solutions and the prioritization of resources and programs for mental health we've got to talk about it more publicly it's it's you know mental health conditions but a whole gamut there's a whole spectrum and especially in communities of color we don't talk about it enough because it's we're feel full of the stigma or what are people going to say we got to shake that right it's uh reggie if i saw you walking around i saw you limping what would i tell you or what would you tell me if you saw me like what's wrong with you go get it checked out but when you know something's just a little off up here it should be the same thing it should be just as normal just as natural but we don't treat it that way so the more we talk about it the more we understand it i think the more we'll overcome that stigma but uh congresswoman you must have been reading my mind because as we were talking a minute ago i was googling it oh yes the good news is that come this thursday if you have filed a 2019 tax return or a 2020 tax return whether it's direct deposit or you get the check in the mail you will automatically get your child tax credit which was part of the american rescue plan which we we voted on uh several months ago so i believe i'm right about this for a family has a child under six it's three hundred dollars per month for every child six or under that you have uh children over six from six to eighteen it's 250 dollars a month of a child credit that you're automatically eligible for that you'll automatically start receiving this thursday if you file the 2019 or 2020 taxes if you haven't because you know some lower income families don't earn enough to have to file a tax return you can still sign up for it because you you're eligible go to irs.gov there's one of the buttons on that home screen is information on the child tax credit and you can sign up there uh to receive the benefit that you're eligible for if you have children uh and uh last but not least this is important because look we have diverse constituents right there's a lot of non-citizen parents with citizen children so you have a individual tax id number an itin is what uh people call it but you have eligible kids then you're eligible to receive that child tax credit but same thing if you have that tax return it's coming automatically if you haven't filed that tax return go to the irs.gov website and make sure you claim uh that money that's rightfully yours now you're on what i'm worried about uh here is that um and an assembly member is that people can get the checks and if they don't know that the checks are coming they might be afraid they might think that they've received something by mistake uh but to know that these checks are yours if you buy if you if you make under 24 000 ahead of household makes under eighteen thousand or a single filer under twelve thousand you are eligible for the child tax credit so that check that is coming in the mail is yours the other thing i worry about is that some people might have moved or they might have skipped filing for their taxes and so you know feel free to call the office and we can help you navigate that but we want to know that the child tax credit is a major advance we're going to be doing a lot of of education work around that we're going to be sending out letters we're going to send postcards to people that we believe are eligible so expect that check and you know what in a way we're looking at this in the future this is temporary we want it to be permanent and then it's really like social security but social security for children something that we are one of the few countries developed countries advanced countries that do not provide a number of resources in including universal health care the aca the affordable care act was a tremendous advance but it's still not universal uh or paid family leave you know there's a lot of benefits that developed countries in europe and asia and other places provide for their citizens and we should as well now a couple of people are concerned about vaccine hesitancy and i really wanted to address this because the vaccine is saving lives and i realize that the vaccine just like any other medicine you could take can have side effects there can be consequences but considering that hundreds of millions of people have taken this vaccine already it is i would consider it to be safe and i have to tell you that when it first came out i was not jumping to get the vaccine because i was concerned that it was political i was concerned that trump rushed it but then when i learned that this vaccine has actually been been in development for over a decade because although covet 19 is new it's called 19 because the virus was discovered in 2019 but a covet vaccine is a cousin to other i mean i'm sorry the covet virus is a virus is a cousin to other viruses that have been around for a long time and so i know that there are side effects i know that uh madera you know does not have the final fda approval but understand that hundreds of millions of people have taken this vaccine and also understand that the deaths and hospitalizations that are occurring now are from people who are not vaccinated so i just hope that people do not are not deterred by that and someone asked me if i support it with jean saksaraki i'm sure i mispronouncing her name said where she said she wanted to send out people to go door-to-door i absolutely support that not only do i support that and uh reggie and and alex we're going to be talking about this soon because we need to start going door-to-door and i know that there are communities that are doing community organizations that are doing that right now when i found out that the african-american population was had always been african-american latino asian and native americans have been disproportionately impacted by the virus but right now in la the african-american population the numbers for hospitalization and deaths are even more disproportionate than they were before and so to me whatever it takes to get that message out there when i go to the grocery store i always talk to the clerks i talk to people on the street and ask them about it so i am concerned if people are waiting for the perfect situation because frankly you could take just about any prescribed medicine or any over-the-counter medicine and there are also side effects and consequences that's why every time a medicine is advertised on tv at the end of it they tell you 400 things that you could die from from taking you should know because i worked in the medical field for a long time that's a legal announcement they're doing that to protect themselves from lawsuits not because if you take a medicine for psoriasis or whatever that you're going to drop dead after you take uh the medicine so i just hope that people are not hesitant that people will get the vaccine because we have been dying i i i thank you uh congressman for sharing that and i want to echo all that the only way to get past the pandemic and to fully reopen the economy uh is when more and more people do get vaccinated a couple reasons why some people have been hesitant number one as you said they get bad information about whether or not it works whether or not it's safe yes it works yes it's safe especially in in spanish languages a lot of disinformation uh on social media especially so go to the source if you've ever talked to a doctor or a nurse or even the pharmacist at uh you know at you know cvs walgreens even at the grocery store those pharmacies and grocery stores trust a medical expert when it comes to the vaccine number two you do not need to have health insurance to get a vaccine uh it it and it's free some people think well you know how much they're gonna charge me or am i gonna get billed later vaccines are free it doesn't matter if you have health insurance we hope you have health insurance but even if you don't you are eligible for the vaccine and if there's non-citizens monitoring this town hall you will not be asked for citizenship papers or proof of status or anything this is a public health concern every uh not even every adult every child 14 years and older 12 years and older is eligible for the vaccine so there's no excuse um you know and yes we're coming to the neighborhoods once upon a time you know maybe you you couldn't get to dodger stadium and that was the biggest vaccination site in america but that's okay that's why neighborhood pharmacies community health centers door-to-door if we have to los angeles county has mobile units that come to different communities over time we need as many people vaccinated as possible i got mine back in january you know my wife is vaccinated my dad is vaccinated my mother's law is vaccinated that's why we're able to get together again and give each other a hug because we're vaccinated the other thing i want us to learn from history uh i know we all got vaccinated because we had to get vaccinated before we could go to school so we wouldn't spread measles mumps smallpox polio i don't even know if i i don't know anybody that i went to school with that had any of that and i was because everyone got vaccinated we basically eliminated polio you'd have to talk to a grandparent to understand how scary polio was back in the day and because of vaccinations we don't have to worry about 10 20 different things you can get right now that should be the proof why you need to do this right now because it's always been proven already been proven that when you get vaccinated everyone everyone is um is safe and there hasn't been to talk about how do you make it mandatory at the work site uh here in the capitol what can we do to force the issue that have people get vaccinated because it's a public health issue it's not i know it's you know hipaa and i know you know that better than anybody else a congresswoman but at the end of the day it is a public health crisis absolutely and uh i do not believe that people should be uh forced to take the shot but um but i do think in some situations it should be mandated now what mandated means is that if you don't want to take the shot then just don't go in don't go to the event or don't go you know to the situation but let me just say uh one um i know one uh constituent is raising that there might be uh other alternatives for treatment of covet there are definitely uh treatments for covet but treatments in lieu of vaccinations if you have a treatment it's because you have covet i want to take a vaccination so that i don't get covet but let me just say that this has been an amazing hour i hope that we do this again assembly member and senator but you know what the next time let's make it in person okay let's make it in person we can have one of those rowdy town halls that i often do that i think are are a lot of fun but why don't i let the uh senator give us some closing comments then we will hear from the assembly member all right well uh thank you uh congressman again for organizing us and uh convening us and uh my again my apologies uh for being a little bit late but for good reason because we got some good news coming out uh everybody who's uh tuned in today or is watching a replay on facebook or some other platform i hope the information here has been uh helpful uh to all of you so until we meet again please uh contact our offices if we can help with additional information or any uh constituent services uh on the covet front again if you've been vaccinated already thank you so much uh you've been a leader for your family and for the community if you haven't been vaccinated please please please make your appointment get vaccinated as soon as you can and thank you for your support of us as we advocate for you know congress to act to invest in our communities uh we we did the american rescue plan and we saw the impact of all that direct assistance to working families to small businesses state and local government schools are reopening the economy is reopening now we've got to invest in our own future we talk about this infrastructure we need to invest in you know roads and bridges and our water systems and all that but also in families to put ourselves in a much better position to succeed economically making sure every community participates in an economic recovery uh that's the the infrastructure deal that we're getting ready to announce and uh uh we just uh you know getting keep advocating on behalf of uh you know not just our districts and the state of california was good for the country uh for uh the years ahead so thank you again and uh can't wait to the next one in person absolutely assembly member yes and i i hope we are able to do this not only in person but to have it recorded i i think the public needs to see us together needs to see how we work together see how we are like-minded and how we want to make sure that california is taking care of the federal and state level um i think sometimes they think we're in silos and they don't think we talk but also i think what was proven here is uh we can share ideas and we we probably when we get off here go oh the congresswoman is working on something i can get information from her to make my bills better and vice versa and then the senator can say oh you're doing that then i can then take the baton and run with it on the senate side and i think for the for the public they need to see more of that and i'm not trying to bag on your side but i know it's a little dysfunctional sometimes uh in congress in the senate um but they need i think the public really do need to see us working together um and talking and things out on a variety but most important we gave a lot of information today i mean a lot of good information to a lot of different people on various um different subjects and so i think i mean i would love for us to be on tv i think we could take this on the road and uh make make california better and so uh i definitely want to want to continue these conversations because i think it benefits everybody so thank you for for putting this together well i'm going to take you on the road so you can tell people that police reform is really not that scary and that we should get it done i want to thank everybody for uh attending for participating in this zoom call with us and as i said we will see you again soon and the next time we'll be in person be well be safe out there look for that check talk to your friends your family members let them know that that check belongs to you it's the beginning of social security for children and i hope to see you all soon thank you so much thank you everybody thank you

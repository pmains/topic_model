can tell us a bit more um about what's going on today and what we should expect well thank you mia forever staff person for that wonderful introduction and welcome to all the panelists i thank you so much for taking the time uh with us this evening and thank you uh to everyone listening and everyone who will listen because they will be able to listen after this is taped also uh good evening i am congresswoman robin kelly and i have the honor of representing the second congressional district of illinois and my district extends from the tip of hyde park through the southeast side of chicago extending into the south suburbs and further south to kankakee as vice chair of the energy and commerce committee and chair of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i work with my colleagues to address the glaring racial inequities in health care i'm so glad that you could join me in our highly esteemed panel for my covet 19 town hall on vaccine safety and benefits we've been battling cobit 19 the pandemic for nearly a year now and it's been a trying time for all of us like many of you watching this event i too have been impacted by covet 19 i've lost a couple of family members of this disease last year so far over 27 million americans have been diagnosed with cobit 19 and nearly half a million americans have died from this disease despite those staggering statistics we're starting to see a glimmer of hope we now have two fda approved probit 19 vaccines being administered with several additional vaccines being tested and reviewed for safety and efficacy as you may know i've received both doses of the pfizer vaccine i've had no after effects and i'm feeling fine and i'm a chicken and it didn't even hurt so i really want to ensure you that my my constituents i want you to have factual information so that you can make informed decisions on whether to take the vaccine or not i know that many in our communities have trust issues and hesitancy toward the vaccine but i believe that when you hear the facts you will want to receive this vaccine in fact we did a little survey uh from our office and got about 400 returns and i'm happy to say that most people about 75 said they would take the vaccine they just have a hard time signing up and getting the vaccine but for those who are still hesitant they talk about they've never taken a flu shot or they don't take the flu shot another 78 of those that don't want to take it talk about the fear of trust but they did say that they trust their doctor and like we all do they trust dr fauci and for them to take the vaccine they just want more information on long-term effects and uh and safety data so for our panelists those are just some good things to know so for the next hour we'll have national and local health experts help educate us about covet 19 the importance of taking the vaccine and where you can get the vaccine and before i turn it back over to our wonderful um uh moderator mia keys i just wanted to say one more thing we have gotten so many phone calls about the issues going on with the post office i just want you to know that i'm aware of what's going on i've been affected like so many of you and the illinois delegation is working together we've sent a letter to president biden and i'm also on the oversight committee as may has talked about so the post office is under us we've had hearings of the last congress and we will have more hearings and we there are many letters going to the president uh one thing that he will have to do quickly is replace the people on the post office board and when he does that then they can get rid of the leadership that the former administration picked which made some changes and slowed up mail and those kind of things and i know the post office uh in the chicagoland area they will be hiring more people soon and then the other thing uh just to help them uh you know the weather has not helped them so as much as we can even clear our path so they can deliver more mail or as much mail as possible that would be great too so i just wanted you to know i hear you um and and we are taking action to hopefully in the near future speed up the mail so thank you so after that or right now i'll turn it over to our moderator mia keys and thank you so much for agreeing to be the moderator thank you so much anything for you congresswoman for sure and i appreciate also your mention of the post office you know particularly from a medical standpoint we rely on you know on post delivery of really very critical medicines and and drugs and such like that and so that's that is relevant also to today's conversation so i appreciate you offering that i also failed to mention that i'm i used to work for the congresswoman but currently i worked for the american medical association as the center for health equity director of of health equity policy and advocacy and i couldn't have been able to really think about um the the equivalent equitable bend um had it not been for my time under the congresswoman's tutelage and so i appreciate everything that you you've done congresswoman in in the ways that you continue to teach um and also your network you have such a strong network which is clearly um visible to us here with our with our illustrious panel who i i just can't wait to dig into in terms of you all helping us today to think through some of the issues around cobra 19 and and especially with respect to the vaccines distribution um concerns as the congresswoman mentioned around around trustworthiness of institutions and and so on and so forth and so without further ado i'd like to just introduce our panel so first and foremost or at least at least in terms of of on across my screen we have with us dr gary gibbons who joins us as the director of the national um heart lung and blood institute at the national institutes of health and we really appreciated you being here with us today dr gibbons we look forward to you helping us to understand nih's role we've been we've been hearing a lot about about other federal institutions um with across the the pandemics or um existence and so it's really significant today that we can talk through why the nih is is so significant to this conversation and to the to the health of those who are benefiting from the from the vaccine we also have with us dr angel lee thank you very much dr lee for joining us she joins us today as an infectious disease specialist and of course it goes without saying we cannot have a conversation about coca-19 without talking about and talking with someone who's able to walk us expertly through the significance of of infection and and why the coca-19 vaccine is so very unique compared to other infectious diseases we also have with us a long time um colleague and ally of congresswoman kelly's office doctor show rocker whitaker who by training is an internist she joins us today in her capacity of as ceo of complete care management partners llc um out of chicago and so we're really excited for you to be here thank you very much dr record whitaker for joining and last but certainly not least to to help bring us more into a local perspective and we have with us dr armal tokars who is is a is a really mid mid-year mid pandemic hire as as as assistant director of the illinois department of public health and so come in and to do that work at such a high stakes time um it goes without saying just how just how uh how much of an addition you have been to to that office and we look forward to hearing from you dr tokar thank you so i want to just give you all time to briefly um briefly tell us a little bit about yourself your your your current work your your background and why that's relevant so if you could just take about 90 seconds or so between between all four of you to give us a little bit of that we'll start with you please dr gibbons you're on me there say you're saying after being on zoom calls all day uh you you think we we we pick it up it's a long day uh but uh it's my pleasure to be here particularly at the request of congresswoman kelly uh i'm the director of the national heart lung and blood institute part of the national institutes of health largest biomedical research agency in the world and it's been directed by dr francis collins you're all familiar with our colleague and friend tony fauci and our institute has been involved in the nih response to the kova 19 pandemic clearly a key part of our mission is discovery science and discovery science is really the bedrock of developing new drugs and therapeutics and vaccines to address treat prevent and eventually crush this pandemic and so therefore the entire apparatus of our research enterprise has been focused on developing the effective treatments and therapeutics in this space over the last year in addition i've been charged to lead an nih response called the seal program the community engaged alliance against covet 19 disparities that was developed as a in response to addressing the clear inequities that were laid bare by this pandemic and this virus and developing a community-engaged response particularly in communities of color that address those disparities and so that's why i'm delighted to be here clearly as a cardiologist a non-infectious disease expert we recognize this virus affects the lung the heart the blood systems and that's part of our portfolio and that's why we're playing a key role thank you thank you very much dr givens that was really quite vivid and it helps to level set our conversation i want to hear from dr lee dr tell us tell us a bit more about your work and as an infectious disease specialist and what you're able to help us to consider today well as an infectious disease specialist my biggest goal right now is really more of a grassroots effort it is to educate it is to make sure that peoples of color especially the brown black communities and disenfranchised communities understand what this disease is doing within its communities and addressing any issues getting barriers breaking through any obstacles that uh prevent them from receiving the proper medical care and making sure that they get the vaccine thank you dr leek dr record whitaker uh thank you mia i'm an internist and actually i spend most of my time now as a ceo complete care partners management partners loc we do work in the community for health plans who are looking to find the highest risk folks and get them connected to care so we're we're building in to our work uh although it's not required um a kind of a covet 19 um kind of question wellness question or two and we're helping our members try to figure out when they can get vaccinated and where they can go one of the biggest things that i'm finding is that people want the vaccine but they don't know where to go so it sounds like the city of chicago and the state and the county are rolling out various sites but no one knows where they are and maybe that's intentional they're going after sort of micro sets of people but i know lots of people who want the vaccine so i'm very encouraged that the problem i'm seeing right now is that there's not enough vaccine number one number two if there is vaccine out there people don't know where to go and they they really want to go give an example 69th and king drive on saturday i got a text at 2 30. hey they got a few doses left you get it by 4 o'clock you can get a dose well everybody i knew people were like well i can't get over there as fast enough but one guy did he's in his late 50s he's living with one chronic condition a retired uh chicago police person he got over there and got his vaccine so i got one person in but it was more like a hey it's over here and so people is sort of like where's waldo right now in our community because we're using the cvs and walgreens as a major distributions point but many of those closed in our community so if that's going to be a key place we're going miss opportunities to be vaccinated so what i'm looking for is more equity in distribution uh opera sites and so that people have more opportunity to get the vaccine and more communication about where the vaccine is so just excited that my biggest issue is finding enough vaccine that's a good problem and we're going to dig into that good problem thank you for that dr record whitaker and dr tokars who's joined us here on the phone today we appreciate you oh you're so welcome so can you hear me clearly very we sure can okay so as you mentioned i came to um the state health department just this summer in the pandemic i am not a physician i am a public health professional and prior to that i was leading county public health policy and infrastructure building in public health for a number of years my clinical background is in mental health and so i am often thinking about the intersection between the kind of duress that this disease has brought to our society and the many other kinds of duress that the pandemic has brought as well so these are things that i pay attention to a lot i also am always very interested in the way that we build our civil society together as one that would nurture for all which has been alluded to in a number of ways and in this conversation thus far and so everything that we do can work towards that if that is our intention so i'll close there i know we have a lot to do this evening i'm so glad and grateful that you mentioned the mental health and behavioral health part we're going to make sure to come back to that especially because we know that you're with us for a limited time so if for whatever reason i do not paying you to talk about that please insert that into somewhere into your into your uh your remarks but i want to i want to just back up a little and and just go back to you dr gibbons and then you know i don't want to assume that everyone listening knows the intricacies of coven 19 in terms of what the virus is how we got how how it got to pandemic proportion so i'm wondering if you can give us a bit of that and then segway into what the vaccine does what it is and and how it was developed okay um i'll start off maybe dr leake will add in but this is a virus a particular kind of a novel coronavirus that is spread basically in the small sort of tiny droplets that are expelled every time we speak or sing and that's how it spreads from person to person and it can attack the lungs the heart the blood systems and the various major organs uh and produce uh a devastating particularly pneumonia that then can spread and affect multiple organs to the point of of failure where your kidneys shut down uh your your heart can stop pumping uh you need a ventilator to help you breathe and so uh the the severe complications of covet 19 are devastating and that's why it's probably at least 10-fold more uh virulent and deadly than a flu so uh to speak plainly to your audience this is no virus to play with uh it has devastating consequences and it's hit the communities of color in a devastating way with higher case rates two to three fold higher hospitalizations again three to four fold in communities of color and and unfortunately death rates in fact the life expectancy of black americans dropped by three years in 2020 that's how devastating this has been for communities of color so this is a virus that is having a global impact and particularly disproportionately affecting communities of color african american latino american indians in particular the best ways to fight this virus is to prevent it uh from coming in and infecting our bodies the best way that's done is through vaccines vaccines work by training your body's own defense system its immune system to really fight the virus this is a new virus and so most people had not been exposed before and so our body's defenses were not that buttressed and strong to to defeat it particularly amongst our elderly and that's where it's been so devastating in in fatality uh for elderly people who've never seen this virus before so the vaccine the treatment in essence exposes our body's immune system kind of teaches it trains it to recognize the virus and so vaccines work by taking a piece of the virus and uh exposing it to the immune system uh if you will this coronavirus it's called that because as these spikes almost like a crown like a king and those proteins in the spike uh proteins are what the vaccines have developed it's only the part of the virus not the whole virus just a part of the virus and the vaccine by exposing the the body to that piece of the virus trains the virus to wreck the change the body to recognize the virus and destroy it eliminate it from the body that's how the vaccines protect us from developing symptomatic covet and certainly preventing hospitalizations death and mild to moderate covet so all the trials that have been done throughout the world involving tens of thousands of people participating in those trials have proven that if you get vaccinated you then teach your immune system to fight off the virus ward it off those people are much less likely to develop covet and require and get sick at all and up to between 70 to up to 95 effective and in a very safe way and so really vaccines are critical part of of crushing this pandemic a pause there that's that is so helpful for helping us to to set i want to i want to go to dr lee to for a follow-up question um with respect to the technology of of the vaccines but i know we're also going to be losing dr tokars in just a little bit so i just want to pivot a little bit but dr leek i'm going to come back to you to expand on on well to expound on what dr gibbons has mentioned dr tokar's you know so you you're you're you've just come in during you know the height of the pandemic really and so there's a lot that you've seen um with respect to who's being um impacted um and then now there's a lot that you're preparing for in terms of the rollout of the vaccine i'm wondering can you talk to us about you know who's able to get vaccinated currently in illinois especially given who dr givens has mentioned has is the most vulnerable among us yes um i'll say uh briefly but that's one of the most important questions that people often ask about so the uh individuals that are eligible are first of all all our medical professionals and all persons that are residing in nursing homes along with the staff that work there now in illinois we also decided early on because we had many vulnerable populations in other kinds of congregate care and residential programming that with severe disability many different kinds of disabilities so we also included all of those precious persons and the staff that work with them also the advisory committee on immunization practices has cited a number of frontline very specific professions we have aligned with that and we have not added or taken away of any of those that are in 1b what we have done is we have looked at the age so the age originally was going to be 75. we um in december early on looked at the age of 65 and older because when we looked specifically at who passed on because of covid in illinois and what ages they died and what race they were this is what we saw we saw that many latino persons were passing on from covet in their 60s and many black persons were passing on from covid in their 70s so as it was mentioned previously by one of my colleagues that elders were the most likely to have an adverse outcome from covet and pass on not only did we want to address our elders but also address those racial disparities that we saw within that um also we wanted to add persons that are experiencing homelessness or are in a shelter any kind of a shelter or day program or sheltered workshop or psychosocial rehab we wanted to make sure that those persons were also getting vaccinated early there are also a number of medical conditions associated in the literature and mentioned as definitely associated with adverse outcome by our asip committee so those medical conditions are also going to be eligible starting on the 25th to be able to um apply it slots at pharmacy along with persons with disabilities that are not already covered but this is also what i want to say and this is one of the most important things to say there is limited supply i say that out of consideration and reverence so that people don't have fear when they're looking and they will know that this infrastructure is there we have these providers that are ready and it's nobody's fault our federal partners are giving us the vaccine not late they're giving it to us as soon as it's prepared and these vaccines are being prepared in the time that is proper for them to be safely prepared so we are getting the vaccine um as quickly as is reasonably possible and every state is doing this and so people will have to uh you know look for an opening more than once and our federal partners are telling us that we will be getting more vaccine and we believe that to be true so we've got beautiful partners in the community all over illinois doing a wonderful job we are moving vaccine quite quickly as we get it but we are really limited in our supply and i think that's very important to say and related to mental health communicating crisply and clearly that the supply is limited now but we expect there to be more is very very helpful so that people don't believe that they are getting left out and know that there will be enough for all of us and that when our turn comes we want everybody to say yes and step forward for that vaccine as the congresswoman has said she went through that and she is feeling just fine now and you will all know people that receive the vaccine and are doing well ask them about it so that when your turn comes you will say yes as well so i know i have to close with that and i have to i have to leave momentarily in just a moment i hope i answered that question for you well you you really did and i appreciate you offering the answer at you know at intersectional junctures you talked about vulnerability in terms of age in terms of race ethnicity can you talk to us before you leave a little bit about what people living in rural areas downstate illinois on the countryside what some what are some considerations for them in terms of um accessing the the vaccine and and some challenges that they might face right now and how can we be helpful in helping them think through navigating all of that okay the largest challenge that everybody faces is limits of limited supply and that really affects their ability to get into a clinic and find a clinic so um the first thing that i want to say is if you look on our website most people are finding out locally but i think it's also helpful to look at we have a website that says coronavirus.illinois.gov and on that website there are all the sites of providers there is all the information on eligibility there is a lot of data because we also want people to pay attention to still protecting themselves from covet there's so much more to do that we will need to continue to do to keep safe public health practices to protect ourselves from covid and there's also a lot of information about testing which is also still very important but on a map where it gives locations there's a like a red teardrop and these teardrops will point to the precise address of a current provider not a future provider because there will be more future providers but these are current providers so individuals can look in their own vicinity and then they can call that provider or get on that provider's website now you will see a concentration of teardrops in suburban cook a concentration of teardrops in the east st louis area and also in the southern tip of illinois because these are areas of that individuals have not been able to always access equitable quality health care for all kinds of things so we really want to make sure that there is plenty of access we are speaking to providers about a number of things to help make things easier for individuals first there is a digital divide and even though it's so wonderful the providers are having people register from the comfort of their living room and have that secure spot for themselves so they can go calmly and safely to their vaccination appointment we also need people to be able to when they do not have a computer or do not have a smartphone be able to call and be able to do it that way so we're also talking with providers about that there are also lots of difficulty for individuals that have a difficult time just walking across parking lots for a number of reasons and so there are a number of providers that are also providing drive up options which will be very important for individuals we also are doing quite a bit of engagement at local churches for local groups that ask us but we are also initiating this engagement for groups to hear about what they need and helping them access in their very specific circumstances we also have mobile units that we are able to deploy uh to help in some of our rural areas and we have also stood up the national guard in some of these areas to really help assist in providing vaccine on large scale to individuals so those are a few things there is so much more to do um so much more to do but we are very pleased with the progress that our partners are making thus far i really appreciate all of that you're welcome i have to close with that but i so appreciate being with you and um feel free to get to reach back to me if you need to again thank you dr tokars and just to to reiterate for the audience the website that she mentioned is coronavirus.illinois.gov and hopefully we can link that in the in the chat feature so that you all can can take a look at that i want to go back to you dr leak and and and dr gibbons feel free to to jump in here um talk to us about you know you were telling us a bit about how the virus itself is set up and and therefore how the vaccine matches onto the virus the technology associated with all of that dr lee can you expound a little and tell us you know the difference between the the four most leading vaccines available right now the physical vaccine the montana vaccine and do people have a choice in terms of taking which one okay first i'm going to go back just a little bit and talk about the mrna vaccine this technology is not new so because we you know because of the pandemic and because it is the worldwide you know mass destruction that's caused we're thinking like oh this is a new thing no it's not we've seen this before we've seen it with mers we've seen it with sars and so at that time more than ten years ago they started creating this technology to actually answer those issues with merge and sars now because it kind of fell off a little bit and not everybody died you know kind of just lost interest in formulating it because it takes a lot of money to develop these vaccines mrna vaccine basically it's just the instructions to our cells to create a spike protein that is very similar to our sars kodi ii vaccine i was not the vaccine the actual uh the uh the virus itself and so when you have that and you develop proteins to it your body now sees that and then develops antibodies to that mrna piece there so when we look at the pfizer vaccine and we look at the moderna vaccine they are very similar they're very similar because they both use the mrna technology and with the pfizer being able to be taken and then secondary one being taken 21 days after and the modern one with 28 days after so once you have this mrna technology that then it starts to create an antibody response the reason why you take the first shot because it basically primes your antibodies it primes your immune system and so at that point you get about 50 coverage now when you go back 21 days later and 28 days later respectively with the pfizer and the modern vaccine it will then reach up to 95 for both of those vaccines we see some coming down the pipeline if i could just take this moment that everybody is excited about astrazeneca has one coming down the sideline and uh johnson and johnson has one now these two are using different shall i say uh directions their uber systems are different they use an adenovirus and so again just like with the mrna vaccines they are not using any live vaccine so nowhere at any moment in time is anybody who's receiving the vaccine receiving any live vaccine therefore it should not give you the response as i'm getting sick from coronavirus the interesting thing we're getting excited about with johnson and johnson is because it's a one-shot vaccine and when you look at the astrazeneca and the johnson johnson one it's really a lot has to do with how we are trying to store them our visor vaccine has to be ultra refrigerated or ultra freeze freeze and then you have the moderna which still has to be held at very very cold temperatures so how do we handle our patients who are in the rural areas let's talk about the appalachian let's talk about the mississippi delta let's talk about any rural areas of arizona how do we try to uh number one deliver these vaccines to those places would make it very hard to deliver the pfizer and the modernity to those areas so even though johnson johnson has a 70 75 coverage the fact is it's a one-time vaccine and then their shelf life lasts a lot longer than the other ones that we have now and that is particularly relevant to the congresswoman's district which she says all the time is urban suburban and rural right and so those rural areas in particular um for those of you who are listening and you live you know down state i hope that you're hearing beyond all the big words the mrna and antivirus and all of that and what and what dr leak is saying is that there are there are developments coming down the pike that are really top of top-of-the-line state-of-the-art and they're specifically designed um to to cover everyone who's eligible and able to take the vaccine and some will work um better in certain situations so we're grateful for for you breaking that down for us dr lee i'm wondering and and and i'm going to wrap back around to you in just a little bit dr gibbons but dr rocker whitaker you know so dr tokaz is talking to us about those who are particularly vulnerable um to to uh contracting for the 19 you know and as an internist you've seen um quite a lot and you mentioned earlier you know issues that people have with with just trying to consider access um you know to the vaccine itself but back up and talk to us a little bit about those who have had covet your experience with coca-19 patients you know what does it mean um for people on both extremes those who are really very vulnerable and they become sick and they're sick for a long time um what does it mean for them to be considering getting the vaccine and those who are healthy and never become sick and and all of that what should they be considered you know should they consider getting the vaccine can you help us think through that and you're on mute there there you go uh so my recommendation i'm with um kind of a lot of the national recommendations really everyone should consider getting the vaccine unless they're known to be allergic to some component of the vaccine right so that's really as far as i know dr leek and dr gibbons the only exclusion criteria that i've seen um you know if you had coveted um uh you know i heard you know the latest i heard was that there's what we think there's about six months of protection if you will or anybody's uh there but i don't know how much we actually really super know about that topic so i'm recommending folks whether you've had covet or not if you had covid you should get the vaccine and so many folks i know have gotten the vaccine who they've had covet and they've gotten the vaccine with no problem so the vaccine confers what i call sort of known immunity we kind of know what's going on in the body we're really just learning and we're following and tracking folks so what i tell people who say well i'm well and i've done well i haven't gotten covered i don't need the vaccine and plus i don't know a whole lot about this vaccine you know what do we know and i think dr gibbons both dr leaking gibbons pointed out that really over 75 000 people worldwide uh engaged in the trials to to determine that this vaccine was safe we knew it was efficacious we knew it worked but then was it safe and we spent uh there's thousands of people that have been involved in the trials and those people are doing well so we're still learning from those people and that will be on going right we will be checking on them for the foreseeable future to understand you know how much antibody is present and for how long so just know that all of that is being kind of studied carefully um and we say study it's this just a scientific term means we're monitoring and we're watching so you're not being studied right you're being monitored uh appropriately and watched as you would uh with with most things so i tell people whether you've had covid you didn't have covid you should get the vaccine i think dr gibbons pointed out there's a real difference in the mortality between the flu and covet 19. uh 50 000 people are so die a year from the flu over 500 000 have died and we're not barely a year into the epidemic so it's like a very high fatality factor like 10 times what we know about the flu and there's probably even more people who've died so i try to remind people that this is not just a flu i don't get a flu shot okay don't get the flu shot wait don't quote me on that okay i'm saying you know i'm not getting the flu shot i'm like okay but get the covet 19 vaccine i did have the vaccine i did experience a little bit of side effect i had some shaking chills i had a bit of a headache the next morning and i had felt fatigued i took a couple of ibuprofen i laid back down took a nap and when i woke up in the early afternoon after i got a bit i was fine i'm ready to get number two baby so i'm ready and i want to encourage everyone that this is the difference between really life and death and getting back to some kind of normalcy as you know it right so i go to a large church i told folks i said look you will never have trinity church again because if two thousand people show up and fifty percent of them aren't are aren't uh immunized we're having a super spreader event every sunday right so we want anything that we used to have where we gather together it's a big part of returning to that normalcy mia so i tell everyone to get it i'm a big fan of the vaccine looks like dr lee i wanted to add on to that i had a lot of patients initially who fought me on that idea they said well i already had the provide i have immunity to it i'm good i should be good and i try to give them the the analogy of such wear uh and i think all of us especially uh colors uh communities of black and brown understand uh back in the day and uh when we would have uh chicken pot parties i don't know if you guys remember that but remember when you always had a cousin who got chicken pox and someone else got chicken pox you went over their house because their family wanted you to expose yourself to it so you would develop basically antibodies so that when you got hit with a chicken box you'd be okay but what did we find out even though you're with the family members that had chicken pox later on the line you got it again and wondered why because you really didn't develop much of an immunity to it even though you had that first initial exposure so simply that's very similar to the coping uh exposure we're having some of those people who are asymptomatic and those who get it lightly and feel kind of achy and they stay at home yes you've been exposed to it but we don't know the level of immunity that you have built in your system and so just like that with the chickenpox uh exposures when we started having uh varicella vaccines what happened we started seeing less because we're able to get enough of a collective immunity up and we no longer see it so likewise that's what we're trying to attempt here with the covenant vaccine we're trying to get enough of a collective immunity what we call a herd immunity which is what we've identified to be over 70 to kind of downward trend what we see right now in terms of covet uh exposures and infections rapid fire questions for you dr leek before i bring in dr gibbons here if to your point about being vaccinated do you continue to social distance and where am i oh absolutely actually i think there was a representative from massachusetts he uh was uh vaccinated got both of them now i don't know the time frame after the second one but he received the second vaccination and he tested positive he had no symptoms whatsoever but what ends up happening he ends up going to another party to another event to another meeting and he's just spreading coveted without even knowing it he's fine but everybody else is getting sick because they they don't have any uh vaccinations i hope you all heard that clearly even if you've been vaccinated it doesn't mean that we stop the public health hygiene you keep up with the mass keep up with the social distancing because you can still be a spreader of the virus and for nothing else then wanting to keep your loved ones safe certainly continue to mask double mask all of that dr gibbons talk right exactly dr gibbons can you can you tell us a little so so there have been concerns a number of people have voiced concerns about the the speed at which the the vaccines were developed right now my argument is we live in the 21st century we should expect that certain things should be developed um world-class science should be developed you know in a speedy fashion but can you can you help walk us through that you know talk about the speed of which the vaccine was made what does that matter um in this conversation yeah no i think um uh this is really actually a testimony to advances in science and so um actually vaccines have been around for well over a century and you know many of us grew up uh getting vaccines and so in some ways uh it it's there are elements of it that are kind of an old technology if you will but as dr leakes eloquently uh pointed out earlier there have been advances in terms of how we make these vaccines compared to previous uh iterations and what we may have even experienced as a child getting our childhood vaccinations and a key part of that innovation was what we've developed in terms of the technologies of being able to manipulate dna the genetic code in this case of the virus itself and we had that technology to produce all kinds of drugs really now by engineering what protein we want to create and doing it basically in a test tube and so as again as dr leeks pointed out this isn't the first experience with this kind of family of viruses of coronavirus we had the mirrors and and and sars before that gave us clues about how to engineer uh these sort of vaccines uh in ways that use technologies that have now uh matured in a way that could be mobilized almost as soon as the sequence of this new virus of sars kobe 2 was was made available in uh last in december of of of 19 literally within a couple of months uh the teams were working to develop vaccines against it so that's where a lot of the quote-unquote speed comes but there were no shortcuts there were no steps skipped in terms of of being sure that it was either both safe and effective it still went through the various stages of testing to make sure that when it trained the immune system that the body responded with a robust uh response to those antibodies that fight the virus and neutralize it and get it out of the body and then as we pointed out tens of thousands uh have been studied over the course of the year that took a lot of mobilization of those trials indeed at nih we were monitoring and have been there still are monitoring each of those trials and and tracking the data to see okay how effective is it compared to just getting uh sort of salt water if you will and that's where we could see dramatic differences so this is unequivocal about how effective these agents are and as was pointed out studying safety but again streamlining the process such that we were already gearing up to produce the virus as we were testing it we were going to hold off until we really had the data that was safe and effective but that didn't stop them from learning how to manufacture and make as much as possible that's also shortened the time necessary to produce as much now it's not as fast as in producing a billion doses as we need and would like in the first several months but again even that's pretty remarkable these are not easy things to manufacture and produce and yet we're sitting here literally within a year of even knowing his virus existed and we've already vaccinated millions of people around the world that's incredible uh but again without shortcuts uh and not never uh curtailing or compromising safety or efficacy this is such a big issue and i imagine it takes a while for people to really wrap their hands around the the grandeur of this whole thing this is huge i mean we're still in a state of being we're recovering from the shock of of 2020 you know in terms of all the things that covetous has caused and i know dr tokar's is not on the call to to help us talk through some of the behavioral health related issues some of the mental health issues i'm wondering though if anyone would like to speak to to this idea of returning to a new normal or what it you know where we are as a people feel free to mention that um that's not a question it's more just you know i open the floor to speak to that yeah well i guess i would just throw out that uh unfortunately the the the number of overdoses uh the number of suicides um that that's also going on when i said the life expectancy for black people went down and this is something by three years that's not something that typically happens in epidemiology so the the devastation is is is widespread uh and its impact and and clearly they're from their elements of the isolation uh the stress um and particularly again in communities of color in the context of literally again an economic depression recession uh that uh has compounded it's almost a perfect storm of elements that have been brought together and so clearly there are implications also just mention that uh the their effects of this virus that we're still learning about in terms of not only affecting your lungs and your breathing and causing pneumonia attacking your heart system attacking your blood system but there's a fair amount of data that the brain and your neurological system is affected and we may get into it further in our dialogue but even recovering from this stressor of this disease many of your audience may be aware of something called long haulers or long covet it takes a while to actually recover so even though the virus is gone it's had an impact on your body and on your psyche that can have long-term effects and those also need to be addressed i'll pause there now i i want to just uh pile on uh gary to kind of what you you're saying the the other the other thing that uh so one the people say well if i get coveted it's mild and i'll be okay but but there's a reason that college sports and the nba and others uh you know create either created bubbles or stop games when their athletes were experiencing an outbreak they've seen um the echocardiograms the heart studies that show that there's decreased muscle function uh when someone's infected with covet so they want to end up with a bunch of athletes who has some kind of what we call kind of myocarditis is what doctors say but let's say heart inflammation that decreases heart function we don't want to end up with a bunch of folks like that because we don't know where that's going to go and like gary said we don't quite know understand a lot of the long-term impacts i heard numbers as high as 40 at one point but i'm sure that dr gibbons and those guys at the nih are going to be commissioning long-term studies prospective studies so we can follow people monitor their heart over time so we can get you remembered from that the other thing i want to say that we're going to run out of time and talk about guys but i did interact i didn't have anyone in my family died from covet but i knew a lot of people who did and i knew a lot of well-to-do people lawyers doctors i'm not talking about is everybody was impacted by this here's a story that i heard uh uh her cousin early on in the covet 19 kind of disaster let's say in the within the late first quarter she called the ambulance she was having trouble breathing the ambulance went to her house and said uh you got covered we we put you in our ambulance that woman stayed at home and she died okay she died people were going to the er and they were turned away because of whatever reason i'm going to call it a little bit of implicit bias like that's how racism works when folks are turned away there you can go to henry ford in detroit and you can see some of the stories there that were published about african-american people going home and dying after they were sent home so i feel like you know guys we're here now you got three african-american docs on the phone you got like a mia who's leading out of a national effort on these conversations god you can believe us right we've all had the vaccine the vaccine is safe we're telling you that the best of science is there but there's a real ugly side of this guys that i would like to see our community kind of come through shake away some of the sort of crazy things you guys are hearing because i i get some of the crazy things my family talks to me too and they watch a certain tv station that says a lot of crazy things i was like guys why are you watching that like watch this right so i just want to point that out that this has been crazy like for our community there's been implicit bias we've been turned away that drug that president trump got that anybody cocktail that he got that made him sort of get well faster than most would most of us didn't have access to that okay and we're still not going to have access to it so i want you to stay well the vaccine is our pathway to do that thank you for that i know we're coming up against the the last couple of minutes i'm wondering um you know i will say i will say this because you touch on something really important dr gibbons um in terms of the isolation part you know in terms of people in terms of suicide um increasing and we've already we'd already seen an uptick uh prior to 2020 for other other reasons you know but i'd be remiss if i didn't um mention that the congresswoman herself um her colleague who jamie raskin represented jamie raskin who represents parts of maryland um he's the co he was the co-manager of the impeachment trials as you as you know he lost a son in december of 2020 to suicide and i don't know um the family's um relationship with with covet but um dr um professor raskin he was a professor prior to becoming a a member of congress he he is well he he would be described as as well to do middle class white family um and and they absolutely felt the the impact of uh of the suicide related to you know battling depression during a period when we've been very socially isolated um and so i i hate to to to pause on such a heavy issue um that's a heavy issue the racial bias is a heavy issue um these are things that our nation are is just really grappling with and the consciousness of the nation is is really being challenged in these times and um you know we don't have to live a particular existence to know and understand the depth of the pain but we have to hear it that's why situations in form forms like this are so very important where we may not be living the same life but but we're all being impacted um in in very deep ways by by uh the tragedy that multiple tragedies copenhagen has brought on um we have we have two minutes left in the conversation this is a big question this is almost an unfair question but i'll give it to you anyway you know um what are what what is the lesson of covet 19 so far what is the takeaway how dependent on we are on each other as you said it it's it's in isolation that we die it's but we all uh are in this together uh and and we need to mask for each other we need to get the vaccine for each other that's the only way uh as uh sure was saying we're gonna get back to church and fellowship with each other uh and that's that's what that's part of our resilience that's with part of the resilience of this community for hundreds of years so we need each other i agree as well it's advocacy we've seen people become more let's just say politically quick aware health care associated awareness we've seen groups out there giving out masks we've seen them educating we've seen them uh you know try to find the places for covet testing we've seen them help seniors get groceries and so forth i think that sometimes it's in the the trials that we endure that we find our strength and i'm hopefully hoping that we really you know come through this that we really continue to educate that we help support each other as we get vaccinated continue to socially distance and wear masks and be really just cognizant that uh if we continue to employ these things hopefully we will see uh better days to come and then uh finally uh i agree with your comments and uh i'm gonna go a slightly different direction that the lesson of cobot 19 and 2020 for me was the the the amazing power of knowledge and the amazing power of the internet to spread false information and mis-educate people and the really the power that it had over people's ability the people's decision-making that people believe a lot of things that are so far out and false it's incredible and so i want to challenge my community to educate yourself i say education's liberation you know there's a lot of good information on the internet too read about about what viruses are they've been around for billions of years and them changing and moving around and finding a place where they can rest their head we call it finding a host but you know they're looking for a human to to engage with that's that's since the beginning of time guys this is so cool so the idea of a virus that moves between person to person is not new how they move is somewhat unique uh how they present do you think that i would like us to be very conscious guys about what we accept as truth or fact and maybe read a little bit harder and deeper and i like to challenge the american school system to teach more science to folks earlier as i'm a big proponent of better stem education because i think if we had more folks who understood what a virus was uh that we wouldn't have all these things that people just make up and i'm really guys amazed i may write a book on this the number of things i've heard attributed to covet 19 is really you know it's just really amazing so i would like to encourage because we're seeking information don't say our people are seeking information we are seeking information let's educate ourselves about science and um you know bring it into our lives in ways that are positive thank you thank you all dr gary gibbons the director of the national heart lung blood institute at the national institutes of health thank you very much to dr angel leake who joins us as an infectious disease specialist very hearty thank you to dr cheryl rucker whitaker who is the ceo of complete care management partners llc and in her absence we're grateful that dr amal told cars was able to join us from the illinois department of public health before we go the congresswoman is is back here with us but i do want to just encourage you all to continue to to stay abreast of the conversations and the work that the congresswoman is doing um you can follow her on all all the social medias and she will she will not spew false facts at you know false false uh information to dr whitaker's point so you can follow her on twitter at robinkelly you can follow her instagram at the same thing at robinkelly and then on facebook um rep robin kelly uh her page and then finally you can also sign up for her monthly office newsletter um if you want to learn more about what the congresswoman and her staff are doing on behalf of her constituency robinkelley.house.gov follow her there and then otherwise just just numb to to everyone's point stay together stay well still stay safe um invest in the things that bring you joy and keep you healthy and with that congresswoman um the the last thing that i will say again is um what dr tokar's mentioned the website from earlier if you want to know more about where you can access the vaccine and which providers nearby are offering it in your area you can go to coronavirus.illinois.gov backslash vaccine slash location so it's in the chat you can scroll back up in the chat and find that but um congresswoman kelly i'll turn it back over to you and i i thank you all for your attention and your goodwill thank you so much mia thank you to the panel i so appreciate you taking the time to share your talents your intellect all of your information uh with our viewers or zoomers or facebook libraries whatever we're calling ourselves down but thank you so much i really really appreciate you taking the time and hopefully you've convinced more people to take the vaccine so thank you so much and be safe and yes wear your mask thank you thank you

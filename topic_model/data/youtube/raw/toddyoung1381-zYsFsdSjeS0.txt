well thank you chairman that that's kind and and I did uh want to be here for this this panel I I thank all of you for your work and for your presence here so that we might have an opportunity to uh discuss uh the chips in science act uh which uh we think can significantly further our position as it relates to American leadership in emerging technologies that of course will be vital to our national security and uh our our economic health in the future one of the key Provisions in the chips and science Act is the regional Tech Hub provision this will activate underutilized and in some respects overlooked regions around the country and support the innovation of critical emerging Tech areas like Quantum and artificial intelligence and and some other key areas my state Indiana is going to benefit enormously from the establishment of these Tech hub uh that will bring together a wide array of stakeholders it's really why it's it's so important that we're not only celebrate the passage of this Landmark bills and number are but continue to focus on its implementation and fund key Provisions such as the regional Tech Hub Provisions I'll just ask Mr Clark sir why is it important to your mind that we fully fund the chips in science act and how will it directly impact the work that you're doing on artificial intelligence thank you Senator um it will impact me in two ways one it gives uh the ability to create much more ways to test and assess AI systems for both economic capabilities and safety issues we DIY a lot of our own evals at my company and we try and make those public but it's hard to sometimes if we can have more evals for the public it unleashes more companies to build more stuff using Ai and creates a creates a huge asset and the second way is that it can allow us to fund more ambitious infrastructure in the public sector so academics can do more impactful work thank you for that Dr Suter um I know you can attest to how the private sector is putting significant resources uh in in Sweat Equity uh into the development of quantum Computing um many Americans view Quantum as is just another Pie in the Sky Silicon Valley uh buzzword it's never really going to impact their lives in any positive way can you discuss why in fact uh it it's the opposite and maybe elaborate on the many ways Quantum technology is going to impact all of our Lives moving forward let me give two examples where I I think many many Americans many people around the world are already using Quantum uh for people who have ever had a knee or a shoulder injury and have gotten an MRI that's Quantum technology it's higher resolution and usually it's much safer than x-rays that technology was developed originally in the United States going back to the 1940s so people haven't realized they've been doing that but but even more common is GPS we have Quantum atomic clocks in satellites right now that not only give us a Precision location and just as we drive as I got here this morning uh walked here this morning but they give us highly reliable time stamps that we use in uh high-speed networking situations if you've gone to an ATM and you see the little print out there of what time it is that comes from GPS that comes from Quantum as as well so in in many ways Quantum is already part of our lives and it will become increasingly more so those are those are powerful examples and and um in your testimony you note that through the chips and science act in the National Quantum initiative the federal government's already taken some important steps to secure our Quantum future but as you mentioned uh there's there's more that needs to be done what more can the federal government do what more should we do to ensure the U.S wins uh the global Quantum race well I do believe it it comes down to talent and it comes down to skills ultimately um there there has to be somebody that develops this technology there has to be somebody to use the technology efficiently so we have to ensure one way or another either we can train the people uh we have or we can get them Quantum Talent is spread around the world including uh with many of our Allied Nations for example the five Ives countries as well so I do think we have opportunities to look beyond our borders to get the talent we need to evolve this the way we must it's good and so my constituents who might be watching this would be encouraged to know that the chips and science act actually create some mechanisms and and can accommodate crowding in talent and treasure from our closest allies in developing things uh like like the field of of quantum so thank you uh again all for being here chairman

congressman adam chef is a democrat of california he serves on the committee investigating january 6th served as the lead house manager for donald trump's first impeachment and he joins me now and and and congressman shift let's talk about rudy giuliani who was a central figure in both of these in in both plots that resulted in both impeachments why do you think it's important the committee sit down and talk to him here well i think as you can see by the series of subpoenas that we've issued over time they're going to hire and hire people uh in and around the administration and rudy giuliani was really at the center of things he was one of the most aggressive promoters of that big lie about the election he was involved in trying to get these state legislators to send alternate slates of electors or to delay sending sites of electors and to me the most shocking claims are are some of those that you just repeated chris and that is they were involved in urging the president reportedly to seize voting machines that's the kind of thing you see in uh in in the developing world you don't see it at least until now uh in the united states of america uh so there's a lot uh he could tell our committee uh you know certainly a lot we've uncovered already but uh i think he's a pretty central figure in all of this should should we interpret the issuance of subpoenas to mean that uh invitations for voluntary cooperation were rebuffed uh you know that's not always the case you know generally we do seek voluntary cooperation to begin with where we know certain parties are very likely to be hostile we don't waste time spending weeks trying to get their voluntary cooperation and we have gone straight to subpoenas in some circumstances um and you know you're also right about one of the points you're making earlier which is our inquiry is broader than just what happened on a single day uh it's all of the multiple lines of effort to overturn the election that ended culminating in that attack on the capital but uh it's important to understand january 6 to understand the context of all these other failed efforts to overturn the election uh and then the last resort which we saw in the six was violence yeah and i didn't know you know it's hard to keep track of what information we have as public and not because obviously there's a lot of moving parts a lot of things building up to that but this uh jumped out at me in the borish epstein letter you are reported to have participated in a call with former president trump on the morning of january 6 during which options were discussed to delay the certification of election results in light of vice president pence's unwillingness to deny or delay certification i don't know if you track what's public and what's not but but what do we know about that phone call you know i try to track what's public and what's not uh and as you might imagine have to err on the safe side in terms of the committee um but well you know obviously we would like to know uh anything that went on during that call uh what other options at that very late stage were being contemplated to try to still overturn the election uh and and so uh you know he's a obviously if he was on that call would have a lot to tell us if he was part of that war room at the willard hotel he'd have a lot to tell us uh and we hope that he will answer the subpoena and if not as with the others we'll have to figure out what the recourse is there's there's a number of documents that you've been seeking from a variety of sources i just want to go through so one thing i just to note here is that bernie carrick did come in talked to the committee provided batch of documents to the select committee and i i raised that only to note that uh obviously the people that don't comply like steve bannon most i think if miss lee and mark meadows are uh news items and newsworthy for for obvious reasons but the vast majority of people that you've wanted to talk to you have talked to including some people like bernie carrick that one might suppose wouldn't talk to you in so much as he is an ally or or a loyalist to former president trump well that's right uh you know mr kirk worked very closely with rudy giuliani this is all a matter of public record uh and a great many people are cooperating with us so we would hope that everyone would but certainly a great many uh now i think over 400 have cooperated with us um but but you can you know getting back to point was making earlier as we get to more and more significant witnesses uh they you know they are often closer and closer to donald trump and therefore people that the former president is urging and has some leverage over in terms of getting them to refuse to cooperate so but we are as you say getting a lot of help and sometimes um even less publicly known witnesses can offer some of the most important insights uh but i can't be more particular than that yeah we should note i don't know if we have the b-roll of the uh the infamous uh four-season landscaping uh press conference of rudy giuliani but uh bernie carrick is in that uh shot he's standing behind rudy giuliani there so as you said a matter a matter of public record there's also some uh news breaking just recently that the national archives which is in uh possession of has custody over uh a tranche of documents the committee is seeking related to the ex-president while he was in office intends to turn some of those over tomorrow at 6 pm according to a doj letter the docs were not covered by the d.c circuits administrative stay and scotus supreme court hasn't acted on trump's emergency request yet so do you anticipate those actually being uh transmitted to you i certainly hope so uh and uh you know we'll have to see what happens between now and then but i would certainly hope so um and you know i would hope that the supreme court will very quickly uh resolve the litigation regarding the archives and refuse to take up the case from below both the legislative branch and the executive branch are in agreement that the record should be provided and it would uh it would be antithetical to a conservative court to disagree with those two branches of government i think the only reason they would do so is if they have now become nothing more than a partisan court i couldn't help but notice how expeditiously this court moved to have full briefing oral arguments and a full decision striking down the proposed testing or vaccine mandate that the biden administration proposed it just was notable to me that when motivated they appear to have the ability to move quite quickly i wonder if you noted that as well uh yes without a doubt uh and and you've seen you know the other courts the district and court of appeals move with great alacrity in in our particular case uh and there's no reason the supreme court can also particularly when uh the law i think is so clear and would clearly militate in favor of not taking up the case uh so i i hope that they will move with uh swiftness um finally uh there is a another subpoena that we've found out about which is phone records again there are sort of third-party subpoenas that have that that we found about out about through press reports um to uh tech companies that may be in possession of of records in this case eric trump and kimberly gulfoyle's uh phone records that have been subpoenaed by the january 6 committee eric trump calling it in a statement a witch hunt in a one sentence statement can you confirm that those subpoenas have happened i can't confirm any particular subpoenas but i can't say that we've acknowledged that uh early on we sent letters preservation letters uh to these uh telecommunication companies we have followed up with subpoenas uh to request records in certain cases and you know these records i i should emphasize they're not the content of conversations uh they're the you know the who is the party to the conversations of the dates the duration but that can be very important evidence and lead to additional witnesses it can corroborate the testimony of witnesses uh can tell us who was in communication with whom while the attack on january 6 was going on so they can be very important uh but but in this case i can only talk uh generally and can't confirm with respect to those two particular people finally and i know that you're one member of a committee with multiple members and and uh you know i don't know how the communications work here but i just wonder if you have any indication so far from any of the subjects these four subpoenas that were issued today about what they intend to do um i i don't have any indication yet um you know i think we can anticipate certain things that they're likely to say i think rudy giuliani's attorney has made some public comments about him claiming attorney-client privilege or executive privilege there are clearly lots of uh activities that he was a witness to and a participant to that do not implicate attorney-client privilege or where that privilege would be waived uh it's very unlikely that executive privilege would apply at all uh and so you know much as with other witnesses when we for example subpoenaed hannity we made it very clear we weren't interested in his journalistic work on fox if that's what you call that there are plenty of facts that mr giuliani and others attorneys or otherwise can testify to that are not privileged and we want to make sure that the committee has all the facts that we can present the american people all right congressman adam schiff thank you very much thank you

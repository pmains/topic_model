as president later today I will introduce the born alive abortion survivors protection act along with my colleague Senator Langford it's a simple Bill Mr President it simply states that a baby born alive after an attempted abortion is entitled the same protection and Medical Care that any other newborn baby is entitled to and you would think that it would be a simple yes vote from every member of this body but unfortunately Mr President that's not where we are four years ago and then three years ago the U.S Senate took up this bill and almost every single Democrat in this body voted against it and just three weeks ago the House of Representatives took up this bill in almost every single Democrat over there voted against it apparently Banning infanticide is now controversial because let's be clear that's what we're talking about here some Democrats have tried to cloak their opposition this bill in meaningless phrases about a private decision between a woman and her doctor but what is the decision that we're talking about we're talking about whether or not a living baby born after an attempted abortion should be provided with medical care or to be left to die or I suppose be killed outright by the abortionist that's what we're talking about that's the decision Democrats are referring to and that's apparently the decision that they think should be left up to patients and their doctors whether or not to let a living breathing baby die Mr President Senate voted on a previous version of this bill introduced by my former colleague Senator sass four years ago when the Democrat Governor of Virginia came right out and said you could keep a newly born baby comfortable while you decided what to do with it in other words while you decided whether to let the child die or I guess kill it or whether to let it live that chilling statement made it abundantly clear that we needed to State explicitly that any baby wherever he or she is born including in an abortion clinic is entitled to Medical Care it's staggering that we have gotten to the point where we need to debate this in Congress Mr President staggering that this wouldn't be an automatic yes vote from every member of this body but that's where we are and if anyone thinks that abortion isn't a slippery slope that we can somehow devalue unborn babies lives while maintaining respect for everyone else's then I'm here to tell them differently because the Democrat party's gotten to the point where its members not only oppose a legislation to protect unborn babies the oppose legislation to protect born ones as well the Democrats world there are now apparently two classes of born babies The Wanted ones born alive in delivery rooms and The Unwanted ones born alive in abortion clinics apparently only one of those classes of babies is entitled to the equal protection of the laws this President Democrats talk a lot about abortion when they're talking about this bill but this bill of course would do absolutely nothing to restrict abortion it's not a bill protecting unborn babies it's a bill protecting born babies I do understand why Democrats are so worked up though because while this bill may not do anything to restrict abortion there is always the chance of drawing attention to the humanity and dignity of the child who has just been born will draw attention to the humanity and dignity of the child who is about to be born the child Democrats are determined or laws should not protect and Democrats are apparently so determined to preserve the so-called right to kill unborn babies that they are fully comfortable opposing a law that would protect born babies Mr President these are hard things to talk about but they've got to be said because that is the reality of where we are right now roughly 50 percent of the United States Congress opposes giving the equal protection of the law to born human beings if they happen to be born alive following an attempted abortion and I think we're at a real inflection point as to where we want to be as a nation do we want to be a country where the circumstances of your birth determine whether or not your right to life protected we want to be a country that endorses leaving living breathing babies to die the discards born babies because they are for a moment at their birth unwanted I don't know I think we're better than that Mr President we have to be better than that if we truly want to be a nation that protects human rights it stands for justice that defends the vulnerable then we cannot be a nation that says that it is it is acceptable to leave living breathing born human beings to die in abortion clinics it says that there are two classes of newborn babies and only one of them deserves to be protected every human being Mr President deserves to be protected no matter the circumstances of his or her birth I want to thank Senator Lankford for his leadership on this issue we will be working together to advance this legislation and I pray that sooner or later sooner rather than later I should say we will get to the day when this bill will be an automatic yes vote from every member of this body Mr President I yield the floor

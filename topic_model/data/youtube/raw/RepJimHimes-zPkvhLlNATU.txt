mr. secretary my question is about the Volcker rule like you I was pleased to see that the regulator's finally came out with a rule I agree with you I think that it is strong and comprehensive I am however concerned by the explicit exemption for proprietary trading with respect to sovereign bonds frankly also the exemption for muni bonds the headline Bank brought low by investments in Greek debt i think is probably not just an idea and certainly it's a possibility in the future so i wonder if you could address the ability under the Volcker rule of the banks to invest in securities which could be very very risky in quite volatile over time congressman obviously our initial core concern was the treatment of us treasuries and issues arose particularly with regard to the impact that the rule would have on on banks with relationships with other foreign nationals and their sovereign debt I believe that the way the provisions were worked out it provides guidelines you know a path for for sovereign debts to bonds to be treated appropriately I am I think if you look at the the structure of the rule it's clear that there is accountability at the level of the CEO to come up with a plan for implementing these rules in a way that's consistent with the statute and the risks that are being undertaken so I don't think all of the detail is necessarily reflected in the black letter law of the rule there's going to be questions of interpretation it was deliberately left to be worked out by the regulators and the firm's to reach a balance so that we don't shut down a very important sovereign market including the market for us treasuries so it's something we'll continue to work on with with this committee and and with the regulators

what's very clear is that our municipal workers our municipal leaders are on the front lines of the covet 19 crisis and we've got to make sure that the federal government has your backs that we are working cooperatively to make sure we're doing all we can to save lives to keep people safe and to keep vital services moving forward and that's why the conversation around funding to state and local governments uh including our counties and our cities and towns here in new hampshire is so important i've been hearing lots of feedback from communities as they enter budget season about how costs are going up revenues are flat or decreasing in some areas and there's deep concern about how to put together sensible budgets that um respect the taxpayers and ensure that our critical local services can continue to go forward and that's why the conversation around state and local funding is going to be front and center in the next negotiations around a covet 19 package

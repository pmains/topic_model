don edwards your former colleague from maryland said earlier in our program that she was deeply suspicious that there was inside assistance in terms of helping these rioters find very hard to find rooms their offices that as jason johnson has been explaining the the capital is a labyrinth you know the the west wing of the white house is is small you wouldn't have these questions about anything there but the capital is is very complicated multiple floors multiple buildings do you have concerns that um that that maps or instructions about where to go and how to get into the speaker's office were shared with the rioters well i don't i don't know and i absolutely believe there needs to be a complete and comprehensive investigation but one of the things that was very troubling to me is that they seem to come into the building in so many different directions and so i do wonder whether whether or not they had assistance now i wouldn't say that it was my republican colleagues who knows jason raised the question of the police i think all of those questions absolutely need to be investigated but you know i mean i know the way it works on the other side why weren't there police police infiltrating the protesters jason mentioned uh internet traffic but i'll tell you if it's the other side you know you have undercover police officers that are a part of it right this was instigated by the president of the united states he has told us for months that he was going to do exactly what he did and so it was inexcusable what happened here yesterday a police force of 200 of 2 and 500 people were here there should have been everybody all hands on deck should have been in force yesterday well i have to say congresswoman if you thought that you'd be in danger in the city that day people whose job it is to protect cities and buildings and individuals like yourself obviously knew that there was a threat yesterday we're glad that you're safe oh go ahead sorry thank you you know i think and i had a lot of conversations with random african-americans that i don't even know in dc over the last week and i will tell you there was a sense of fear because this is viewed like a clan rally and they just had a rally about three weeks ago and four people were stabbed yes yeah and and um i'm getting screamed at to leave but this is an important point to end on the dc mayor urged all of her citizens to stay home because of the threat being imported donald trump has been emailing and his campaign has been emailing and inviting people and they flew in from parts unknown and you're right if it were a black lives matter protest frankly in the years after 9 11 if if it were any sort of protest against counter-terror policies the cia and the if we would know exactly who these people were where to find them where they were staying but yet as i said earlier it looked like a tailgate party the rioters stood with no fear of being arrested with no fear of their faces none of them had a mask to protect themselves or anyone else from covet and no one made any attempt to hide themselves from the police lots of questions lots of suspicions congresswoman karen bass and jason johnson thank you both so much for spending some time with us today

hello this is carlton jim cliver and i would like to welcome you to my podcast fireburn chronicles i've always been a lover of history i see this platform as a way to connect history with the politics of today this is so important because as josh santiano once said those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it each episode my guest and i will have a conversation about the lessons of the past politics for the present and how we must learn from those experiences to help shape the future thank you for taking time to listen and welcome to clyburn chronicles thank you very very much this is congressman jim clyburn welcome to another edition of clyburn chronicles today i am particularly pleased uh to welcome uh to these chronicles uh a longtime friend javier becerra uh javier bersera is now the 25th secretary of health and human services but i knew him before he became somebody he and i uh were honored to serve together i guess he was i know i was here in this congress i think for 12 years uh how long we came in together in 93 remember 93. that's right real classmates uh and uh he was one of my go-to guys you know we were around at the time things were happening and i thought i was fortunate to be co-chair of our freshman class until i assumed the office in the second term session our first term and of course i found out that i wasn't so honored but uh getting along with that class uh taught me a lot about how to function here in the congress before you came the congress however uh the secretary was a very uh productive uh member of the political scene out in california uh he came here and brought his leadership skills with him uh serving leadership as chair of the house democratic caucus and then serving on the ways and means committed the committee that has a responsibility of raising the money that we need in order to run the government and i was in that capacity that i got to know i mean real uh real well because the two of us were tapped at one point to be members of the so-called super committee uh it's our job uh to come up with a budget at a time uh when that was very very difficult to do and we proved how difficult it was to do because we never ever could settle get 12 people to settle on a budget but we got through it and the government did not shut down under our watch but what i built how i really became endeared to javier was because of those social security amendments in 1965 as a part of the great society program that created medicare and medicaid we're getting ready for the 56th anniversary of that on july 30th and i'm pleased that he's here with me to talk about the importance of expanding medicaid there's still 12 states that have not expanded my home state of south carolina being one over there uh we are working now trying to figure out what we can do to keep the people from living in these the people who are living in these these 12 states keep them uh moving forward uh going to a better place and so i want to thank javier for being here today and i want to just say to him how much i appreciate a friendship i know uh he's going to be very successful secretary because he's a very successful member uh of this uh congress and so i just want him to talk a little bit uh to introduce a subject uh here about uh medicare medicaid and this 50th anniversary 56 anniversary that we're about to celebrate so congressman clevern uh first i i want to say thank you for inviting me uh but more importantly thank you for your service it has been nothing short of a dear pleasure and a real privilege to to get to serve with you to learn from you and to watch you as you continue to make history you know having a chance to serve with people like john lewis uh nancy pelosi jim cliver you you get to see history be made and so uh the title living legend really does apply in the case of jim clyburn so i i i'm thrilled that i get to call this living legend a friend uh and a mentor and on things like medicaid uh we're fortunate to have people like congressman clyburn who who believe in making opportunity available especially to those who've worked very hard but never quite had a chance to get quite there and fortunately with lbj back in the 1960s and his great society as you mentioned congressman he had the wisdom to propose the medicare and medicaid program and medicare which concentrates on seniors is now a lot there there isn't a senior in america who doesn't say you know don't you dare touch my medicare i paid for it i need it and medicaid we're finding is exactly the same seniors depend on medicaid as much as they depend on medicare many of them do those who are lower income kids so many of our kids about a third of all kids in america receive their health care as a result of medicaid and chip the children's health insurance program and so what would we do without medicaid well today we would have poverty rates far exceeding what we we've seen we would have far more people who have died of covid uh but for medicaid let's put it this way in the 1960s before medicaid and medicare were enacted if you were a senior uh you were getting ready to retire chances are you were getting ready to retire it's very strong chance you were getting ready to retire into poverty after all those decades of work you still were going to retire to poverty because we didn't have social security system in place at the time medicare or medicaid today we do so it should be uh surprising to no one that today less than nine percent of all seniors when they're reached that age and are ready to retire are still in poverty and we've done a great deal to try to help them and medicaid has been one of the ways but unfortunately we still have a number of americans millions of americans 200 000 in the state of south carolina who aren't getting access to care and could if the state simply adopted what uh congressman clyburn mentioned which is expanded medicaid well thank you so much for that you know as one of the architects of the affordable care act uh we uh we had a lot of fun uh putting that together it was a great sense of accomplishment uh and of course we were all rejoicing when the supreme court uh issued this ruling uh telling us uh that it was uh constitutional the supreme court has visited the question twice since and each time he picked up a vote on his constitutionality so we've gone all the way from a five-four decision down to a 7-2 decision so i think the affordable care act is with us uh to stay but there's a little problem with the affordable care act as we were the supreme court said it was constitutional it also removed the mandate uh that has contributed to uh what we now call uh this gap in conference again uh um do you have any thoughts on uh what we might do uh to further legislation uh that will allow us uh to make up for that gap uh because as i said earlier my state is one of the 12 states that's not the expanded medicaid uh and we've got to do something about that uh you have the feelings about that yeah i absolutely do and we have to remember that uh and you and i probably relive this pretty much every time we think about the affordable care act in those days back in 2010 when we passed it remember they kept those who were opponents kept saying oh this is this is going to institute death panels where people will be told they have to die they won't be allowed to live because we're instituting the affordable care act and any number of myths that way that we're spooking people who were definitely wanting to see us do something on health care well we did it and lo and behold today 31 million people receive good health care because they have insurance through the market exchanges under the affordable care act's marketplace plans and today 81 as i think i may have mentioned 81 million americans receive their health care because of medicaid and the children's health initiative program so well over 110 million americans today count on the affordable care act medicaid or the children's health program to get their health insurance and so we can make it better and congressman you all did something in the american rescue plan that already made it better and that was you helped extend coverage to americans who have uh access through the affordable care act to insurance that they can continue to afford because of the tax credits that you provided to them so that they could continue to afford it we make that permanent we keep millions of americans on good insurance but on the medicaid program the federal government is giving a deal that it's hard to me for me to understand why any state would not uh accept it federal government is willing to pick up 90 cents out of every dollar in cost for a state resident to be on expanded medicaid but as we mentioned there are about 200 000 south carolinians who still haven't had a chance to get that access because the state hasn't adopted that and total in america in the 12 states that have not yet ex adopted expanded medicaid about 4 million adult americans who lack health care because the states haven't acted well thank you for pointing that out i just had uh five uh town halls throughout uh my district and i concentrated along the so-called i-95 quarter uh that's been uh referred to as a court of shame trying to make people aware uh of what we're doing uh with the for of the uh the american rescue plan uh and how that will be of benefit as you know uh also along that corridor uh and throughout the country now uh it looks like we're about to maybe already experiencing a fourth surge uh in covert 19 uh and um i know that at the department of health and human services that is high uh on your agenda i know vaccinations or the answer to much of this but i would like for you to take a time to say whatever you feel about what covert 19 and our response to it we really mean uh to the people uh that are on medicaid or need medicaid well congressman you and i know because we've seen it firsthand that americans who don't have health care run the greatest risk when it comes to not only becoming ill but so ill that they have to be hospitalized and in some cases we lose them and no one should have to go through that no one should lack access to health care coverage as president biden has said and as i know you agree and i agree health care should be a right not a privilege for only the privileged few and so here we go with uh a pandemic that today we know we could fight against if people get vaccinated and so the president has made a phenomenal effort in trying to get all americans vaccinated and thanks to what you and your colleagues have done you made it possible for the vaccine to be out there for all americans without charge uh and i want to repeat that because it is very it is not very often where uh our communities have access to quality medicines innovative medicines at zero cost yet uh we know that there's still uh a chunk of america that hasn't been vaccinated and now with this variant of covid the so-called delta variant which is far more transmissible than the original version of covid we're seeing infection rates rise again hospitalizations rise again deaths rise again and so it's it's time to act even more aggressively and today in fact the president is announcing that for federal workers we're going to start asking that or expecting that they vaccinate or mask up distance if they haven't vaccinated so that we can start to be more safe indoors and so we're going to do everything we can and we've gotten over 300 million shots in arms already but we got to continue because fully half of america is about half of america is today vaccinated but too many young folks still aren't and we still have a lot of americans who even though vaccinated have vulnerabilities they are immunocompromised or they are frail and elderly and so if someone is young and healthy but is carrying the the covet disease they could infect someone who even though vaccinated may not ultimately resist uh that that uh infection if it if it transmitted so we just have to do everything we can because quite honestly if you want to have a healthy economy you have to have a healthy america that's quite true and thank you so much i really believe that uh right now that is number one uh with this administration that ought to be number one with everybody in the country i'm very pleased to see that some who have uh in the past seem to have politicized this issue has now decided that they are going to do what is necessary for the american people and encourage people to get vaccinated and so thank you so much for that i hope those who are listening today if you have not been vaccinated please get fascinated if you go friends or neighbors who have not let them know that not only is it free but it's safe uh and we have got to get a handle on this disease this country's not going to come back from this pandemic by just wishing it we all got to play a a role in this we you're responsible in our own way for making sure that the world gets out and encourage people to do better and i want to thank you for all that you're doing all that i know you're going to do uh as i said earlier i know you like people were asking me about you when you were nominated i tell them i said you may not know that the java server that i know uh but when you sit around the table with a guy uh [Music] fighting to uh keep the government open i can tell all of the listeners here today uh if you're in that kind of a foxhole uh you want javier becerra uh right there with you and so i want to thank you uh for what i know you're gonna do let you know uh i look forward to working with you guys going forward and hopefully we'll get this pandemic under control get covert 19 behind us and continue building back better that's what this is all about if you have any closing comments you'd like to say uh i'd like to hear it congressman i i i will just build on what you just finished saying because you all did the work of passing the president's american rescue plan now you're on the verge of giving america the largest investment in infrastructure we've ever seen with this bipartisan deal that is making its way through congress which i think is phenomenal then you've got the work of helping get the president's american jobs plan and american families plan which completes the work to try to get us through the pandemic and so i'm just thrilled that i get to be part of this working with you and your colleagues to to get this done because uh not only will we get back to where we were before the pandemic but quite honestly we should go beyond where we were before the pandemic because there were a lot of folks who were still left behind and the work we got to do especially on things like medicaid is to make sure nobody's left behind everybody should have an opportunity to be part of that american experiment so thank you for what you've done thank you for letting me be a friend and i look forward to working with you thank you so much buddy look forward to

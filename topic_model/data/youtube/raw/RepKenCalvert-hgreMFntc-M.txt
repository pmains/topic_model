secretary James general thank you for both being here I want to talk about Merida Creek I've talked to you both about it many times over the years and we're you know wanting to get this project completed we've been working closely with Colonel Barta at the LA office and and as you know we're trying to contain costs and available resources that we use it effectively to get this thing completed the sponsor Riverside County Flood Control and the Water Conservation District have requested a section 221 in-kind contribution for credit agreement to allow the sponsor design phases to be and three of the project they believe the section 221 agreement would accelerate remaining design work and reduce a total project cost the sponsor is also asked to work closely with the Corps to update the economic side by side study of the project so how are we doing on that and what do you what do you expect sir this is we have a very high standard in the Corps for making sure we're collaborative and we communicate we missed it on this one I want to look in you and tell you that the district let me down on this and so as a result we're doing four things matter of fact mr. alleluja right here is my new director so it works he's been on the phone the last couple of days making sure we get this to where it needs to be four things number one we're going to complete the turn door and we're gonna turn the work over to Riverside County by 30 June of this year and Phase two will be 21 January of 21 number two we're not we're going to suspend the work on the grr and instead we're going to do exactly what you asked section 2 2 1 to be able to let the non-federal sponsor go ahead and do that design work on their own number three is we're gonna do better partnering that's always been a goal but again on this one we didn't do what we needed to do to make sure that you were informed we even were late answering a letter to you that we should have been much much more responsive on and then the fourth one is I've asked mr. Lee to be able to do a biweekly update so this district now is not just reporting to the division they're coming in to the headquarters to make sure that we personally track them we've got a lot we're doing 66 billion dollars of work this year but those that are not where we need to be get an extra-special a little bit of love and this one's going to get some extra love

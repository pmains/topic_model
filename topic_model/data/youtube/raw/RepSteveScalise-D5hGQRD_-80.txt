welcome back to american agenda i'm bob sellers here with heather childers a delegation of gop members of congress have been on a tour of the border uh they were greeted by more than a hundred illegal aliens who nonchalantly cross the border right in front of them let's take a look at that as we're here at the mcallen facility you just saw a large number of kids just come running across the border uh here they are right here just came in to the country illegally ran across just got apprehended by border patrol agents now that's steve scalise uh the congressman who was down there with a bunch of other people trying to see firsthand what it's like along the border yeah there have been several different delegations that have gone down and then obviously we talked with congressman keller at the top of the show who said that he's going to go with another group next week so they're all trying to go down there see firsthand what the situation is so they can then determine how best to make some changes people that have not been there would be of course president biden and vice president harris although they've been repeatedly invited to come down yeah and then there was an iowa congressman that said what about nancy pelosi i mean the fact is that uh policy and that's the thing about policy doesn't just come from the white house i mean it also comes from a congress and they need to deal with some of the the problems like down there and obviously the bite administration has had some executive actions or orders that have changed what's going along the border um i tweeted the other day or or sent a text to our team here i i have a nephew that went down to the border and briefed uh uh the governor of texas about what's going on there because he's a game warden in a border county right uh and and is in the the army national guard and uh so he knows what's going on down there and there's so many people coming across illegally and this is a thing i always have a pet peeve about the numbers that we get on these things is okay we get the numbers of how many apprehensions what about the people that are not apprehended uh i mean the people that are apprehended one of the differences now that the bible administration is doing is they are taking people apprehending them and then releasing them right and we talked to a sheriff down along the border who said 80 of those people will not come back for their so-called date right to address whether they're allowed legally into the country that was sheriff joe frank martinez from valverde county in texas and he said that he personally wanted to invite the vice president vice president harris since she is allegedly in charge of what's happening there making some changes he invited her to come down to the border clearly that has not happened yet but he said you know the biggest problem as as you were saying are the people that get across the border that they don't catch that should not be coming in as well um in reference to some of the cartel members and some of the ms-13 members that we've heard about recently being arrested there and then even members of the the terror watch list we had a sheriff on that they talked or a former member of the border patrol and they called those got aways right got aways and uh that number is going up but again it's like how do you know what that number is you don't if they got away right so you can estimate it right uh judging on what the flow is but it seems like the white administration has uh i don't like when they say we have open borders because that's not our policy but effectively it becomes an open border if you don't shut it down right and that's what all of these people who now have come here or all of the parents who have sent their children uh with you know cartel members and coyotes people making a lot of money right now 14 million dollars a day by some estimates to get some of these kids over here unaccompanied because they thought we do have open borders and now's the chance that they should take to get their children in and by the way sometimes children are i don't want to say sold but there's money involved to have somebody show up with a kid because it looks like then you're a family right and you can purport to be something that you aren't using them as decoys yes so um these are some of the issues going on along the border we wanted to touch upon in just for just a moment meantime folks uh i want you to consider taking us along with you when you go out about we have an

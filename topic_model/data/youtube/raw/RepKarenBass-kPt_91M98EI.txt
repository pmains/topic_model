joining me now is congresswoman karen bass of california and youssef salaam one of the exonerated central park five and co-author of punching the air very honored to have both of you here uh congresswoman i do want to start with you because you were one of the architects and a bill introduced last congress um it was the policing bill and that would ban the qualified immunity and no knock warrants now that dems control the upper chamber as well what the does the democratic party planted you um about policing in this country well we certainly plan to move forward the george floyd justice and policing act passed the house of representatives and was led in the senate by then senator kamala harris and cory booker and so we definitely plan to be at it back at it i know that the administration is going to issue executive orders on policing and so it is very exciting that we have an administration to work with this time around so you know that's one of the things that i often find myself in conversations about congresswoman so many people say well what is the cbc doing what is the black caucus doing what are democrats doing and i don't think people understand that last congress the republicans controlled the upper chamber so things would pass the house but fall flat in the senate so given that um now that you talk about the george floyd and police act what role do you see congress playing in just even wider legislation given that a lot of these issues rest at the local level well first of all we know policing is the beginning in order to transform our criminal justice system so so much work needs to be done and i do feel uh very good that we will have a partner in the senate this time so bills that were even passed with bipartisan support languish uh languished on mitch mcconnell's desk but you know when the federal government takes initiative a lot of times that leads to change on the state and the local level and given the mass movement that erupted after george floyd's torture and murder we saw a lot of changes in a lot of different states and on local levels as well and then at the end of the day the church the state the federal government controls the purse strings so i think that there's a lot of influence that the federal government can have yusuf i want to turn to you first of all i'm so happy you're here and excited that uh you are a free man today brother so thank you for joining me um i have to say me looking at that imagery seeing these four uh black people held at gunpoint and then looking at how the violent insurrectionists were treated on capitol hill it's nothing new we all understand uh how this country works and we're all actively trying to change it but i'm curious given your unique situation given that the leader of the free world so to speak once called for your execution how that imagery resonates with you what it reminded me of as i watched it over and over again and even today it looked like slave catchers it looked like the juxtaposition of seeing people who have the complexion for acceptance at the capitol rioting pushing their way through almost doing terrorist acts right alongside a family being put on the ground all of them the mother father children everybody um it is it is the most despicable imagery that we can see in america because we've realized that the system that we are under has continued and the leader of the so-called free will back then donald trump his whole process was to make sure the white supremacy white male dominance continued to stay in power and that's where we're at we're we're really at fighting spiritual wickedness in high and low places because the people who are there to protect and serve are not protecting and serving everyone we live in the divided states of america as opposed to the united states of america today is a new day i'm excited about what this new administration um represents and how we are moving forward with that yeah i mean you talk about it i mean we've seen uh white prisoners get organic food delivered we've seen a white woman who tried to sell a laptop accused of trying to sell a laptop uh to russians of all people get released on bail so let's pretend that somebody from the administration is watching right now let's pretend that president joe biden is watching this program ambassador susan rice who is overseeing the domestic policy council the scuttlebutt is that they will be coming out with more police reform this week assuming they're watching right now what is something you said that you would like to say to them to include in whatever policing plan they come out with which i'm told will include a policing commission you know the biggest thing that i think i would love to say to the administration at this particular point in time is we need reform that will usher in things that will not be able to be changed or taken away you know far too often is two steps forward 15 steps back but the things that are being put in place i believe should be things that are solid structures unable to be moved as long as they represent true freedom justice and equality for all of us because the beautiful thing about what the presidency represents and what the government represents is that it doesn't just be it's not just the president of black folks it's the president for all people in america and here we are and we want the the ability to be able to dream with our eyes wide open in the era of a dr king right we want to be able to dream that impossible dream have the best of the best afford it to us in america for it to be across the board and not for some and deprived from others and far too long since we've been brought to this country many of us in shackles we have been denied that type of treatment where our humanity has been looked at as being sacred in the founding fathers statement when they created this when they created america as it is now they said we the people and we were not considered part of that we were still considered three-fifths of a human being and i think the beautiful thing like i said is that this new administration i believe is ushering in change that will be so magnificent that we will go from being in the trashy of the world to being back on top being back as the example of what could be and the great thing about it is that in certain spaces in america there are already reforms happening there are already changes happening that will signify how we all can be able to receive that and be able to live beautifully happily and respectfully the fact that you remain so optimistic and have this positive spirit and outlook and energy on this panel gives me hope yusef so thank you uh for coming on the show uh police unions that's a big big deal and use of force those are two big issues that uh i think will definitely have to be tackled as we look at police commissions so thank you so much congresswoman karen bass of california you know i'll have you back and yousef salaam you'll have to come back as well

joining us now to discuss is wisconsin congressman and house judiciary committee member congressman tom tiffany uh congressman tell me how you assess the situation right now and whose fault you think it is uh well chuck holton certainly did some good reporting there um vladimir putin should leave ukraine and uh i condemn his actions in the strongest terms and um don't know that he will do that but he should leave the ukraine but what has happened here is as you just uh cited in the press release i put out weakness leads to war and this all started back on january 20th of 2021 the first executive action that president biden took was to shut down the keystone pipeline and he made it very clear that we were no longer going to be energy independent so think about what has happened as a result of that we have actually funded um we have funded vladimir putin's war machine crude oil going from fifty dollars a barrel to ninety dollars a barrel he's taking in enormous amounts of money as a result of that and we have been stuck with the inflation here in america yeah by the way let's take a listen to white house press secretary jim saki pushing renewable energy to stop dependence on foreign oil here's what she said on oil leases what this actually justifies in president biden's view is the fact that we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil on oil in general and need to and we need to look at other ways of process of having energy in our country and others one of the interesting things george we've seen over the last week or so is that a number of european countries are recognizing they need to reduce their own reliance on russian oil uh so congressman don't develop your own oil develop green energy and that will keep us from being dependent uh besides the fact that she's talking about a long-range plan whether you agree with it or not that doesn't solve the problem right now and i'm looking at the price of brent crude oil today it's at a hundred one dollars over a hundred one dollars your thoughts well jen sackey is living the green fantasy and when she cites these european countries and encouraging them that they should get off from crude oil they're doing the exact or oil products they're doing the exact opposite right now because their energy prices have exploded in the last six months they become more dependent on russia and they're actually moving back to where they're reopening some of their coal plants and when you look at here in america we're actually importing under joe biden in 2021 more oil from russia than we did in 2020 we're going in the wrong direction here under the biden administration yeah and the xl pipeline by the way the people dropped that term around as if it was producing a whole lot of oil every day it wasn't but it hadn't been finished but but biden stopped it from being developed and eventually it was going to produce over 800 000 barrels a day to our system and when you have that much more uh on on the market that pushes prices of oil down because you have uh more supply right congressman yeah so it actually is a metaphor for everything that's going on in regards to the oil sector i mean like he's coming to superior on wednesday we have a pipeline that needs to be reconstructed just east of superior in ashland county and it's running into some roadblocks joe biden should say on wednesday if he makes it to superior let's get that pipeline built there's another pipe segment of that pipeline over at the mackinaw straits in northern michigan that governor whitmer has said she does not want that pipeline rebuilt that jeopardizes our oil supply in the upper midwest as well as into canada so those are the things that are happening it's costing us jobs it's driving inflation and as you can see now it's affecting our national security yeah and and cutting off all these projects basically means this is all the supply you're going to have you're not going to have more drilling you're not going to have more supply and that's one of the reasons the prices are going up around the world like you said go ahead sir bob here's one of the other points about this what what the decision on keystone on january 20th of 2021 what that signaled to oil producers is don't invest right it was a powerful message to everyone in the oil sector don't invest in oil related uh projects because we're going to do everything we can to shut them down it's really unfortunate all right congressman thank you so much i'm a little bit passionate about it came right out of here that's uh that that's good it wasn't smoke out of your ears it was an earpiece so uh thank you very much congressman appreciate you joining us glad to join you today bob

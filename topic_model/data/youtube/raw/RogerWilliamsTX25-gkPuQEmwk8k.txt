minutes you're my time to mr. Williams thank you I'm amazed at everybody in here today that is an expert in the car business I am in the car business I'm a car dealer third-generation family my daughters are in our operations right now everybody in here has bought a car and you know what you bought a car you sat down you made your deal and you bought a car and you left because you made a good deal if you didn't have a good deal made you're going to get up and you're going to leave that's the way it works and you know I'm in the business and I must tell you I take a lot of this personal that's dialo today and I appreciate the people are speaking on behalf of the industry my father was the first person to sell the african community cars in texas in the 50s when they couldn't get financed my father sold in new cars he was the first person to sell new cars african african player community and he financed him his self in his back pocket they got good deals they appreciated it and I hear about this guidance thing guidance guidance doesn't come to federal government my industry guidance comes from the from the customer the customer tells you if your prices are right the customer tells you if your services are right it's all about competition competition drives my industry you can buy and you can drive or you can get up and leave and go see the other guy there's always a better deal somewhere and I take personal exception to Cordray the CFPB trying to get into our industry when it never was designed to be as my colleague from Georgia said it never was designed to be under this legislation so I would just simply close by saying the car industry is a great industry it's competitive it understands service competition drives it and to be a great model for the federal government to follow I yield my time back

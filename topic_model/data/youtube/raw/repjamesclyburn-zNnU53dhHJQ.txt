mr. speaker I proudly represent the 6th congressional district of South Carolina in this august body and this past week I spent a significant amount of time throughout the district meeting with faith leaders as well as other community-based organizations and one of the things I kept hearing they came from people who are particularly interested and whether or not this Congress will do anything to respond to this horrific problem that we have with guns of all the things that I find myself talking about the one thing that bothers me most is the fact that we seem to be no longer safe in our most sacred institutions I often quote Alexis de Tocqueville who came to this country way back in the early 1800s seeking what he called the magic of this great country he said that he went throughout the country looking at our institutions educational institutions legislative bodies trying to find the magic of this great country unlesss de Tocqueville said that he could not find it in any of these places he said that it was not until he went into our churches and synagogues that he found the real magic of this great country he said that he came to the conclusion that in spite of all of the difficulties and challenges we had as a country that America was great because Americans are good and he went on to some eyes that if America's comes every ceased to be good America was to be great it's kind of interesting that he came to that conclusion by visiting our places of worship and tonight I want to remind the American people that that sacred institution has been violated time and time again and on this question of gun violence we remember the Emanuel nine-nine soulful Bible study pupils in the basement of their church once again re-establishing the goodness of Americans they had that goodness violated by a young man with a gun we sat among them for a full hour before opening fire killing nine of them now man we think about that incident and we ask ourselves how could such a thing happen one of the things that we do know is that this young man was able to purchase a weapon although under the law he was not eligible to make the purchase but because of a loophole that we have in the law a loophole that I have chicken to call the tossing loophole the loophole says simply that if the background check is not completed within three days that the purchase can proceed to conclusion now the fact of the matter is this gun was purchased in West Columbia I don't know whether or not this young man had enough sophistication about the law to give the wrong information about his address but what we do know is that the wrong address was keyed him and because it was keyed in there was difficulty trying to get the information that was needed and by the time they found out the problem the three days had expired and the young man went back to get the gun and within days travelled all the way from Columbia South Carolina down to Tulsa he picked this church because he said it was historic he wanted to go into a historic black church well this month the nation is set aside time to honor the contributions of black Americans I can think of no way for us to better highlight what this month is all about then to once and for all close this tossin loophole to demonstrate to those nine african-american worshippers who were gone about the business of helping to make this country great going about the business of demonstrating the goodness of Americans the hair of their lives snip snuffed out I can think of no better way honor their lives then for us to close this loophole and on tomorrow I'm going to come before this body with a discharge petition because the legislation to close this loophole was filed in this body last July it's been hanging around now for eight months and I'm going to ask all of my colleagues Democrats and Republicans to sign this discharge petition before the end of this black history month so that we can say to those Souls rest in peace without are you back mr. speaker may I ask the gentlemen question we want you if you could just take a second more about that magic you talked about and how do we get there do you have any sense of well but thank you very much well I believe the you live accountable for history buff and so I spend a little time trying to find out what this country is all about and I also recall a great writer George Santayana once said writing that if we fail to learn the lessons of our history we were bound to repeat them I believe that history should be instructive and I think that that's what the Tocqueville was talking about in his writings he really came to this country from France to study our penal system on that particular occasion he was enamored with this country because of its people now the interesting thing about this I remember the early 1800s when he came here slavery was a law the land and he wrote about how contradictory that was to what he found in people's hearts the goodness that he found in people and so irrespective of what the challenges may be of the various institutions that we might have the various legal issues that may come before us the various legislative accomplices we might make irrespective of all that there is a certain goodness in Americans that ought to be on demonstration at all times and I really feel that it will demonstrate that goodness if we can say to these nine souls that just as Alexis de Tocqueville found in our places of worship but the basic goodness about America is all about that it's what you were in pursuit of as you said in your the basement of your church Emanuel AME on Calhoun Street chanson South Carolina you were there perpetuating that goodness and it was violated and I believe that this body can go a long take a long step toward demonstrating how important that is by saying in their memory we are going to close this loophole so that their their minds Souls

joining me now is the democratic congressman tom malinowski of new jersey he's a member of the house foreign affairs and homeland security committees he was born in communist poland during the height of the cold war when he was six he and his mother fled to the united states he's also served on the national security council in the clinton administration and as a state department diplomat in the obama administration congressman it's good to see you again you of course are watching this very closely not just as a congressman but as a an expert on this in the state department and it's a little bit personal to you as it is for a lot of people who come from this part of central and eastern europe that that borders or was part of the former soviet union give me a sense of where you think we are in this and what more america can and should be doing well it is it is personal to me uh and it should be personal to every american actually because the ukrainians are fighting uh for our freedom for our security as much as they're fighting for for their own uh we've done a great deal we've helped the ukrainians defeat russia's initial plan which was to take over kiev in a few days to get rid of uh the democratically elected government to impose an occupation that has been defeated absolutely uh clearly but we're entering a phase that could still be very very dangerous as putin considers a very very bad set of options from his point of view what we need to do is keep the flow of arms to the ukrainian defenders continue scouring the world for uh countries that have weapons that the ukrainians are trained on that they can use particularly air defense systems i'm glad the administration is now doing that uh and continue to ratchet up the sanctions there's still a few things that we can do uh uh there that that i think would make the effort even stronger than it is today and have confidence in what we're doing things so some of the things that that uh can be done some of that headroom that we've still got in sanctions comes more from european countries than america because america's just not that big a trading partner uh of russia's uh compared to european countries is what do you think success looks like for joe biden as he comes to europe this week obviously he's trying to use his decades of experience to negotiate a ratcheting up of that sanctions but what would you say would be success for him number one there are still european countries that have uh weapon systems particularly our eastern european allies that the ukrainians need and we need to encourage those countries and help them arrange those transfers as quickly as possible number two you're right the the europeans are still and they would acknowledge this overly dependent on russia for for energy supplies it's therefore harder for them to move as quickly as we have moved to ban the importation of russian oil but i think they've recognized that this is something that they have to do on a much faster timeline than they would have been comfortable before and there are things the united states can do for them for the europeans to ease the the burden to to ease the blow that they will suffer um we also have to talk about um scenarios going forward uh this this could go well we could have a negotiation uh where the ukrainians find uh some sort of agreement with the russians a ceasefire an end to the war that would be the best case scenario and we have to talk about uh how we would react to that in terms of the sanctions but it could also go in a very dark and scary direction uh if putin decides that his only way out is actually to expand the conflict um by testing nato article five and so in a way the most important thing the president will need to do is to maintain that unity and that determination among european allies uh to have the the nerves of steel that we will need if he does test us in that way congressman uh there are a number of uh conservative far right uh media personalities who've been on the wrong side of this thing including uh tucker carlson there are also been some of your colleagues in in congress josh hawley said some things uh madison cawthorne and and then finally uh marjorie taylor greene uh who has said that peace agreements have been violated by both russia and ukraine finally your colleague liz cheney a republican uh called her out by that saying putin is targeting and slaughtering civilians in a brutally unprovoked war against ukraine a sovereign democratic nation only the kremlin and their useful idiots would call that a conflict in which peace agreements have been violated by both sides what's your sense of the fact that that there there is a an influential group of american conservatives who are entirely on the wrong side of this thing they have been on the wrong side for years these are people who admired putin who thought he was a strong leader who thought he was a model for america and look it's easy to dismiss people like marjorie taylor green as just being crazy and fringe but the fact is that in the next congress there will be more people like marjorie taylor green because they are winning republican primaries around the country the fact remains that the likeliest republican standard bearer for president in 2024 is somebody who tried to pull america out of nato uh when he was last president of the united states and who said that putin's invasion of ukraine was an act of genius so i have a lot of republican colleagues who are solid on ukraine uh who'd like to uh you know find some way to paint joe biden as as weak uh you know their problem is not joe biden their problem is in their own party their problem uh is that fox news is broadcasting russian propaganda to millions of americans every single night and so yeah that does it does worry me we're solid we're bipartisan in the congress now that there is a debate in the republican party that needs to be resolved uh in in favor of america our allies and democracy and it has not yet been resolved congressman we always appreciate your insights thank you for joining us

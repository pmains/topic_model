mr. Guthrie you're recognized for three minutes thank you I thank you madam chairwoman for putting this together Thank You mr. secretary it's great to be here and I've really enjoyed working with you since you've been sworn in you've been openly accept very accessible and I really appreciate it I think I got a call from you in the security line of the DCA airport on drug pricing on another committee so I appreciate that and Matt and I worked in Matt Bassett worked through they worked in Kentucky together and Sarah runs a really good legislative shop so we're really pleased working with you guys the one thing that I want to touch on and some of it touches a couple of committees and I mom but for today you know Kentucky's really been hit hard like everywhere else on the on the on the opioid epidemic particularly everywhere but the one issue that I'm going to focus on here is just the infants that are born with addiction because of their parent and would you kind of explain what HHS is doing in terms of infant addiction the the issue of neonatal abstinence syndrome is quite a difficult one because it's frankly such a novel issue and so we one of the things we need to do is build the evidence base around what is the right treatment pathway for these children how do we how do we help bring them out of that addiction what's the right way to care for them and we've got to build that evidence we've also got to make sure we get these neonatal abstinence syndrome place is up and running I've been privileged to visit one in the Dayton area and just see the miraculous work they're doing for these kids and their and their parents and would love to work with you on ways we can address na s even better I think it's it's we're at the cutting edge of in Kentucky West Virginia the percent of kids born with na s is shocking and really what would love to work with Congress on the best approaches how we can reorient our programs with the money you've given us to help in na s okay thank you uh I know in the in the late 90s welfare reform I wasn't here but came a lot of it through this committee people having the work the ability and the encouragement to go to work you know Kentucky's done on the Medicaid Waiver there was approved by CMS we're looking at it through our SNAP program you know these people that are their employers with open arms waiting for these people to come into the workforce like in the late 90s where the time it appears the economy is beginning to roar and so as maybe it's a great opportunity to do so could you evaluate the effort how can we evaluate the efforts of states to help TANF recipients move back into the workforce well I think it's it's some of the issues that we've raised in the President's budget which is what percent of money our state's devoting to actual workforce training and workforce placement how many of their people are genuinely getting jobs and how many of them are they just offloading paying with state money dumping off the TANF rolls so that they can get credit for exiting the program all the gaming that has occurred in the TANF program in the last couple of decades and fixing that working with Congress things I know in the in the agriculture of the farm bill the big effort is putting job training money saving the snap to go into job training so people can get jobs that really lead to fulfilling careers and meaningful moving forward that's what we're looking for and look forward to working with you in in this area as well as some of the others so I'll yield back my time thank you very much

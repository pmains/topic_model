Thank You mr. chairman and thank you to our panel I think the discussion here today is thoughtful it is in depth at least a somewhat and certainly I think constructive as we do move forward on very serious issues I think we can all agree that we have unmet infrastructure needs across our country and what that means to various parts of our country can can mean different things but as the representative of one of the nation's most rural and in many cases remote districts we have a lot of infrastructure a little different then perhaps the metro subway and and other mass transit but we also have the world's largest rail classification yard Bailey yard in North Platte we have more than three thousand dams in the state thousands of miles of irrigation canal canals we have a large portion of the existing Keystone pipeline as well as the proposed route for the Keystone XL pipeline we have more than 65,000 square miles of land the vast majority of which is privately owned across 75 counties I could go on with more details about about my district but I have I do have concerns that simply raising the gas tax without implementing other reforms would merely get us a more expensive version of the status quo which we know a troubles most of us but let me let me be clear our job in this committee is to figure out how to fund infrastructure not necessarily make the rules for projects but I certainly want to reflect on the fact that I have concerns about moving forward with increasing attacks without some corresponding reforms and improvements in in public policy so I hope we can get there I hope that we can continue a constructive discussion as we are having today mr. Scribner you you reference the need to address issues such as labor requirements permitting rules and lack of lifecycle cost accounting to improve how transportation dollars are spent could you briefly expand on those comments thank you representative Smith so those are areas where we see great variations they take take labor regulations for instance if you're in a high union density state and we're getting a federal top-down labor requirement that may not impact you very much because you have the the workers of that of that you know type of workforce are already unionized but if you go to a state with lower union density that's where you can see substantial cost increases to those projects so this is the same goes for environmental permitting requirements the lack of life cycle costing where you know we may get a low bid on the initial construction but that doesn't take into account the entire project life and those costs that are borne across that time span so I think we need some basic standards and to recognize that one size doesn't fit all that certain solutions are gonna work better in different states than in others but a as you said simply increasing the the fuel tax and and spending more money through the current channels is just going to be a more expensive status quo okay thank you you know was mentioned earlier about climate change and the efforts can be have been described in a number of ways but mr. spear can you elaborate a little bit in terms of how your industry is already acting on efficiency of energy consumption and various methods there certainly congressman the two highest costs to our industry are labour and fuel so it is in our best interest to find newer technologies that make the equipment more energy efficient we're obviously looking ahead 5 10 15 years out at alternative fuel vehicles but in the near term it's making diesel powered tractors more efficient and you know I think you're seeing tremendous strides in terms of the technology that's that's coming out of our truck and trailer om so we believe that you know the savings that you can get by investment in infrastructure could have a dramatic impact on reducing our carbon footprint I mentioned seventy four point five billion dollars our industry losses each years sitting in traffic that's four hundred twenty five thousand drivers sitting idle for an entire year that is a very measurable amount of co2 that we're emitting and we're just 4% of the vehicles on the road so we're moving 71% of the economy but 4% of the vehicles on the roads so you count in all the passenger vehicles that are sitting in traffic that is a huge impact on the climate so investing in infrastructure does make a difference and it will certainly have a benefit to the environment thank you and just briefly mr. Dooley areto and the annual report card that you do highlights the the grades can you explain briefly how rail infrastructure received the highest grade of any sector absolutely congressman Smith rail actually did a lot of investment in their system some twenty billion in one year alone and it was those investments that they made in the freight rail system that got their grade up so where we see categories of infrastructure that invest the grades go up the condition is better handles the capacity operations and maintenance are taken care and that's how they got the highest grade okay thank you

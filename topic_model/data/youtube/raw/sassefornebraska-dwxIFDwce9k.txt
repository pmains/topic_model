hey Nebraska I just want to say thank you for the big numbers tonight it's incredibly humbling I'm very grateful to get to represent this state but I think what it really shows is that we in Nebraska together agree that DC is broken we in Nebraska agree that we need to send conservative common sense of values to DC and try to keep trying to change that place we in this state agree that politics is not the center of life when my family and I kicked off this campaign 10 months ago in a very very hot airplane hangar in Millard we pledged that we would travel all 93 counties again to listen and learn across this beautiful state and we've done that we've made some great memories but who could have thought 10 months ago that we'd be returning to those 93 counties not just in good times but also amid this nasty virus which is rican so much havoc both in terms of friends and neighbors that we know that are sick but also in terms of the economic devastation that so many communities are seeing because of this nasty virus and so my campaign team and I have been turned into volunteers a little bit deliver and hand sanitizer to nursing homes and first responders across all 93 counties again in the last month and I just want to say I'm grateful for the people in this state who constantly lift up our suffering neighbors in prayer my family and I continue to pray for those folks as well and on a night like this politics is not the center of things it's the way neighbor helps neighbor and the way people come together to love those who are the least fortunate and suffering among us so I just want to say Nebraska thank you it is it has been an honor to represent you the last five and a half years and my pledge to you is that I'm gonna keep trying to be the same independent minded conservative straight shooter that Nebraska deserves and I look forward to the next six months back out on the campaign trail continuing to listen to and learn from you thanks a lot Nebraska go big red

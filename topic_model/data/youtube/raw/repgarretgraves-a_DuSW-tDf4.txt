mr chairman um the the legislation today as you as you mentioned it has a unanimous consent agreement and and expect this package to move forward um i mentioned last time this committee met this committee has jurisdiction over energy that we are the natural resources committee um i want to read a quote from the the secretary of energy who says on on march 9th of this year so yes right now we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand yet all you've heard this administration do is go out there and in fact and members of congress in this committee go out there and blame vladimir putin for the for the gas hikes and electricity hikes to go blame 9000 permits that are sitting around as if people with record oil prices would would sit on stock and not want to produce it and sell it at the highest price they can mr chairman this administration when when president biden was campaigning he he said quote we're going to phase out fossil fuels he said quote i guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels let me say that again i guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels is what president biden said the secretary interior who sat right there at that table said quote i'm wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands mr chairman members of this committee all these names right there on that side of the aisle on your side of the aisle they voted against an amendment that we proposed in fact multiple times that said that the legislation that this committee was pushing could not result in an increased dependence upon energy from russia energy from china or other oil cartels you voted against it all the members all the democrat members of this committee voted against it yet what happened under this administration we saw 161 percent increase independence upon russian crude oil we we offered an amendment that said that legislation can't result in increased reliance on energy imports what happened every member yourself and and democrat members of this committee are posted we we proposed an amendment here here you all are touting yourselves as environmentalists we proposed an amendment that said that your energy policies could not result in increased global emissions because what happens when you overly restrict activities in the united states as you have done and this administration has done it results in more activities overseas that as uh mr obernolte mentioned a little while ago is contrary to environmental goals because not only does give people pink slips in the united states it increases global emissions your side voted against it and of course the amendment that said that you could not increase energy costs for economically disadvantaged communities or increase the likelihood of energy poverty your members voted against it congress daily just today congress falters and bid to ease pain at the pump headline today in congress daily national journal daily excuse me this isn't a republican publication is as you well know i remind you mr chairman we have a democrat speaker of the house we have a democrat senate majority leader and we have a democrat president when they say congress falters let's be very clear on who it is that they're talking about the reason that we have people at home that cannot afford to fuel their vehicles that cannot afford to pay their electricity bills by some measure we've seen numbers saying that one in every four americans are having to sacrifice other priorities in order to cover energy bills these are self-inflicted costs and let me say it again this white house and members of your side are out there saying oh this is a result of permits this is a result of vladimir putin this is the result of of energy companies uh being greedy if if i wanted to make money i'd be selling every drop of oil at these inflated prices that that your policies have created and so you create false narrative false excuses false examples and then you don't legislate on them but we rename parks and convey land this committee has jurisdiction over solving the problem over providing relief to those families that are struggling to make ends meet right now and by the way mr chairman it would result in lower global emissions i agree with secretary grant home who says we need to increase energy production to meet demand we need to increase energy production to meet demand that that's what we need to be doing right now 70 colleagues sent a letter uh to president biden last year on june 7th saying hey don't wave these nordstrom 2 pipelines it took putin going into to ukraine in order for that to happen the president his budget request explicitly says he's going to ban any corps of engineers project could be for flood protection people aren't going to get flood protection if the project also results in lower cost for oil and gas lower costs for oil and gas in other words he wants prices to go up and it's exactly what we're seeing mr chairman look i'm not going to tell you that our bills are perfect our ideas are perfect but i would like to ask you mr chairman if you would make a commitment to bring up energy legislation that will help to relieve the price at the pump the price that the electricity bills are folks are experiencing today including mr chairman i'd love to get your thoughts and and work with you on legislation that would include renewable energy

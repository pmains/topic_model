thank you for joining the California a democratic delegation we have been urging our president over the last several years to aggressively address the house of a catastrophe that exists in our country and especially in our state we know that one out of every foreclosed homes in this country are in California one of every 250 for housing units in California is foreclosed upon prepare to a nationwide average of one in every 634 houses we know that health is portfolio late is more than twice the national average and with homeowners underwater we expect fully a new wave of foreclosures to hit California we know and we've been told by economists and now most recently the Fed that we've got to do something that involves reduction of principle in order to get out of this spiral downward we have a debt overhang that is not only punishing families who did nothing wrong but is also preventing our economy from recovering we know last night that the president gave a terrific speech it reminded me of the yes we can a president who we supported so enthusiastically four years ago and we believe that the president the yes we can president i can do something about this principal reduction need he is the most powerful person in the freedom and we know that our president can help us in that proposal that we have been pursuing which is to allow for the reduction of principle in bankruptcy court we know that if we do that not only will homeowners save their homes but ultimately banks will lose less and the important takeaway on this is when when you lose your home not only does it have a devastating impact on your family but on average the homeowners next to you who have not lost their homes lose seven percent of value on on their homes as well so we will urge our present we asked to meet with the president we have available for all of you the timeline I think it's three pages of our efforts to get action on this pressing problem we think it's time have a face-to-face with our president we believe yes we can deal successfully with this foreclosure crisis have been interrupted by the boat on the floor of the house we have 1 minute and 11 seconds remaining on the top so we don't have a lot of time for questions if there is one reply to your GOP college in California are here today why well when you look at the clinical train what is realistically a bill that you can see passing it's not a bill that we're asking where the president has a we can't wave a gender where he uses the authority that the president possesses so you can't wait Californians can't wait anymore and we're asking the President to use the authority that he has to to obtain the principal reduction plan that we have urged he has the authority let's use it you saw the DeMarco letter on Friday to mr. coming that said 300 billion dollar cost to bring the 3 million homes that are underwater under training fannie freddie is that a discouraging figure that eyes that low has a justified well we looked at it and honestly it's hard to even soon where he got that number but our proposal has been to do the principal reduction is bankrupt support in order to get into bankruptcy for after the 2005 revision you have to be broke and so the banks are going to lose a hundred percent of the of the houses that are in bankruptcy court they're going to lose everything here's an opportunity for them to not lose everything and for homeowners to

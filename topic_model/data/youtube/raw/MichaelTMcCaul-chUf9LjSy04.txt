this morning we're going to turn now to Representative Mike McCall he is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee of course his Republican he also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee he is joining us this morning from Austin congressman what's your advice to the president right now no my advice would be to have a foreign policy as it relates to Syria I think you know there's no good outcome here we have a puppet of Iran who's used chemical weapons we have a rebel faction forces they're being hijacked now by Al Qaeda and I think the number one chief objective is even not to even pick sides here to pick the American side and that is to do everything we can to secure and destroy these chemical weapons my greatest fear is chairman of Homeland Security these weapons ending up in the wrong hands say some al-qaeda jihadist who we know are there fighting in the rebel forces and that could be a direct threat not only to Western interest in the Middle East but also directly to the homeland security of the United States so how do you go about doing that but we know the president one of the options being considered is cruise missiles would you go so far as to say we ought to put American troops in there to find and secure and destroy these weapons I don't think the American people have an appetite to put troops on the ground in Syria I do know that the military's ling out options for the president we do know there are four warships in off the coast of Syria missiles are an option to try to take out these chemical stockpiles and I think that's an option the president should be looking at but again my chief concern is excuse me is that we have allowed this to fester we've had a wait-and-see policy and hoping for the best and we had a time to support moderate forces in toppling the Assad regime and we failed to do that and now we have no good outcome and now we have a situation when we have a mecca every time I get briefed on this issue it gets worse because it's become a mecca for the jihadist they are traveling from all over the world al Qaeda factions in decir yeah to fight the Assad regime so I don't really see any good outcome here again the number one chief objective should be to secure and destroy these chemical weapons if we have to do it militarily them as a last resort then so be it I do not favor putting our men and women on the ground in Syria but you would support if the president orders cruise missiles an attack by cruise missiles you would support that what about also US military planes in there would you would you support that well and there's no guarantee the cruise missiles will be able to take out all the chemical weapons and we there's been a lot talk about a no-fly zone that may have been helpful a year ago a no-fly zone will only benefit the rebel forces again who are the rebel forces fifty percent of the rebel forces are al-qaeda and that and the jihadist so I don't know which side to pick here oh I know I want to pick the American side and protect them from any use of these chemical weapons against Americans so I'd go back to the question I asked you if he launches a cruise missile attack you will support that if the military advises the president that this could us destroy the chemical weapons stockpiles I would support that how do you see I just asked Senator Reid do you see any hope that we could get the Russians to join with us to try to broker some kind of a ceasefire now I think there was a there was a great opportunity for you know we need an international coalition to deal with this United States cannot do this alone and we had an opportunity with the Russians to do that but now the relationship between the White House and the Putin administration is so bad and like so much credibility that I think that's very difficult we have a shared interest I do believe that the Russians do not want these chemical weapons used as does the United States so weak it we do have an opportunity here that I hope the president will will try to take advantage of but one concern I have is this sort of you know the reset button with Putin is sort of reset us back to the Carter Administration where they the u.s. is more of a weak weaker power not negotiating out of strength but bit of out of weakness all right and I think that's the real problem here all right there is a problem there there's question about that thank you

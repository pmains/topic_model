joining us now is a Democratic member of that Judiciary Committee Karen bass of California who is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus thank you so much for joining me congresswoman first I mentioned that generally what the goal of the chairman is what is your goal for your questioning of robert muller my goal is for the american people to hear the truth you know the report has been out but given that it is so long and given the way that babar completely misrepresented what is in the report we're concerned that the American people really don't know what was in the molar report and so part of the questioning and the testimony tomorrow hopefully will bring to light what is in the report so if he doesn't go beyond the four corners of the report and give up put a little bit more meat on the bone on issues like why didn't he feel that he could exonerate the President on obstruction you think that's okay even even just saying the basics that are in the report are enough what well I do I mean I certainly hope he provides a little more context to the report but we're not expecting him to come in and go well beyond the report and say you know I wished I could go back and actually issue an indictment we're not expecting anything dramatic like that but you know what it is dramatic enough that we are focusing on the second volume of the report which goes over ten very specific examples of how the president attempted to obstruct justice and then cover it up and we feel just illustrating that alone will be a significant significant difference to is that the entirety of your focus the second volume or were you off yes ask about collusion no no no our focus is the second volume and then the end committee the intelligence committee will focus on bars of course ok so last week congresswoman you voted with Al Green on his impeachment resolution yes that you had been reluctant to say publicly that you support beginning impeachment proceedings given your vote last week that's changed no let me tell you exactly where I am I have always said that if something comes up on the floor that I would vote for it I totally recognize that what Al Green did last week was symbolic and I wanted to support his symbolic effort but when it comes to actually issuing impe articles of impeachment I feel like we have several committees that are still in the midst of an investigation and oversight and that that needs to be completed I want to see if we move to impeachment I want to see our leadership and our committee chairs all on the same page okay I want to turn to another committee that you sit on Foreign Affairs and I want you to listen to what the president said about Afghanistan during a meeting with the Pakistani leader yesterday at the White House okay we wanted to fight a war in Afghanistan and win it I could win that war and a week I just don't want to kill 10 million people Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the earth it would be gun it would be over in literally in ten days your reaction you know I mean I want to say that at some point I'm gonna stop being shocked by what the president says but I am shocked and horrified because I don't know what he is implying I'm not even sure that the president knows where Afghanistan is or what is going on over Afghanistan to say that oh we could win the war by wiping out ten million people not only is it completely irresponsible but it's embarrassing and you know I travel internationally all the time and I'm always put in a position of essentially apologizing because there's no way in the world I am going to go overseas in two and an irresponsible ignorant statement like that when it before I let you go ask you one question about politics about 2020 Joe Biden is out today with the new criminal justice reform proposal he started to get some endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus which you cherry is about a handful of endorsements are you ready to throw your support behind him or anybody else no you know as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus I have two of our members that are running for president and so I think it would be a little inappropriate I'm excited to hear about his proposal around criminal justice reform it is an extremely important issue for the Congressional Black Caucus so I'm hoping that he's going to issue some policy statements that we can all get behind okay congresswoman Karen bass thank you so much for your time good luck tomorrow thank you appreciate it

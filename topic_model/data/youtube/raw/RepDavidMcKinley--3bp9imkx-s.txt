uh thank you uh thank you anna um and thank you for the chance opportunity this chance for you uh to give me that chance to get back to the hospital be with her uh and and for ranking uh guthrie i appreciate it um look we all know there's a need for drug pricing reform we all i don't think there's any one of us would be arguing against that but pursuing this uh highly partisan hr3 uh is just an example of overreach on unfortunate overreach it occurs too often in washington and it gets in a way all the political observers that i've read about in washington in the press are saying that h.r 3 is not going to pass the senate so i've got to say fundamentally i'm saying why are we doing this why are we working together to try to pass something that can be signed into law uh so uh there are bipartisan solutions that were included in hr 19 so unless we unless we change the course this projection of this legislation we know how the story is going to pan out we've seen it before in immigration we've said we're about to see it in the infrastructure bill again uh overreach on that and we're seeing it now in this drug pricing these are all bipartisan issues that we would all work together on if we focused on what we need to get done focus on those but that's not what's happening with this uh but we were we were here to get solutions to it and i really want to get to it hr 3 unfortunately is an overreach uh and unfortunately it gives me the impression for those in the public that congress is seemingly willing to let american patients suffer this is a high-stakes political game we're into right now and if the senate doesn't pass it and it doesn't get to the president's desk or signature the american public is going to suffer i think they deserve better hr 19 includes caps for insulin deductibles it passes on rebates directly to state medicaid programs ensuring that pbms do not profit off government programs and it makes it unlawful for pay for delay practices whereby drug companies enter agreements with generics and biosimilar manufacturers to delay a competing drug coming to market these are all obviously these are just a sampling of the 40 bipartisan bills that we already passed out of our committee so we know that the loser here is going to be the american public if we don't get a bill to the president's desk for signature so i want it with my my question is now we know that utilizing generic medications well the best way to lower drug pricing but pbms and part d program plans are not covering generics so in this practice cost seniors four billion dollars new jersey four billion dollars in so miss sacks in your testimony you discuss some of these issues about the formulary design in part d the current system incentivizes uh placement of higher cost drug brand prices over generics and the bill that i'm working with coaster about uh 2846 addresses this issue by ensuring that we'll lower the price can you speak more of this issue of formulary design and how the current trend is is leading to increased cost for patients rather than lowering yes absolutely so without going too far into the details of the part d benefit design as this committee is well aware the current incentives unfortunately may lead both manufacturers and pbms and plans to increase or drive up prices over time rather than to reduce them and so the part d redesign elements in hr3 and also in hr 19 are important for minimizing some of those incentives however they only work where there are generic or biosimilar opportunities available for patients and in many of these cases there are not so in my testimony i also give the example of a drug like humira which was first approved in 2002 and has lively biosimilar competition in europe but where we still have no competition today and won't for another two years yet it's one of the top 10 selling drugs in part d the idea that we would negotiate the price of a drug like humera and be able to obtain better prices for patients and our payers is at the heart of hr3 but it's not part of hr 19. if i could get i want to ask that last question to dr gupta because the united states we're still across this country still experiencing a wave of drug overdoses uh at a higher rate than we've ever seen before uh so my question doctor it with when how would hr3 affect the price and discovery of new non-addictive pain medication and treatment assisted medically assisted treatments how would that how would hr3 affect that can you share some of your thoughts thank you congressman yes so i think the uh the uh the need for developing non-opiate non-addicting pain medications is one that the entire biopharma industry is is is working hard to tackle you know we're aware of uh both the need um for for treating pain but also the need of us creating alternatives to opiates um it's early stages still there's there's not there's several things in development that we don't know if they're going to work yet and i would caution that price controls which by the way you know don't ensure that we'll be passing savings directly onto patients would really um put a lot of that work at risk okay thank you my time's expired and i just want to say auntie anna and and brett thank you i want to be with my wife so god bless

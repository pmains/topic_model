Thank You mr. chairman thank you to each of you for being here good good to see you again let me say a special thanks to the men and women a border patrol the men and women of ice for for doing an exceptionally difficult and exceptionally important job at a time that that is particularly challenging and and and we are grateful for the men and women of law enforcement and and the work you do every day to keep us safe chief chief Provost can you give us the most up-to-date statistics on how many people are crossing the border illegally and and what the trend has been that you've been seeing certainly senator overall fiscal year-to-date 460 thousand two hundred and ninety four that's Border Patrol southwest border apprehensions just in the month of April for border patrol southwest border ninety eight thousand nine hundred and seventy seven and the trend it is increasing day by day we had a group just last week of over fifty or a day where we apprehended over 5200 people we are seeing groups in this we've actually apprehended a hundred and forty eight large groups of individuals compare that to thirteen last fiscal year into the fiscal year before that and when I say a large group that's a hundred or more people in one group 148 of those groups as you know well the demographic is changing as well we have apprehended over a hundred and sixty-five thousand individuals from Guatemala one hundred and thirty three thousand from Honduras forty-two thousand from El Salvador currently 80 percent of our apprehensions are other than Mexican nationals which is a huge demographic shift from where we were just a few years ago seventy-four percent are from the northern triangle and in FY 18 we apprehended individuals from over a hundred and forty different countries and this fiscal year to date we've already apprehended individuals from a hundred and twenty-seven countries in your judgment to what extent does catch-and-release contribute to this this massive increase in illegal crossings it is a huge poll factor in my opening statement I said my biggest concern is that we will have to start releasing single adults if ice cannot get enough bed space what we have seen with family units since we have had to release all family units we have seen the numbers grow exponentially I am highly concerned about what's happening with single adults those numbers are increasing dramatically over a hundred and sixty seven thousand single adults everybody's focused on the humanitarian crisis we have a crisis here as well those individuals have to we have to maintain the ability to detain those individuals through their immigration hearings and we need a way to safely and securely detain families together through the process as well in March commissioner Macklin and testified before this committee that border patrol had identified over 1,700 cases where children crossed the border with adults claiming to be a family unit only for the border patrol to discover that the child and the adult were were not related can you provide any update on those numbers our fraud numbers are over 3,500 now year-to-date fiscal year-to-date that includes individuals who are not related whatsoever it also may include individuals who claim to be juveniles but then we determined that they are actually adults themselves as well as some they have the breakdown of how many are fraudulent family units not if you get the over 3,500 so far so I've heard reports that the cartels are now engaged in the practice of renting children to what extent has Border Patrol seen that occurring and and and it is increasing we have seen cases happen HSI is focused on this as well now and have task forces that are working with us just last week actually an office of field operations officer who was assisting Border Patrol agents identified a case just like that and and worked hand-in-hand with HSI on that investigation where the child had admitted to being basically sold by his mother any of the other witnesses care to elaborate on yes man factors my colleagues in HSI to to reiterate what the chief is talking about as far as they are moving some of their resources to additional resources to the border that being victims awareness specialists special agents and I think I was in around April 15th up through May 3rd in there conducting their interviews of families they identified roughly 3 out of every 10 families to not to be families in other words fraud being conducted also let me ask you briefly just because the talk time is expiring would you agree that that congressional loopholes that that make essentially a child a get-out-of-jail-free card no incentivize cartels abusing children and putting them in these circumstances absolutely it's alarming what we are as we are turning resources to this problem because first and foremost the welfare the children is the most important to all of us for our components and and and to the Chiefs words I'm really concerned once we start digging into this as to the level of exploitation these children being recycled fraudulent documents another problem if I may adults posing as children we've had cases where individuals are saying there's 17 16 we're putting them in an HHS care only to find out after further investigation there is oldest in their late 20s I mean the fraud the exploitation is rampant and it's not stopping please keep this committee advised as as those data that evidence is developed because I think this is an issue of particular concern to this committee thank you

senator tester Thank You mr. chairman ranking member Brown I want to thank you for being here today the director made Mulvaney appreciate you appearing from the Banking Committee you had previously referenced that you have the authority to ask the Fed for some dollars what you do yeah how much do you intend on asking the Fed when it comes up in October we haven't done that analysis senator I will tell you because we just got into a new quarter I asked for ninety eight point five million dollars at the end of March and that will be sufficient to run the the bureau for the next fiscal quarter okay how does that compare with the previous director that is the same amount he asked for in 2015 it's less than he asked for the last couple of years the difference is primarily we have some cost savings related to the hiring freeze but we're also spending down what was started off as a hundred seventy million dollar reserve fund that I didn't think we needed okay thank you mr. vain you come to this position with a record of being a deficit Hawk and I think that's true fry yeah but I will tell you that it is somewhat troubling that and it just goes on with the ranking members questions that your chiefest staff is getting paid forty seven thousand dollars more per year more more than the members of Congress most federal judges a vice president and cabinet secretaries more than you you've got Pleasant political desease that are making right at or right next to two hundred forty thousand dollars that doesn't jive with being a fiscal conservative can you explain to me why you had to pay these salaries to get the political appointees sure that that's the system that y'all set up in the statute I know but you have the flexibility to pay whatever you want by average compensation is 195,000 I know but your political appointees are making a lot more than that yeah again I do have the authority statutory to bring in political appointees and I'm also with the senior people that I hired and most of folks that you referenced our senior team um the the practice of the previous administrator director it was to pay those folks as much as he possibly could and he did I did not want to set up a situation so what you're saying we have been more flexibility for your chief of staff to pay him nearly two hundred and sixty thousand dollars when Cordray's chief received two hundred and twelve thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars but the folks who are actually working with their senior partners are making the exact same thing that they are talking about your political appointees because it looks like favoritism no I I'm saying my political appointees I mentioned I don't know if you're not that the the system at OMB marries a political person with a career person and at the CFPB I thought it was important to those folks make exactly the same and they do that's how we said that's how we arrived at those numbers well it is well it's I'll just tell you from my perspective and I think that the debt is important to address I think it smacks of impropriety I would welcome bipartisan review of our compensation structure over at the bureau I can't tell you the number of folks who I know on the hill and where folks who I'd know in the White House who are begging for jobs at the bureau because of how much money we pay I don't think it's necessary to pay that we pay it because that's what the statute says all I know is when I look at the numbers and you can talk about how your parent how your not more the Corddry was in our paties chief of staff two hundred twelve thousand bucks you stepped in being a physical conservative budget hawk and you're paying them two hundred sixty and my overall budget will still be sixteen million dollars less I know your overall budget will be that but the truth is is it I think it's good to be conservative you need to be consistent you can't be conservative when convenient that's all I want to talk about the budget process we had secretary Purdue in front of Appropriations Committee yesterday the administer secretary Purdue about cutting crop insurance subsidies significantly I think by by almost half by the way which is going to price a bunch of folks out of the business in the crop insurance saying I think Purdue gets it I think the problem may be at OMB and I'm going to tell you as a farmer you reduce those safety net programs and food security becomes a problem because farmers won't buy that insurance they will go broke and I guarantee you with unequivocally if we're dependent on multinational corporations to feed this country we've got a natural security issue can you tell me the thought process that went into reducing crop insurance subsidies Center I'm having to put take my bureau hat now put my own hat on perfectly candid with you I'm not as well prepared on that as I was when I met before you and the budget committee but I seem to recall we had this similar conversation no I'm not a but you're not okay and the ask the question and the point of the matter was that we tried to tailor our benefits to farms that had below a quarter of a million dollars of adjusted gross income to speak to the exact group that you just talked about to encourage family farming but small farming that's not what the President's budget proposal does and I'm going to tell you Purdue understands agriculture I hope you have people in your agency that understand family farm agriculture otherwise I am Telling You we will see a mass exodus off the land it will hurt our security in this country it is critically important last thing and then I'll give up the mic when I go around and talk to folks in Montana agriculture is a number-one industry they say one thing to me first thing out of the mouth when we talk about reauthorizing the farm program don't screw up crop insurance it's our safety net it will put us out of business and I'm talking about the little guys are telling me that okay thank you thank you sir

Mr Speaker let's cut to the chase I support this legislation it wasn't an easy decision but I believe that Democrats are able get a lot of policies into the bill that it's good for middle-class it's going to help 16 million Americans out of poverty in New Jersey 435,000 children and 219,000 families will lose some or all of their working family tax credits if we don't do this this package includes it a bill introduced by my friend Tom Reed and myself to help put people back to work our tax credit for businesses who hire long-term unemployed Americans and we've abandoned them let's face it that will help those families who haven't yet felt the effects of our economic recovery another bill mr. Riker from Washington I caught it supports our nation's hard-working teachers you heard him speak about it just several minutes ago both of these bills are part of the tax package before us today and as someone said mr. bloom an hour from Morgan said these things pass routinely anyway who the heck we kidding the enemy of the good is the perfect over and over again we prove that here on this floor an important provision allowing public safety officers to withdraw from their pensions when they retire early without a tax penalty is included in this package there are provisions that support mass transit commuters small businesses low-income housing families paying for college economic development and the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our biggest forces against poverty in this country in this nation I can't say enough about the significance of making these enhanced credits permanent but when faced with the choice between these important priorities for families for teachers for Public Safety officers I simply can't in good conscience vote against them to prove a point that not everything is in there including the kitchen sink the bill is far from perfect and they could close you let me say this mr. Chairman I think this has been a civil debate and that's healthy for us all of us regardless of work what happens in the vote Thank You gentleman Sam has expired gentleman from Michigan reserves gentleman from tech

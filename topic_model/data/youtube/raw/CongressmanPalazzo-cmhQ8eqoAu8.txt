it's for one minute Thank You mr. speaker the American people are sick and tired of talk they want action for three years now Senate Democrats have blocked votes on bills important to all Americans they blindly supported the president's failed policies and have shielded him from having to defend his policies to the American people House Republicans have heard the American cry for help we fought to repeal Obamacare we fought to stop the reckless Iranian nuclear agreement and once again we are fighting to defend the defenseless we've passed budgets that will reduce our national debt stop job-killing regulations provide for our national defense and get Americans working again Republicans control Congress we have better solutions to the problems that face our nation it is time for the president to go on record for his opposition to common sense solutions that put America first this can only happen if the Senate employs the nuclear option it is time to change the Senate rules and forces president in the Senate to work for the American people instead of against them I yield back

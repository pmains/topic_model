hi I'm Congressman Steve Stivers and I wanted to talk today about the opioid crisis and how it's affecting our kids today is national foster care day I want to recognize the many many volunteers that are looking out for our kids that are put in the foster care system many of whom are there as a result of this opioid crisis and here too the foster parents thank you to the caseworkers thank you to all those people who are allowing these kids to make sure they're safe and that they can be a kid and that they're shown that they are loved thank you for helping our children I have been a foster parent proximately for years I have been in and out of doing foster care since 2013 for just over 20 years thirteen years I've been working in child welfare since 2007 I'm a licensing specialist or an Assessor with the National Youth advocate program for the last six years I have learned that caring for these kids it really makes a difference in their lives even if we have them for one month or three years we planted a seed we've loved on them and we can help them become a better person a lot about love and letting go that's probably the biggest is just patience and giving them time to adjust to your house I think the system is challenging I mean it really is workers have a lot of cases they have a lot of kids the sheer amount of kids in care versus the caseworkers available it's not a ratio that's good enough by trying the flowers in the day to service appropriately all the children that are coming into care sometimes foster parents aren't heard our we try to advocate for them Oster parents are we are with them every day taking them to their appointments and being there when you know they're sad and struggling and to have a voice for someone to listen to us is probably the hardest part of being a foster parent like it feels like I am not doing it right or you know I'm missing something somewhere - despite all your best efforts you feel like it still never done there's a stopping point that you have to do for yourself for self-care so that you can't keep giving the next day when it when it works how you think it should and everybody kind of does come together and it's very rewarding it's one of the first homes I of our license at biological children had a ten-year-old and a teenage son and they got this little baby Dino and foster parents and biological parents are able to work together love the baby and blue guy was reunified with the grandmother it was great it wasn't a child's best interest I think the one thing that people say to me all times well I just couldn't give the kids back when both set of parents can come together and create that benefits the child it's not about keeping them or giving them back that's about the book I said and you talk to him since and they're casual or fine once he was here this weekend is that I was able to love them and care for them until their family good things times when you're like this is why I'm doing this is to see a mom or a family really make the changes they they need to do to see how much she loves her kids and then she looked really really hard to do the things that she wanted to do you guys see each other like all the time oh yeah we need halfway through the town at the kids for the weekend and he comes over for Christmas and we still see each other there very much families and it's so the family that they have built that's what kind of keeps pushing me every single day we are here to build families on love and compassion and understanding and not through biology and this is from the low orphan boy and it says what makes a family is the or the absence of tragedy or the ability to hide from misfortune but the courage to overcome it and from the broken pass you can make a new beginning and being part of a family I think is just whether it's something hard or something happy just experiencing that with you as a family and seeing how you can clear that as a family is really helpful to them what I didn't know is how amazing kids are are incredibly smart and resilient and resourceful and through everything they have been through for them to be forgiving and loving and still want to have a fun childhood is nothing short of really remarkable in watching the growth that they make but we have had some things that overcome so just watching them grow much in the progress they make some of us that are the hardest to love needed the most so I think sometimes when kids come in there they're angry and you just have to be patient with them how they are isn't how they can be austere care can be scary the word foster care is scary but knowing that you can make a difference in a child's life the school rewarding when you just have all that extra look to get up and give and receive back it's and it's not always hard it's not always easy it's not always happy it's not always sad it's it's everything it's really it's not always easy but it's intended for others a lot of experience and it's it will make you a better person you have an opportunity to change the world one child at a time but the change can't happen without you those foster carrots are doing an incredible job unfortunately Ohio has the distinction of being second in the country on opioid related deaths almost 5,000 last year we need to do more and we're working to fight that epidemic putting a huge strain on our foster care system and a strain on those volunteer foster parents there's much more we need to do to solve this opioid crisis I've recently introduced a bill called the results Act which will ensure that people in treatment and recovery get the benefit of evidence-based medicine that they're not getting today the other bill that I've led on with Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Democrat is helping with neonatal abstinence syndrome that's babies that are born with drugs in their system we need to make sure we protect those vulnerable population you know obviously we want to solve the opioid crisis and really they're not those kids with their parents if we can make it happen but we need to do all these things and it's important today that we recognized the many foster parents that are giving up their time they're loved for these children that are affected by the drug crisis

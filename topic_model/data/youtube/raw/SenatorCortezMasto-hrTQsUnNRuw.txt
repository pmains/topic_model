thank you Thank You Madame chair and ranking member for this important hearing and thank you all for being here today is it is it cefalu yes ma'am dr. cefalu I couldn't agree with you more your last statement I never understood why we work so hard we spend a lot of money to create some a cure for acute diseases for individuals to save lives and then we price it out of their hands the very people that we're creating the cure for it we can't they can't get the drug it makes no sense to me and so that's why my fight has been to address the the high cost of prescription drugs in general and how we put them in the hands of individuals who actually need them and can't afford them in Nevada we recently passed a diabetes drug transparency bill it was passed last year and it requires drug manufacturers to explain each factor that contributed to increases in the price of diabetes drugs the percentage of the total increase attributed to each factor and an explanation of the role of each factor in the increase the bill would also require PBMs to disclose rebates negotiated with drug manufacturers and what rebates are distributed to insurers dr. green I'm curious what your reaction is to this transparency law and in dr. cefalu as well and do you think that a national drug price transparency law similar to the one that Nevada has would help us understand why drug prices have become so high thank you for that question senator I've been following the great interest the activity in the Nevada Legislature and also states across the country who have tried to understand where the state government can take up the cause of off-patent drug affordability and prescription drug affordability in general and in the state of Maryland the Attorney General proposed a bill that became law last year making a price gouging unconscionable price hikes and off-patent prescription drugs illegal and actionable this was the law in the state of Maryland until just a few weeks ago when appellate court in the Fourth Circuit ruled under the dormant Commerce Clause that it was unconstitutional which is to say saying that the extent to which the state can successfully act who defend the interests of its consumers and not paying unconscionably high price of prescription drugs was limited to the scope of federal activity now that's being appealed by the Attorney General and personally it was a two-to-one vote I actually think there's there's a really credible legal argument for that that willing to be overturned and for the law to be reinstated I'm not a lawyer I'm a physician and I think that right now does the law of the land suggesting that that that this is an arena in which only the federal government only Congress really can take the proper actions to help ensure a more transparent system and understanding why prices are increasing I had had high hopes for state initiatives and I still do for the Nevada initiative but the finding of this recent fourth fourth fourth District ruling 4th Circuit ruling has caused me to consider even more the importance of Congress taking up this issue I agree and let me just say that the Nevada law as well is being challenged by the pharmaceutical industry and it will go through the courts right now and it would be in the ninth circuit but but it's a clear example of where the states are taking action to protect their residents and their individuals because there is an issue that I think we all hear every time we go to our state from a high cost prescription drugs something has to be done to address this and I think that a transparency in general to shine a light on what is happening and why the costs are there and what's causing these high costs is so important to address the issue so I appreciate your comments yes dr. seth lu so i appreciate that we also believe again from this exercise its transparency throughout the supply chain not just one or two stakeholders the entire stakeholder issue is opaque it's complicated and so we would support transparency throughout the chain first and foremost transparency is not going to get the job done that will shed a light on what the problems are and then we can address long-term solutions so again transparency all the way through the supply chain so we understand the flow of money who's profiting who's not profiting but once again at the end of the day it's the patient at the point of cell is not benefiting I think that's the important thing to consider here I agree with you thank you I noticed my time is almost up thank you all for again for this important discussion today I appreciate it

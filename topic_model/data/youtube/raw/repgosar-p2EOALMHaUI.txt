in our dialogue right before you said that the service doesn't consider jobs so the 1,700 jobs in Mojave County and the 75 million dollars in economic output associated with the willow Beach hatchery that's now are in jeopardy are a result of terminating the child stocking program the annual production of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of rainbow trout that just doesn't matter to the US Fish and Wildlife Service well certainly matters these are jobs for our fellow citizen you said it doesn't matter I mean early you testified that it just is never put into the equation may I clarify sir what we're talking about is we put out a draft blueprint to manage the National Fish Hatchery system the matrix of decisions recommendations that we include in there because no decisions were made yet did not factor into the economic impact as one of our criteria we looked at Biological outcomes instead and you're pointed out and the other leaders are maybe Fish and Wildlife Service up you guys have it all wrong you should be factoring in some economic impact to your decision as well I can't go that would be that would be really nice if it was really something true it's not you know because you're taking it right off of your litany off of this of this this this this playbook and you're not engaging the state wildlife services Game and Fish you're not get dialoguing with the state stakeholders local municipalities so that's a bunch of crap 4,000 jobs 60 million dollars in payroll does does the Fish and Wildlife Service once again consider these figures before terminating Nehring about trout stocking programs if we've used the report as it's currently written it wouldn't be one of the factors yes or no no no boy I mean this is just and this is absurd to me the Fish and Wildlife Service stated in a letter to the subcommittee sent on may 30th 2014 that the reason for terminating the rainbow trout stocking program at the time was that the agency didn't have 1.5 to 8.5 million dollars to repair a broken water line and keep the trout stocking program holding I'd like to put exhibit 2 into the record recent engineering reports indicate that these estimates were a gross exaggeration and the broken water line only cost $100,000 to fix yes the water now let's listen very carefully if the water supply line is fixed does the Fish and Wildlife Service plan to reinstate the trout propagation program at Willow beach a tree I believe we would yes oh great I'm liking that we want to be a little more certain that the answer should be yes total in your testimony you dismiss one aspect of my bill and say as as announced in November we do not intend to close any hatcheries in fiscal year 2014 you failed to mention that enactment won 13-6 enacted by the Congress prevent such closures are you aware of that yes I am congressman did the Fish and Wildlife Service even discuss closing fish hatcheries in fiscal year 14 prior to the release of November 13 report with Congress internally there were some but make sure you understand the law oh yes we do mr. Cohn so we got a problem here right yes or no yes we violated the law yes or no if we had closed one yes you closed them prior to 14 right 13 I am not aware of us unilaterally closing for a good station congressman if if if there wasn't then why did congressman Scott Tipton feel compelled to write Dan Ashe a lengthy letter on September 9th 2013 and stayed in part I am told that based on the review of the propagation hatcheries within NFS H that there will likely be some closures of hatcheries nationwide I would strongly urge you to keep the lead ville National Fish Hatchery open meter reports also indicate that there will likely be hatcheries closings correct well that's up and I'm not trying to give you a beer crack answer but that's a complicated question to answer it no no if we're gonna close hatcheries you got to come talk to us under this current appropriation law yes we do and and so everything that you have told us I mean you don't take into consideration economies you're supposed to be talking to state call you don't do that why would I even try it why would we trust you congressman uh we clearly are off to a very bad start with you and all I can pledge is going forward we've done just with me they're on a bad footing with a lot of people I understand I mean we can know a better job and we will and we would appreciate your giving us that opportunity to come back and relearn that trust and had a bit of credibility with you and the other elected I want you to turn to your left and I want to turn to right behind you to two people that you better be very familiar with chairman Manziel and chairman hing Angus I want you to make sure that you make sure that those people on your speed dial yes Harmon and yield back met mr. Manziel at a waffle meetings previously in the West

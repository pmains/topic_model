I could not be more excited for this once-in-a-generation opportunity no more bailouts handouts or lobbyist loopholes this tax reform is about keeping more of your money in your pocketbooks and this week this very day we've taken a huge step forward in delivering that promise for the past three years my wife my family and I have dedicated our lives to listing the Kansas we've circled the district maybe nine ten times we've had 55 town halls over 70 roundtables I've listened and listened but more than just listening the people of Kansas want me to be their voice in Congress and that's why we're here today to celebrate the passing of legislation of historic tax reform that's not been accomplished in thirty-one years can you imagine 90% of Kansans being able to do their taxes on the back of a postcard the average hard-working family of four with the median salary of fifty nine thousand dollars is going to get $1,200 back in their pockets this will be definite reform definite relief for hardworking Kansas many people ask me how the current tax plan is different than Kansas well frankly it's it's apples and oranges it's it's day and night don't let Nancy Pelosi for you this is a completely different scenario while Kansas lowered the the LLC rate to zero our tax plan lowers it to 25% additionally we're gonna lower the Secor rate down to 20% this is gonna fuel jobs it's going to grow the economy that's going to put more more money in the Kansans pockets by raising their wages another common question I get from folks is what is what does your tax reform gonna do to the national debt and like everybody I'm very concerned about our national debt it's the biggest threat to national security that we have what what I think is going to happen is that this tax reform is going to grow jobs and going to grow the economy Washington DC doesn't have a tax problem it has a spending problem in addition to tax reform we have to start making this government leaner and more efficient we're going to create a healthier economy so you can keep more of your hard-earned income simpler fair more jobs higher wages that's what this tax reform bill will do [Music]

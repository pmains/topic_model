THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. MR. MENENDEZ: MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE, SENATOR WARREN, FOR BEGINNING THIS DEBATE, AND WE WILL MOVE TO A CONSENT SHORTLY. AND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR WORKING TOGETHER WITH ME ON THIS MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. MR. PRESIDENT, AT THIS MOMENT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AFTER THE REPEAL OF ROE V. WADE. MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES. IT'S A HEART-WRENCHING CHOICE. NO DOUBT ONE OF THE HARDEST DECISIONS ANYONE WILL EVER HAVE TO MAKE. BUT IN THE MIDST OF THIS, IN THIS POST-ROE LANDSCAPE WE FIND OURSELVES IN, THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS, AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED HERE, KNOWN AS CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS, WHO ARE PREYING ON THE FEARS OF WOMEN. EXACERBATING THE FIERCE CAUSED BY THE DOBBS DECISION. CRISIS PREGNANCY DECISIONS CLOAK THEMSELVES IN BENIGN LANGUAGE ABOUT, QUOTE, PROVIDING ANSWERS AND, QUOTE, OFFERING ADVICE. BUT THEY HAVE AN AGENDA; NAMELY, TO STEER WOMEN AWAY FROM ABORTION THROUGH A COMBINATION OF GUILTY, HARASSMENT, AND DOWNRIGHT LIES. CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS PRETEND THAT THEY ARE THERE TO EDUCATE, SUPPORT, AND EMPOWER WOMEN FACING UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES AND YET AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR WEBSITES IN VERY SMALL PRINT YOU'LL FIND THE DISCLAIMER THAT LAYS IT ALL BEAR -- CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS DO NOT OFFER OR REFER FOR PREGNANCY TERMINATIONS OR BIRTH CONTROL. INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL AND/OR MEDICAL ADVICE. THAT'S THE DISCLAIMER. YOU CAN HARDLY READ IT, BUT IT'S THERE. THIS IS PULLED STRAIGHT FROM THE WEB PAGE OF ONE CENTER IN MY STATE. I'LL REPEAT THAT ENDING AGAIN. INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL AND/OR MEDICAL ADVICE. IRONICALLY, THIS IS THE ONLY OBJECTIVE AND ACCURATE PIECE OF INFORMATION YOU'LL FIND ON THE SITE AND OTHERS LIKE IT. AS SENATOR WARREN MENTIONED, CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A PHYSICIAN OR A REGISTERED NURSE ON STAFF. VERY FEW OF THEM DO. THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTIVE CARE OR EVEN STICK TO MEDICALLY SOUND CLAIMS. AND BECAUSE THEY CLAIM TO ONLY PROVIDE SO-CALLED EDUCATION SERVICES, THEY CAN PROMOTE BLATANT LIES ABOUT HOW ABORTION INCREASES RISK FOR BREAST CANCER. MR. PRESIDENT, WOMEN IN AMERICA DO NOT DESERVE TO BE LIED TO. THEY SHOULDN'T BE PREYED UPON DURING MOMENTS OF VULFLEXIBILITY OR@AT ANY OTHER -- OF VULNERABILITY OR AT ANY OTHER TIME. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SHIFT TO WHAT'S REAL OR WHAT'S NOT AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PARSE THROUGH THE CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE OF CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS THAT PROMOTE AN ANTICHOICE AGENDA. OUR BILL, IT WOULD EMPOWER THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION TO ISSUE RULES PROHIBITING FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF ABORTION SERVICES. IT WOULD ALLOW THE FTC TO PENALIZE THOSE WHO ARE FOUND IN VIOLATION, AND IT WOULD PROVIDE GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS WHO PROFIT FROM THE PAIN OF UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES, SOMETIMES WHILE DOUBLE DIPPING ON THE TAXPAYERS' DIME. SENATOR WARREN AND I ARE LEADING THIS BILL TO END THE PRACTICE OF DISRECEIVING WOMEN AND GIRLS THROUGH FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. WE ARE LEADING THIS BILL TO PROMOTE TRUTH IN ADVERTISEMENT, TO END MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION AND TO PROTECT WOMEN FROM HARASSMENT. YES, HARASSMENT. AS SENATOR WARREN SAID, CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS HAVE NO DUTY TO UPHOLD HIPAA PRICE OF PROTECTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN GIVE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH AND THE STATUS OF YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR CONDITION. YOU DO THAT THINKING THAT YOU'RE IN A MEDICAL CENTER, AND NOW YOU'VE GIVEN ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT HAS ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES TO IT IF IT'S MISUSED TO THESE DECEPTIVE ENTITIES. AND AFTER DIVULGING PERSONAL INFORMATION, THEN THEY CAN FREELY SELL IT TO SCAMMERS WHO WOULD WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. SO I DOES MY COLLEAGUES, LET'S END THE ASSAULT ON BODILY AUTONOMY AND THE RIGHT TO ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE CARE. LET'S END THE BARRAGE OF ATTACKS ON THEIR HEALTH CARE. LET'S END DECEPTION IN ANY DELIVERY OF ANY SERVICE. LET'S END THE FRAUD IN ANY DELIVERY OF ANY, QUOTE-UNQUOTE, SERVICE. LET'S END THE BARRAGE OF TAC ON THEIR HEALTH CARE. JOIN US IN PASSING OUR BILL SO THAT IN THE HARDEST MOMENT OF THEIR LIVES, WOMEN ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY CAN REST ASSURED IN KNOWING THAT WHEN THEY ARE GET SOMETHING THE TRUTH, NOT SOME BIASED AGENDA PRETENDING FOR MEDICAL ADVICE, NOT SOME ONE- SIDED TALKING POINT THAT STEERS THEM TOWARDS ONE AGENDA. THE TRUTH, TRUTH. PREGNANT WOMEN IN AMERICA DESERVE THE TRUTH, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. TO OPPOSE OUR UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST IS TO PROMOTE DECEPTION, IS TO PROMOTE FRAUD. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY WANTS TO DO THAT. WITH THAT, I YIELD THE FLOOR TO THE SENATOR TO MAKE THE CONSENT REQUEST. MS. WARREN: [INAUDIBLE] MR. MENENDEZ: OKAY. AS IF IN LEGISLATIVE SESSION, MR. PRESIDENT, I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE BE DISCHARGED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF S. 469 AND THE SENATE PROCEED TO ITS IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION. FURTHER, THAT THE WOMEN BE CONSIDERED READ A THIRD TIME AND PASS AND THAT THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER BE CONSIDERED MADE AND LAID UPON THE TABLE, WITH NO INTERVENING ACTION OR DEBATE. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS THERE OBJECTION? MR. MARSHALL: RESERVING THE RIGHT TO OBJECT -- THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM KANSAS. S. MR. MARSHALL: MR. PRESIDENT, I RISE IN OBJECTION TO THIS BILL AS IT IS AN OUTRAGEOUS TAC ON LIFE-AFFIRMING PREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTERS. AS A PRO-LIFE OBSTETRICIAN, I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE AND HONOR OF DELIVERING OVER 5,000 BABIES, AND I CAN ATTEST TO THE LIFESAVING CRITICAL AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND RESOURCES THESE CENTERS PROVIDE MOMS IN NEED. THESE PRO-LIFE CHARITIES NOT ONLY HELP WOMEN IN POVERTY CHOOSE LIFE INSTEAD OF ABORTION, BUT THEY ALSO HELP WOMEN AFTER BABIES ARE BORN. THEY HELP PROVIDE CLOTHING AND DIAPERS AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND NUTRITION. AND SOMETIMES JUST PUTTING AN ARM AROUND THEIR SHOULDERS AND HELP HELPING GET TO THEIR NEXT APPOINTMENT. THIS LEGISLATION ESSENTIALLY TO SHUT THEM DOWN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY PURPORTEDLY SPREAD DISINFORMATION. UNDER THIS BILL, CHARITIES COULD BE FIND $500,000 OR 50% OF THE REVENUES EARNED BY THE ENTITY OF THE CHARITY FOR VIOLATING THE ACT'S PROVISION ON DISINFORMATION RELATED TO ABORTION. NOW, I ASK YOU -- WHO WOULD DETERMINE WHAT COUNTS AS PROHIBITED DISINFORMATION? THERE'S NO DOUBT IT WOULD BE BUREAUCRATS WITH A PRO-ABORTION AGENDA. IS THIS NOT AN INFRINGEMENT ON OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS? THIS BILL WOULD TURN THE FTC INTO A NATIONAL ABORTION DISINFORMATION BOARD WITH AN AGENDA OF SUPPRESSING SPEECH AND SPREADING PRO-ABORTION PROPAGANDA. NATIONALLY PRO-LIFE PREGNANT RESOURCE CENTERS ARE A GOOD THING. IN SOME STATES BY AS MANY AS 11-1. NO KNOWING THAT MANY WOMEN CHOOSE ABORTION BECAUSE THEY FEEL PRESSURE THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER OPTION. THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT HAS PLACED TREMENDOUS RESOURCES INTO THESE CENTERS WHICH EXIST TO OFFER ALTERNATIVES TO ABORTION, USUALLY AT NO COST. BUT RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA, PREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE THE ONES THAT NEED OUR PROTECTION, AS ZEALOUS PRO-ABORTION TERRORISTS HAVE SPENT THE PAST TWO MONTHS FIREBOMBING AND VANDALIZING PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS ALL ACROSS THE NATION. THESE CRIMINALS, THESE TERRORISTS DO HE SO NOT IN THE NAME OF ABORTION ACCESS BUT IN RETRIBUTION FOR DARING TO STAY ON THE SIDE OF GOOD IN THE SPIRITUAL BATTLE. THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 60 PREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTERS AND OFFICES OF PRO-LIFE GROUPS THAT ATTACKED AND VANDALIZED SINCE THE DRAFT SUPREME COURT OPINION WAS LEAKED IN MAY. PRO-ABORTION DOMESTIC TERRORISTS HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CRIMES. CONGRESS SHOULD BE TAKING UP THE LEGISLATION INSTEAD TO AFFIRM, GROW, AND PROTECT PREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTERS AND PRAISE ITS CITIZENS FOR THEIR GREAT WORK FOR VOLUNTEERING TO HELP AND SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY. AND ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND SHOULD ABIDE BY HIS OATH OF OFFICE AND PROSECUTE THE LAW. THEREFORE, I OBJECT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: OBJECTION IS HEARD. MR. MENENDEZ: MR. PRESIDENT? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. MR. MENENDEZ: I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOUND A QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE THROUGH THE CHAIR. DOES THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALLOW YOU TO PROMOTE FRAUD? DOES THE FIRST AMENDMENT ALLOW YOU TO PROMOTE DECEPTION? IS IT GREAT WORK TO LIE TO SOMEONE ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE PROVIDING THEM? IS IT GREAT WORK TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO GET YOUR VITAL HEALTH INFORMATION, BRIEFING THAT YOU ARE A HEALTH PROVIDER AND THEN BEING ABLE TO USE THAT PRIVATE INFORMATION? MR. MARSHALL: MR. PRESIDENT? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM KANSAS. MRS. MURRAY: TO ANSWER MY COLLEAGUE, THE FRAUD AND THE DECEPTION IS OCCURRING IN THE ABORTION CLINICS. I CAN TELL YOU STORY AFTER STORY OF PATIENTS CRYING IN MY OFFICE WHO WENT TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR A PREGNANCY TEST AND WERE SCHEDULED FOR AN ASS BORTION, COMING TO -- FOR AN ABORTION COMING TO MY OFFICE WONDERING, DO I HAVE TO DO THIS ABORTION? THESE WOMEN AREN'T BEING TOLD ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS OF THESE ABORTION PROCEDURES. THEY'RE NOT BEING TOLD THAT THESE ABORTION PILLS ARE GOING TO CAUSE PAIN AND CRAMPING AND BLEEDING, THAT THEY COULD END UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AS WELL. THEY'RE NOT TOLD ABOUT THE COMPLICATIONS FROM THE ABORTION PROCEDURES. THAT'S WHERE THE FRAUD AND DECEPTION IS PRESENT. YOU'RE AFRAID TO SAY THE WORD ABORTION IN THESE CLINICS. THAT'S THE FRAUD AND DECEPTION. THIS ISN'T REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES. THESE ARE ABORTIONS, THIS IS TAKING THE LIFE OF THE UNBORN. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. MS. WARREN: I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED BY WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED HERE. I PRESUME DECEPTION IS WRONG, WHOEVER DOES IT. SO IF WE JUST SAID, NO DECEPTION AROUND PREGNANCY SERVICES, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS? MR. PRESIDENT? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. MS. WARREN: YES. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: QUESTIONS FLEED KNOB ASKED THROUGH THE CHAIR. MS. WARREN: I AM SCUG THAT QUESTION, MR. PRESIDENT. MR. MARSHALL: WE COULD NEVER SUPPORT ANY PART OF THIS LEGISLATION. I THINK THE DECEPTION AND FRAUD IS OCCURRING ON THE PART OF ABORTION CLINICS. THIS IS A THREAT TO OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, AND I THINK, LIKE I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS, THIS IS JUST SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO OBJECT. THANK YOU. MR. MENENDEZ: MR. PRESIDENT, IF I MAY ASK MY COLLEAGUE THROUGH THE CHAIR, IS IT RIGHT, NO MATTER WHO GETS THE INFORMATION BY FRAUD, TO GIVE YOUR MOST PRIVATE HEALTH -- SURELY AS A DOCTOR, THE SENATOR WOULD SAY THAT NO ONE SHOULD GIVE UP THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION TO AN ENTITY THAT DOES NOT PRESERVE IT UNDER HIPAA LAWS. SO COULD THE SENATOR NOT JOIN US IF WE LIMIT LIMITED TO FRAUD THAT ACTUALLY HAS THAT FRAUD CREATE THE INSECURITY OF HIPAA INFORMATION? MR. MARSHALL: MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO TRY TO REWRITE LEGISLATION. OF COURSE I'M AGAINST ALL FRAUD. I THINK ALL FRAUD IS BAD. I THINK THAT I'M ALL FOR THE TRUTH, ALL FOR PROTECTING PATIENTS' PERSONAL INFORMATION. BUT I'M ALSO HERE PROUD TO SAY WHAT GREAT WORK THAT THESE CLINICS DO. I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE YOU A EVEN ACCUSING THEM IS EVEN TRUE. I HAVE A NOT WITNESSED THAT A THE PREGNANT CLINICS THAT I HAVE SEEN DO GREAT WORK FOR THESE FOLKS. THEY SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM, THEY GIVE THEM A HAND UP, DO SO MANY GREAT THINGS. I DON'T NOTED WHERE THIS FRAUD AND DECEPTION IS COMING ABOUT EXCEPT THAT THEY'RE TALKING TO WOMEN AND SAYING, DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR BABY HAS A HEARTBEAT? DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR BABY CAN FEEL PAIN AT 14 WEEKS? DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOUR BABY RECOGNIZES THE VOICE OF YOUR HUSBAND RIGHT NOW? DO YOU RECOGNIZE -- SO I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT THINGS TO SHARE WITH PATIENTS, HOW WONDERFUL LIFE IS, THAT WE'RE ALL WONDERFULLY, BEAUTIFULLY MADE IN THE WOMB, THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. I THINK THAT'S ALL THE TRUTH THAT SHOULD BE SHARED WERE THEM. -- WITH THEM. SO, NO, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING YOU COULD DO WITH THIS LEGISLATION THAT COULD CHANGE IT THAT I COULD SUPPORT. AND I CONTINUE TO OBJECT. THANK YOU, AND I YIELD. MS. WARREN: MR. PRESIDENT, THEN COULD I ASK THROUGH YOU ANOTHER QUESTION AND THAT IS, IF WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FRAUD PART, CAN WE AT LEAST TALK ABOUT COLLECTING HEALTH INFORMATION, THAT ANY SO-CALLED CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTER -- I'M SORRY, IS THE SENATOR LEAVING, THE ONE WHO SAID THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PRIVATE HEALTH CARE INFORMATION? THAT AT LEAST WE COULD AGREE THAT PRIVATE HEALTH CARE INFORMATION -- I GUESS THE SENATOR IS JUST GOING TO WALK OFF THE FLOOR. SO THE QUESTION WOULD HAVE BEEN, HOW ABOUT AGREEING THAT ANYONE THAT COLLECTS INFORMATION ABOUT A PREGNANCY AND COLLECTS MEDICAL AND PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS TO BE BOUND BY HIPAA SO THAT THAT INFORMATION IS FULLY PROTECTED? THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION, MR. PRESIDENT. BUT SINCE THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO ANSWER IT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, I GUESS WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT FOR TODAY. THANK YOU. MR. MENENDEZ: MR. PRESIDENT? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. MR. MENENDEZ: I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THE SENATOR'S QUESTION. THAT MAKES EMINENT SENSE THAT WE WOULD PROTECT HIPAA INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN A POSITION TO MAYBE HAVE ACCESS TO COLLECTING IT. AND THERE HAVE BEEN, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, YOU SHOULDN'T COLLECT IT IF YOU'RE NOT A MEDICAL ENTITY, BUT IF YOU DO YOU SHOULD BE ULTIMATELY BOUND BY THE SAME GUARANTEES THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD BE GUARANTEED. YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BAFFLE ME THAT PARTICULARLY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, DOCTOR, WOULD SUGGEST THAT HIPAA INFORMATION IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULDN'T PROTECT. I THINK THAT AT A MINIMUM WE SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO AGREE TO THAT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. MS. WARREN: THIS IS A REMINDER AGAIN WHY I AM SO HONORED TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE SENATOR MENENDEZ. I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD BE DECEIVED, AND PARTICULARLY A WOMAN WHO IS SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT TERMINATION OF A PREGNANCY, AND I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE'S PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION SHOULD BE SHARED. THE IDEA THAT THESE CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS GATHER INFORMATION FROM WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE GIVING IT TO A MEDICAL PROVIDER, AND THAT THAT INFORMATION WILL BE PROTECTED, AND THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE, IS TRULY DESPICABLE. THANK YOU AGAIN,

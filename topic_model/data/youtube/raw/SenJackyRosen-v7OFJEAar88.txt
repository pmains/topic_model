A SENATOR: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEVADA. MS. ROSEN: IN THE MONTH SINCE THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN ROE V. WADE, THE ASSAULT ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BY ANTICHOICE MAGA REPUBLICANS, IT'S BEEN RELENTLESS. WE'VE SEEN AND HEARD THE HORROR STORIES OF STATES THAT HAVE OUTLAWED ABORTION. WE HAVE SEEN CHILDREN, AN EVEN YOUNG GIRLS, CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 10 WHO WERE RAPED AND UNABLE TO GET AN ABORTION IN THEIR OWN STATES. WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF STATES LOOKING TO RESTRICT -- RESTRICT A WOMAN'S ABILITY TO TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES, RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S ABILITY TO TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE, THE OFTEN LIFESAVING CARE THEY DESPERATELY NEED. IN FACT, THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT REPUBLICANS IN THIS CHAMBER OBJECTED TO WHEN DEMOCRATS BROUGHT UP A BILL TO GUARANTEE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF WOMEN TO TRAVEL IN THIS COUNTRY TO SEEK CARE. MAGA REPUBLICANS, WAIT, THEY WANT TO STRIP WOMEN OF THEIR FREEDOMS AND THEY WANT TO STRIP WOMEN TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR OWN BODIES. IF MAGA EXTREMISTS HAVE THEIR WAY IN CONGRESS, THEY WILL ENACT A RIGID -- A RIGID NATIONWIDE ABORTION BAN WHICH WILL THREATEN WOMEN AND THEIR DOCTORS WITH JAIL TIME. AND LOOK WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. ANTICHOICE STATES ARE WORKING TO STOP WOMEN FROM GOING TO PRO-CHOICE STATES TO SEEK CARE AND NOW THEY'RE EVEN GOING AFTER THE DOCTORS IN THOSE STATES THAT ARE SIMPLY DOING THEIR JOBS TAKING CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS. THIS IS UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. THAT IS WHY SENATORS MURRAY PADILLA, LUJAN AND I LOOK TO PROTECT DOCTORS IN STATES LIKE NEVADA WHERE ABORTION REMAINS LEGAL. PROTECT THOSE DOCTORS FROM FACING PROSECUTION BY ANTICHOICE STATES. LET ME BE CLEAR. NO DOCTOR SHOULD EVER BE JAILED FOR PROVIDING WOMEN WITH THE REPRODUCTIVE AND OFTEN LIFESAVING CARE THEY NEED WHEREVER -- WHEREVER THOSE WOMEN ARE FROM. OUR BILL, THE LET DOCTORS PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ACT, WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE NAME. IT WOULD LET DOCTORS, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN STATES LIKE NEVADA WHERE ABORTION IS LEGAL WITHOUT FEAR OF PROSECUTION OR FEAR OF JAIL TIME. OUR BILL WOULD EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROTECT WOMEN AND THEIR DOCTORS IN PRO-CHOICE STATES FROM ANTICHOICE STATES' ATTEMPTS TO PROSECUTE THEM. THIS MEANS THAT IF A WOMAN FROM TEXAS TRAVELS TO MY STATE OF NEVADA, A PRO-CHOICE STATE, THE NEVADA DOCTOR SHE SEES CANNOT -- CANNOT BE PROSECUTED UNDER TEXAS' EXTREME ABORTION BAN. WE NEED TO PASS THIS NOW, WITHOUT DELAY, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS BECAUSE WE MUST PROTECT WOMEN AND WE MUST PROTECT THEIR DOCTORS. WE MUST PASS THE LET DOCTORS PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE

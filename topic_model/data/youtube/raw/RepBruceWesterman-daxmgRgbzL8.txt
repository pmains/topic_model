thank you madam speaker today one in five americans are affected by dyslexia making it the most common learning disability yet there are still children in u.s school systems that go without being diagnosed instead they are written off as having a lack of effort or a plain lack of intelligence despite misconception dyslexia is not connected to one's level intelligence in fact where students have a difficult time reading they often excel in creative thought and critical thinking my bipartisan legislation the 21st century dyslexia act will federally define dyslexia and label proper treatments and diagnosis enabling teachers students and parents to assist aspiring students to achieve successful academic careers and to ensure that all children are granted equal opportunity in the classroom

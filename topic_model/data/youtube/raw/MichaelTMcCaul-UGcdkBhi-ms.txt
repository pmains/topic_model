the winter olympics are underway now in sochi russia but along with the competition there's a serious threat of terrorism for more we turn to two key lawmakers michael mccall chair of the house homeland security committee who's in austin texas and from los angeles los angeles congressman adam schiff a member of the house intelligence committee well the director of our national counter-terrorism center talked this week and gave a threat assessment of the situation in sochi let's listen the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in the potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the games themselves in the area surrounding sochi or outside of sochi in the region and tsa banned all liquids aerosols gels and powders from carry-ons on flights between the us and russia chairman mccall you're just back from the sochi and you say that the threat there is very specific and credible well it is specific incredible let me first say i was watching the olympics last night and we're rooting for team usa to bring home the goal but we also want them to be safe and secure while they're over there my experience was that this ring of steals putin calls it the perimeter very fortified a hundred thousand security officers military special forces so there's a lot going on there including our fbi our homeland security people over there diplomatic security but chris there are two major threat vectors as i see it one is to the aviation sector externally into russia into sochi at that airport which is in the ring of steel and the second threat as i see it is a threat of suicide bombers these so-called black widows who are widows of of chechen rebels who have been killed by the russians as we saw you know the most wanted pictures down there uh potentially uh blowing themselves up or detonating explosives in transportation modes and so that's what we have to be very concerned with the russians so far but i think have been cooperative when it comes to external operations outside of russia when it comes to internal operations i think less so that's where we'd like to work more closely with them congressman schiff from the intelligence that you have received as a member of your committee how dangerous is the situation in sochi well there certainly are a lot of risks but i think they're manageable risks that people stay where they're supposed to they don't very often uncharted areas minimize the time that they spend in train stations and minimize the degree to which they demonstrate where they come from it wouldn't be wise i think to be broadcasting that you're from the united states i think the risk can be contained as mike pointed out those risks are probably greatest in the soft targets outside of sochi uh and i think that to the degree that people are mindful their surroundings i would go if i had tickets and and enjoy the games we aren't getting the kind of cooperation that we'd like from the russians in terms of their internal threats i think as a matter of russian pride they don't want to share that as a matter of not disclosing their sources and methods to us they don't want to share that but it means that we're less effective in protecting our people and that's a frustration but uh but all things considered i think that uh that it's relatively unmanageably safe to be at the games chairman mccall let me ask you a bigger question because after your tour of sochi you said that the olympic village and this is your quote is very well fortified is that what we've come to that what was originally designed to be a a an exhibition of international unity uh it now needs to be very well fortified and if that's the case what's the point well i think any olympics is going to have a certain risk to it i think this particular olympics i've never seen a greater threat certainly in my lifetime we had the 1972 olympics where the israeli team was taken hostage we didn't have the threats warnings in advance remember we've already had two suicide bombers that have gone off outside of the the olympic village uh in recent uh like in december you had the train station and the bus blown up and i think as adam pointed out it's the soft targets outside uh the perimeter i would caution people to stay in the uh village if they were there i think what what really poses the greatest damage or threat if you will chris in my judgment is the proximity and the location of where these gains are being held they're being held right dead center in the middle of what was has been a historic battleground between russia and the chechen rebels that have now spun off into an isla islamic a radical militant a group and so you have the leader of the chechen rebels umar of calling for attacks on the olympics calling for attacks on civilians including women and children and then zawahiri the al-qaeda leader the lieutenant of bin laden now ford you know reinforcing that a threat and so that that's a whole new ball game that makes i think these olympics are very very different i think that there's a high degree the probability that that something is gonna some something will detonate something will go off but i do think it's probably most likely to happen outside of the ring of steel in the olympic village i've got to pick up on this you're saying as the chairman of the house homeland security committee you think that there is a high probability that there will be some explosion outside the ring of steel well i hope i'm wrong in this assessment but you're talking about an area of the world where suicide bombers go off all the time and the fact is right now chris the eyes of the world are upon these olympics and the chechen extremists know this and they want to make a global statement they want to make a jihad statement and what better time to do it than right now and that is i think the biggest threat to these olympics remember they don't have to hit in the ring of steel at the olympic village as long as they they hit somewhere in russia to them that's a victory let me switch subjects on you because a lot of us found out this week about an attack on a substation a power substation in san jose california last april in which snipers knocked out 17 giant transformers congressman schiff this happened in your state of california how sophisticated was the attack what does it say about the vulnerability of our electrical grid and what can we do about it well it was a sophisticated attack uh there's abundant evidence of pre-planning uh the people that went in knew exactly what they were doing they knew what they were going to shoot at to try to disable these transformers without blowing them up and attracting attention they cut fab fiber optic cables in advance to prevent telecommunications so it was sophisticated uh we're hoping that this was not a dry run but that's obviously a great concern and one of the thing things that i think it highlights is we put a lot of our focus on cyber security on the ability of terrorists to use cyber networks to try to bring down our grid and perhaps we've taken our eye a bit off the ball of less sophisticated attacks that can be equally brutal or even more damaging these a lot of these substations are in remote areas they have nothing but a chain link fence and maybe a remote camera and i think we what we can do about it is prioritize those transformers those substations that would bring the greatest threat to the grid uh protect those first i think it's a limited number probably less than 100 and then branch out from there but plainly a lot needs to be done and some finger pointing already going on between the various agencies as to who's responsible for security here we're beginning to run out of time and i want to get into one more subject but very briefly congressman mccall how concerned are you about this attack well anytime you have a power station under attack both physical or by a cyber attack we just passed a cyber bill out of my committee last week uh a very very grave concern because if the power grid is shut down it takes a long time to restore that capability and and that would mean uh turning off power to large regions of the united states so and we have to be better fortified from a physical attack uh but also as my bill demonstrates from a cyber security attack which could take down uh do far greater damage than sandy did for instance uh in the northeast shutting down power grids over regions of the united states so this is a i don't want to you know engage in hyperbole but this is a very the critical infrastructures in the united states both power both oil and gas both financial sectors are all under attack in the cyber world and there are physical attacks like you saw in california that we need to do a better job protecting the nation gentlemen i want to get to one last subject and that is syria because there were reports this week that thousands of foreigners including as many as 70 americans have gone over to syria to fight alongside uh the extremists against the assad regime and may now pose a threat to the u.s homeland here was a comment from the new secretary of homeland security jay johnson extremists are actively trying to recruit westerners indoctrinate them and see them return to their home countries with an extremist mission chairman mccall how big a threat uh americans and other westerners being trained in syria and coming home to carry out jihad you know i had this conversation with the secretary jay johnson just last week before his speech we both agreed that syria is probably the largest and most significant threat to the homeland security of the united states today and the reason being is that we have so many jihadists pouring into syria every day training their training camps military training camps this is far surpassing the fatah in pakistan this is becoming the worldwide training ground for terrorists so concerned about westerners european but also americans who have traveled there with legitimate travel documents who could come back into the united states or in western europe with this kind of expertise with this kind of training uh and pull off you know a terrorist attack and let's not forget the external operations they have right now their goal is syria but but after syria externally they want to hit the west in the united states of america let me bring in congressman schiff we've got about a minute left congressman there's a growing sense that the obama administration's international conference in geneva isn't working isn't going to solve the problem of syria does the do we need a reset in the administration's policy one to oppose the assad regime two to make sure that they they live up to their commitments which they aren't at this point of turning over chemical weapons and third to address this growing extremist threat inside syria and especially the idea of them coming home to the u.s well first of all that growing extremist threat that you mentioned that mike was talking about is uh probably going to be the most pernicious threat to the country for the next 10 years so it is a very serious problem we're already seeing it in egypt where some of the jihadis trained in syria are now attacking the egyptian government and of course they're trying to train people to attack us here on our homeland in terms of the geneva talks they haven't been successful in fact no one has been successful here our policy hasn't the russians haven't been successful the regime hasn't the opposition hasn't it's a bloody stalemate with horrific humanitarian proportions of horrible proportions do we need a reset it's hard to see what the reset will be i'm not sure that the united states getting deeply militarily involved is going to contribute to an end to this conflict i think we have to try to keep the pressure on with both a bottom-up strategy like we're seeing in geneva and more importantly probably is what will happen outside of geneva and that is we need to talk to the the nations that are fighting by proxy in syria to the iranians to the russians to the saudis to the turks to the qataris uh and try to reach a resolution here and i think the resolution is assyria without assad he's not indispensable to any of us there are goals we all want to see in syria after the the conflict and they're not necessarily the same but we don't need assad in power of course there's no indication that assad plans to go anywhere congressman schiff congressman mccall want to thank you both so much for coming in today thank you next up

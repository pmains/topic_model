Thank You mr. chairman and I wanted to say thank you to the entire panel for being here today appreciate hearing your perspectives reducing emerg emissions carbon emissions is a shared goal however I believe that we must be realistic and we must be honest about the challenges that we face we need a strategy that provides consumer choice ensures affordability and maintains grid reliability and capacity clearly the United States is a large country its diverse and coming from different regions different states you find that there's there's different strengths and needs a top-down government mandated approach is not going to be workable for some states nuclear is the best option for others it's wind solar or natural gas there's its hydropower I'm excited about the technological innovation and the American ingenuity that enables us to develop a variety of new cutting-edge ways of clean energy production I'm I'm proud that America is leading the world in reducing carbon emissions Eastern Washington is a leader in clean energy solutions hydropower built the Pacific Northwest it built our economy and it continues to provide clean renewable reliable electricity in fact we are number one we have the lowest electricity cost in the country it accounts for 70% of the energy in Washington State and as we all know it is the largest source of renewable energy in the country we could double hydro power in America without building a new dam simply by investing in technology however right now in America it takes ten years to license a new hydropower project you compare that to 18 months for a natural gas facility we can and we should do better Washington State is known as being a leader in wanting to bring down and reduce carbon emissions just in January though there was an article in The Seattle Times that was highlighting that carbon emissions are actually in Washington State over a decade ago we wrote we wrote a plan into law to reduce carbon gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 but the latest tally of state's emissions show that we're trending in the wrong direction to meet that target and that more emission goals are ahead of us in fact the legislature has continued to increase those carbon emission goals the fact though is from 2012 to 2015 our carbon emissions spiked 6.1 percent due in part to increasing fossil fuel generated electricity so at a time when we have this shared goal we should be embracing what makes sense in each region of the country and for us its hydropower we shouldn't be putting more costs and more mandates on hydropower we should be actually like moving forward with licensing reform here at the federal level in Congress and you know that I have worked on this and I encourage the majority in their goal to move legislation to I urge you to take action to address the licensing of hydropower projects in this country without it I'm not sure there's a realistic path to success so I wanted to ask mr. Matheson and I too want to welcome you back to the committee and appreciate your service and your continued leadership I want you to expand on the role of hydropower in terms of grid reliability capacity how does it compare to other forms of renewable electricity well it's you you you stated the case well and it matters a lot Pacific Northwest of course is where it's so important but I got to tell you we've got over 600 electric quarters in the country either get hydro from from power marking agencies federal power marketing changes in 34 states so this issue translates across a lot of the country maybe not quite to the proportion it is in the Pacific Northwest but by members in that part of the the country it's a significant part of their power supply the low rates are an important part of how they provide affordable power and it's extremely reliable it's interesting you mentioned the history that it built Washington and it built it's such a part of the history of the Northwest and yet here we are today talking about moving into more of a carbon-constrained future it's just another value adder for the Hydra asset it's quite candidly and it seems to me that I would concur with your statement that any discussion about moving ahead to for federal policy to enact a more carbon constrained future the the consideration of how we can best enhance our hydroelectric generating capacity ought to be right at the top of list because it's it's there thank you I appreciate you making that point because hydropower we have new technology and it is and it isn't just Washington State it's all over the country 34 states and there's potential to double it Thank You mr. chairman I yield back [Music]

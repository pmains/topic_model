hey madam chair thank you um great to be here um somewhat ironic to hear the secretary of transportation to note that he's late because he was in traffic that's that's all i heard that's all i heard uh so uh no madam chair thank you and thank you all for uh your continued um attention and focus on this issue i think it's i think it's absolutely critical um look this project is is uh is different because every other core of engineer project as a colonel will tell you it's normally us chasing money um it's us chasing the dollars to try to get the project built and unfortunately with louisiana having one-third of the corps of engineer projects across the united states we have over 30 billion dollars in project authorizations in the state of louisiana whereas the core nationally probably has just over 100 billion so so we have a third of the core projects and i'll say it again we're normally chasing money for these projects all across our state trying to get them built in this case we actually got the money up front and at that point i think all of us including our our chair were popping champagne corks and said all right this is it it's all downhill from here only to find uh repeated impediments or obstacles and uh we're at the point to where we thought the project was going to be completed by now to now we're probably looking at 2025 and and it's it's incredibly frustrating to be in a situation like this because and and colonel i clearly heard you talk about the attention of the chief the general and i appreciate it i appreciate the fact that you're always a phone call away but i think that if any of us are looking at this and saying that this project development implementation process corresponds to the urgency of this project then then we're crazy let me say that again if we think that this project development and implementation process reflects the urgency of this project and unfortunately a number of other projects in the state of louisiana then we're crazy we have we have a crisis in louisiana and whether it's people living in the coastal area with with the erosion of our coast and the increased vulnerability to hurricanes or the fact that we drain montana new york and canada coming down through here we've got water and we've got attacks from the north from the south and that we've got to be more agile and have to have a process to implement these projects that reflects that urgency that reflects the situation that people are facing now look madam chair you're well aware in the aftermath of the 2016 flood all of the people that we represented that representative mincy represented that senator uh pope represented these people lives had been just devastated that everything they owned was sitting out on the curb and we're asking them hey come back to central come back to denim come back to watson and these people are sitting there with everything they own out on the curb and at that point we couldn't tell them hey it's going to be safer it's going to be better it's going to be stronger and and thankfully within just a few months we were able to come in and secure the dollars to where we could tell them hey we've got record funding going on and and so this is going to be safer reinvest your insurance check reinvest your restore louisiana check back in your community because it's going to be safe investment it's going to be a stronger protection system it's going to be a great place for you to live and raise a family and have a business but here we are six years later and we're still talking about the project and and so you know look going out there and trying to get at the at the time 342 million dollars that's not easy as the colonel will tell you nationally for the course construction budget they normally get somewhere between two and three billion this project is over ten percent of their entire national budget and and and we were able to secure those funds only to have come back and say all right now we need another another 128 million dollars which thankfully we were able to to get secured as well so now we have over half a billion dollars in in this project that's uh in the bank and and being invested in protection so one last time project deliveries got to reflect project urgency next thing is this madam chair and i know that i know that this task force is focused on the on the commit project and it's certainly the foundation the linchpin the anchor for this basin but right now if i go through and add things up we have about a billion dollars being invested in the basin about a billion and so i just urge you to to all of you to keep thinking about yes we need to keep the heat on everybody who's implementing this project but we also need to be looking at all of these other components for example the baton rouge area flood control project and the and the and the over quarter of a billion dollars being invested in it another core of engineers project um with with uh the east baton rouge parish it's an important part of protection for this basin um as much as it pains me to say it uh mark harrell here uh the the work that they're doing and and i'm going to say it you know you want to talk about urgency we got them 50 million dollars in december of 2016. december of 2016 mark and their team have already done clearing and snagging on 450 miles and you're now going to up the number and say 462 or whatever you're going to do but 450 miles of rivers by use canals and ditches in livingston parish so you want to talk about urgency 450 miles and and and this was done within months of the dollars being appropriated and and those miles are going to keep keep going up so that's another important component the highway 22 project which is going to create another outlet of the emmett river into the marpa basin helping to evacuate the water faster not just be dependent upon the diversion canal and emmett river to get the water out is another important component the weir the dredging at the mouth of the blind and the and the and the dredging of the amit river all of these things and i could go on and on um all of these things are important components because look madam chair you you're well aware of this if you live proximate to to the north-south bayou is draining into the diversion canal you may see feet several feet of flood relief but in other areas further south you're not going to see you may just be a few inches and so these other projects are the projects that deliver feet of relief for you and so you know one last time we have over a billion dollars being invested in the basin i think that we have to work collectively and whether it's the our federal partners whether it's the the state agency um it's it's our emmett river basin commission it's the parishes that are involved it's obviously all of you stakeholders and legislators are here we have got to collectively work on a process that allows us to be resilient to be safe and secure and execute on these dollars get these projects done i can't express my frustration enough on what's going on with energy transfer i mean the fact that we discovered a pipeline from the 1950s um and realized it was there uh you know 40 years later or whatever i mean that's that's uh or heck 70 years later i mean that's just that's inexcusable it is um and and and i hate where we are on that but we've got to fix this so i'm happy to answer any questions but i want to thank you all very much for um thank you all very much for your efforts to focus attention and to make sure that everyone's playing well in the sandbox to get this thing done well thank you congressman graves i appreciate your comments appreciate you being here and your commitment to this project is unparalleled and we hear the passion in your voice because it doesn't matter if you've got teamwork it's it's it's about project delivery and all of these things have there's got to be a quicker way to do it than to miss the target date we thought we were going to finish by december of this year and we're pushing it back a year and a half or two years that is mind-boggling i don't understand that and hopefully we can get an explanation for that but i really want to say thank you because i know how hard you fought how hard everybody's fighting for money but you fought to get that for us here and i want to say thank you on behalf of the constituents of east baton rouge and the east baton rouge metropolitan area because your commitment is is noted thank you so much you bet thank you representative nancy yeah i just want to echo some of the same uh comments uh congressman graves thank you again for being here and and for your passion for this area and um you know i think it's safe to say that that we wouldn't even have these discussions about the delayed schedule if it wasn't for your efforts in dc to get us to funding so i just want to thank you very much you bet you bet thank you and and again i just i can't emphasize enough this takes everybody everybody considering point fingers and says his fault it's her fault it takes all levels of government working together to get this thing done and and i really appreciate you all pulling everybody together and being the venue for that collaboration or perhaps accountability madam chair well thank you and one of the things that we're going to talk about is the oversight on the um i see councilman moak and fred rayford here talk about the clearing and snagging how to get that done and hopefully uh with mark carroll here and the tremendous success that he's had in livingston parish um i'm hoping that we can see the same thing in ebr because it is possible it just shows you with dedication and commitment and organization and i think leadership is the key thing is to have the leadership

a few weeks ago actually a week ago yesterday the nation lost one of its most selfless and unique public servants with the passing of my predecessor former north carolina 10th district congressman cass ballinger from 2000 up until 2005 congressman ballinger represented the 10th district of north carolina the united states house of representatives during that time he served as chairman of the house subcommittee on workforce protections where he authored groundbreaking legislation that improved workplace safety and created the opportunity for employers and regulators to be partners not adversaries in protecting the health and safety of workers as chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee on the international relations committee he took on the daunting and often thankless task of fighting to promote democracy and defend human rights in central and south american nations he did this not only for the sake of justice in those countries but also to protect the interests of the united states his personal commitment to serving his constituents is a legendary example that i strive every day to follow i was a beneficiary of his kind and gracious nature when i was elected to represent the 10th district in 2005 after his decision to retire from the house he personally provided me with guidance and assistance that immeasurably helped me as a new member of congress and ensured the continuity of our quality constituent services for western north carolina in his personal and professional life cass placed himself well he placed others before himself he's a part of the greatest generation went and fought world war ii returned home to go to college afterwards started a family joined his family's business his father's business that was in box manufacturing he told his father that boxes were the thing of the past and the wave of the future was plastics it's almost like it was george bailey coming home to say that so as a county commissioner in catawba county he was one of the first republicans elected after the civil war and then now at this state catawba county is one of the most republican counties in the state of north carolina he led the way to establish the catawba valley community college and catawba valley medical center as a legislator in the north carolina general assembly he authored the state's first meaningful open meetings law was named the most effective republican legislator by the north carolina institute of government it would take volumes to talk about uh all of his phila philanthropic work of congressman ballinger and his wife donna but they are responsible for countless schools day care centers hospitals and disaster responses in the united states and in central and south america as well uh personally uh cass was the ultimate character he could tell you a great story a great joke and tell you off and you would you would all laugh at everything that he said um he uh in addition to being one of the most uh distinguished members the north carolina republican delegation and north carolina delegation generally congressman ballinger was also very colorful there are great moments here on the house floor that we can point to um but um any anyone who spent any time with him knew that he was affable kind and brutally honest he would tell you exactly what he was thinking in generally some hilarious way he was one of the few people who could hold someone accountable in the most blistering way possible make you laugh and also help you out of a tight spot all in one conversation he was a rare person indeed and he will be missed so i asked my colleagues to join with me in a moment of silence on the passing of congressman cass ballinger thank you i yield back the gentleman yields back

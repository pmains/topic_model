title 42 remains in place still thousands of people streaming across the southern border illegally Fox News obtained the latest numbers showing border agents encountering about 6 800 people a day a record high number of Crossings since October 1st so let's bring in Florida congresswoman Kat kamek who has a little bit to say about the situation uh what do you think oh well you know this might go down as one of the greatest cell phones in history certainly of the Biden Administration while they are simultaneously trying to remove title 42 the the Public Health Directive at the border that we are able to expel people back to their home country under the bind Administration is also now saying that Chinese Nationals uh must be tested for covet because there is still an ongoing Public Health Emergency so I think they must have missed the memo where 151 different Nationals are coming across the border including Chinese Nationals it just never ends we have a Public Health crisis a humanitarian crisis and certainly a national security crisis playing out on our Southwest border it's killing 300 people here in the United States a day right so congresswoman then why do you feel like President Biden doesn't feel any pressure to change the situation because of the crisis you know I think he does feel pressure even from people within his own party I can't tell you how many times I've been on the house floor when Democrats have approached me and said you know listen I agree with you I know that there's an issue at the border I know there's a crisis at the border uh we're feeling it in my district and these are people representing uh districts all over the United States they're saying the fentanyl crisis is really hurting our communities uh we've got people here um that just don't know what to do we don't have enough resources but if they speak out there will be political retribution for them so I think behind closed doors there's incredible pressure even uh Obama's DHS secretary said that 2 000 a day was a crisis now we're on average six thousand to eight thousand a day and with title 42 going away that could go up to 18 000 a day but if he's feeling pressure then why isn't he acting well because I think that he has to at one point or another acknowledge that this 100 is on the Biden Administration it is their election of Duty it is negligence but above all it's unacceptable and so if they were to take action and actually call it what it is a crisis and then continue the full force multiplier that we know is the technology and the wall the physical structure or to actually uphold the Trump policies of NPP that remain in Mexico program that means that he would acknowledge that he had Stripped Away the policies that were working to secure our Southwest border the data does not lie and he can be a data denier as long as he wants but eventually it's going to catch up with him and he's going to have to answer for that come 24 when Americans realize how big of a national security threat actually has been with this open border policy that they have so I want to change topics here now that I have you the president signed a 1.7 trillion dollar Omnibus spending Bill uh yesterday it had some 60 million to hire border agents and 800 million for expenses to shelter people illegally that are crossing the border the priorities just mixed up here well and let us not forget that uh Biden signed this bill from the tropics the U.S Virgin Islands uh to be exact where that bill all four thousand plus pages had to be flown to the island where he was staying at taxpayer expense so I just want to make sure that everyone is aware that that's where he did in fact sign this 1.7 trillion but you talk about the additional funding in here he's kind of saying the quiet part out loud that yes we actually do need more agents we need Force multipliers we need resources but you have to ask yourself at what point are you going to give a policy to our agents that they can actually uphold because that's the number one thing I hear from Agents is they need a policy and the second thing is is what message are you sending to the cartels the people that are actually trafficking these individuals across the border if you continue to build soft-sided facilities and expand the footprint along the Southwest border you're saying to the cartels keep sending people over and we'll keep housing them it's the wrong message to send and quite frankly that's why I've called Biden the trafficker and Chief instead of the commander-in-chief he is completing the trafficking cycle on behalf of the cartels and that is what is so so yeah one more one more uh point on this so both parties approved that massive spending packages and and many of them actually the federal debt is at an unsustainable path so how do you get fiscal responsibility when it seems that Republicans and Democrats are voting for some of these spending bills I can tell you as a first-term member of Congress it is probably the most frustrating thing that I've ever done in my life and at one point in time I was homeless so if that's any indicator it's it's very very frustrating but what we have to do is get government out of the way that is really at the root of it the Democrats want a dependency and control agenda which seeks to expand the size and scope of government that make people dependent on its programs Republicans our goal is to reduce this footprint of the federal government people have the capability and the responsibility to make these decisions for themselves not some bureaucrat in a basement somewhere in Washington so we have to get the spending under control by just stopping the spending cut some of these programs reduce this footprint if we continue to grow about 60 trillion dollars is when we become insolvent and that is going to be a very very Troublesome day in our Republic we've got to be serious about cutting the spending and recognize that the government is not the answer to every problem that we we have yeah cat camick thank you from Florida representative from Florida appreciate you for being here and

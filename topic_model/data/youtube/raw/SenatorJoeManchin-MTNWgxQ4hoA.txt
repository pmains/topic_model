but in a recent written testimony inspector mitchell states that when it comes to incidents like clarksburg the common contributing factors the oig has identified are poor and consistent or ineffective leadership that cultivate a complacent and disengaged medical facility culture in which the va goal of zero patient harm is improbable if not impossible that's clearly the case at clarksburg va and yet individuals in positions of leadership were able to simply resign able to simply resign and keep their valuable va benefits like retirement benefits i'll never forget setting when all this was unveiled and we heard we learned more in the one week that that mr missile was there than we had from the administration who've been there forever and the head of nursing and i looked at the head of nursing i said sir with all due respect you're either lying to me or you're totally incompetent one of the two but you have no right of setting here that was in that hearing it was that bad so how do we hold the va leaders responsible in incidents like the murders at clarksburg how do their people stay in the system how are they able to retire with the benefit with such disrespect and such neglect and malfeasance of doing their job

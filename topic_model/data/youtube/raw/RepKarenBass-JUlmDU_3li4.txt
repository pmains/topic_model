I'm sure my Democratic congresswoman carrying bats of California who's on the Foreign Affairs Committee peter baker's chief White House correspondent for the New York Times John Brett is the former director of the CIA Congress willing I guess it looks like that the Republicans around the present those who like him don't like him whatever for whatever reason are getting crazy like he is they're beginning to do things like that stunt today because they can't win the argument anymore he's been caught your thoughts well well I actually think I mean I know that they shared it with him last night that they were going to do that but I also think that they did that in response to his rhetoric saying that they weren't defending him enough so when I saw the antics I just thought that they were marching to his orders and I think it is really was an act of desperation they are not going to be able to stop the truth from coming out I think it's really like a dam is breaking right now and it's just important that we hear from all of the witnesses so that we can have a clearer picture of the damage that's been done to our democracy well congresswoman that the hearings are being held to get information from top people like Bill Taylor yesterday are all bipartisan there's Republicans in every one of those rooms it's not like there's something sneaky going on but these people and this sort of Brooks Brothers this reminds me of 2000 in a recount another Brooks Brothers protest showing up like it reminds me of like a 1930s panty raid or something it's so ridiculous into high jinks what a boring little group by the way yes it was it was actually embarrassing but I do have to tell you and Chris you know this if you add the number of Republicans from three committees Intel Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs you're talking about a large number of Republicans so it is not like they have not been involved that they haven't had complete access to everything they just want us to have everything in the open right now so that the witnesses can coordinate their testimony and be bullied by the White House and we're not going to do that let me go to Peter Baker that's because she rate the main bar the big piece and the times and I want to ask you about this it seems to me they don't the bolts of the Washington Post has written bolts has written a pretty solid statement no it's not analysis it's a statement that it's now clear on the record that president nighted State's condition the US military assistance to zelinsky's government in Ukraine who are facing the Russian tanks on him providing some sort of declaration and he's going after going after Joe Biden my question is what's left to argue about yeah I think that Dan Balz is it gets a spot-on as he always does I mean when you get Dan who's about as measure to you know a journalist out there making such a definitive statement it does tell you that something has changed in the debate and I think he's right that basically the question now is what do we make of this facts that that we have in front of us what do we make of what the president and his people have done in terms Ukraine is it important enough is it defensible and the the the storming of the barricades as you were today in terms of the basement shows that the Republican argument right now is one on process when you when they don't want to defend what the president has done in terms of Ukraine partly because they may not be a hundred percent sure that all the facts are out there and don't want to get caught out but also because it's very hard to argue at this point so they focus on on process that the Democrats aren't being fair it's not that different in some ways in the 1998 when the Democrats focused on process when they were defending against President Clinton's impeachment they didn't want to be seen as excusing his conduct so rather than you know defending his conduct they said the other side is his handling is bad it's a way of making it a partisan affair us versus them they're treating us badly therefore you have to be with us it worked to some extent for President Clinton that impeachment was a party line impeachment that's the goal of President Trump has here to keep Republicans on his side make sure it's a party line debate as long as it's a party line debate then he wins if it gets to the Senate you know John Brennan thank you for coming on tonight it seems to me that you're a public servant for life and it seems to me that what Trump does every time you have a really good witness like Bill Terry yesterday who was our head of mission in Kiev who testifies very forthrightly and a beautifully developed argument about how he discovered there was this other force out there led by Giuliani and the president to use this leverage we have with this desperate country militarily desperate country facing Russia when he realized that was going on he's finally come out and put it to the public gave it to the public it just seems to me the Trump's last-gasp is to say he referred today for example as all Republicans who don't like them as human scum this the president is talking he trashes every individual who speaks against him that's why I find it very heartening that it's Nationals he called him scum human scum that guy it's national security professionals our diplomats like Bill Taylor like investing Evanovich like Laura Cooper from the partners of defense like the whistle blower from the intelligence community somewhere who are standing up and speaking out against Donald Trump it's it is very heartening to those who of us who did serve in that security environment for so many years and so therefore I think he has to resort to these name-calling tactics because they're professional professionalism their expertise their experience I think really lends great weight to the substantive argument that Donald Trump engaged in extortion bribery with the Ukrainians the let me turn this because I think this language is something that again you and I have been I do have some experience and not an American political life all these years and calling people scum it's kinda it's kind of like the worst street corner lingo and you're talking about Republicans including bill tower whose certain he's not in this for the money like Trump's in for the money almost all the time it's not all the time this guy Center for Public Service and because he told the truth he's human who comes up with these phrases I'm sorry I will you know though you're right that no other president in modern times anyway use this kind of language repeatedly and as extensively and as viscerally as this one does he talks like a playground you know combatant he's not he doesn't speak in presidential tones in fact the other day in Dallas at a rally that he gave down there he mocked the very idea of being presidential so the idea that he uses terms like human scum and and very incendiary phrases that's part and parcel of his style and his and his approach to the presidency definitely is a turn-off to people who remember other presidents who behaved in a more you know in a more unifying way or even combined even when they conducted fierce to base did so and I in a higher tone this is not the way he rolls it's not the way he operates in it and it is work for him as he sees it so he's going to keep it up but it's a very different way of looking at the presidency than we've seen by Republicans and Democrats going back and I think it's really hard to make Bill Taylor into a radical unelected bureaucrat which is the phrase the White House use last night to describe him he's a he's given 50 years of his life this country went to West Point served in Vietnam was appointed you know first to ambassador to Ukraine by George W Bush served under Ronald Reagan Republicans Democrats he's not you know a radical partisan he's somebody who's believed in in the service of his country and diplomatic and other reforms so it's hard to radicalize him or hard to demonize him but that's what President Trump tries to do just to make the point use terms like humans come to justify genocide the use you ins come the phrases like that to justify totalitarian behavior against your political enemies anything goes it legalized 'as to people in licenses people to do the worst possible things when presidents leaders of a country uses terms like that this is frightening anyway Trump's now making no argument he didn't engage in a quid pro quo because as he says Ukraine didn't realize they were being leveraged they were being it's it's outrageous troika quoting Republican Cosman John Radcliffe Trump today claimed that neither terror or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld you can't have a quid pro quo without a quo well but there's ample evidence crannies did know they weren't getting the aid they expected in fact ambassador Taylor testified that quid pro quo was spelled out explicitly to a top Ukrainian official in September on the first congresswoman this president is so desperate and so reaching around for bs excuses for what he did I sometimes wonder didn't he say it would be okay to be impeached he could use that to get reelected with he clearly now will do anything to avoid what's coming his way in the next couple months well absolutely and he clearly didn't understand or believe that it would ever happen but I will tell you when we when I sat in that room yesterday listening to the ambassador you felt like you were in the presence of a true patriot he had been very clear he told secretary Pompeo I don't want to go to Ukraine unless the policy is going to be consistent so they were forewarned and they went and they asked him to go anyway and he went out of his patriotic duty even though he knew what happened to the previous ambassador so he is somebody that we need to recognize in the future and I think it is so sad and such a tragedy for all of us you know I travel a lot because I'm on Foreign Affairs and every time I go to another country I have to go to an embassy and try to lift their spirits because they are so demoralized from having their commander-in-chief constantly humiliate and denigrate their work and their service to our country well John Brennan it seems to me they're making great witnesses they are and I think all Americans should be proud of these individuals who are willing to stand up and I just wish some of the members of Congress who are still ardent supporters of mr. Trump would have the courage would have the spine would have the honesty to do what these professionals are doing and it's very unfortunate that Trump's defenders continue to try to explain away his misdeeds and again focus on the process right now and they are really quite hypocritical also because this was the process that the Republicans had during the Benghazi hearings and it does make a lot of sense to be able to do these things without the glaring lights of the TV cameras so I'm just very pleased that the people now are starting to listen to those professionals who can expose the activities and the the actions of mr. Trump well being increasingly obviously in the historic role of Anna totalitarian which is what he is a man who will serve lead his country all by himself with no staffer and we're gonna get this later in his show there's no loop with Trump there's no people around and there's no council of war he does everything he feels like doing at that moment but what he resents her people like you John Brennan he apparently has an obsession with you well he's a sense that he can be obsessed with me if he likes he's a badly broken person who has really done a great disservice not just to this country but to our world in terms of how he has been so irresponsible and reckless and self-centered in the conduct of the presidency and therefore and I believe that there is more than a legitimate basis right now to impeach this individual and also to remove him from office I am just hoping that more and more Republicans will find the courage will find the the spine to be able to speak out against what truly is a such a dangerous aberration of our great Republic I hope you're listening thank you US Congress when we carry and bathroom quite like all you speak but you all for you people see the Cicilline and you and Hakim and Sheree I think you're great I think just keeps speaking out for the leadership of the house I think you got to get on TV all the time thank you so much carrying back some California land farmer at foreign affairs

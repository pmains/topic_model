mr. secretary welcome it's good to see you here again on previous occasions we have discussed the overwhelming success of the access received close to home or arch pilot program in northern Maine located in Caribou Maine in increasing access to health care for veterans who are living in that part of my state recently a veteran from northern Maine use this program for emergency surgery it was on a broken hip had the arch program not been in place he would have had to endure a 250-mile hours long ambulance ride to the togas hospital in Augusta over bumpy winter roads in extreme pain in december of last year the VA held a town-hall meeting in which two separate veterans came forward and said that they had received cardiac care and they indicated that they believe they would not be alive today but for the care that they received through the arch program because it was so accessible so thanks to the arch program veterans like these have been able to receive the care that they need right at home or close to home and close to their families what concerns me is that this highly effective indeed life-saving program is scheduled to end at the end of this fiscal year which is coming up very rapidly and the VA has yet to recommend whether or not the arch program should continue I personally believe that the success of the arch program in northern Maine could serve as a model for the entire tree I wrote you back in December about this issue the letter was signed by my colleague from Maine but we've had to get an answer and I know you've been tied up with budgets and bad clogs but I'm hoping today that you can answer the question of whether the VA intends to recommend an extension of the arch pilot program senator I regret that you haven't had a response yet to your question we are in the stages of as you indicate this pilot ends in the end of this fiscal year and we are in the process of analyzing all of the good stories that have come out as well as where could we have been more effective which as you know we r CH only went in 25 states I believe and so as we look at our national health care responsibilities let's try to understand how we take what we learned from march and make sure we're dressing needs for rural veterans and highly rural veterans elsewhere i'm going to call on dr. Petzel i don't know that he's prepared to recommend on arch at this point there i know they're still in final deliberations about what results mean but let me call on dr. Petzel Thank You mr. secretary senator Collins as the secretary mentioned we're still in the final stages of evaluating the project we've learned a lot of lessons from that pilot the specifically in Maine the arch was worked through the carry medical center in in caribou and that's been very successful from our protector particularly in terms of providing specialty care we are we have developed a a program called patient-centered community care across the country where we have two entities that we've contracted with who in turn have set up networks across the country to provide that same sort of service nationally that you've seen with arch because we do believe that access especially care particularly in rural America is is an important issue for the veteran communicate community we want to provide the same level of service in rural America that we do in in urban America and we think that pc3 built on the lessons that we learned from arch are going to accomplish that specifically in in Caribou we're going to continue our relationship with Kerry we're going to continue to have the services available that you've seen available under under project arch and i think that the transition that we're going to be making to the pc three contract is going to be seamless as far as the veterans that live in maine or in those other areas where we've had had this pilot program let me just tell you that the concern i'm hearing about the pc three program is that it is not likely to be fully implemented until this summer and there's lots of concern about whether it will be as broad in scope of its coverage as the arch program has been and i just want to pass that feedback on to you i'm told that the arch program in Caribou has been the most successful of the five sites which of course doesn't surprise me because it's my hometown but in all seriousness I think the link of the local hospital with the VA with thee there's a veteran's home also located right next to the hospital and the work that they've done with the veteran's service organizations has made it extremely as successful in a great model for you to replicate I would if I could just comment yeah you're absolutely right the Caribou Maine carry relationship has been one of the most festival aspects of project cart and our intention is to continue the relationship with Kerry and to continue the relationship that we have with the veterans in that community in their use of that wonderful community asset

wyoming mr president reserving the right to object the pump act is no noble in nature but it's an economy-sized approach without flexibilities for for some non-stationary workplaces this legislation would require all modes of transportation that have employees including rail cars be retrofitted with private non-bathroom enclosures to allow for breastfeeding it would also require employees reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk to be clear i recognize the need for breastfeeding women to do just that however many women in this industry are quite literally keeping the trains running on time entire supply chains could be disrupted because of an overly broad and burdensome regulation that is not crafted to fit this industry i can't believe i'm the only one who sees the pitfalls in this regulations like this risk inadvertently doing more harm to working women than helping them i understand what it's like to juggle the need to feed your child while also working to provide for them my daughter is working while raising two little boys mr president this whole thing just makes no sense that's why i'm working on an amendment that would recognize the unique situation working moms in the transportation sector face it's my hope we can work with the bill sponsors to solve this small issue until that time we don't need to exacerbate our supply chain crisis by implementing regulations that do not actually protect or aid women in this industry for that reason mr president i object yes the objection is heard mr president

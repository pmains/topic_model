opening statement thank you very much for holding today's hearing on the status of Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program first I'd like to work welcome all our witnesses to the hearing and look forward to your testimony which I've read and made comments on so I'll be asking a few questions and to our dialogue on this highly successful program I'd also like to formally welcome NIR Deborah Robertson from city of Rialto to the subcommittee Rialto has benefited in the past from the brownfields progress and the continuing has some programs that both miss Norma Torres congressman Pete Aguilar and Norma Torres represent and look forward working with them to address them I look forward to hearing about how your community has utilized the program productively this is the second time this committee has turned to this subject and many as many congress's since we met last on the subject the program has continued to operate as it has since its creation in 2000 efficiently and successfully in fact the data provided by EPA shows that since its inception the brownfield programs has leveraged more than 120 2800 jobs in over 20 3.6 billion in cleanup and redeveloped funding nationwide communities have assessed more than 26,000 400 properties cleaned up more than 15 Hertz and have made 66,000 800 acres ready for reuse back on the rolls for every dollar of brownfield funding more than 16 of other public and private dollars to leverage and more than eight jobs are leveraged for every thousand of EPA brownfields expended it is undeniable that this program is working as it should and that communities across the nation are benefiting from the investment of the federal dollars in the program while effectively returning brownfields into income producers I am troubled however by the recent press reports that the new administration plans to eliminate nearly 40 separate programs at EPA include the brownfields program in fact I am long with ranking member DeFazio vice ranking member st l as ranking members pallone and Tonko from the Energy and Commerce Committee senthil ur to the EPA Administrator on March 10th 2017 on this very subject requesting answers mr. chair alike to has four unanimous consent to enter this into the record without objection in this letter we sought the clarification as to whether or not the administration will support or eliminate this program I'd like to know for the record that is of this date of this hearing we have received no response to me the administration's reluctance to publicly support the brownfield program is puzzling by all accounts this program has been extremely very very very successful every witness that testifies on hearing the last Congress spoke very supportive of the program in fact one witness called it write law for the right reason however this program successes have been hindered by the lack of funds by EPA's own estimates over the past five years funding deficiency have cost 16700 600 several proposals to go underfunded these sites are not only settling idle and unproductive but we are missing out on the returning investment of these sites in fact at these proposed to receive funding it is estimated those grants would have leveraged approximately 54,000 680 jobs and over ten point three billion in public and private financing it begs the question why aren't we investing more in redevelopment of brownfield spaces if this is a success rate of an underfunded program matching the potential economic impact and potential for job creation they would come from fully funding the program mr. chairman this is a program that has received bipartisan support in the past and I hope and will continue to receive bipartisan support in the future and that we support an increase for the EPA this program the program success speaks for itself again I welcome our witness and Thank You mr. chairman for holding this important meeting and I yield back the balance of my time Thank You mr.

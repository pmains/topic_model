up front now democratic congresswoman karen bass of california she is the lead police reform negotiator for house democrats and congresswoman bass i appreciate your time tonight i know that this has been the work of months you've been talking uh to your fellow negotiators two deadlines for a deal have been missed but you've still been working august recess now looming in just days is a police reform deal in serious jeopardy of dying i don't think it's in serious jeopardy but of course i'm concerned about it because we're going on break as you know the house goes on break tomorrow but the senate will be in next week and i know that my colleagues in the senate have been meeting on a daily basis i know i uh hopefully we'll see senator scott tomorrow saw senator booker yesterday so the work goes on of course i am frustrated i wish this would have happened a long time ago but until the two senators say it is over it is not over and you know how long you know that we can negotiate and talk about legislation for a long time before it actually occurs yeah so it's definitely true now you mentioned uh senator tim scott by chief republican negotiator uh he we talked to our own money raju last week about the potential for a deal and said quote if we're having the same conversations next week then it's dead okay that was a week ago you're telling me you just spoke with him yesterday has the conversation changed the conversation that you had with senator yes the conversation is changing and the way i can describe it without going into details is is that when you are negotiating something it's important that you reach a conclusion considering the bill even though the focus was only on one part of the bill the bill is quite complex with about 15 to 20 different pieces and so you go through each of those pieces and work your way to a point where you agree so i don't believe that the conversation is the same this week as it was last week well that's a hopefully hopefully a good sign look i know a major sticking point continues to be qualified immunity and this has been around you know big part of the since the beginning but basically it's the federal doctrine that makes it hard to sue police officers you know individually for wrongdoing senator scott says eliminating for individual officers cannot be on the table he's been calling that a poisoning bill you have said that eliminating it is essential so that would seem to be two positions that are diametrically opposed do you have potential compromise on this i do think there is and let me just tell you that the primary concern that i have is with accountability because i want to stop seeing people brutalized and killed period an average of three people a day are involved in in encounters with police that result in their death that's over a thousand people a year so that's what i want to see stopped and i think one way to stop it is for officers to be held accountable but i also think there's a lot of other things that we can do that will stop the brutalization and killing of people so one bipartisan deal that has been struck in the senate um is the roughly one trillion dollar infrastructure package now democrats in the house actually have had all sorts of objections with it here are two of them i think it's inadequate on many levels i definitely can't support in and of itself this was written by three people who have no knowledge of our expertise in transportation infrastructure i think it needs to be substantially changed okay so uh and and that's just there's more where that came from i mean how hard is it going to get be to get this agreement through the house congresswoman with such a slim democratic majority well i think it is going to be a challenge and i think that we're going to need republican votes but you know really and truly on the infrastructure piece we have to see everything that's in the bill remember the main thing that happened is that they had a vote to begin a debate yes we know that they came up with an agreement but i don't believe now maybe i'm just speaking for myself that uh the members have seen bill language now i know our chair uh peter defazio of course has been way more involved but i don't know that they have shared bill language and until you can actually see what is written it's easy to make a great agreements verbally but we need to see the bill language and anytime the bill moves from one house to the next you know that significant change takes place all right thank you so much i appreciate your time congresswoman you're welcome

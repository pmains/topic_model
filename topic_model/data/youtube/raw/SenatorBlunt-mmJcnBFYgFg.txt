mr president i think the president the president united states has done the things he can do within his authority to try to address the issues before us but the truth is his authority just doesn't go far enough now i have frequently questioned the president's view of how broad the presidential authority is but in these actions he took in the last few days i've looked at them carefully i think he had the authority to do what he did but he'd probably be the first to admit that the authority he has doesn't solve the problem the way it needs to be solved it's time that the congress stepped up and did its job you know in this debate with the president there's the article one view of the government that there's a reason that the legislative branch is article one there's a reason it's our job to pass laws there's a reason that it's the president's job to execute those laws occasionally the president has to act quicker on some emergency basis than the congress and within the fairly narrow ability he has to act on this issue he's tried his best to step up where the congress has failed to step up my good friend from virginia just said well the house bill's three trillion dollars and the senate bill's a trillion dollars we should figure out how to compromise it two trillion dollars now i believe in compromise i think it's the essence of democracy but compromise actually has to be based on some principle of the issue you're dealing with you know if the house bill had been five trillion dollars i guess the logic would be that we'd compromise it three trillion dollars if they'd have known that their bill would have probably been five trillion dollars when the bill was passed it was described by more than one reporter as a democrat wish list or the ultimate campaign platform having everything in it it was described by a whole lot more than one reporter that about a third of their bill has nothing to do with covid and another third of their bill is about the big question of what we can do to help state and local government now let's take let's put that issue aside for a minute it's an issue that clearly the house feels strongly about clearly there are challenges to governments particularly at the local level i think and that has to be dealt with in some way maybe not at the 871 billion dollar level or whatever they've suggested but that's a different issue that i will first of all concede is very much part of the discussion and should be but if you take the third of the bill out that has nothing to do with kovid let's get that off the table i mean we could have a debate about whether people who are in the legal marijuana trade should get access to banking or not but i think you've got to work really hard to make that a covet issue we could have a debate about whether the federal government should require every state in the country to allow ballot harvesting or not but i think that's very hard to make a covid 19 issue a third of the bill according to many people who analyzed the bill when it came out has nothing to do with covet so let's set aside the other third of the bill that deals with state and local government us giving state and local government we don't have to replace money they don't have and i'm not going to say that some element of that won't be in a final bill but let's talk about the things we all need to know need to be in the first bill which in the house bill were about one trillion dollars how do you compromise with the house when you agree with them on a number so they change the number back to school a critical part of what ought to be happening right now and by the way back to school money that schools get in december will not be nearly as helpful as back to school money that schools get in august they need the money now we need to see back to school whether it's distance learning which takes some assets and planning that districts need to do more on or in-person learning where that's possible where you have to have more expenses for probably more bus routes so you don't put as many people on the same bus more expenses for delayed starting times more expenses for social distancing and classrooms but they need that money now so the house in their bill for elementary and secondary in higher education the heroes act put 100 billion dollars we looked at that carefully i chair the committee that does that appropriating we i think know as much in our committee as anybody in the senate about some of the needs that are out there we thought the number was 105 billion dollars as soon as our bill came out the house decided no we really need 400 billion dollars how do you meet somebody in the middle when they keep changing where the middle is when the heroes act what members on the other side of the aisle have repeatedly said we should pass and pass immediately had 100 billion dollars we had 105 billion dollars you would think that would have been good enough might have argued some about the language but there's not much difference on the language the argument is about republicans never spend enough according to the democrats and the democrats seem to have no limit in what they're willing to spend according to us in child care a critical need for people to get both back to school and back to work and the child care system is in intensely stressed as part of what's going on people who lose their jobs and take their children out of child care people who would prefer after they've figured out how to do this a different way not to put their kids back in child care for a little while i haven't talked to anybody who thinks that the child care system will have more than 50 percent of the kids willing to come back that were there before so how do you how do you still make child care work do you double the child care cost to make up for the fact that 50 of the kids aren't there of course not that doesn't work at all so the house put in the heroes act seven and a half billion dollars for child care we put 15 billion dollars for child care and then the house decides well no we really need 40 or 50 billion dollars for child care pretty hard to compromise in the middle if the middle was somewhere between 15 i think hopefully our number would have prevailed 15 and 7 and a half and then suddenly the middle is somewhere between 50 and 15. let's be serious here let's get this job done let's get kids back to school let's get people back to work let's get people back to child care let's do what we can to restore the health care system that's been incredibly stressed during this and let's quit acting like there's this vast disagreement when the disagreement is way more apparent than real if you look at the third of the bill that dealt with covid 19 that the house passed we are very close we're a little ahead of them on testing testing absolutely essential in my view to get kids back to school to get people back to work to until we get well into the vaccine period of of having a vaccine and getting that vaccine to people testing going to continue to be critical we have money for vaccines and vaccine distribution that i think exceeds the house bill money but we can talk about what is really not a very big difference in a trillion dollar bill or something a little more than that we've said in our bill that on testing uh on vaccines on other things we're going to set some priorities for testing we said the federal government priority to be sure that everybody gets that test in whatever way they can get it as quick as they can get it we said nursing homes child care centers elementary and secondary education colleges and universities would be federal priorities employers are going to have to help with some of the workplace priorities but we think those are the right federal priorities and we put in our bill back to work you have to have child care again to get back to work a second round of ppp which again the senator from virginia agreed that this is something we need to do health care provider assistance we ask our health care providers to do the two hardest things you could possibly do at the same time one was stop all of the income you can possibly stop stop the so-called elective surgeries and by the way some elective surgeries get less elective the longer you wait until you have them and we're seeing some results of that right now but i think there was some logic to stop putting people into the hospital if you don't have to or having them in the surges center if we don't you don't have to until we know what's happening here and not only stop the income but stand ready for the worst epidemic uh your community may have ever had to deal with or may ever have to deal with at any time in the future so maintain your full readiness stop your income we need to come back now for the third time and provide money for providers and again money now is much more valuable than money 90 days from now telemedicine finally have woken up to what the federal government should have been doing for a decade and embrace telemedicine as part of normal office visits that don't have to happen in the office as part of behavioral health and you know our bill says that the cms the that determines how medicare money is spent can't go back on what they've allowed in the last few months ever and on some of the things they've allowed they can't go back for a significant period of time to see how this works uh broadband we could deal with this we're going to have telemedicine and tele-behavioral health that kind of medicine as well as other kinds of health medicine you need to have access to broadband if kids who are learning remotely have the same opportunity that other kids who are learning remotely you need to have access to broadband and you need it as soon as you can get it whether that's assistance to get hooked up which is a little easier than just access and we've been working hard in this senate and in our state legislature in my state to get the missourians that don't have access to high-speed broadband to get that access so there are areas here that are the areas we need to be dealing with most of them we really you have to really work hard to pretend there's a disagreement sure you can decide that your education category was really only 25 of what you really needed but but i think our house friends know that's not right and we know that's not right uh this probably not the last bill we'll pass if it turns out we're incorrect on our 100 billion or 105 billion but 100 billion right now to schools getting trying to get started is worth more than 200 billion will be in may let's give people the help they need when they need it let's quit arguing about whether the president has inadequate tools to do what everybody knows need to be done because certainly that's true that should be true the under the constitution the congress has to do its job and compromise is more than some middle number between an outrageous number and a number that may turn out to be not quite big enough let's get serious let's get back to work let's do our job let's get back to school in the country back to work in the country back to child care in the country and do those things we need to do to restore both the health care system and more importantly the health of every american we can possibly help with that mr president i'd yield the floor

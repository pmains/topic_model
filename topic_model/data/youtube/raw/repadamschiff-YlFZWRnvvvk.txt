joining us now is representative adam schiff of california he's the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of the january 6th select committee uh chairman schiff we've been puzzling here over the the is there any strategic reason you could conceive of for russia to attack a nuclear power plant no i can't imagine what the thinking is there you know i understand uh although it's reprehensible why uh putin has been essentially um using the nuclear saber rattling tactic to just raise the temperature but to risk the release of radioactive material to make himself even more pariah uh i i can't imagine there's any strategic thinking to it uh so i have to imagine that this is more incompetence as well as a willingness to just attack civilian targets even without knowing what they are yeah we have seen we have to remember this tonight i think especially in this coverage we have seen a great deal of military incompetence on the russian side including inoperable trucks because their tires are too old uh just kind of stunning uh situations like that and so it is entirely possible uh that that's what's at work here in including a unit uh kind of operating in a renegade fashion you know you can't exclude the possibility i think there have been a number of rude surprises that have been coming putin's way one of them is really how poor the russian planning is now maybe part of the reason why the russian planning is so poor is that putin is isolated and putin hasn't wanted to share his thinking with others i and you know those in his inner circle are probably terrified of contradicting him and even telling him that he was not going to be greeted like as like a liberator in ukraine uh he's also i think been rudely awakened to the strength of sanctions the degree of western unity all of this zielinski's leadership must have come as a rude awakening to him but he has to be really displeased with the performance of his military and i have to hope because i don't think he's insane that attacking a nuclear power plant wasn't on the list of russian war plans you know we've never had a chairman of the intelligence committee have to make the point that i don't think he's insane when referring to a russian dictator but that has been an active question and when i hear you say that i know that you are briefed at the highest level uh by the intelligence community on everything about situations like this ukraine russia and uh the mental state of vladimir putin are you confident in your own are you confident in the intelligence briefings you get on this and are you confident now in your own understanding of what vladimir putin may be capable of uh yeah i think that uh lawrence the intelligence agencies have been pretty spot on uh in their assessment of what putin's plans were uh in their disclosure of putin's false flag operations putin's timing so i have to give them a lot of credit uh tragically they've gotten this exactly right in terms of putin himself i think we have pretty good visibility not perfect but i think we have pretty good visibility you can tell though just watching open source that he is isolating himself uh you know in that highly publicized incident where he dresses down the head of his intelligence agency um because he he wandered off script you can see how far away from putin's requiring people to even sit and by that display of humiliating one of his top officials he's basically telling the russian people that not even his top people are safe from him um but he's also telling his top leaders they dare not contradict him and i have to think that that that covet isolation uh the isolation from getting candidate advice from even his top people because they they're scared to give it to him uh is resulting in a lot of really poor decision makings but i don't think that's a mental health problem chairman adam schiff thank you very much for joining us in our breaking news coverage in the war in ukraine tonight we really appreciate it thank you

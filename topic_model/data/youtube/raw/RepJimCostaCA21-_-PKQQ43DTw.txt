without objection the gentleman is recognized for one minute yes madam Speaker today I rise to talk about America's health care system and the importance of protecting the Affordable Health Care Act residents in my home state of California benefited greatly from the ACA when it became law in 2010 California was one of the first states to implement it at that time 22 percent of my residents had no health care insurance whatsoever and 17 percent were uninsured the ACA greatly decreased that number by less than 10% a big difference while also providing coverage for those with pre-existing conditions which we all feel strongly about now the president wants to strike down those protections and eliminate the last benefits that's wrong these repeated attempts to repeal the ACA are responsible especially when there is no real proposal to replace it by the President of the United States are my Republican colleagues if he succeeds one in seven people in California will lose their health care that's a fact yes there are improvements that can be made to the Affordable Health Care Act and we should address those those deficiencies and that's what I'm committed to doing the Congress and the administration should work together to fix the law and to make it better I yield back the balance of my time for what purpose

the house votes on its tax plan today the Senate is debating its own version of the plan and one Republican senator is publicly opposing it that Senator is Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson and he joins us now I see you have your jacket off you are going to work I like the image senator morning Chris well I'm Norwegian from Wisconsin I get hot walking around pretty fast so good morning well it is it is good to stay cool right now with all the things that you guys have facing you let's start with the moral question about Roy Moore what is your position on the allegations against the senator the allegations of some pretty credible to me and if I were Roy Moore and I'm not I would resign as being candidate and give you Alabama voters what they want a Republican candidate they'll actually be seated in the United States Senate well now let's look at that just for one step because people are arguing let the people decide it's good to hear your position on it you should be a moral leader you were put there to make those kinds of judgments however let the voters decide and if he wins you would have a really tough task to expel him the ethics committee hearings the time the distraction who knows what happens wouldn't be that easy to unseat him and should you have that ability to do that or should the people just decide and not push Roy Moore out I think Supreme Court has ruled that you know a duly elected senator needs to be sworn in but then it's up to the body itself to decide whether we want to expel member and I'm just saying what the reality situation is based on the folks I'm talking to I really seriously doubt that judge Roy Moore would be serving as the United States Senator for very long so he just needs to face that reality and again I think the Florida was of Alabama are quite clear they want a Republican senator not a Democrat one he ought to take that into account mmm all right next issue you came out and said help the little guy as much as you're helping the big guy when it comes to corporate tax cuts if you don't I'm not for this bill the president called you true yes he did What did he say did he change her mind no what he talked about is working with me providing me the information so that we can work together to fix this problem you know the folks who wrote the framework for this tax reform realize if we're gonna make American businesses globally competitive which we must do it's table stakes we need to make sure that every American company remains competitive and we can't leave the pass-through of businesses behind which is why they came up with a 25% pass-through rate the problem is neither the house nor the Senate version on it that 25% rate it's far higher and we are leaving those pass-through businesses behind and those pass-through businesses really are the the engine of economic growth job creation innovation area economy and so I'm just looking for a fair shake for all businesses to maintain the competitive balance and position of all businesses let's upset that apple cart and harm our economy well it's interesting the insight that you've gained here it's kind of a metaphor effect into what one of the criticisms of the overall bill is is that if you want to help the little guy which the president keeps saying it's about middle-class tax cuts then the tax benefits should be over weighted to that group this is a political decision not an economic one but that's not what the House bill does for sure it's not what the Senate bill does either people like me statement against self-interest here get helped more than the middle class which is supposedly what this cuts all about why well first of all I think the tax proposal should all be weighted toward economic growth we're twenty trillion dollars in debt even with mere economic growth crisp revenue the federal government has increased 1.2 trillion dollars per year over 2009 so if you want to really address the debt invested issue you need to grow our economy and again it's the it's the pass-through businesses that really re a large a portion of that economic growth in the Senate bill 82% of the tax relief for businesses goes to see corpse represented large businesses only 18% go to pass right but that's the individual side also III hear you on the corporate side I get the righteousness of your calls let's see what happens I'm saying the same is true on the individual side you're helping people like me more than you're helping the middle class and supposedly this was supposed to be about them well I'm a completely outlier when it comes to what we're doing on the individual side I would I just wouldn't do what we're doing I never promised anybody tax cuts because I'm one of those deficit hawks we don't what don't have enough revenue to pay for all of ours can you be for this so what I'm for is economic growth and that really is on the business side of the equation making sure that all Americans are competitive against each other and globally and grow our economy that's how you actually increase wages on a self-sustaining basis right but the big sell on this as you know is trickle I realized I mean that's what it is they don't want to use that term because it's tainted from those big deficits we wound up with and that huge income disparity we balloon during the Reagan years but that's what it is you give more money to people like me and then I will use private investment to drive benefits to the middle class so they get a booster on top of whatever their actual tax cut is economically it's dubious and practically we've seen that it doesn't work that way every time you shouldn't be guaranteeing it as an outcome how can you be for this bill when it does exactly that well I'm not for the current version bloods on the corporate side and the individual side stays the same well what I want to see is the information to prove the kind of economic growth we're going to get with all of our tax provisions and again I think it's kind of a heavy lift to say on you know cutting individual taxes that that really boosts economic growth it does to a certain extent but all the economic growth driving in this in this tax proposals really on the business side with the understand expensing so it's easier for businesses to expand to create more good-paying jobs boost wages you know Chris we are at full employment so we have just even just slightly more economic growth that's going to put incredible upward pressure on wages that's how you again increase wages money in everybody's pocket and revenue the federal government may be right because what do we see right now you have corporations not pass-throughs necessarily but the bigger corporations are holding unprecedented amounts of cash senator you know this for the audience's edification which is a background in business he's a businesses him before he came and damn Christian they're just raising wages so giving them more cash doesn't necessarily mean that they're raise wages which is why I want more the tax relief on the business side to flow to pasture industries because I really do believe they are the true engine of economic growth and job why don't you do the same thing on the individual side and if you're gonna take a bite out of somebody's behind it should be mine because I have a bigger behind metaphorically in this situation because I make or money and give a bigger benefit to the middle class if that's what you want to do why isn't it that's simple first a lot Chris again I'm an outlier on this in terms of my party I don't want to see any increase in the deficit through individual tax cuts we have all these benefits we've promised to you know baby boomers where we are 20 trillion dollars in debt the projected deficit over the next 30 years is over a hundred trillion dollars maybe as much as 129 trillion dollars this isn't it from my standpoint it's not time to cut individual tax rates what it's time to do is make American businesses competitive globally so our economy can grow and again this the stat that I just told you about right revenues increased federal government by 1.2 trillion dollars per year even with the meager economic growth we've had since 2009 that's really the number one component of a solution here again I'm an outlier I understand that but we really need to make sure that the American economy realizes a full potential Greenspan agrees with you he says now is not the time for tax cuts Garrett Gary Cohen was at a symposium and he listened to all these CEOs said you give us more money we're gonna give it back to the shareholders it's gonna be passed through in dividends so there's a lot to be argued out here senator Johnson the same promise as always when you've got the numbers when you want to make the case about why this is good for the American people you've got time right here well hopefully the president probably get that information I'll come on in there with our your wonder board one more time let's get it on take care Alison every day

I'm dedicated the last 17 years of my career to building businesses that essentially upended the conventional wisdom that you could clean up the environment and improve the economy at the same time all those projects we did recovered wasted energy from industrials turned it into heat and power and lowered people's cost of energy dramatically cut co2 emissions so we built a nice business we employed a good number of people with good clean energy jobs and I felt like for the next stage of my life I wanted to go and try to tackle the policy side of the equation my feeling is that we need to have elected officials in office who will look at facts figure out what the best policy of based on those facts and leave the politics to the side

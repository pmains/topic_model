thank you mr chairman thanks to our witnesses as well for being here today the coronavirus pandemic has affected the whole world but there's no question its impact has been felt disproportionately by our elderly populations nowhere is that more evident than at nursing homes and long-term care facilities we knew early on last year that the coronavirus spreads quickest indoors and at close quarters we knew that those most at risk for complications or even death from coronavirus or the elderly and those with underlying health conditions sadly nursing home facilities combined with all those worst case factors in one place the overwhelming evidence was clear that just about the worst possible thing anyone could do was to knowingly introduce coronavirus into a nursing home and yet that was essentially the policy for states like new york new jersey michigan and pennsylvania which mandated that nursing homes must admit patients who tested positive for coronavirus these state policies ignored guidance the trump administration released on march 13 2020 that said quote nursing homes should amend any any individual that they would normally admit to their facility including individuals from hospitals where a cova 19 case was and it is present only if the nursing home can file cdc guidelines for quarantining cms administrator verma later said quote under no circumstances should a hospital discharge a patient to a nursing home that is not prepared to take care of those patients needs despite these warnings governors of multiple states issued guidance and executive orders forcing nursing homes to admit people with a virus thereby encouraging spread to those vulnerable populations such an abject failure of policy should have invited tough questions from the democratic majority and the media instead the national media rewarded new york governor andrew cuomo with glowing talk about his handling of the pandemic and he received an emmy for his covet leadership while michigan governor gretchen whitmer was receiving vice presidential buzz at the time the media was quick to condemn states like florida for opening its beaches and even branded george's reopening as quote an experiment in human sacrifice yet after sending coronavirus patients into nursing homes full of vulnerable residents governor cuomo was laughing it up with his brother in a softball interview on cnn pennsylvania's top health official took her mother out of a nursing home at the state was as the state was forcing the facilities to take patients testing positive for coronavirus and yet barely a peep from the national media on june 15 2020 i along with other republican members of the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis sent letters to new york pennsylvania california michigan and new jersey inquiring about their policies to take in cope and positive patients mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that those letters and their associated responses be entered into the record last year without objection so thank you last year it was very disappointing to see my democratic colleagues on the coronavirus select subcommittee ignore these concerns and instead spend time questioning the safety of the vaccine developed under operation warp speed and even tried to bully many officials and experts associated with operation warp speed with overzealous investigations into their backgrounds despite the political actions by the democratic majority to attack the trump administration at the time we now have multiple safe and effective vaccines that are successfully protecting people from the virus and allowing businesses to fully reopen at the same time governors who ordered coven positive patients at the long-term care facilities have not been held accountable for their reckless actions i would invite my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in getting to the truth today's hearing would have been far better spent as a bipartisan effort to investigate coping related nursing home deaths and data reporting my question to you grace is how frustrated are you with the fact that governor cuomo ignored cms guideline guidance he endangered vulnerable populations and then covered it up by under counting nursing home deaths by as much as 50 percent let me just say for the record i can't hear grace let me just say for the record i think it's appalling i mean i think we could have used our time in such a much better way on behalf yes we hear you grace you hear me i'd like to answer that i go back i would like to see he says responding let the witness respond to the question it i i it was like nice to my heart to hear um the governor's callousness um him joking on late night tv on his brother's tele cnn spot uh avoiding questions about it he has yet to say an apology to the families although my mother always said you apologize just when you make a mistake i do not believe the governor made a mistake i think he he knew the science and the only thing known from the beginning was that the elderly was the most vulnerable and instead of um isolating the sick he put them in where the most vulnerable were he always said he wouldn't put his own mother in a nursing home so it was like a knife and a heart and we really we really need to know why he did this and why he didn't follow the signs thank you mr truth for your answer thank you thank you mr lord let me say let me say this this hearing i believe has been objective from the beginning until this this present moment when you put people in jeopardy whether you're a democrat republican uh independent are you of course going to respond to that you're talking about governor cuomo and the record will verify or not verify when there is testimony what about the governor of florida see if you you could pick out a state and you could say you're putting people at risk if you don't follow the orders and if you're and excuse me you call it a hoax don't tell me you made this political and that ends it you're absolute that is not the truth mr chairman gentleman's time as a gentlelady's time has expired based on the members in attendance and assistant with committee practice we will move to two to one questioning and now we

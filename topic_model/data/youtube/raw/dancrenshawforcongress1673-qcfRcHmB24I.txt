the second congressional district good morning mr. Crenshaw mornin Allison thanks for having me great to have you what did you think when you heard that you were featured on SNL well you know the the first part of that skit was just strange I don't know what kind of programs that he's watching the second part I think is when it just became dark and innocent as we have thick skin but as veterans it's it's it's hard for us to understand why war wounds would elicit such raucous laughter from an audience and you know so III think they should have I think they should have rethought that joke a little bit if you could even call it a joke so listen here's what people need to know you are a Navy SEAL you did five tours of duty you lost your eye after being hit by an AED in Helmand province in 2012 you've received the Purple Heart two Bronze Stars a medal with valor you could squash Pete Davidson like a grape obviously okay so I mean it's not even a fair fight right he's punching up so what do you want from him this morning well you know yeah everybody's asking that like do you demanded an apology from this man I do not demand an apology he probably should apologize but I don't want some hollow apology I think he's exposed himself I think he's exposed himself for who he really is you know I wish him well I think what him and maybe the producers at SNL should do is pull their money together let's throw a figure out there a million dollars and we will donate that to a series of veterans nonprofits that helps veterans maybe to Navy SEAL foundation maybe wounded warriors maybe folds of Honor I was just at their benefit last night it's a lot of great there's a lot of great organizations out there's a lot of veterans that really need help and frankly you know this kind of thing is offensive to them they feel laughed at okay so that's really interesting I mean I don't know the Pete Davidson has a million dollars but we'll see what SNL comes up with and if SNL needs your call to do something meanwhile while I have you I do want to ask you about some veterans issues um as you know President Trump has been talking a lot on the campaign trail about this migrant crisis as he calls it this group of migrants from Central America that are still roughly a thousand miles away from our border but he is saying that he'd like to send 15,000 troops to the southern US border that's more than are in Afghanistan there's 14,000 more than are in Iraq 5,200 do you think that's appropriate well I think the president and his advisers need to come up with any way necessary to make sure that some people don't break down our barriers the way they broke down the barriers on the Mexican southern border we need to be working with Mexico on this issue and we need to be monitored monitoring it closely so we need to do it as required a lot of those troops are logistical in nature they're there for medical reasons they're there for housing reasons they are building this tent cities like the like the president talked about the bottom line is this we need to stop thousands of people from illegally crossing from one side of our border to the other if you simply allow that to happen or we pretend that there's just nothing to see down there then then we're setting a precedent we're setting a dangerous precedent where there are no laws enforced in our country and that is not sustainable it's not sustainable for a law enforcement already trying to to to defend the border it's not sustainable for our court systems that have to deal with illegal illegal immigrants coming across it's not sustainable for our schools when they have their children in schools or our emergency rooms I'm mr. kretchner I just want a fact check a little bit because just to be clear I are reporting from people embedded journalists embedded with the migrants is that the numbers have dwindled they're not 10,000 at last count dwindle to 3,500 but you know our border agents have processes they have rules for when people present themselves at the border it would not look like what happened in Mexico I mean they've dealt with this before is my point they've dealt with people well having our oh well because there were other so-called caravans in previous years that have shown up at the border and we treated them like asylum seekers and processed them and they were dealt with so in other words it wasn't a crisis by the time it showed up at our border it's it's it may be it won't be this time either but to not be prepared for it I think would be a disservice to the American people okay next question on are you comfortable with the fact that President Trump has not visited a military base in a combat zone since becoming president well he often asked the president why or what benefit that would have he said that at some point I will do that at some point but I don't think it's overly necessary I've been very busy with everything here so I'm just getting your take on as commander-in-chief is Kashif he's he's quite busy I was in the military for ten years I never once saw any president visit a base that I was at and I felt that I could do my job just fine but do you think that it helps morale when a US president shows up at a military base in a combat zone it it could it could help morale but I will tell you this I still keep in contact with a lot of the the soldiers the seals who are out there serving morale is actually very high and and the reason is this the president gives our generals and our troops the ability to do the job to build the ability to to to go forth with the mission that we have given them it did not feel that way under the Obama administration and I have to tell you the truth on that it really didn't feel that way troops do feel like the president has their back and and morale is actually pretty high all right Dan Crenshaw thank you very much for your perspective

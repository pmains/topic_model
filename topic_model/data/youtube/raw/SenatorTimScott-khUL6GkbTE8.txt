meanwhile folks president by not letting inflation recession economic morass and mlas uh of course all that he engineered go to waste the president writing a letter to refiners essentially blasting them and their profits for not doing enough to lower the price of gasoline part of the letter read that we're in a crunch and that fa and people are facing uh you know families are in trouble and we need immediate action he's talked about his administration and some near-term solutions to the crisis joining me now to discuss republican senator tim scott of south carolina and i got to tell you senator there's obviously disdain for capitalism at this white house and i know i know they want to attack the for-profit business model and apparently they think their main target should be oil companies you remember back in the day it was always oil companies they always had the guy raymond from exxon mobil trade you know they were enemy number one and then where did oil go oil companies fell off the map all went from 148 to 38 no one thought about it anymore but i think it's part of a larger picture in this there ultimately it's disdain for for capitalism yeah they they certainly misunderstand the american economy remember the president said during his state of the union speech that you have to lower costs by increasing wages that tells me he has no clue what happens in the free market as a business owner i can tell you we need more free marketeers we need more capital it's not fewer capitalists number one number two remember gas prices went up 60 before thanksgiving last year which means it was three months before russia and the ukraine situation even occurred so what we continue to see out of this administration is who can i blame next russia didn't work putin didn't work now let's go to the ceos of the same companies that last year in house hearings they were saying don't you dare produce any more energy so you can't have it both ways you can't tell the companies stop doing it we're going to punish you if you do it and then say why aren't you producing the energy and frankly you and i both know that the prospects of getting companies no matter what industry you're in to put billions and billions and billions of dollars into research and development and excavating energy and then have the threat of the united states government coming in and saying why are you doing that that kind of schizophrenic attitude is bad for every single person at the pump and we layer on the esg part of this but before i get to that and you just reminded me energy secretary granholm actually recently was asked about this warrant capitalism i want you to listen to what she had to say hear a response please it's a capitalistic market we're not against profit it's just that when you have 225 percent increase in profit year over year and q in quarter one i mean it just tells you something else is going on it tells me i want those companies in my portfolio my retirement account that's what it tells me hey but here's the thing they want price and they want price and profit controls and it sounds to me like the old soviet union well listen they believe in socialism i always tell folks that what we're seeing today is this incremental approach towards getting us closer and closer to a socialist economy and that works terribly for the poorest americans in this country if you're coming from a neighborhood like the one i grew up in the one thing you should know about a caste system created by socialism is you're stuck at the bottom it's free markets and capitalism that believes that there's more that the pie can be increased in size and because of that you too can live the american dream and what these folks are doing is exactly the opposite that's what uh tocqueville discovered when he came to america he went back and wrote the book and he couldn't believe it he was astonished i mean what kind of a country is this everybody thinks they can be successful uh let me ask you about the republican party major victory in texas uh this week and there's obviously a major shift with black and hispanic votes it's palpable you can feel it why is it happening well there's no doubt that the administration has just let down their primary voters they continue to tell people living in poverty we are here for you but you look at a 40-year high frankly in inflation and you go to the gas pump and your prices are 100 higher you go to walmart or to the grocery store and you say i can't afford bacon i can't afford fruit i can't afford fish you look at your accounts they're all going down your credit card balances are all going up and you come to the conclusion the buying administration is a part of the problem for people living in marginalized communities and that's disproportionately african-americans and hispanics so come to the gop the great opportunity party and let us show you what we've already done and we'll do it again i like that i never heard that for the acronym all right so a minute ago the gop wins the great opportunity party you win the house you win the senate by large margins we take shellacking 2.0 what does it mean for the economy well it's good news it breathes more confidence into the economy number one number two we stop more bad policies like buildback better or as i like to call it buildback broker from being ever considered again so less money feeling more inflation is good for every single person living paycheck to paycheck the way i grew up so we've got good news coming for every single american in the country as we win these elections senator scott is always good news when when you're on the show i appreciate it thank you so much thank you charles god bless

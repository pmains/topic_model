thank you mr chairman uh secretary budage there has been already early stage planning for passenger rail linking atlanta and charlotte with a possible stop in the athens area there's also advanced discussion of rail connections between atlanta and savannah with a possible connection in the macon area the south is often left out of inner city passenger rail discussions will you please commit to working with my office to ascertain what can be accomplished through upcoming infrastructure legislation to expand inter-city rail connections in the southeast region and comment on such initiatives if you see fit thank you yes i'd welcome a chance to work with you on this i think many of the most compelling uh opportunities for uh strong rail connections are in uh the south and the southeast and as you mentioned it's not just the uh cities at the endpoints of these routes but those in between making on the one route the athens or commerce communities in the other all of these could unlock opportunity throughout the region and when that happens makes the country as a whole stronger which is part of why the president's jobs plan includes such robust resources to expand access to quality rail in the u.s

well that brings us to the conclusion of this hearing let me again thank our four witnesses you are all experts in your field you've all brought some incredibly riveting testimony some concerning testimony just in the sense that more of these questions need to be asked and frankly uh we we should be getting answers from others who were also invited but didn't come forward because there are a lot more questions to be answered about the origins of covet 19 i think it's been very clear from all of your respective testimony that the origins of coven 19 came from the lab whether it was engineered just completely from the mice uh was there a source a host like a bat but the bottom line is we need to be asking more of these questions especially to people who do have these answers and there are some people who have these answers who chose not to come i would urge our counterparts in the majority party to hold a bipartisan hearing where subpoena powers would be involved where we can compel all witnesses who know information that has not been put on the table to come forward we're here to find facts we found out a lot of facts today i think facts that are very helpful facts that show that if china was just fourth right early off in this process going back to september october of 2019 when they knew what was going on in that lab but lied to the rest of the world lives could have been saved hundreds of thousands if not millions globally could have been saved so let's make sure we get those answers so it never happens again but also there needs to be accountability as well those are things that congress should be debating so far this majority has chosen not to let's also continue to call for a expedited hearing on senate bill 13 48 which would declassify much of that information that the director of intelligence of national intelligence has on the origins of covet 19 again it passed the senate unanimously this is not partisan legislation let's get all of these facts out there and those others who have information and have not yet come forward now is the time to come forward the american people deserve to know uh wherever the facts lead and if the facts don't lead in a place that you're comfortable with the facts are going to come out anyway it's better for everybody who has information to bring it forward so that we can at least ask these questions get the information and learn from what happened it's been very very helpful uh that we got this information out i think you've all done an incredible service and having this having this broadcast i think will open up and shine a light even brighter on something that we still need to dig and get more answers for so with that thank my colleagues for participating thank our witnesses again and we stand adjourned

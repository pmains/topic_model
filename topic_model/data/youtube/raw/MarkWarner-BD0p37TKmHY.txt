thank you mr chairman i appreciate also the opportunity to go in front of my friend john tester um you know i want to i'll just ask one question that i wanted to highlight and that's for mr pierce um you know if we go back and it's an issue i've been working on for some time to 1982 i think congress created in the student loan program the ability for a couple to consolidate their loans together and and at a slightly lower rate pay on it in a single um um you know a single payment the pitch made i think probably some good macro sense but at that point the congress never allowed even if the couple were to then separate or to get divorced any ability to separate this consolidated loan and consequently one party or the other oftentimes the female spouse got stuck with that burden do you know mr pierce any other student loan product where it does not allow borrowers to separately um if they took on their debt separately to somehow not separate again if they have some kind of an event like a divorce to take place no i do not well i appreciate that now you know i i uh matter of fact this was so egregious that congress stopped issuing this type of loan consolidation with this restriction on being able to separate the payments downstream if the couple comes apart in 2006. this came to my attention from a woman named sarah who was a single mom and and teacher in mclean um she and her ex-husband separated the ex-husband frankly um didn't pay his share of the bills and sarah single mom as a teacher got stuck paying that joint consolidation effort literally um for months she ended up having even some of her wages garnished mr pierce the education department has told me they're approximately remember these were all loans pre-2006 14 000 plus outstanding joint consolidation loans with held by the department with the total outstanding balance of about 800 million dollars um can you talk a little bit about you know this issue i know you're familiar with it what kind of burden it puts on on on these individuals oftentimes who may have been in a abusive relationship oftentimes uh their former partner being willing to basically screw it i'm gonna leave all this obligation on you um you know i've got a bill with senator rubio and and senator smith and and senator cornyn um that would allow this kind of breakup to take place could you could you weigh in on that and and uh give me your views absolutely so you mentioned a number of the problems with these loans particularly in cases of domestic violence or or um marriages where one spouse is taking advantage of the other and it causes uh financial ruptures in families where one spouse may end up assuming responsibility for the debt owed jointly your bill would help dissolve these loans but not just to help provide a fair outcome for borrowers but to actually restore access to key parts of the student loan safety net that are denied to borrowers that have these so-called spousal consolidation loans including access to public service loan forgiveness and the ability to get an income driven repayment that actually matches their financial circumstances right now the student loan safety net is failing people with the so-called spousal consolidation loans and your legislation would fix this mess well i i appreciate that mr pierce um and i would point out mr chairman ranking member this is something that we've got virtual unanimity there's one senator who still has a hold we're trying to work through this but this is a bipartisan not going to solve all the problems but for 14 000 americans who are caught up in in these joint consolidation loans many of them having circumstances again as mr pierce just said with spousal abuse we could provide some much needed relief my hope is that uh we can get that one senator's hold removed and um i will you know yield back the balance of my time

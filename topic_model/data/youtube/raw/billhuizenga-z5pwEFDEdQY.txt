chairman camp I appreciate that and I'm a little confused myself I saw one of our Senate colleagues from New York on television this morning talking about how we needed to pass this two-month extension and he would be the first one on an airplane back to Washington DC so that we could negotiate a year-long deal I'm confused why don't we just do that right now that's what the American people expect the American people expect us to get this deal done right now and to provide them some certainty for an entire year versus two months now this this monday morning I had a breakfast with my joint chambers of Congress Commerce and Holland and Zeeland and that we had almost 500 people there and when I asked the question who here thinks that this two-month extension is a good idea not a single hand went up I said okay maybe I need to ask this a little differently who here thinks that this is a dumb idea to do two-month extension virtually every single hand in that breakfast went up the American people are looking for long term solutions employers are looking for long term solutions it's called quarterly reports all right I'm a small business owner often times people have to file quarterly reports we're not even doing them the service of giving them a full quarter to change their paperwork or doing two out of three months now you want to talk about a burden on small business I can tell you it is it's time for this house to go to work which we have done it's time for our Senate colleagues to do the exact same thing because guess what my three employees Irv Dirk and Larry they're all at work today why isn't that good enough for the Senate there's two things that fundamentally need to be included in this first and foremost is 12 months of certainty let's get through that debate of how we are going to offset the costs and how we are going to make sure that this works for the employee the employer those with the job and those without a job we also need to make sure that we don't lose sight of the Keystone pipeline in here immediate 20,000 jobs that can be provided here in the United States 20,000 jobs that could come to this country and help alleviate the need for these systems then need for unemployment insurance and it's the right thing to do Thank You mr. chairman

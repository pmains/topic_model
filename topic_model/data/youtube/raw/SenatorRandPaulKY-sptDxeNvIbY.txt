and earlier i sat down with senator rand paul to discuss the violent riots and mobs that continue to terrorize cities across our country take a look senator thanks for being with us i understand that at least one person has been arrested from the angry mob who attacked you and and your lovely wife kelly do you have any confidence that there will be consequences for the people who are being arrested in these mobs i think it's the only way we can stop this is people who break the law have to be arrested there has to be a punishment unfortunately the man that tried to get to us who tried to knock the policeman down to get to us was arrested for punching the policemen and causing a cut that required stitches uh around the per the policeman's eye but then he was released on his own recognizance which means by i assume no bail he's just gone in fact i sort of sarcastically said on twitter today if you're looking for him you might try kenosha but this is uh not funny these protesters we now pictures of protesters who've been in portland kenosha louisville dc question is who's who's financing this and who's flying them around it really is a federal crime to incite riot and to fly people around to instigate violence and i think that's what's happening and yes we've got to get to the bottom of this one person at a time and once we have suspicion or probable cause we need to ask a judge for a warrant and they need to look at their financial records and see for this okay but do you have a an idea of who might be financing this no and uh but we do need to get to the bottom of this because there's one or two possibilities it could be nefarious rich individuals who want to foment violence in our cities or it could be less sinister but still equally as bad black lives matter is out there collecting corporation money from corporations who want to show the public that they're not racist but these corporations need to know if that money's going to black lives matter and black lives matter is giving it to hooligans to cause and create havoc in cities someone has to trace the money i don't know the answer yet but i certainly think we need to know i believe attorney general bill barr is doing that as as as we speak but you know what is happening in the criminal justice system is so different now i mean the idea of the so-called bail reform which means literally no bail but now we've got prosecutors including a prosecutor from contra costa county in california who says that her prosecutors should consider whether looters have been arrested for stealing before charging them they should consider the looters needs in other words if the looter is poor and needed something that maybe they shouldn't prosecute and in manhattan now the the d.a sci vance is telling his assistant das you know make sure that there is a police brutality and if you need to get the arrestees the looters to testify against the police i mean how are we going to change this criminal justice system will it ever change npr had a woman on there talking about why looting was justified would that not violate twitter's policy basically that you're not supposed to be inciting violence is looting not violence you had a member of the black lives matter from chicago after all the store fronts were broken running around saying this is this baby this is this is reparations baby and so really in a civilized world we have people making an argument for looting so this is the question i have for joe biden and kamala harris how come they won't condemn these people who attacked my wife and i and the two other women that were with us they they can't attack and all they do is they get on tv and they say oh yeah there's violence we don't like violence but it's all donald trump's fault well the cities that the violence is occurring in have been run by democrats for 50 years law and order is largely the province of mayors and governors not the federal congress or presidents and so really the failure is coming from these cities and they need to own up to it because frankly i think a lot of people are not going to be happy living in a country that looks like portland and i think senator what we're seeing now is more and more people more and more prosecutors being elected uh and having their elections funded by these left-wing organizations but senator rand paul thanks so much for being with us this evening thank you

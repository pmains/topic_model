we'll never become law but we do have an opportunity actually to do something real and and allay the concerns legitimate concerns of farmers ranchers and others who feel that the EPA is either overreaching or has written a somewhat garbled rule I would agree with that but instead of approaching it in a measured way and saying we want to be certain that you're not doing this and we want to be certain that you are doing this this would say that anything and everything that they have considered over the last two years in developing this rule is now ineligible for future consideration well what does that mean well it means that the determination that certain things are exempt well we probably can't revisit those can we use the court's decision or any of those documents seems not so where do we end up if if this cockamamie thing passes the house and becomes law which you won't well where we end up is back in the the earlier era of the 2003 and 2008 guidance and many of the groups are here today supporting this unbelievably broad overreach are actually groups who have ejected strenuously to what the Bush administration did in the 2003 guidance and the 2008 guidance here's a quote from the American Farm Bureau 2003 no clear regulatory definitions to guide their determinations what has emerged is a hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories 2008 American Farm Bureau guidance is causing confusion added delays and it already burden and strain permit decision making process which ultimately will result and is resulting increased delays and cost the public at large then on the other side groups National Wildlife Federation Ducks Unlimited also found the objections of the 2000 you know the 2003 2008 guidance to be totally inadequate and of course the Supreme Court itself split for 1/4 on this on one of the guiding documents behind this so instead of waiting in rolling up your sleeves and acting like legislators you're acting like idiot ideologue here today and you're saying nothing that was considered in developing this rule can ever be used again to develop a future rule what does that mean that means you are stuck with the 2003 2008 guidance which all these groups found to be disturbingly inconsistent expensive causing unnecessary delays and we need new guidance we do need new guidance we do need new definitions but there's some who have the agenda of wanted to repeal the Clean Water Act altogether let's go back to the good old days when you could light a match and watch the Cuyahoga River burn or when the Willamette River in Oregon was an open sewer let's go back to those good old days before the Clean Water Act no I don't think the American people want to go there and I don't think a majority in this house and want to go there but instead of fixing and limiting the problems and the potential defects of this incompetent rulemaking that's ongoing and is at this point only proposed perhaps the agency itself will wake up and withdraw and revise the rule that's what public comment periods are all about but no we're going to preempt it before then and say nothing that went into developing this rule can ever be considered again in developing another rule you're stuck with something that doesn't work which these same groups objectives so you know maryse add that we are at a legislative body anymore you take someone who's got a tough race you give them a bill they go out and Rob Rob Roth and they pretend they did something and they go home and get reelected instead of really doing something thomas expired gentleman from West Virginia reserves and the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized I thank

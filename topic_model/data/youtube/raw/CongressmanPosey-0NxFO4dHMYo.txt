uh Miss Quinn Smith and your written testimony uh you stated by increasing China's profile on International standards bodies it aims to implement the nation's China standards 2035 blueprint and built and Road Initiative for the Next Generation technology what can Congress do particularly the health science committee to ensure the U.S maintains their leadership in the international standards base thank you Congressman well standards have for many years been a non-tariff barrier even our colleagues in the EU have used standards as a way to protect a different technology or innovation path from the U.S in adopting standards we have as you know a private sector standards-driven process with various committees nist our National Institute for standards and Technology plays a role but at the end of the day it's the private sector committees that develop our standards they do not have quite frankly the reach the resources to participate in many of these critical standards bodies so it's very important for us in my opinion to beef up the capacity of nist and our private sector bodies to participate fully at scale because sometimes we only send one or two people to a standards body and you look at the international organizations I mean China now is is poison and they may be the head of the inner of the IPO the intellectual property organization so we need to invest and populate these International groups because the U.S alone cannot do that and then also it goes back to what I said about technology statecraft we need to work with our allies and partners UK Australia Japan India increasingly and the EU on these standards that are so critical in the technologies that determine National Security because all of these are dual use Technologies quite frankly yeah they like to play everybody's game by their rules Mr strugmire and you're written testimony you had recommendations regarding the national s t strategy and quadrennial s t reviews one recommendation is the need for skilled technical Workforce you know I represent the Kennedy Space Center and and heard from companies that the need for these highly skilled technicians is really great what policy changes do you believe are needed to help us maintain a pipeline of this kind of personnel well thank you so much for asking that question because it it oftentimes goes a notice that that the skilled technical Workforce is really the underpinning of a lot of the Science and Technology development that we do you look at large facilities like the Large Hadron Collider you look at the ligo facility that had the the first gravitational wave uh there are people technicians who develop you know capabilities to to have very incredible vacuums and things like that to keep these facilities going they're skilled machinists that use 3D printing and other kinds of things so they're very very important I think what we we need to know we heard an example from Dr badel that that Lawrence Livermore in their own initiative they reach out to two-year and technical schools to incentivize the folks to do this and I think we need to make sure not only are we resourcing them but we're making clear the value that they have that this is not just sort of a second class citizen job if you don't have a PhD well it doesn't really matter no these folks in many respects are the the underpinnings of our s t Enterprise so we need to have programs the National Science Foundation has one in particular uh for the skilled technical Workforce it's I forget exactly the name of it something like something Career Tech education or whatever but but those Investments are very very important uh across all all disciplines to incentivize these folks coming in and showing the value that that they they actually have uh Mrs Webb Smith would you repeat uh your uh statistic uh that you mentioned earlier about graphite 90 of the world's sourcing of graphite comes from China thank you very much

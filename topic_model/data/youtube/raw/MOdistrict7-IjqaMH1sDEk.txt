i rise today to address an important issue that is the scandal engulfing the irs lois lerner is a central handle surrounding the irs's decision to target certain groups of americans for scrutiny and other unequal treatment due to their political beliefs now we have learned emails pertinent to this investigation are missing in very suspicious circumstances involving multiple deletions of records in the fiscal loss of computer equipment the missing emails only add to the irs as gross misconduct and raise disturbing questions about the professionalism and neutrality of bureaucrats who were supposed to enforce the law in a fair even-handed manner in may the house held lois lerner in contempt of congress and passed a resolution calling for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the irs the irs conduct appears widespread and almost certainly harmed the right of free speech which we cherish in this country it is critical that congress discovers the full truth of what happened at the irs and that the responsible individuals are held accountable for their actions madam speaker i yield back the gentleman's time

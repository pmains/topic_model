the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida mr. Posey for five minutes thank you very much as chairman and and thank you for calling this hearing homelessness is not something that's on the radar every day but it's a it's a massive massive problem and and I don't think anyone's districts are completely immune from it miss Lilly I think your written testimony and and your verbal testimony may be some of the most compelling that I've heard so far thank you very much for that I love family promise my wife and I became aware of it and we work through our church and I know it's effective I know what you're saying is the truth it's another example of how much more productive efficient and effective privately operated functions can be then government monolithic one-size-fits-all you're in or you're out structures that clearly have not seemed to have worked very well or there wouldn't be a need for so many of the other organizations such as yours a question that demands an answer after reading all of your testimony a couple times actually how did how did you break the cycle how did how did you free yourself and your family I was supported by Family Promise and so I'm actually the deputy director of the organization that served my family four and a half years ago and so it was it was the support that allowed me through that process and they they extended a lot of grace to me emergency shelters generally will time a family out after 90 days and ask them to exit and then reapply if there's availability I stayed in shelters straight for more than six months I did receive assistance through rapid rehousing on the back end of shelter to be able to house my family and that supported me on my trajectory forward once I exited the sheltering was stabling housed I wanted to give back and so I started volunteering with Family Promise a year after exiting shelter I became a staff member and have just kind of climbed up the ranks ever since and homelessness has kind of become my life sense I think it's important to recognize in my personal story that I received some assistance that was HUD funded that helped me overcome my situation it was after six plus months in shelter it was after an extreme amount of time of struggling my special boy Jerry my homeless situation had two more long-term hospitalizations because the process is stressful for him as it was for me but that that that HUD funding that helped me get back on my feet I was availa it was I was able to utilize it before that six-month mark however when you're looking at rapid rehousing I had to qualify for a landlord that was willing to take those funds and my family as you can imagine a lot of landlords look at an application and say currently homeless six kids lower income than it used to be a year ago and they go and you know I think I'll pass especially when you're in communities with low vacancy and so it took a long time for me to find a landlord willing to work with me which is why that may not have been the most effective across-the-board intervention that we're offering to families how would you specifically suggest we redefine homeless eligibility at HUD specifically I think that we need to broaden the definition to align with other federal with other federal systems we need to include the families that are doubled up we need to include the families that are living in a motel they are not stabling housed most of these parents are out trying to figure out how they're gonna pay for the motel room tomorrow they they're not sure how they're going to stay with a friend another week longer they're sitting in in bedrooms on floors with their children telling them that they can't cry telling them that they can't access the frigerator because it's not their food it's not a housing situation it's a floor it's cut it's a blanket and it's not acceptable we have to expand it we have to truly work to to serve the most vulnerable and acknowledge that just because just because a family has four walls around them that that doesn't mean that they're not vulnerable there's there's a lot of assumptions that go into the Alliance saying that we're not this this expands that we're not only are gonna be serving the most vulnerable that that they they haven't done the research to back up these families are vulnerable they are being victimized and they deserve a spot in the line for resources based on their vulnerability if you can make one change besides the definition what would that be I would allow communities to be able to use the the resources that best fit their community dynamic in the current housing dynamic of that community so if transitional housing is effective in a community and proven effective in a community that had not prioritized it being defunded thank you I see my time stops thank you chairman Jim Neil's back to the church

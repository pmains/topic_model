um let me move to why we originally invited you we talk about these Tick Tock bands and I think a lot of people don't quite understand what they are the state Bans are not bands people in Oklahoma can still use tick tock it's people that work use it a device that the Oklahoma that the state government pays for that they can't use tick tock explain how your band you're calling for a full band how do you pull that off so originally Senator Holly and I wanted to ban devices on government phones president Trump actually did that by executive order now we are introducing legislation that would ban Tick-Tock in this country as long as it's owned by the communist Chinese party we will not tolerate them Gathering Intelligence on our young people to use in a future cyber war and so it is really important that we first educate Americans about the dangers of buying this kind of a product from from China and secondly uh seek to ban them now I think competition is great and I think that having Tick Tock competing with Facebook is is exactly what we need in this country but we want to make sure that it's an American-owned company or at least that we have some certainty that the the data that is created by these users is kept in this country without any access from the Chinese Communist Party well what you're describing and I've been down this road with the owners of tick tock that's what they claim they're they've created with Oracle that Oracle is going to own the data is that enough or do you think a full divestment by of bite dance is what's necessary here well I I think there needs to be a separation but I am happy to attend hearings and learn more about what they claim is is happening there are still information out there that they can seek to remove people from from China giving the order to remove people on Tick Tock and so I I think there's a danger and I think it's important for us to hold hearings and and pass legislation if necessary uh I don't mean to pick a scab here but I know you wanted to be the subcommittee chair of the Judiciary Committee uh having to do with antitrust legislation there are reports that you're not going to be able to do that um Thomas Massey got uh got that gavel he's very much a Libertarian which in when it comes to antitrust might mean he's total hands-off does that slow down this idea because you did seem to be have some conversations with Amy Klobuchar I think in the Senate like there's been some bipartisan discussion here is this slow it down or do you think Thomas Massey will will pick up this uh mantle no I think that my good friend uh Thomas Massey will oppose antitrust legislation he's voted against it in Committee in the past um and and he is ideologically opposed to the bills that that we have introduced however um it isn't the only way to to move forward on this and we're going to explore all possibilities to make sure that we protect the American people from these big tech companies but realistically this does seem to slow things down at least on your side of the your side of the uh of the fence there in the capital it motivates me more to to get out and and get members excited about it so I think it slows it down in one on one route uh it opens it up and some others Congressman Ken Buck a republican from Colorado I blew it last time I didn't realize you didn't have Greely in your District anymore I keep learning all the new remaps so uh but uh it is uh I got to get re-familiar with the with the new map there anyway Congressman Buck thanks for coming on and sharing your perspective with us

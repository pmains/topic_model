I mean, I will not sign up
to anything that does not produce the energy we have
in the backyard. I can absolutely, it just did
went through me like a knife when they start
talking about reopening negotiations, or taking
the sanctions off of Venezuela and Iran. I will
not in any way shape or form support a vote for
any of that. When we have in our backyard, how are
we asking other people in the world to produce what
we want? We have it. That's so hypocritical.
I'm not going to do that and I never have thought
that would be the answer.

out front tonight Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia he's a member of the gang of six who tried failed to make a grand bargain last year but he tried and has made a lot of deals and progress with Republicans across the aisle I started by asking him how long he thinks it's going to take for America that that Triple A rating back the challenge is if we don't act by the end of the year to avoid the sequester or if we simply kick the can down the road further we could even see a further downgrade of our debt which would mean it might be decades before we could get it back so i know there was a lot of folks last year who thought we were look you know the little boy who cried wolf we said if we don't do this we'll get a downgrade will have a negative effect we got the downgrade we we didn't see the stock market real terribly but clearly consumer confidence was hit then the super committee failed and last fall and again we didn't see a real negative effect but I do feel like that story the little boy who cried wolf the first two times he cried wolf nothing happened the third time and this is the third time with the fiscal cliff I think if we don't act we could see not only another down debt downgrade that we could see a real decline in our economy Treasury secretary Geithner was giving an interview to Bloomberg and he was he was he was so much more sanguine he said look you know they're only charging us a percent and a half to borrow money for ten years look we borrow more than a trillion dollars over the past year since we got downgraded your senator you're a businessman things can change really quickly when it comes though to those rates right Erin I mean we're in pretty good shape until the bond market turns against us you know in a strange way we have not been hit as hard because Europe has looked even worse yeah and so let's talk a little bit about that cuz part of the fallout obviously you know as you said from the from the debt ceiling debacle and the subsequent downgrade was the sequester that's now looming you're in a tough spot given that you're from Virginia which is such a defense heavy state but if there is a sequester would you keep it as structured or would you support the shift to say well look let's not make those defense cuts but but make some of them more of them from the services side of the equation like some of your Republican colleagues have pushed for iron first of all I think it's kind of ironic it's some of the very congressional leaders who put together the so-called sequester these automatic cuts to try to force us to act who are the ones who are the shrill lists sometimes about trying to cut back on government spending are now saying we want to cut back oh they're spending not this bending it is a great honor yes it is a great irony you know it I was I don't want to have the sequester I don't want to have the defense cuts actually in a state like ours but there's gonna have to be cut backs and what I think is rather than just fixing the defense cuts or just kicking the can down none of this gets any easier every day we fail to act we had four billion dollars to our national debt let's come back brush off our gang of six plan of the simpson-bowles plan that raises revenues that looks at our entitlement programs to make changes there so we don't have to make all these cuts I'm only going to say this because I've noticed you're a little bit hoarse maybe it's from yelling at people because you're losing your voice that they won't actually get this done but I mean is there a chin you were the group of six you had a deal you and you know Tom Coburn have come on this show together the left and the right said look we have a deal and and yet here we are I mean is there any chance of us getting a grand bargain because sometimes it just feels like you got a voice of reason like you or like Tom Coburn and yet we're going to end up going off this cliff is seeing our debt go down further because nobody's working together you know I actually think we will solve this problem I think the necessity of doing it will force us anybody that thinks there's going to be a Democrats only solution or Republicans only solution is just not dealing in reality so there are a large more the Gang of Six we have about forty five senators saying we want to get something done we're going to lay it out and you know when I get depressed I always go back to that wonderful Winston Churchill quote that said you can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they've tried everything else well we've kind of tried everything else it's now time for us to do the right thing and I know you said you got a number of new ideas and I get it that you don't want some of them shot down that is how that this this incredibly polarized environment seems to work but can you give us the sense of something that's in there i mean it's just really a rehash of different packaging of a simpson-bowles group of six or or they're gonna be a couple of new things and if so can you tell me about one well I think we need to think about for example on the entitlement side on the healthcare side and to get the kind of sustainable savings that we need we've got to look not just as chairman bernanke of the feta said not just looking the kind of the way Congress does budgets on a 10 year basis you've got to look on a longer term because some of the changes we will be proposing will be phased in over a longer period of time so if you get a lot of savings in its year in year 12 or 13 we got to figure out a way for that to count I also this is just my personal view believe we need a plan that not only reforms our entitlement code or our tax code to generate more revenues to lower some of our deductions but we need an approach where every American can find a way to chip in even a little bit into the solution set on this problem this is an area where this is a broader base kind of contest it just kind of broadening the base but with the sense that everybody needs to make some level of contribution one final question when you talk about taking everything on and you're someone who's you know taking the heat you know on your own side and stood up for things Virginia on this issue of defense I mean you know your States put out all of this information saying look we get about a million jobs from the defense industry one of the top three states in the country department of defense obviously is your largest employer visa V the Pentagon nearly twenty percent of your of your state's economy so but you're willing to say look I don't like the sequester but I recognize the need for more defense cuts right and that's a pretty courageous thing to say when i look at your state the defense budget has doubled in the last decade we need to make sure that America keeps the strongest defense in the world but as the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Admiral Mullen the biggest threat to our national security is not the terrorists but this debt and deficit so the idea that we're going to be able to exclude any part I don't want to do the sequester I think we can avoid the sequester but we not by simply kicking the can down the road but by actually putting a comprehensive plan let's go where when you're really going to solve this we got to generate some more revenues and we've got to find a way not to spend as much on the entitlement programs and make sure that they are sustainable over 20 30 year period all right senator Warner always a pleasure thank you so much

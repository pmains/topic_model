mr speaker today i rise in opposition to h.r 5746 late last night the democrats hijacked a bipartisan piece of legislation that i helped draft to allow nasa to lease property and help fund their own budget shortfalls this bill would have been vital to america's space program and mississippi's fourth district with stennis space center in our backyard to no one's surprise democrat socialists hell bent on minimizing the power of american voters have jammed through their radical agenda to include this so-called voting rights legislation this legislation only does one thing it ensures that democrats remain in power by tipping the scales by limiting your first amendment and slashing states rights why else would the democrats spend so much time catering to non-citizens giving them taxpayer benefits allowing them to stay in our country and now giving them the ability to unconstitutionally vote in american elections democrats believe that behind every illegal immigrant as a democrat voter only waiting for a bill like this to pass this legislation shreds our founding documents and bastardizes the sacred rights of american citizens only to appease a group of socialists we all know that democrats need every advantage to give them any hope in november after seeing their commander-in-chief's gross incompetence and tanking approval ratings they have the slimmest house majority in history in an even split in the senate still mated by a few democrats who refuse to bow to the demands of the socialist agenda democrats know the american people reject their ridiculous policies and we cannot allow them to cheat their way back into power with this bill i strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this hijacked bill and i yield back

since my colleagues have spent the last six months avoiding negotiations and I didn't come here tonight the water to wine so we're going to say like it is my fellow Americans this house of representatives passed its budget over 200 days ago on march twenty first then the senate as its budget two days later now think about what i just said what happened to it well the usual protocol is that the two sides named conferees they come together in conference and they work out a budget that that happen that's six months ago we've been asking to go to conference so we can resolve our differences and there are always differences within parties between parties you name it we want to fund the government we want to get rid of sequestration like chairman Rogers said on July the 31st 2013 I believe the house has made its choice sequestration it's unrealistic ill-conceived discretionary cuts which must be brought to an end mr. Rogers the chairman he's a Republican he said that I didn't say that he put it better than I could ever even imagined to say it so what happened Democrats attempted to go to conference 20 times the Republicans objected every single time fact check this over here in the house got almost 200 members who've signed the discharge petition calling for a conference on the budget we tried four times to bring the resolution to the floor leader Pelosi even went so far as to name conferees some of them are in this room some of us are come free she did that on june the 27th what's the date that october the eighth june the 27th so why after this stalling has the republicans finally found religion and now they want to negotiate I'll tell you why we've just discovered we have a phantom government in the United States every congressman every house member every Senate member should be concerned that they're elected by the people of this country be they Democrat Republican independent libertarian doesn't matter they've been elected they stood for election we respect that regardless of denomination because we know that neither party is ever privy to to virtue come on we all share in the pluses we share in the minuses never one party that has all the answers we know that but why well just this past Saturday October the fifth we had a front page story in The New York Times it was mind-boggling mind-boggling that article here was the title of the article the federal budget crisis months and planning well I don't remember planning this I don't know if any Republicans were out planning this who in God's name are they talking about and this is what it says in the article in the second paragraph which refers to a manifesto a manifesto put together by non-elected people in this country hear me America hear me that he sat down one morning in a location the members insist on keeping secret Wow and came little-noticed a blueprint quote unquote this is what they said Mr Speaker blueprint to defunding Obamacare signed by our you're going to love this ed Meese boy there's a name that props up again you know I can't believe it ed Meese it's not funny it's serious a phantom government leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups I will put in the record tonight who those groups are and I got part of their manifesto listen to this this is what they put together I'm sure that there are only a few congressmen on the other side that even knew about this says this conservatives should not approve a CR unless it defunds Obamacare this includes Obamacare's unworkable exchanges unsustainable Medicaid expansion and attack on life and religious liberty they said that februari the 14th of 2013 this did not just happen it didn't happen it wasn't an accident it was planned that is the lowest thing you could ever read about a government that doesn't even wasn't even elected who the heck are these people that decide what we're going to do now we know why mr. Ryan did not want to go to conference now we know why mr. Bader did not want to go to conference because that was not the plan read it judge for yourself judge for yourself it also said this that these 30 groups in the names of each of the groups beside mr. mrs. are right here you got every right wing group in the universe they go into this manifesto on Medicaid expansion permanent appropriations implementation they want to run the government these people actually wanted to run the government my friends the Republicans don't want to negotiate they want to use this shutdown in the threat of the fall to invalidate the results of Oh an election last November these people weren't elected we were elected and I love debating people from the other side who are elected that's their god-given right that's what liberties are all about why don't they come in here this shadow government this phantom group why don't they stand there and tell us who they talk to within the Republican Party tell us America has a right to know don't you talk to me mr. speaker about let's have transparency in government when you have this vagabond group out here funded by guess I'll give you three good I only give you one guess the Koch brothers they think they're running this government the Supreme Court heard just another case today's and that interesting so this is mild compared to what would happen if they're able to do and spend as much money as they want I did not come here to water to wine and you better listen to it and I remember the staff better listen because they tried every trick in the book putting your own health care in jeopardy saying that you get a subsidy for the government when it's just like any company who in some way contributes to your health care somebody gets somebody gets hired by the federal government to be a secretary $20,000 $25,000 their their their costs that their health care will go up between five thousand two hundred dollars in twelve thousand dollars how you going to live on at being a staff member here on the floor back in your districts will stop at nothing nothing they'll bring the government down at any cost at any cost the November election apparently did not occur in their minds we're dealing with dangerous people either they're on hallucinating drugs or they just lost their minds this is what we're dealing with to eat to bring us to this precipice only a few days away something's wrong this is not how we debate things in the United States of America this is not in any manner shape or form as President Obama said Democrats are willing to negotiate but not with a gun to our heads never I'm from Paterson New Jersey you never put a gun to my and I got news for you let's end this eerie spot shut down and the fall threat and let's get back to work that's what we were sent here for and I yield back and I thank you mr. Garland

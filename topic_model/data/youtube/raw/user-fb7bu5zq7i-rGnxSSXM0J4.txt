thank you madam speaker uh thank you to Chairman Scott for allowing me the time my rise today in support of H.R 2954 the securing a strong retirement Act I am grateful for the bipartisan collaboration to produce this legislation that makes Common Sense improvements to our nation's Retirement System there are far too many challenges today that prevent workers from having access to secure retirement benefits and information to protect their hard-earned savings I also appreciate the inclusion of the provisions of my legislation the pension risk transfer accountability act which requires the Department of Labor to review existing rules on pension pension risk transfers a promise made should be a promise kept for all workers and retirees I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation to further ensure that workers can retire with dignity security and peace of mind

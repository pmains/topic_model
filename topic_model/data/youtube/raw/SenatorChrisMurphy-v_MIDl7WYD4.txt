thank you very much mr. chairman we have such amazing respect for the work that you have done throughout your career and particularly the job that you have taken on most recently and that's why I think some of the most stunning testimony that we've heard here today came in answer to Senator Menendez this is early questioning when he asked whether you had been consulted prior to this momentous decision being made I don't really know why we have someone with the title Special Representative for Syria engagement and special envoy to the global coalition to defeat Isis if they are not consulted before the president takes the most significant single action affecting US interests in Syria and the future of Isis during his presidency and I think it speaks to the utter chaos of American foreign policy today that you were not consulted or talked to about this decision prior to it being made I had a recently retired general who commanded or oversaw American troops in Syria in my office last night he was distraught in part because he tells me that the word that our soldiers are using as they are moving out of their positioning is betrayal they've been embedded with the Kurds with the SDP and they feel that they have been part of a betrayal of the forces that they have been supporting and fighting alongside one of their specific reven says is that we convinced the Kurds to dismantle some of their defenses along the border with Turkey in anticipation of the United States and turkey being able to work out some joint patrols but in tearing down those defenses it left the Kurds much more susceptible to the inevitable attack that came in retrospect do you think that it was a good idea for the United States to press the Kurds in to dismantling these defenses of all the things that I've experienced in this particular portfolio in particular this sub sector of it with the Turks and the Kurds the thing that I am most disturbed about is the fact that after having agreed to a way forward with us in August turkey to do these joint patrols and the dismantling of fortifications then suddenly inexplicably from my standpoint and many others the Turkish leadership decided that they would just march in and do it all themselves the requirements of the August agreement were for the YPG to dismantle fortifications in the what we called a safe zone but essentially the zone were talking about the truth is they that was the one thing they didn't do a very good job of and perhaps they felt that this was they could see what was coming and this was a major bone of contention between us the Turks in the SDF I said I certainly think that we can draw issue with the Turks decision to abrogate the agreement we made with them but it would have been an additional reason for us not to sell them out by removing our forces given that we had asked them to take this extraordinary measure which they took in anticipation of us remaining the bulwark between them and the Turks a part of your testimony that I'm having a little trouble understanding is your belief that the president has not green-lighted or did not green like the actions by Turkey on Sunday night the president sent out a press release in which he said that he had just gotten off the phone with the president of Turkey and that they would now be moving forward with their long planned operation into northern Syria he took the one action that was a precondition to the Turks mounting an offensive which was the removal of our forces and since then he has defended turkeys actions he said quote they've got to keep going at each other it's artificial to have these soldiers walking up and down between the two countries he said like two kids in a lot you've got to let them fight I mean the world read that statement on Sunday night it's listened to the president defend the decision of Turkey to enter Syria listen to the president talk as if it's a good thing that the two sides are now fighting each other without the United States in the middle of it how is the world not to read all of those actions as a clear green light to Turkey to come in the president is defending the decision that he made a couple of points first the President did say those things he also said many other things including I will crush the economy because Iran has released well they're actually we released a letter to president heroin you can see that the president took very tough language with President Erdogan on this issue advocated some kind of an agreement or arrangement with the SDF leader general but in addition and I think it's a very important point here this idea of betrayal and giving a green light it's as if our troops in Northeast Syria will like our troops along the Korean DMZ to hold off a force from the north they were not that's not where they were there were two outposts each of 12 people along that whole area of 140 kilometers and we had told the Turks I was involved in telling them that that is simply to observe whether the Kurds are shooting across the border at you were you're shooting across the border at them that was not a security perimeter of any sort the forces that we eventually did move were way west of any of this fighting and they were moved again DoD can explain why but looking at it on the map it was clear that pretty soon they would have been cut off as the Turks came down to the main east-west highway and that's my understanding of why the decision was made but I repeat and from having followed obsessively turkish including the intelligence that i can't get into here turkish views on this of all of the things I saw are in there all over the map senator I never once are any Turk in any way in a position of responsibility saying gee what are we going to do about those US military forces they knew they did not have an to defend the courage that well DYP you don't think that our forces were a deterrent absolutely not and I will cite ash Carter Sunday on I think that was with Stephanopoulos when he was asked out specifically and he said we never this is the last administration we never gave a told the Kurds that we would defend him militarily against Turkey and that means we didn't tell Turkey this was followed up in Face the Nation by General Tony Thomas who said essentially the same thing to the I think our soldiers on the ground were led to believe something fundamentally different and and so query as to how our soldiers who are carrying out the mission felt that they were betraying the Kurds if ultimately part of the reason for being there wasn't to protect them against the very nation on their border that was seeking to destroy them

MR. CORNYN: THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. MADAM PRESIDENT, AS I WAS PREPARING TO COME TO THE FLOOR, I WAS GOING TO SAY WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE TONIGHT TO PROCEED TO FILL A MAJOR GAP IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE MOTHER NATURE AND THE WEATHER MAY PREVENT A VOTE TONIGHT, AND IT MAY BE TOMORROW, BUT STILL, I EXPECT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS FOR US TO ADDRESS A MAJOR GAP IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THE ORIGINAL CHIPS ACT BECAME LAW, WE'RE FINALLY APPROACHING THE FINISH LINE IN THE RACE TO FUND IT. YOU MAY RECALL IT WAS IN JUNE OF 2020 THAT SENATOR WARNER, THE SENIOR SENATOR, DEMOCRAT, FROM VIRGINIA, AND I INTRODUCED THE CHIPS FOR AMERICA ACT TO ADDRESS A FRIGHTENING SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOST ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS IN THE WORLD. 90% OF WHICH COME FROM ASIA. 60% COME FROM TAIWAN. DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN RECENTLY WROTE A LETTER TO CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS SAYING THAT FUNDING THE CHIPS ACT IS CRITICAL TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. AND LAST WEEK, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE AND CIA DIRECTOR MIKE POI PAYO ALSO -- POMPEO URGED CONGRESS TO PASS THIS, SAYING THE COST ON THIS BILL PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE COST WE WILL SUFFER IF WE ALLOW THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO ONE DAY OWN AND CONTROL ACCESS TO OUR MOST CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. I AGREE WITH BOTH OF THESE STATEMENTS, ONE BY A DEMOCRAT APPOINTEE, ANOTHER BY A REPUBLICAN APPOINTEE. CHIPS UNDERPIN VIRTUALLY ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE, THAT KEEPS US SAFE AT HOME AND PROTECTS OUR TROOPS AROUND THE WORLD. AND FOR THOSE NOT CONVERSANT WITH THE ROLE THAT SEMICONDUCTORS PLAY, THESE MICROPROCESSORS UNDERPIN LITERALLY EVERYTHING THAT HAS AN OFF AND ON SWITCH, AND OBVIOUSLY OUR DEPENDENCY ON THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY WILL DO NOTHING BUT INCREASE IN THE DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. FROM OUR MAJOR MILITARY ASSETS, LIKE THE F-35 JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, TO EVERYDAY TECHNOLOGIST THAT KEEP OUR TROOPS SAFE, LIKE ADVANCED BODY ARMOR, SEMICONDUCTORS ARE KEY. KEEPING A READY AND DEPENDABLE SUPPLY CHAIN OF THESE DEFENSE ASSETS REQUIRES A LOT OF SEMICONDUCTORS, AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE MAINLY LOOKING TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO MANUFACTURE THEM. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MAKES ZERO PERCENT OF THE MOST ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS IN THE WORLD. WE DEPEND ON OUTSOURCING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MANUFACTURING TO OTHER COUNTRIES, AND PRODUCE NONE OF THEM HERE. ROUGHLY 75% OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING GLOBALLY IS CONCENTRATED IN CHINA AND EAST ASIA. AND 100% OF THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED CHIP MAKING CAPACITY IS LOCATED IN ONLY TWO PLACES, TAIWAN AND SOUTH KOREA. AS I SAID, TAIWAN COMMANDS 92% OF THE WORLD'S ADVANCED CHIP MAKING, AND THE UNITED STATES MAKES ZERO. YOU MIGHT WONDER HOW DID WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS SITUATION. WELL, I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY THE SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES THAT WE SAW FROM COVID-19 THAT CALLED INTO QUESTION THIS ASSUMPTION THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING COULD BE MADE CHEAPER SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, THAT THAT NECESSARILY CHECKED ALL THE BOXES. WELL, IT DOES IF ALL YOU'RE DEPENDING ON IS CHINA TO MAKE TOYS FOR OUR CHILDREN OR OTHER NONESSENTIAL ITEMS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VERY BRAINS BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY WE NEED, RANGING FROM OUR CELL PHONE, AS I SAID, TO OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED MILITARY WEAPONS, IT DOES NOT CHECK ALL THE BOXES TO SAY WE'LL JUST IMPORT THOSE FROM ABROAD, WHERE THEY CAN BE MADE CHEAPER, BECAUSE THAT VULNERABLE SUPPLY CHAIN, IF DISRUPTED, COULD CAUSE NOT ONLY A SEVERE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IN AMERICA, BUT ALSO THREATEN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTLY. IF ACCESS TO THOSE CHIPS WERE CUT OFF OR RESTRICTED, WE WOULD BE UP A CREEK WITHOUT A PADDLE. WE COULDN'T PRODUCE A STOCKPILE OF JAVELIN MISSILES TO SUPPLY UKRAINE OR PRODUCE THE RADIOS-AND-COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES THAT KEEP OUR TROOPS AND OUR ALLIES CONNECTED. THAT'S WHY SHORING UP THIS DOMESTIC SUPPLY, THIS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, IS A KEY NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITY. AND THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT ONE OF OUR MOST CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND ENSURE OUR MILITARY READINESS WILL NOT BE COMPROMISED BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA OR THE CHINESE COMMUNITIIST PARTY. WHICH HAS THREATENED, BY THE WAY, TO INVADE TAIWAN, WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS ARE MADE. BUT IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE MILITARY INTERVENTION. IT COULD BE ANOTHER PANDEMIC, IT COULD BE A NATURAL DISASTER, ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BLOCK OUR ACCESS TO THESE ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS. WHILE CLOSING THAT NATIONAL SECURITY GAP IS THE TOP PRIORITY HERE, WE CAN'T IGNORE MAJOR ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL DELIVER AS WELL. WHILE WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION WITH SENATOR WARNER, FROM VIRGINIA, WHO'S CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, ON WHICH I ALSO SERVE, OUR FOCUS WAS ON NATIONAL SECURITY. OBVIOUSLY, MANY OF OUR STATES WILL BE WINNERS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL. TEXAS HAS BEEN, FOR EXAMPLE, A LONG-STANDING LEADER IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND IS HOME TO MORE THAN 200 CHIP MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THAT EMPLOY 29,000 TEXANS. FOR YEARS, OUR STATE HAS REAPED THE BENEFITS OF SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING. MOST OF THESE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED LEGACY CHIPS. THEY'RE THE OLDER CHIPS, WHERE YOU'RE NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT MINIATURIZATION OR COMPACTNESS OR POWER. THINGS THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, RUN OUR REFRIGERATORS, OUR TV SETS, OR OTHER CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, OR MAYBE EVEN OUR CARS. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS THAT THIS CHIPS BILL WILL FINALLY BRINK. EARLIER THIS SUMMER, TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, IN THE METROPLEX IN DALLAS FORT WORTH BROKE GROUND ON THE FIRST OF FOUR NEW FABS IN SHERMAN, TEXAS, ABOUT AN HOUR NORTH OF DALLAS. THIS IS PART OF A $30 BILLION INVESTMENT EXPECTED TO CREATE SOME 3,000 MORE JOBS. THE MAYOR OF SHERMAN, WHERE THIS IS LOCATED, IN NORTHEAST TEXAS, DESCRIBED IT AS A WATERSHED DAY, NOTING THAT IT'S HARD TO HAVE A FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR A $30 BILLION INVESTMENT IN A TOWN OF 50,000 PEOPLE. AND SHERMAN ISN'T THE ONLY TOWN IN TEXAS PREPARING FOR A MAJOR CHIPS BOOM. LAST FALL I JOINED LEADERS FROM SAMSUNG, A SOUTH KOREAN COMPANY WITH A LARGE FACILITY ALREADY IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED A $17 BILLION ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN A NEW CHIP FAB IN TAYLOR, TEXAS, JUST OUTSIDE OF AUSTIN. THAT FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO CREATE 2,000 HIGH-TECH JOBS AND OTHER JOBS ONCE OPERATIONAL, BECAUSE THESE FABS, OR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE NOT STANDALONE, THEY ARE PART OF WHAT ULTIMATELY WILL BECOME AN ECOSYSTEM OF SUPPLIERS AND OTHER AFFILIATED INDUSTRIES THAT WILL BE BUILT UP AROUND THEM, CREATING THOUSANDS OF MORE JOBS. BUT WE ALSO LEARNED FROM SAMSUNG THAT THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO STOP THERE, IF WE PASS THIS CHIPS FOR AMERICA FUNDING THIS WEEK. SAMSUNG IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING WHETHER TO EXPAND ITS INVESTMENT TO INCLUDE 11 NEW CHIP-MAKING FACILITIES IN CENTRAL TEXAS. IF IT MOVES FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN, WHICH AGAIN DEPENDS ON OUR PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION THIS WEEK, IT COULD LEAD TO NEARLY $200 BILLION IN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND CREATE 10,000 JOBS. I KNOW THAT'S TOUGH TO IMREE HEND, THE ECONOMIC -- TO COMPREHEND, THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SWEEPING BENEFITS WITH A $200 BILLION INVESTMENT AND 10,000 NEW JOBS, BUT AS EXCITING AS THESE ARE, THERE'S SOMETHING EVEN BETTER. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE EYEING TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES FOR NEW INVESTMENTS IN CHIP MAKING. APPLIED MATERIALS, MXP SEMICONDUCTORS, GLOBAL TECH AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING OR EXPANDING THEIR FACILITIES IN TEXAS OR OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. GLOBAL FOUNDRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IS INVESTING $1 BILLION TO BOOST PRODUCTION IN NEW YORK. INTEL PLANS TO BUILD A $20 BILLION FACILITY OF TWO FABS IN OHIO. AND TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY TSMC, AS IT'S CALLED, IS BUILDING A $12 BILLION PLANT IN ARIZONA. THEY'VE ALREADY BROKEN GROUND ON THAT PLANT, BUT THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT AND COMPLETE THAT FAB WILL DEPEND ON OUR PASSAGE OF THE CHIPS FOR AMERICA ACT. AND ONCE THIS LEGISLATION PASSES, I EXPECT MORE GOOD NEWS TO FOLLOW. THIS IS NOT JUST GOOD NEWS FOR INDIVIDUAL STATES BUT ALSO FOR OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY AND OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. MADAM PRESIDENT, WE'RE NOT USED TO PROVIDING THESE KIND OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO BUSINESSES, BUT WHEN IT COSTS 30% LESS TO BUILD THESE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ACROSS THE SEAS IN ASHAH AND -- ASIA AND OUR ACCESS TOSS THAT SUPPLY CHAIN IS POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZES BY VERY REAL THREATS, IT IS A NECESSARY INVESTMENT FOR US TO MAKE, AND WE'RE SEEING OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD PROVIDING SIMILAR INCENTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SOLVE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEM. WE NEED THOSE JOBS AND THAT ANNVESTMENT HERE IN AMERICA FOR US TO BE TRULY SAFE AND SECURE AND TO REAP THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THIS INVESTMENT. ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, THIS FUNDING HAS THE SUPPORT OF MANY GROUPS ON THE OUTSIDE, INCLUDING THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. IN MY STATE, THE TEXAS ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS, THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, FOR EXAMPLE. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION, WHICH IS A BIPARTISAN ORGANIZATION OF U.S. GOVERNORS. AS WELL AS THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS, WHICH REPRESENT STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE -- ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MY GOVERNOR, GOVERNOR ABBOTT, CALLED THIS BILL AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOCK EVEN GREATER ECONOMIC POTENTIAL. SO I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. AFTER ALL THIS TIME, I'LL BE ESPECIALLY GLAD WHEN THE FINISH LINE IS? SIGHT -- IS IN SIGHT AND WE CROSS IT SUCCESSFULLY LATER THIS WEEK.

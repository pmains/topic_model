joining us now for a bipartisan conversation Democratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican senator Todd young of Indiana they've introduced legislation today that gets at a critical issue the War Powers Act who gets to decide when where how long American forces are sent into Harm's Way uh and this show is almost 10 years old I think you've been coming on the show to talk about the War Powers Act for for the for the last decade my entire 10 years in the Senate and it was very lonely at the start and then along the way have picked up more and more support but I'll say Todd young of Indiana has been a fantastic comrade on this the last few years so I want to get to that in one second I do want to ask about Ukraine which is Ukraine now asking for fighter jets there was a time when Biden said no tanks now there are tanks going there do you think that zielinski should get fighter jets from the U.S you know I Todd may have a different opinion to me I never served in the military I'm unarmed Services I got a kid who's a marine but I don't micromanage like which is the right platform at the time what I do exercise oversight is what's the degree of communication that we have with the Ukrainian Defense Forces so that they're making the asks and we're assessing them women in real time making decisions and as long as that communication is strong I feel like we're gonna we'll get to the right answer what do you think because some of your colleagues including Senator Roger wicker is saying that the bite Administration needs to do much more so that the ukrainians can push back uh this Russian offensive you know my default position is to listen to their military commanders working with our military commanders and in the end I think consistently we've made the right decisions about sending the material I wish that would those decisions would be made more quickly when we think about a potential future conflict with Taiwan there won't be uh there won't be much time to afford delays in these sorts of decisions SO waiting a few additional weeks for tanks most recently could jeopardize uh you know the the Taiwanese effort and a future conflict we need to remedy that and and hopefully if we do we can bring this conflict in Ukraine to a close uh all the quicker so let's talk about the War Powers Act the gulf and Iraq war authorizations as people people may or may not realize they're still on the books and they're still being used in many cases you and Senator young introduced legislation to repeal the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force why well first these are congressional powers under article one and too many congresses of both parties have abdicated this responsibility to presidents of both parties usually because they don't have the backbone to like put their name on the line when it comes to war so both Todd and I believe article one matters Congress should be deeply involved in this it's our job second Iraq's not an enemy anymore these these were War authorizations against an Iraq ultimately leading to the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the Baptist party Iraq is now a security partner of the United States in the fight against Isis in the fight against Iranian bellicose activity in the region why have a war authorization against a nation that is your partner and finally I think it sends a good message a great thing about America we have had a capacity to take Nations we've been at war with and then end up as allies Germany um the UK Japan and it's good to send that message that a nation that's been in war with the United States we're open to making the relationship better and other nations have been too I think that's an important message why is it important uh to you I mean I I I think that theoretically uh a lot of Republicans believe in a strong executive branch and don't I don't know that that's you that that describes you but and the legislative branch should defer what's your take we were right a lot of Republicans do and I think Tim did a really good job of outlining the legal arguments the moral arguments and some near-term National Security considerations let me focus on the latter every Republican agrees we should counter Iran and there is no more important country in that effort than Iraq so we need to partner with a newly formed government of Iraq prime minister al-sudani is prepared to work with the Americans but more importantly Middle East Partners throughout the region to ensure that the terrorist state of Iran doesn't form a land bridge through Iraq into Syria down to Lebanon endangering Israel and Beyond and and so the best way we can do that right now is to affirm our support our friendship uh with the people of Iraq but he also points out and and it's true one of the reasons this hasn't happened is because it's a lot easier to just defer to the president of the United States and if things go great you've wave the flag and if things go bad then you can criticize it and not actually have to as a lawmaker take a position we've been doing that for decades now and frankly giving up our legal prerogatives but also failing to live up to our responsibility something Tim spoke to uh as as members of Congress we need to make hard decisions hard decisions about when you enter conflicts how those conflicts are are carried on which we do through oversight responsibilities and ultimately after we authorize military force we need to de-authorize force when the conflict has ended that's what Tim and I are focused on here is it going to happen is it going to say see this I feel very very good about it we we filed today with 22 sponsors in the Senate 11 Democrats 11 Republicans which means we have the votes to get it through the Senate and I predict when we get to a floor vote it'll be more like two-thirds that we'll get to um and then while the Senate is usually slow and the house is fast this may be one where the Senate will act first the house patrons on this are really interesting Barbara Lee chip Roy Tom Cole Abigail spanberger very broad ideological group um and and I'll just go back to something Todd said we got to have backbone Todd had backbone when he enlisted it in the Marine Corps my son had backbone when he went into the Marine Corps if if our troops have the backbone to say they're going to defend this country then Congress can't be Chicken in in making decisions about war peace and diplomacy we got to put our name on the line just to illustrate how absurd this is I entered the United States Navy right after high school that was 1990 a few months later the 1991 First Gulf War authorization Congress has not repealed it since then it's time we please don't don't uh thanks to both he really appreciate it and stay in touch uh and we'll keep covering this also

I have to respond to what my my friend and colleague just said and I understand the Democrats talking points here but this is so so far out of line with what the American people believe about this I during the August uh District work period I I was in a number of states uh and colleagues districts all from the west coast to the East Coast and everywhere that I went as soon as it as soon as the conversation was turned in a public forum to audience questions they asked a couple of things right off the top they're deeply concerned about inflation of course they're deeply concerned about illegal immigration and the Border that's open and all these other issues but you know what is fundamental and at the root of so much is that is the the people's doubt about our institutions themselves and it begins with our system of justice and my friend you said this is an un quote unquote an unpatriotic response our request for information about this this is our most basic and fundamental responsibility this is the this is the committee of the United States Congress that has the responsibility of oversight over this department of justice that my friends is completely out of control in the American people know the facts it doesn't matter what the talking points from the Democrats are are presenting here today the people know what's going on let me give you a quick recitation of some of this this department of justice has filed politically motivated lawsuits against republican-led States they have artificially inflated domestic violent extremist statistics they've used counter-terrorism resources to Target parents at school board meetings and we'll be talking a lot about that later today the department has selectively prosecuted and investigated political opponents of President Biden and his administration these are facts these are objective facts and anybody can see that we have a pattern that's emerged this attorney general mayor Garland seeking to prosecute cases against these political opponents they're leaking this to Friendly media sources they're not doing this in a courtroom they're not following regular order they're not respecting due process they're not even respecting the Constitution itself they have weaponized that is the word they have weaponized the Department of Justice and the greatest threat to this is what all those people have told us in all these public forums all around the country they the American people are doubting now that the system of justice is fair you cannot weaponize America's system of justice you know most of us on this committee are attorneys we all went to law school the most fundamental tenet of this is you know the the phrase the motto that's etched into the marble above the entrance of the United States Supreme Court Equal justice under law wow that is a critically important principle in a constitutional republic there's a reason I say all the time and he's probably performed there's a reason that lady Justice is depicted as the symbol of our system with a blindfold because there's not supposed to be two standards of Justice not one for the rich and powerful and one for everybody else that's what we're seeing you're not supposed to have Lady Justice yielding the sword against political opponents of the Party In Charge that's what we have right now and that's why we're alarmed the most patriotic response that we can we can have right now is to seek this information now our side is in a minority we don't have the gavels right now and for those who are watching back home who are so frustrated about this why can't you guys take control of this why can't you bring accountability hey accountability is coming it's it's coming in the next Congress we we will get the Gallows back in January early January of next year you'll have a new Congress I pray I believe that you'll have Republicans in charge of this committee and we will perform our responsibilities and gathering this information right now is a critical step a critical step in having the information we need to exercise that that responsibility the the department the FBI the White House they have failed to respond to our respectful and formal and lawful requests for the information we're entitled to it more than that we must have it so that Congress can continue to work so that we can provide this essential oversight so our department of justice can continue to work for the people that's why we're here that's what you're going to hear repeated over and over a yield to the to the ranking member I thank the gentleman in 2016 the FBI spied on the Republican presidential campaign based on a document they knew was false at the time in 2020 they hid evidence damaging that would be damaging to the Democrat presidential campaign but oh the lady from Texas says they're not political um that those are the two examples you have to look at they spied on the campaign based on false evidence we know it's false because we had the Mueller two 19 lawyers 40 agents 40 million dollars all that said no nothing there but they hid evidence because a whistleblower came forward and said Timothy t-ball who's amazingly now retired from the FBI was pressuring people to suppress evidence suppress evidence that was damaging to the Democrat campaign but they're not political not no not political I yield back there'll be more foreign

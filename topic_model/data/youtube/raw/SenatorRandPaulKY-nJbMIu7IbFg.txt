close the bars and keep the schools open is what we really say obviously you don't have one size fits all if you look at the data the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all not like one would have suspected okay so it's been a bit of a yo-yo for the families as authorities shut down the schools in new york before thanksgiving based on the increased number of cases they went up to three percent but they disregarded that data and on in-school transmission which is very low so my next guest has repeatedly pressed the doctor on the science of this shutdown for months dr falchi every day virtually every day we seem to hear from you things we can't do but when you're asked can we go back to school i don't hear much certitude at all i hear well maybe it depends all of this body of evidence about schools around the world shows there's no surge i feel very strongly we need to do whatever we can to get the children back to school okay so joining me now senator rand paul of kentucky senator good to have you back tonight so now it's um close the bars open the schools uh you know i i don't know how parents and families across the country are supposed to navigate all of this it's like okay now you got to find someone to help you at home or you have to stay home and leave your job and then the next week oh we're going to reopen them even though the infection rate has actually gone up during that time period in new york can you explain what's going on here well here's the interesting thing you know when i tried to get dr falchi to look at the data six months ago on children the data from europe where they were keeping schools open and they did not have surges he was unwilling to look at it and he was so overly cautious that he wanted to keep schools closed now he says oh well we can open some schools but not other schools but really what we have to do is close bars well really what we should do with dr fauci is sitting down and showing the evidence on lockdowns when you look at lockdowns and you look at the mandates whether they're masks or whether they're how many people go to a restaurant or how many people can gather and you look at when the mandates were instituted around the world country after country guess what the virus rises exponentially after the mandates right now we have more mandates in place than we've ever had we have more mask wearing than we've ever had and yet the incidence of the disease is exploding really maybe showing us that what we're doing is not working we ought to be open-minded you know and that brings me to this this is a flashback sound bite on the issue of masks from dr fauci and this is march 8th watch us right now people should not be white there's no reason to be walking around with a mask when you're in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is and often there are unintended consequences people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face that totally changed you know the new england journal of medicine in the summer said that masks were a talisman and they could help with generalized anxiety but didn't work outside the hospital setting what i would say to people because i don't want people to think that they don't work at all right but i would say to high risk people yes they work the n95 mass work the surgical mass are about 50 percent effective in blocking virus-sized particles and the cloth masks block about three percent of virus particles so we ought to let this be out there but if you say things like this immediately big tech censors you and says oh you can't say that and i think shouldn't we have a debate and a discussion shouldn't we look at the evidence the evidence is in now on lockdowns it's been in for schools for six months we finally have dr fauci looking at the evidence closing schools is not necessary now we need to look at the lockdown evidence and we need to target our approach to those who are vulnerable and try extra hard for those who are vulnerable but we shouldn't punish all the people across the country particularly those who are not vulnerable to this virus and these businesses you know open closed i mean you've got like a third of the businesses across the country that are probably never going to get those stores and shops and bars and restaurants reopened and this is the guidance and now the supreme court decision on religious gatherings has thrown a wrench into what the guidance is from these state leaders the governor in new jersey today said that new rules so for outdoor gatherings you've got to go to a maximum of 25 people and they're canceling all the winter indoor sports basketball and that kind of thing maybe that makes sense but then he says that there's the exception to the 25 people rule with religious political activities both of those are included funerals memorial services and wedding ceremonies there's no 25 person limit on those i wonder if there'll be an exception you think there'll be an exception for the inauguration so the thing is is we need to look at the evidence dr fauci it took him six months to agree with us that school should open my governor just this week is closing down the schools so we took it to the sixth circuit and we lost we won at the district level lost to the sixth circuit now we're going to the supreme court with it but he's mandating that uh private religious schools can't open even though dr fauci and the so-called experts have finally come to agree that the schools should open our governor democrat governor kentucky is closing them all down by fiat with no consultation of the legislature or anyone else so really we should look at the evidence but the most important thing about this is science is about disputation the same way politics is you present your evidence on both sides and we should hear out both sides what we're living in is a world where we censor people like myself who have contrary ideas but who look at the evidence every day right now new york is having virtually zero deaths and you have to say is that because they're washing their hands better or might it have something to do with the degree of immunity that their vulnerable population got a lot of them died but those who didn't die in the nursing homes a lot of them have antibodies now could it be that the immunity among the vulnerable in new york is at such a state that their deaths have gone way down because their vulnerable people actually have a degree of immunity but nobody wants to talk about that you put that on twitter and they flag you like you're somehow denying science and all we want to do is debate the science yeah i know dr fauci has uh debated you on that issue of immunity as well and it's probably something that we're not going to get a good handle on i don't think for some time uh when we get a real treat how many people actually have the antibodies and how long they they work but intriguingly one of the things i told dr fauci the last time he came to our committee was one of the reason children are asymptomatic is that i think they've been infected with coronavirus colds and he disputed that he went out of his way to say it wasn't true but now the nih does say it's true 43 of kids have antibodies and t cells to coronavirus that are effective against covet because they've had previous infection with colds it also may explain why adults like myself didn't get many symptoms then maybe i'd had previous coronavirus colds that allowed me to have some levels thank you and dr rand paul good to have you here tonight thank you

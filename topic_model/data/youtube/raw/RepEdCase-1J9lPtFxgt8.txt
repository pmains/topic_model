out and about with some of my fellow elected officials and we're here with the great county council council member from the district four uh tommy waters and also the chair of our uh city council aloha tommy good to be with you hello congressman thank you so much i'm really looking forward to this yeah so we're gonna we're gonna drive out to the edge of both of our districts which is makapuu point and then we're gonna work back in and we'll talk along the way about uh about the district about uh chair waters and and uh we're gonna stop along the way and check out some projects uh where either the feds are helping out or may help out that was the worst job i ever did i'm congressman case i represent this district uh here uh just where are you guys from so makapuu all of hawaii kai you and i share portland kahaoni valley coolio and then moving westward we have hawaii ridge waialae iki aina haina new valley guadalupe um while i newey ridge i mean you and i both walked door-to-door in this district and it's a difficult thing yeah even hawaii lower ridge i think i got in there you gotta know rich you know funny story never never let a gated community stop a politician nobody's gonna go door-to-door exactly you can put that on tape because you know what we have a right to come to your house so i go up there and i'm like hey this is uh walaiki five there's a gate i'm here to see ben cayetano okay go right in i i felt nervous though i turned around and came out it's too funny that i got in i don't think i used the ben kai town of excuses [Music] is that the one that you go on the trail yeah that's the one you go on the train going hiking but yeah not the kind of hiking that you thought no exactly you know i didn't think about it till later that exactly the sierra club fought for the right yeah and that still exists yeah i saw that they tried to close it off the other day and i went no you can't do that you can't do that you gotta you gotta allow access yeah um but yeah those all those mountains including uh mauna lani heights william in a rise as people normally call it that's where i live uh i love kaimuki i have half of kaimuki um the dividing line is sierra drive coming down to waialae avenue twilight avenue uh down to eighth avenue eighth avenue cuts across all the way to um kind of that cross street where rainbow's drive-in is yeah so rainbow's driving down to kapahulu ave cut down all the way to the ala and then head head west so i have half of kapahulu half of kaimuki all of diamond head all of kahala all of waikiki all the way out to ala moana beach park and everything makai of kapiolani to peak so it's a pretty huge dish i got i got balls you got a ball a surf spot but you don't have panic i don't have point panic no no no okay but i need to get away from the holly i'll go buy a plate lunch sometimes i'll drive all the way to kalihi to uh google delicatessen grab a plate lunch sit at point panic and watch the waves and just dream about bodies yeah yeah um well back in my salad days point panic was my go-to um and i haven't actually been out there uh for a number of years i guess i should do it just to see if i can still think oh i'll go with you let's do it well you know you know who the uh you know the great body surfer of the hawaiian politicians is that senator schatz really yeah he's all right he rips it up so there you go brian we gave you a plug right there yeah he sneaks away to panic every once in a while nice well your office is in the federal building right my office is not in the federal building um i don't have to be in the federal building and in all honesty i i don't i don't um i don't know i don't want to have my office in the federal building with apologies to the building but it you know to me it's uh first of all it's a little out of the way just in terms of people being able to come to my office it's easier for them to come to my office which is in downtown honda one of the office buildings and then second it's it's just uh it just feels a little too imposing and to federal government it's very sterile uh yeah so so i so i i'm not in there but the rest of the delegation is in there the last time i was in so um your district has about a hundred thousand people right yep just over a hundred thousand people because i have 750 000 people spread over um about seven and a half um council districts yeah two to somewhere around a million people on this island so so we have a hundred thousand uh joint constituents uh we're on kalanianaole highway right now uh we're heading east it's what is it about uh 8 15 in the morning and we have traffic yeah so this is um and of course i've signed waved here a million times so i've watched the traffic go by when i guess we're contra flowed right now which is why this traffic is a little heavy yeah so one of the things i wanted to show you it's called vava malu beach vava malu beach it's in between sandy's and makapuu and it's this beautiful white sandy beach that over the years is the beach the sun is turned brown black because all the kids with their off-roading vehicles go driving over it so nobody used it because it's too dangerous and of course there's monk seals out there as well turtles will come up there but nobody goes there because it was dangerous like i said so working with the sierra club reese liggett we're going to meet in a few minutes he had this idea he said hey tommy why don't we get these boulders from the dlnr land on the other side of the surf spot called irma's and he said you know henry kaiser when he built hawaii kai there's all these boulders they just threw them all over there right below the trail he said hey let's create a barrier so the off-roading vehicles cannot drive onto the beach i thought okay that's a great idea it took me two years to convince the department of parks and recreation to do it we talked to i think it was sam limo yeah from dlnr and and they said yeah you can have the big boulders so it was free no cost to taxpayers we got these boulders put out there and now you have this beautiful white sand beach for folks to enjoy and i'm really proud of it and i wanted to show it to you and meet rhys the the architect of this idea great maurice liggett resident of kaimuki but this is my closest wild coast and so i've been very interested in it for many years and tommy waters came to my door council member waters constituents six years ago and and he said will you support me for city council and i said tommy i said will you help me get the cars off of vava malu beach oh really yes the house and he's at his door historically this whole piece of land is called vava malik you mean all the way all the way from in fact if you go to google earth google earth you you you type you type in baba malo and they call this entire piece of land baba mali i see now obviously the city put a beach in you know and called it sandy beach popular name and uh in a park uh so now they call this the vava malu beach section of sandy park uh this was all city park but the city just wasn't looking after it until tommy got on it and uh and the neighborhood board got on it so i i came to tommy with a really simple map early on and tommy took it around and um so here's kaivy channel i said you just put a corral in here so that the only way out of it is to the highway thanks reese yeah it wasn't salmon it was quick control yeah well sam but sam has the coastline so it would have you know could well eventually so just looking at your bio so you were born september 27th correct i board september 27th i didn't know that yeah oh wow birthday okay you were elected to the manoa neighborhood board in what like 1985 right i wasn't like you you were born in nineteen yeah but uh i my first elected position was on the asuh associated students of the university of hawaii the student government mark takai oh was the president sylvia luke was the president i served a couple terms under both of them but i caught the bug you remember marion kelly i do john kelly marion kelly surfrider yeah i took a class from her and she made us go down to the state capitol and follow a bill any bill and we had to write our term paper on that and i caught the bug and later 1984 or 85 actually i ran for the kailua neighborhood board and got elected representing the maunawili area wait this is this is 84 did you say to kailua yeah yeah well well maybe 94. maybe it was closer to 1987-ish right yeah well i was just asking because that was when i was serving on the boards right i served on the manoa neighborhood board eighty 85-89 right and then you ran for the state house when well i ran in 86 [Music] i ran for the state house in 86 in manoa against ryan tata gucci the incumbent representative if there was ever a stronger candidate i can't imagine it brian ryan was brian was born and raised in manoa he had attended manoa elementary stevenson intermediate and roosevelt high school university of hawaii uh law school he was his his mother was you know his father was their parents were these incredible community leaders who i got to know pretty well later on and ryan as well and i i thought i was invincible so i went out there and ran against brian and and i walked to all of those uh do i you know manoa has has the same thing you're talking about it's got it's got you know um streets that you go up and down single driveways and you stand at the top of the street on the driveway where there's a mailbox and every temptation in you is to just drop your brochure right at that mailbox yeah and then i always thought to myself i don't think brian's gonna walk down this driveway that's exactly so so i walk down the driveway so i can say in all honesty that i went to every single door in manoa valley that campaign that first campaign 86 including all of the ones that probably weren't particularly legal so that's what we call it the slipper door like wherever there was a slippers yeah that's the door you you leave your brochure that's exactly right yeah so question so brian ends up running for the senate and that's when you you won the house right no no it wasn't quite that simple this this actually gets a little bit more interesting so brian beat me in that race by 36 votes 36 votes 36 votes i know you've got a few questions yourself i think even closer than 36 if i recall correct 21 21 yeah so we changed to a reservation system oh actually because it was just getting really crazy but we just also changed it so that that local people don't have to make a reservations they can just show up i want to try to get it so local people one day a month open it up just for local people right here over there oh nice hi good to see you again aloha how are you this is anka robert hi anka and just so you know i'm taped i'm mic'd up and um i'm going to do it on a level show i call it cruising with congressman case and i i go out with one of my colleagues and we drive in the car and talk and visit things and compare notes about what we can help each other with karaoke right it is cloudy today so you see it's overcast so you don't quite see the clarity of the water although it's starting to clear up a little bit but when you don't have the clouds overhead the clarity of the water you actually see blue water you don't see a chemical sunscreen haze it is probably the most beautiful phenomenal day has been in generations and that's due to its closure due to the covet last year and hopefully by restricting the number of people that are coming in postcoded and using a reservation system will be able to help maintain this quality in the marine environment postcode the reservation system was there to kind of stagger people right up due to social distancing requirements and also to kind of help keep the volume down i'm sorry right and well to improve the visitor experience so instead of having 2 000 people in line you have that two thousand people hopefully not that many but staggered so that when they come in they have a much better experience on the beach and that's what a lot of the visitors are saying you know when they will have to watch a video so if you're waiting in line to watch the video no sense they just come in right and that video is very important because it talks about reef etiquette and about what makes the nature preserve and the marine life conservation district special and different than any other mutual marine environment in hawaii and the need for conservation so i got to tell you i got to tell you a story that uh hopefully you i think you'll appreciate so of course the friends were instrumental in the first of the nation state law as to the use of sunscreen and trying to try to eliminate the use of the more damaging sunscreens that that have done empirically have done a lot of damage here at hanauma bay because it's probably the highest concentration of sunscreens in the water in the entire state of hawaii if not if not the world i mean you got all these tourists coming in with their sunscreen in a very small bay beautiful marine life which is preserved but significant impacts on them last week we introduced a federal version of that in congress oh terrific bipartisan bicameral no kidding senator senate and house republican and democrat and it's to ban the use in it's to restrict the use of of of sun sunscreens uh along the lines i don't think it quite goes as far as the chemical sunscreens but it's definitely patterned after the hawaii law so that started with you yeah uh so that's a that's a good story and i remember talking to you about this uh two and a half years ago when i first got reelected and i came down and talked with the friends and you told me about this so we did go out and work on it i just want you to know awesome that's exciting yeah so we're going to try to get that we also have other bills that are not sunscreen specific but they are designed to to significantly improve our coral laws yes coral research coral uh preservation and i've found friends in congress in the strangest places like for example senator rubio from florida is one of the co-sponsors of these bills now he and i don't see eye to eye politically on a lot of stuff but he cares about his florida corals so hey i'm going to work with him if i can observation is my favorite and i was i actually came from i stopped in utah on my way home from dc for a few days on a very very interesting program which is a a congressional exchange program where essentially you pair with a member of the other party and you go spend time in their districts with their people trying to understand their perspective and then they come and do the same thing in yours and the idea is to nurture across partisan you know and find areas of common interest so i went i went with representative chris stewart who represents kind of the southwestern corner of utah now chris and i he's very conservative and and i'm not we probably vote we probably vote on the other side of most major issues 90 of the time but i spent time with him one of the things we did was to go he has zion and bryce national parks right in his district and we went into zion which is just a spectacular national park it's the fourth most visited national park in the country it's 4.4 million visitors a year and they are at capacity almost at capacity and they are agonizing over whether to institute a reservation system even a lottery system for entrance into the park especially in the most um you know busy times and i'm sitting there going what are you agonizing over do it already you know it's really the only real way to to have a sustainable uh enjoyment of our parks and of course that started you know in some of our hawaii and and i think that's where we're gonna have to go with all of our pride then and then cara waters of course is also talking about about there has to be a time when us locals can actually enjoy this because i think we're at the tipping point in terms of our our acceptance of tourism and if somehow we don't get to enjoy hawaii ourselves uh then we're gonna take it out of the tourists because you get impacted the tour helicopters don't stay up to sea when they come over here they cut right over right east on lulu they go over kalama valley they go over hawaii kai they if they can they go over you know kamiki and yeah i think you and your office put together a meeting with the faa yeah how we learn that they can leave the airport they have to stay out outside of off of land up until diamond head once they hit diamond they can turn inland so it's super bad yeah and uh anything east of diamond head this free-range freak game for them open the open seas open season and it's just terrible terrible athlete well i i would like to add to both of you your offices have been so accessible and yours not only here on oahu but in dc and tommy waters your office and your personnel coming to our neighborhood board meetings and you know gavin's a text message away we really appreciate all that we can voice our concerns to um decision makers who actually listen to us and are willing to try doing something about it we're so excited about a congress yeah i know we'll send you the information we just introduced it last week tell us a little bit what uh how's the visitation now versus say three four months ago um actually um it's increased uh we we're what we're trying to do is because of the pandemic we're trying to regulate the amount of people and maintain physical distancing so what we've done is we've um created time slots staggered time slots and within the time slots we restrict 40 people at a time to be in the the theater and um once they enter the theater and then they go down to the beach right now we have a pilot program for kamaenas it'll it's supposed to end on august 8th and what it is is they don't need a reservation or a showtime ticket and so they meet us at the front and then we we send them in after we process the reservations or showtime tickets and then they we walk we brief them and then walk them down yeah and how's that one going that's been very popular and positive yeah yeah i think we were just talking about it it's important for us local folks to be able to enjoy this too yeah it's not just for the tourists it is um it's just we would prefer to have them watch the educational video because right now it's just a break yeah yeah so i see yeah but yeah it's a good thing well as we've seen with covet 19 we're not immune from making mistakes here ourselves so we can't blame that on the visitors actually it's us that's doing the damage right now aloha how are you all doing good thing i'm congressman case i represent this district uh here uh just where are you guys from india southend indiana south indiana oh wow uh so you've been waiting to come here for quite a while yeah how do you how do you like this uh reservation system um it was a little stressful today is our last day here ah and so we were able to get in we leave at you know five o'clock this afternoon so yeah yeah but we're excited how did you know about hanama to start with was it in a book or um a recommendation from someone on here so you you had your last day here but you were able to get online and sign up and get at times what do you think of the idea of a reservation system that are i mean from reading about it it seems like it makes sense with you know how bad the uh day was for time so really really bad very overcrowded hard to regulate local residents were getting so crowded out that we are all getting upset at tourism which is not a good thing yeah okay good well thank you so much you guys have a great trip back okay chris kramer is with the mauna lua fishpond heritage center remember the old reward estate yeah i think i've read about this fish pond that's the one that just kind of is in the middle of it just kind of comes up anywhere right yeah it was a beautiful beautiful old house anyway uh the city using the clean water and natural lands fun purchase is that a city fund yes so we take a portion of the cip cap improvement projects fund and put it into this fund so that we can buy land right and preserve it so we did the same thing in the very back of aina haina um jeff stone was gonna develop these homes and the trailhead in the back of anaheim so we bought that so we use the same fund to purchase this property and turn it over to a non-profit which is the heritage center the folks and they're malama and i'm bringing it back to life it's a natural spring i've i've heard about it yeah that's awesome i didn't realize when did you actually buy it 2014 i think i didn't realize i thought there was still some dispute over ownership that that had prevented you from mahala you guys thank you for the hard work what are you guys doing welcome yeah the parks how's business today okay thank you every opportunity i get just to thank the city workers for all their hard work it's just you know because they work hard yeah follow you guys thank you for your hard work like you i i haven't been down there since the 70s really yeah i don't know you know i mean we all get dizzy but hanauma is one of those places that you you almost feel like you know you've got abandoned to the tourists and you're not welcome there anymore and we can't feel that way anymore we're especially as we've seen the the um the tourism numbers coming back after kovit i mean covet 19 of course you know terrible pandemic devastation especially to the tourism industry and hundreds of thousands of folks in just difficult situations but one thing that happened was people got to experience hawaii without tourists and i think we all thought to ourselves well this is this is pretty nice of course the dilemma is you you need tourism for a lot of us to be here to start with so that's uh that's always been the double-edged sword but you know i just can't uh i can't see going you know way over 10 million visitors a year where we're i think we're almost we are on track now we're back on track for 10 million we're back to 30 000 plus arrivals a day i came through the airport yesterday and it was a it was a zoo it was a total zoo by the way there's something to mention to you along those lines with which i uh witnessed firsthand and you know that the city operates that um uh covet 19 test in the airport in the airport yeah the city operates and pays for it yeah using using karazhak money using federal funding which has been really really good and it's it's been up it's been especially as we've seen the uptick in in infections it's important for us all to get tested whenever we think we should get tested and the city has made that available for free for now and i've done it myself there a couple of times i have to when the first lady came to visit they required us to get a yeah a negative test within 24 hours and you know what i went there super convenient and i got my test results within about five hours well i i got in yesterday after look at that so beautiful i wish the video could see the view we see but you can all you all can imagine in your mind's eye the the coming over the top by hanama bay and looking down through banalo bay down the entirety of of uh council member waters district all the way to diamond head black point kahala all of the ridges we talked about earlier it's just really one of those you know i have to say that that our entire island is beautiful but we represent one of the most beautiful portions of the island wouldn't you agree this is uh yeah i mean it's it's um you know honolulu is a city people don't realize that it's a real city it's got um you know it's got one it's got a very high the part of utah i was i was in the last couple of days their density is uh 18 people per square mile 18 people in honolulu were almost 4 000 a square mile yeah and yet with all of that city and that density it is really beautiful you got the mountains and the ocean and that's why fighting for open space is key right i mean i'm fighting for affordable housing housing for homeless folks but at the same time we gotta appreciate and preserve open space it's gonna become even more important so anyway back to the covet test quickly the the um so i get off the plane yesterday i've been in utah for two days um i'm vaccinated so um but you know as we know people that are vaccinated can get infected so i went right right as soon as i got off the plane to the city's covet test at the airport yeah long long line really totally long line like out to the baggage uh out to the passenger pickup that's good to know i had heard that we had cut staffing of that we need to bump that back up well there's a lot of people that are trying to get tested and from what i could see it wasn't it wasn't tourists that were trying of course the tourists were supposed to get tested before they get on the plane right but um there were and i was talking story with people in line like why are you getting tested uh well some of them because they they're going you know inner island or up to the mainland but but most of them they just maybe they thought they were in some kind of a coveted situation just wanted to be sure and we want them to get that test so i'm sitting there and there's this parking lot right outside um and that's where the buses get loaded and you know it's dedicated to airport purposes and everybody's in line everybody was parking in that parking lot um and people were being really polite you know you wait for your parking space you park you come in you get your test it probably takes about half an hour because of the line 45 minutes and the only alternatives are to go to the parking structure which is a long way away or outside the airport all of a sudden uh you know a law enforcement officer came in and you know said hey clear out this is not for you know for you to park during covet testing this is only for airport use i'm going to start ticketing people and he did he started ticketing people and so people were kind of flipping out in the line and i just thought you know what that's not the way to do this you know and i actually called it to my office and said hey call the state department of transportation airports and say we want people to be able to park easily to get tested so don't don't enforce that right now anyway i mentioned it to you because your your program there is is a critical program and it's it's um there's a little bit of you know i guess the airports are trying to preserve it for the for the vendors that use it it wasn't being used i said said to my wife i said hey you know what the tourists can get picked up somewhere else right now we need this parking lot to get us ourselves tested yes thank you so much i know exactly where you're talking about hi how are you giving a long time nice to meet you i'm here that is uh butch korea oh i see hi oh good how's he doing he's good yeah tell us what's happening here i talked we talked on the phone so i i have a little bit of a background but well we can come in take a look okay this is uh kanye west spring and this is uh the hopes and dreams of our community it's our our fresh water source this ancient uh punaway that uh feeds the ancient fish pond here and you know this is really special for our community that we're we're able to for the first time have access and and raise the funding to bring our community back and have that connection again it's been uh lost to our community for generations so where was the actual fish pond was it inside the uh is the drive where the wall was or um actually we'll go and see in a few minutes but there's a makaha that and it flows out to the right to the fish farm so is this is this the spring itself here then yeah this is the source of fresh water right source of life right if you look if you look in it you can see there's a lava tube you kind of see a circular cleaning this out because when we got it 10 years ago first we started 2010 yeah started it was all overgrown there was stagnant water flow and we cleaned it helped to bring the water flow back in conjunction with some the city's re-piping of the sewage pipes because there was fresh water going into the sewage pipes right so the city fixed that and then has helped to increase the water flow and increase the water quality in the fish pond and the lagoon and throughout the bay so what kind of fish chris what kind of fish do we have in here uh all your your mullet um those are the ones with the fork tail prawns i don't want to do anything inappropriate here culturally a inappropriate bit breakfast yeah nice sweet right it is sweet yeah i kind of feel like i taste a little bit of salt but yeah just a touch yeah the heat that's what gives it the sweet taste all right well that's beautiful congratulations on that yeah so that that was all overgrown oh this whole entire almost an acre was you know you couldn't even walk through here yeah so this is where on the other side is the wildlife sanctuary paico on the there's another makaha fish right over there yeah so that's we got a grant with the fish and wildlife to connect the 36 acre wildlife sanctuary and connect it to the source and you know because the fish don't they don't read you know tmk boundaries i mean we need to connect these habitats so that's a big see it see right there that's the kaku feeding all right oh really the mangrove yeah you got a kaku inside here right right below the mangroves i didn't know they came in oh there it is right there yeah yeah hey bud he just ate a fish look at him look at that these are some other resources wow loaded with i mean big giant crab so you can see a lot of resources in here wow what kind of crab is that this is a 7-eleven usually you see that in the ocean right you can see the shell is really is that usually this that's not what i have is in here yeah that's what it is about the ass that's not a samoan crab yeah no 711 this is really good fatigue we have these we can harvest and these are so rare species these are you found that all in here these are all artifacts from this area we've got ads this was returned this was in a punahou classroom this is tottori and her students and the archives at one hall returned it so how did they know that they know it came from here it came from here so we have they gave us the story what is it this is for probably herbs you could feel where though yeah these are all from the area ian lynn brought this back you can feel that is that our mica well the mica yeah yeah look at that this was in the fishpond walls for slingstone really look at that yeah that's not natural is it i mean they must have they chipped away at it yeah but it's an oval not not round i wonder why easier wow we've been out for a couple of hours uh uh three stops and we're not even one third of the way in into your district yeah that's right we're only uh we're only at the hawaii lower ridge that's right hoiler ridge just to the right you know the problem over here with guys hitting golf balls into the water those homeless folks hitting golf balls into the water as the surfers were paddling out you mean from the from the park yeah they just stood on the shore and yeah it hit golf balls killed me down and called me up you know the famous surfer family tommy you gotta help us so part of what we did is end up cutting back the mangrove there are people living in there um and then trying to provide services for folks so that they don't have to live on the beach although i have to say that it's a beautiful area there they probably preferred living on the beach just like diamond head i got there were about 350 people living in the bushes on the slopes of diamond head and uh that's a challenge though that we're facing all all government and all levels i think trying to council member elefante had the same problem on the shores of um pearl harbor that the mangrove oh yes yes yes that walking trail exactly so next we're going through the guay lupe stream we did a lot of work on why lupus dream as a result of that huge flood and mamo rhaego who's been here for decades if not half a century is gonna meet us and talk to us about what's going on on guadalupe yeah this is a this is a project that we've been working with the community on for for uh quite a while and um it's been a little frustrating to to try to to get the federal government focused on this particular issue so army corps of engineers right and working with your office actually was very very helpful in getting the army corps to the table right because we in order to go into these streams we need a permit by the army corps and the city in many respects that dropped the ball and did not apply for a permit they're good for five years so this stream went unmaintained for five years and you know i worked with your office we've got the army corps here and jackie conant and uh boom we got the we got the permit and we're able to get access to the stream which is great so thank you very very much for that so is it being uh maintained then that that's a city maintaining the stream correct correct but uh we were able to to get some emergency funding i think fema might have actually come in right and helped out as well yeah there was some fema money from the time of the flood the recovery from the flood see that house way up on the hill there yeah i've been there i remember being up in that house i bet the view is they got a really spectacular view back to portlock they can actually look out that way my grandmother and grandfather used to live on paniolo drive right up here and i was walking door to door and my the neighbor says hey mr waters does that house look familiar and i'm looking i'm like oh my god that's where my grandparents live they ended up dying in that house luke excuse me william and ida waters so a lot of people think that you get into anaheim and it's flat all the way to the back and then you come in here and you look up at these uh hills i remember hiking a few of these hills for sure they'll work you out you may recall this was there's a landslide over here on ahu vale in hindi yuka and the city had to condemn a bunch of these homes and you can see some of them still they they're theater tottering we had that in manoa when i was living right now we had the woolsey drive i lived on walls by the way the first time i met you this was later on uh you're running i'm not sure which one of the races you came to my door oh really yeah and we had a really good conversation this was uh jeez i can't remember i think this is the time you actually in 94 right but then i moved to town i was living in manoa why were you living there were you school was that uh yeah closer i did you know the commute was was easier so there's 11 76 here's 1184 here we are but yeah you came he came to my house and you won that year hopefully what your what what street was that i lived on parker place oh parker place yeah beautiful beautiful street yeah the very end there's the school yeah mid-pack yeah i live right there oh parker place i know that yeah yeah i remember that yeah parker place that's a very nice little street oh it's beautiful you know to this day i i pretty much remember almost every street i don't know even though it's been 20 years since i lived in manoa or represented it almost 20 years so well you probably walked it door-to-door numerous times well seven times seven that's awesome that's awesome you know that's what it takes to to to get to know your community that's the to me the best part is walking door-to-door because you get to see what people are thinking what people need what's important to them and that's what we're doing here right now we're going to meet memo regal and she's going to tell us what's going on with wailupi's dream so okay okay roller basin there it would be deep enough that i would wouldn't be able to touch the top but of course it's all filled now right and this is actually how it's supposed to look and another thing on january 26th or 25th when we had that six inches of rain i came over here and this and it had already breached the water had you couldn't even see the wall it had already gone over it had come over here because the boulders that are there are supposed to be on this side over here interesting yeah and she's a community advocate like i said lived in this valley for decades 74 she said she moved in just gonna go a long way show you up here yeah get to the very back of the valley yeah there's another street ahu valley one up that goes even further back but that's for another day and are there are there pro old style properties that are way way back there that that people you know live in the old houses from you know pre-development times or no no it's just all state watershed then all state watershed land and there's a lot of mana back here and that's where the community got so upset when jeff stone wanted to build houses back yeah because they have these rocks that have face formations all over the place everywhere and it's super cool can we just stop and say hi to these folks yeah sure do you know we don't get out of the car no aloha i brought your council member by to say hi i'm just i'm a congressman case your congressman so you got your congressman and your council member how's everything going nice to meet you do you live here or yeah oh right over here how long you lived here a year oh we just moved here oh i see we're checking out the stream to see what we can do to you know make sure it doesn't flood again so we're just um i'm just back from dc and you know checking out the my district to see what i can do oh nice awesome thank you well have a good day guys okay aloha bye-bye because there's a ditch a water ditch that for flood mitigation and they're not cleaning it well and you don't clean it you and and by the way those are that's all city lan i think it's city not state yeah it's not developer land yeah it's also there's there's some liability issues no exactly so i'm trying to get our guys to get in there and clean it the responsibility is this still the city yep this at this does the boulder basin the other part is the state and from the kailani on the only highway bridge to the ocean are private it's the people that live there that's their problem so their problem is to maintain the base the channel yes why do they own it yes evidently they do yeah so why did they maintain upstream and not downstream because they said they ran out of money so this is just where they ran out of the money yeah they actually did they came in here but they used weed whackers instead of coming in with the machines like they used to do yeah like look at that how the hell i got there i mean thank you so much so i got i got i got my project and i'll work with him too okay thank you and if you need any more papers we have tons of papers yeah so this is the kujio beach maintenance project we started in march finished in may uh the sand was pumped from offshore right about in that area and pumped into this basin that's the diamond head um uh cuhu beach basin yeah and so we had a huge pile of sand there about 20 000 cubic yards so we piled up all the sand first and once it was all piled up we actually had to clean out this entire area and truck the sand all along the beach the idea is about every seven years or so we have to pump the sand in from offshore because it it tends to migrate the prominent migration is is from east to west um although there is some summer redistribution like right now in the summer it tends to fire on the the ewa end we were able about double the size of the beach and we just measured it uh at the end of last month and we've been able to retain most of the sand that was pumped however it's normal to lose the sand over over time it's it's that's why they call it a maintenance project i mean essentially the only way that we can keep sand on this beach is to periodically pump it back in from offshore and uh but the nice thing is the creation of the the new raw hawaiian groin that we built has done as you would expect a much better job than that old dilapidated dilapidated one of holding the sand in so you can see we've got a much stronger beach presence down at the other end than we had prior to the i mean that where the red red red umbrellas are uh immediately eva of the railroad and that's the new groin right there right right how's it going good where are you from alaska alaska holy moly so you're you're catching up here huh yes yep i'm congressman case this is my district and council member waters down there so we're kind of checking out what's happening here and talking about the beach and uh trying to figure out what we need to work on together so that's why we're all dressed up like you're

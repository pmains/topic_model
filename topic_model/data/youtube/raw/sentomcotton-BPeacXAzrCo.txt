also public urination I believe is now legal in the District of Columbia so three cheers for that joining me now is Senate Judiciary member Tom Cotton um he's also the author of The Fantastic book Only the Strong Senator um this bill is facing one more legislative hurdle but if it passes tell us how destructive this will be I understand the urination provision is sailing through by the way I mean it's amazing that the D.C city council facing a massive homelessness problem a crime problem deciding that we should eliminate mandatory minimum sentences and decriminalize things like lifestyle crimes like public urination or I think there's other crimes they're going to decriminalize I mean I found it deeply ironic that Joe Biden decided to give his speech from Union Station the city's main train station which is the epicenter for homelessness and so bad there that you can't even get a cup of coffee getting on the train because Starbucks had to close its store in that train station now I thought he maybe do his speech in front of all the tents that are in front of us I guess they roused them all out yeah but just like yeah just like 10 years ago or five years ago there was no problem with it was a great place to go have lunch and it was yeah it's just totally different now this morning on CNN Senator Hillary Clinton had a different take on the whole crime wave issue watch when they talk about crime you know they're just trying to Gin up all kinds of fear and anxiety in people they're not dealing with it they're not trying to tackle it and so I view it as an effort to scare voters um are you trying to scare voters Senator uh no I think voters are scared of democratic policies that have led to this crime wave in America we have a wide open Southern border with 5 million illegal aliens Crossing almost all drugs in America come from there Democrats across the country have called to defund the police they've condemned the police they want to end the bail system they were in mandatory minimum sentences in prison they were released prisoners what do they expect to get and that's why voters are going to repudiate them next week because they know that this is the direct and obvious results of soft on crime policies from the Democrats now I think this Senate is going to go Republican on Tuesday I hope people get out and vote but um a lot of Republicans are concerned that if the Republicans take control of the Senate senator they will not do the aggressive oversight that is necessary at the Pentagon because and I know your military background and it's reflected in your book but I mean I'm of the view that this Pentagon needs to be cleaned out I mean in in Republicans do I say oh we can't defund the Pentagon we can't defund the bill we can't but okay then what can we do no the entire Biden Administration needs a lot of oversight to include the Department of Defense and that's not just the kind of traditional oversight we would normally do to make sure you're getting good value for your tax dollars on things like the new stealth bomber but also the kind of left-wing struggle sessions like something out of mouse cultural revolution that I've heard from so many troops from I got a note just yesterday from someone with whom I served in the Army total warrior he taught me a lot about what I know about surviving in the woods and Leading Men in combat he's been a special operator for years he's going to retire now because he didn't pick up for command he said you know I guess I'm just not today's Army's kind of the kind of leader that today's Army wants so there needs to be a lot of oversight on what the leadership of the Pentagon has done to our military that's why we have a retention and a recruiting crisis in our military who wants to go into the military if it's just like going to be like an associate lecturer you know an Ivy League cool young men and women joined the army to learn to kill the bad guys they don't learn how to join the Army to learn to use the right pronouns so you will insist that this happens yeah absolutely are um your book Only the Strong now why'd you write it real quick you know I wrote in the aftermath of the Afghanistan Fiasco last year a lot of our cancers are asking me how do we let this happen lose to a band of medieval Savages like this and it but it wasn't just that I wanted to lay out the case for how the left is at best ambivalent about America going back to Woodrow Wilson and the progressives and therefore they've been undermining the sources of American power for over a century well how did we have that Fiasco and no one lost their job yeah there's going to be a lot of oversight yeah Millie and Austin should not be in their positions after what happened everyone can get out and get this book Only the Strong Senator great to see you thank you Lawrence great to be here

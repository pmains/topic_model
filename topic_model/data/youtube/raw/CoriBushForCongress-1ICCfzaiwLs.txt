Hey everyone! I'm Cori Bush, your
favorite candidate for U.S Congress for Missouri's First District.
And I need you to know we need your feet. We need you working on the ground, boots to the ground, helping us canvass, knocking these doors, being face to face with voters, so that they hear our message
and know that they have an advocate. They have a fighter who is ready to show up and show out in Congress on their behalf.
You want to go to coribush.org/events and sign up there. Can you bring a friend? Absolutely! You can bring a friend,
bring a cousin, bring your partner, bring everybody! Because this is going to affect everyone. We need change in St. Louis and this is how we get it. So come on and be boots to the ground.
You know that's who I am, that's who I'm asking you to be. If you give me just a
few days I will give you some hardcore boots to
the ground work in Congress. Let's do this, let's win together, let's
go!

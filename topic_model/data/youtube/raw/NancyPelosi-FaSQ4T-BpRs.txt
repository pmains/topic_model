well let me just say that the evidence of our own experience in the Bush years indicates what the the tax cuts at the high end do they increase the deficit they do not create jobs they do not create jobs so for them to put forth a formula a recipe for failure that we have already done I mean we did this in the Bush years it didn't work it produced record unemployment record unemployment so now they're saying perhaps we shall all engage in the luxury of amnesia let's forget all of that and let's do it again because our friends they need these tax cuts and it's just not right so it took us to a near depression we don't want to go the fair again and again I know that the handmaidens of the millionaires think that that's the only way trickle down well I don't know what's trickling down but it's not a pleasant experience for the middle class and now they want us to go down that path again it did not work then there's so much more that's wrong with what's on the floor right now but the clearest picture of what it does to the middle class and what a just a millionaire's is it's it's stunning it almost has an immorality to it 331 thousand dollar tax break for people making over a million dollars at the cost to the middle class of paying more of forty five hundred dollars how many people in our country do you think are aware of this blueprint for again extracting money from the middle class and giving it to the wealthy in our country you have to give the Republicans credit they're very clear about their agenda when they talk tax cuts for the rich they talk about rewarding success what they don't talk about is the tax increase for the middle class which is devastating to a country the middle class is the backbone is the backbone of our democracy tax cuts for the middle class are spent they inject a man into the economy they create jobs

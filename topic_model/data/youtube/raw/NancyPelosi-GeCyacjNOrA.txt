what Democrats rather extend all the cuts or let them all expire I believe that right now what we're looking for is compromised we're hoping that our Republican colleagues were coming right now if we were to pass the Republican bill if you're a sergeant in the military serving overseas in Afghanistan you have a wife and children back here stateside you will see a four-hundred-dollar increase in your taxes if the Republican bill boat want to become law that's simply unacceptable for the middle class and working Americans we need to pass a bill that makes sense for America not just for the wealthiest 2% of this country

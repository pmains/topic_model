hello representative derek kilmer here this April 22nd I hope you'll join me in celebrating Earth Day each year reminds folks around the world of our obligation to be responsible stewards of our lands and waters I want to leave a better world for my daughter's generation and the time for action is now our nation's made a commitment to reducing greenhouse gases and tapping into a growing demand for renewable energy sources that's a good step in the right direction but it's not nearly enough climate change isn't just a theory and it's not something we can wait for future generations to take care of just take a look at what's happening in my neck of the woods and in coastal communities all over the country for centuries in the Pacific Northwest folks have called our coastlines home but now the landscape is being reshaped by forces beyond our control climate change has brought more severe storms that trigger flooding and sea levels continue to rise already three Native American tribes on the Olympic Peninsula that have called our Coast home for centuries have had to seek help moving to higher ground that's why I'm working on a bill to help them and others across this nation confront this problem it make it easier for tribal governments to implement coastal and shoreline initiatives that support public safety public access and can help save their rich cultural heritage sites that's one item I'm working on for this earth day I encourage everyone to find a way to contribute take some time to read more about climate changes impact on our oceans we're better yet head down to your local beach for a cleanup together we can each do our part to protect our natural resources so that we can leave a positive legacy for future generations

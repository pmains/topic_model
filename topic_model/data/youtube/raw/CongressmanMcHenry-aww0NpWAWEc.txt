killer vice chairman of the committee director wat thank you good to see again and always good to see on the plane coming back and forth from your former district in Charlotte congratulations on that beautiful baby well thank you thank you mel I appreciate it and I appreciate your kindness and friendship over the years and we've been able to have conversations even when we disagree about issues and so I just want to ask you a few questions but you know you know me fairly well so I figured at some point you'll cut me off here so it seems it seems that we have some conflicting actions that you've taken one is you suspend the G fees right and you move away from risk-based pricing at the same time you start up holding reserves the Housing Trust Fund and allocating capital Housing Trust Fund in one respect you're conserving capital for an assessment and the other you're actually moving capital away from the enterprise how do you reconcile that represent to mchenry all i'm doing is following the statutes that were written by congress and passed by congress and we're trying to do it as judiciously and prudently as we can i I'm not even trying to connect those two things the housing trust fund funding was an independent decision that that was based on the statute the GFE decision was a prudence decision just to give us an opportunity to study the issue thoroughly and we're doing that and we don't know where we're going to get to on that so I think judging where where that might go at this point would be premature so under the statute you have no choice you have to allocate capital for the housing trust fund well if the statute if if the statutory standards are met the contributions to the trust fund can be suspended they were suspended in 2008 by the acting director at that time and we applied the same principles under change circumstances to reinstate them that's all we did but the Housing Trust Fund was not created by fhfa housing trust fund was created by Congress and the decision to fund it or not fund it is based on statutory criteria but most of us look at this and think that that so look at Freddie being leveraged 156 2 1 Fanny leveraged at 134 21 and think that the conditions are not right because you know the the requirement to suspend the allocation of capital the Housing Trust Fund is shouldn't be justified under these circumstances with this type of leverage rate of these institutions that's not one of the statutory criteria that that Congress set for evaluating whether to fund the housing trust fund are not fun now entrust my so is this an odd circumstance because in you know right you were outspoken about subprime lending in the private sector leading up to the crisis you know i heard jen debates here I heard you on TV at home that that you said that these really high LTV loans were problematic that this was deeply concerning especially for those that didn't have savings that a small fluctuation in the marketplace could cause problems do you have that similar concern because in many respects you're making substantial decisions no now you're making huge decisions in and so the consequences of these actions are real I know you know that but you know is there that conflict looking back at it what you said about the private sector versus the actions you're taking right now I don't think there's any conflict between what I said then and what I'm doing now you need to make responsible loans and this decision was surrounded by a bunch of compensating factors for every borrower that would make their loan as reliable a a loan as a ten percent down payment loan of twenty percent down payment loan and that's our responsibility and I would hope that you all would would would rely on the same things that I said in in advocating for reform in this area to know that we are going to apply those principles and not sanction loans back by Fannie and Freddie and the taxpayers that are not reliably expected to be paid toyota the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York

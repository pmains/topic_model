really appreciate you joining us and so this is our so to speak headquarters we just got an office in Detroit West and we have an office now in Detroit East and we are just looking and working on a third office in Detroit so we'll start building teams and we'll start you know going we'll have something in Grand Rapids and we'll have something in Lansing and we'll just have something in Bay City and Muskegon and market and we'll just you know this is really a statewide campaign ly not taking any geography for granted we think we want to just go appeal to all Michiganders because we need a change we need something different a lot of things aren't working our education is one of my number one priority thank you I don't say that because there's a teacher sitting on your front row here you know I want to be known as the education governor and someone that really made our education better and tell you why you know I don't say that just because it sounds good Ellen was the ladder for my success so when I was 14 years old and my family fell into dire poverty you know for girls in the in the family two boys my mom and dad my dad had to retire because of his age they just made him forcibly retire and the family had financial problems and I worked as a janitor and fortunately the state paid for my bachelor's and master's because of my financial status now here it doesn't happen and we got to make education more affordable so my focus is look that helped me get my degrees and then I came to University of Akron and so in high school I worked as a janitor I worked many jobs in college then I came to University of Akron in 1979 to work on my PhD in chemistry so I'm a scientist yeah so I'm a chemist I'm a scientist and so they paid me $300 a month to teach undergraduates laboratory they and so out of the 300 I'll take $75 and I'll send it home so my family can put food on the table and then in summer they won't pay us no teeth no labs in the summer so no teaching assistant so then I couldn't afford to keep my apartment and then I started sleeping in my car I had a little car and bought for $200 I didn't have insurance but it couldn't afford an insurance on it but I would sleep in the car and if Ben got too hot in the car I will go and sleep in the chemistry building so one day the the Dean and the professor came there to have a meeting and I was still sleeping because I worked late last night and so two years later they gave me an award an outstanding teaching assistant and the Dean said tree is very very dedicated he works very very hard many a nice is known to sleep in the department so so so I got my PhD and I applied 150 jobs and didn't get a single that was 1982 I don't know if you remember but the interest rates were 17% your first car right so couldn't get a job and then I was I Michigan is why Michigan is critical to me so I was I was invited at Midland they had a chemical you know like a talk show a nut talk show or what you called chemical regional meeting where I presented my thesis work there to them and one person in the back was kept asking me tough question but in the end he came and offered me a job at the University of Michigan he happened to be the chairman of the chemistry department here in Ann Arbor and his name is dr. Curtis M dakotas and so I came to Michigan I was excited and the question really was will my Impala that I had bought for 200 will it make it to another from Akron Ohio back then the life was very simple because everything that I owned fit nicely in the trunk of my car and I still have some room left so I came and drove the car made it to Ann Arbor I parked it in the central campus I had to I was in a hurry to go to the department and then I came back to the car this is September of 1982 and I got a ticket and the ticket that wiped out half of my net worth for the ticket so I stayed in Michigan till 84 and then I before I got a job in st. Louis Missouri so I went to Central Missouri got a worked up there as a chemist and in 1990 I wanted to be my on my own so I bought a little business it was a three-person service business that did chemical analysis chemical testing what they did was like a woman who is working in her garden and she's getting the skin irritation working with the soil and it's it so happens that the town has a chemical factory and there are stacks and there is fly ash flying all over so the townspeople are little afraid because they were the only employers in town to go complain so but they go there and complain and the company won't listen so they came to my lab and what the way I would do it is I'll analyze the soil and look for any kind of chemicals in the soil and then I'll go and found the fly ash and analyze that and guess what the chemicals in the fly ash was exactly same as the chemicals that I found in the soil including some cancer-causing chemicals so when I wrote my report they went to them and they fought and they were able to resolve that and don't be change their methods and processes so I this is what I did my company did help people you know solve problems like that fight with corporations we did some innovation and helped little companies innovate new drugs new medicine that Pfizer won't do because you know there's only 500 people somewhere are 5,000 people that need this medicine it's a rare disease precise not blockbuster profits so they won't do it so I will help this little virtual small startup companies develop this new medicine so that was become my part of my business and he started growing so I bought this three-person company for $75,000 that's the loan I got from the bank and I had 3,000 on my credit card so I'm not no Rick Snyder and no Donald Trump of who's that getting 14 million dollars to start small No so you know so I the bank gave me the loan I got this thing and started the company and the owner retired after I bought the company first secretary was 75 years old she retired so I only inherited one chemist and me and then grew them that business and in 1996 I grown the business to about 20 employees about a couple million in revenues from the hundred fifty million thousand per year revenue that and I bought it so grew that business and then 1996 my children were four and eight years old and their mother died so I had to take care of my children as a single father and run the business and a few years later I made a wonderful woman I got remarried these boys I'm so proud of them these boys graduated from rough Business School with a business degree and now there are entrepreneurs creating jobs so so you know and I thereby one of my biggest consultants because I'm trying to get some value for all the fees that I hated and they're very good they're very passionate and they tell me that I should really do this and they encouraged me and it's I felt that I my wife and I must have raised this children well because they were encouraging me to spend their inheritance on this campaign who the money that I'm putting into this campaign is a big chunk of for Rick Snyder it goes pocket change to put it but a lot of money I'm putting into it so that I don't have to take money from the corporation's because I'm not going to take a single penny from the corporation's I will not only be hold on and I'm passionate enough in this that I want to you know do this and they encouraged me and I said do you realize this is your inheritance I'm the head we we fine you know do what you need to do if this is what you're passionate about do it and so that's really what I'm doing so I sold my business so the business that I was that I had bought so kept growing and in 2008 the business had grown to about 450 employees 65 million in revenues so many little companies that I had bought using more loans from the bank because I needed a infrastructure to serve these little companies that are developing medicine these are all venture funded virtual companies and in 2008 too with the recession anybody remembers the recession yeah so all of my employees one of my my customers my this little company started going belly-up in the recession and I had borrowed what 44 million though before the recession the business was valued at about 200 million so it wasn't too bad I borrowed 24 million and created a business that was worth 200 million but in the recession the the lot of my customers started going belly-up the bank got it impatient and I kept telling them that let me and I will head working 18 hours a day trying to turn it around and I said saying that the bank that give me time I'll save all these jobs and you'll get your money and we'll keep the jobs and the bank are impatient they're getting like 10 cents on a dollar everywhere else in the recession so they came in took charge defy everything that I had sold it mm got more money little more money than what I owed him so they got paid them so full they gave the rest of the money that they collected as late fees and receivership fees huh they said to me as I was leaving last time from my business they gave me a cardboard box I said mr. Stanner that if you won't take your personal stuff feel free to take so I'm putting in the Box my children's pictures from my desk and I put my entrepreneur of the Year trophy that I had one else very proud of from on Sonia - of ours that had gotten before so I put the award in my box and I said I'm gonna be in another one of this I come home and then we learned that the bank is going to foreclose on our home you know so we put all our personal stuff put it in the budget rental truck my wife and I took turns driving this was in September of 2010 we drove straight from there to Ann Arbor Michigan we got a little lab in Weston Arbor and rented that space bottle this is business that had gone out of business it's like my part that and started my business again and in six years I created 50 good paint jobs in Ann Arbor moved into a bigger building right here and cross the an Al Gore Airport and in 2016 I won that award under suburbia and at that time I felt like you know we achieved our American dream my family is doing well you know a lot of people are hurting and there's this is across the America and especially in Michigan you know getting American dream you know it's very becoming harder our children supposed to do better than us know and that's not happening and there are no opportunities and we are putting people but you're not giving them skills and you know we're not training people and education become so expensive and health care has become expensive you know this is because they should not be education should not be a privilege health care should not be a privilege and you know we see the rich people getting richer and we see people that are struggling 22% people under poverty line in Michigan 40% of the African American children going to bed hungry and that's no way to live you know I make women a cameo I made in obesity she worked for a manufacturing company and her company decided to go all automation and she lost her business having a job and he had two little girls single single mom two little girls and she's working a taco let $8.50 an hour and that's no way to raise a family for a country that is so affluent you know so something isn't quite right and something isn't quite right then our governor says he wants to run the state like a business and state is not a business right we got you're dealing with people's lies and when you put emergency managers and you don't pay enough to the cities and counties you know you take that some of that revenue you put it into balancing the budget and cut short to the cities and then you giving money to the cities based on the zip code not based on the needs and then city's failed cities like Detroit fail and cities like Flint fail and then they put the emergency managers and Michigander said we don't want emergency managers despite our opposition they put emergency managers and these emergency managers can only look at cost not revenue so when they look at the balance sheet they tried to save hundred and fifty thousand dollars in Flint that's all 150 thousand dollars because they needed to soften that water put some chemicals to so that they won't corrode and the lady won't leach into the water buts that simple if they try to save little bit of money and poison literally thousands of people including children no we got to change the lead lines from everywhere you know we gotta fix infrastructure son we got to find money today you know it's people's health it's people's health and nobody you know we be sitting on yes I do you know we are going to look at there was a big study done and that said that we need to put up to six billion dollars a year in our infrastructure there's this love not only our roads are terrible you know is this a joke or the potholes that we have is just a joke we got to fix those roads you know we got to fix the bridges that are can you know there's this temporarily supported bridges there is no internet in northern Michigan high-speed Internet how can you study how can you innovate how can you you know and how can you run we a good good question so first of all I'll be giving away hundreds of millions of dollars to big corporations remember even at Amazon we try to give so much money and they still didn't come here because you know they said you don't have good education system you don't have the skilled people in Michigan so we give them a such a sweetheart deal and they didn't take it because that's not gonna work anymore all Snyder has done is give money away to big corporations you know and I'm going to take some of that money out we're gonna do some bonds municipal bonds we are going to do do some graduated tax structure that you know so the corporation's aren't paying their fair share of taxes some of the rich aren't paying their fair share of taxes so we I don't want the lower middle class and middle class and the working poor to be able to have to pay any more taxes they should not and making them paint these auto fees and is ridiculous you know trying to raise the registration fees that's not the way to collect money so we need to redo our tax structure we need to get some some money we can get from the federal government like a for a new sous lock we can get money for expanding 94 we can get money from federal government so we gotta go fight for that money and get that money you know so there's a we I would support recreational legalization of recreational marijuana that little bit about 125 million dollars so money is there if we have the will and money is there if we can do the leadership sorry so we need to we need to really focus on that so there's multiple sources of revenues that we can generate but we need to have the will to make a change you know the same old same old isn't working and we got to regard to think big we got to think and bring big ideas we have to have a vision how is Michigan going to be five years down the road how is Michigan going to be ten years down the road and we gotta start investing in our state you can it's not investing in our infrastructure we kind of start investing in our education we got to create skillsets we got to make college affordable I would like to see the public universities tuition-free you know because that's the best investment we can do in our people and it's doable some of these things are doable be and I call myself a financially savvy Bernie Sanders no offense but but you know i i'm i'm ran small businesses i have to make payroll every two weeks so i understand - how do you know so it's not empty promises i understand how to generate the revenues and then how to use them frugally because i mean i grew up in poverty I have I learned from my mom how to be frugal and how to be pragmatic and how to use common sense to get things done and that's the kind of a you know knowledge-based I will bring to Lansing but you have a question can you address how the lottery affects education because our governor keeps saying oh all this money you know from the lottery is going in education and get a feeling it's actually going into the general fund it's not helping it's not happy and that's what they do you know they have money allocated even we have the school fund that they take the money out so every time they they run shy of money they rate the education the first time that they come they yeah yeah and so we need to really make banks specifically for education specifically from infrastructure put money into it and that money is earmarked for that particular issue and nowhere and we should not let them take that money away you know so we that's really what we need to do but we need strong leadership what's going to happen more than likely is that we're gonna have a repo blinkin Senate with all the gerrymandering there is no way we can win the Senate there is a good chance we can win the house if if we can win the governorship with at least 10% margin I would love to I would love to but I may not want to count on that okay but house there's a good chance we can get to the House said it is going to be difficult but if I have the house I can I will have plenty of leverage and I'm used to working with a little bit of leverage I don't need a lot of leverage because I've dealt with adversities all my life so I know how to make things happen and I know I know how to fight for things so I yes anyway and then they pick up an etsy so like for people that live in Bello yeah and respect with nothing we have either Drive like to Westland yeah I know I'm in a want you know why because something I think we gotta we gotta have big mass transit is very very critical and we need to work within a comb and we need to work with Oakland and we need to expand those bus lines and we don't we need to find a way where they won't be able to opt out of it yeah sure sure yeah they were last week I made a woman she takes three different buses and then she walks one and a half my tour you know look how difficult we make it for people to get a job and work exactly and you know we have good intentions and we need to have good strong leadership and we need to have leadership that's not beholden to the corporations and the lobbyists and the billion-dollar families you know because look at the Alicia's and the people there they get the best deals there's just so many loopholes and you know and even when they're when they get better the city money and they're supposed to be hiding downtown you know Detroiters they don't and when they don't they are just built in a small fine they and they built that into their calculation so they just pay the fine and that's what big corporations get away with and our politicians have become so dependent on these big corporations because they need money to run for election and so there is this bond a there's you know there's this thing and when they go to power this Baker's you know this is just a pay for play culture and that's really holding that's really where we see the effect of the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies and the building builders you know what they're trying to do here is just you know just unacceptable so our government is representative but it's representative because because you and I in rest of us don't have a lobbyist in Lansing tell me if anybody does I want to offend you you know we don't have the lobbyists in there and many of the new lawmakers who come in who don't study and don't you know Callie wants would make them part-time and I'd rather want them to work 80 hours a week you know and figure out what the problems are and work hard and do the research and don't get your information from the lobbyist because the lobbyists have an agenda go to your own independent research and your own studying understand the issues good talk to your people in your constituency to understand then they know what needs to be done so go talk to people don't talk to the lobbyists you know we need to kind of stop this you know then lawmakers get term-limited then they go become lobbyists and they start influencing I mean we gotta you know give them a like a five year period where they can't even lobby there's a lot that we need thank you thank you thank you but you know you gotta stop that corruption this is the corruption that we can start until we do that we're not gonna get you know we are last in transparency we lost in ethics among all states you know we don't need to know where the did they can tell us where the governor is the governor could be out of the country then he goes to Japan no one can know about no accountability Emme DC makes these backroom deals with big corporations they don't we'll see what they offer to Amazon they are we are not telling us they're not telling us so what kind of a deals are going on and look at look at this look at this Freedom of Information the the governor the Lieutenant Governor the lawmakers they're not subject to that and I want to change that and I think similarly I can do that for my own position as a guy because you know we paying them you know that we are paying them to do service and we need to know what are they up to you know and why what is it that they want to hide there should be nothing there yes oh I'm sorry yeah so so first of all I'm a little saner than Donald Trump and I think I have a little more heart and compassion than Rick Snyder you know basically you know Trump came in with very narcissistic everything it's all about him it's all about him and so I should not be don't look just because I owned a business and I succeeded in business and I also failed in business and succeed again I shouldn't be just compared in the same way as Rick Snyder or Donald Trump you know I'm a scientist to begin with I've lived my life with transparency and ethics and you can you go we have a book for every one of you a complimentary copy of my memoirs and if you read that you can see how how transparently I've lived my life and how open I am about everything that happened to me in my life and that's how I will be as a governor I'd be very transparent I'll be very open about whatever ideas there are some good skills when I grow a small businesses I have to hire good people because I can't alone take a three person company and make it into a 450 employee company nor can i and alone solve all of Michigan's problems so I gotta have good people and I know how to do that I know how to craft a good vision for our state you know and then I know how to communicate that vision to the lawmakers to the people of Michigan to to to my cabinet and then make this all happen and I stand behind it sometimes I also get a question about or haven't been a mayor before and I haven't been a lawmaker before do I have enough experience too and if you look at who a governor is a governor is a leader he or she has the their job is to have a vision their job is to have solutions you know when I do my State of the State address I plan out an agenda for our state you know and the lawmakers have to go now and vote on it you know and often a lawmaker only has one vote her or his own hood and most of them work party line right so it's not being in as a lawmaker doesn't give you that leadership skills doesn't give you that leadership skills because when you're running a small business you making critical decisions you know where as a lawmaker you're all be responsible about your own one work and 90 plus percent now is we are our politics is so polarized that people have just worked hard aligned and they're not well informed they go to get their information from the lobbyists so I think what is critical here is that we get somebody that is a leader a strong leader has a strong backbone because we are going to have to negotiate and use little leverage that we have against the Republican you know how sort of cynic make things happen because this is not about grandstanding this is not about just talking and it's not about great passionate speeches it's about solving problems ultimately four years down the road at the end of my first term where I want to look back and I want to create myself you know like like we were great in at school and there are various many areas you know are our roads better could we invest in our infrastructure where is our education did we raise it up in the top 10% you know did we make it easier for people to acquire skills did we make college more affordable are we more transparent as a state now so that's there will be many question that I'm be asking and I will be grading myself I'm a hard grader and I will grade myself and see how I did it's not about what a great speech I made about human rights or it made civil rights or women's rights or workers rights right speeches don't change the right lives you know we need to actually make happen that means we need to really work things out and actually pass bills and change people's lives so that's what I want to do I'm not a career politician I don't need this job to make my resume look good you know my I've got a pretty good resume you know so I mean I'm going there to fix things and do things and I'm very passionate about it and I want to so I sold my business so when I came to a number we restarted our business at 2016 I got that award and I decided when it sells so I sold the business sent a paid 1.5 million dollars like chicken gave it to all my employees and I did it by not by their titles the presidents and CF was usually get to buy most of the money I gave it based on the length of their service you know so Katie my administrative assistant got one hundred and seven thousand dollars for the bonus so so you know I don't just talk progressive I have lived a progressive life I've provided the health insurance to employees and I provided you know sick leave paid sick leave to employees and I've run good businesses you know now my opponents are going and finding some disgruntled employees and making so I think I've arrived because now I'm getting all kinds of attacks every other day I see in the newspaper somebody is trying to find something go find a something so that's really going to happen and I'm you know they told me it's gonna be dirty politics is dirty and that's why good people don't want to go into it you know and those who are in there try to live a very sanitized life or at least appear to you know and that's what the media is always trying to go find something in their lives and if you live a normal life then the media can find the little things and blow it up so that's what I'm starting to see happening but they tell me it's a good thing because yeah the take me seriously there being I'm a threat now and some poll put me three percent above I was I'm leading among all candidates now yeah now the only poll that really matters is the one on August 7th and November 6 so I want you to come doesn't matter what these little polls tell us and they're gonna change from week to week but I was 2% in the polls in November with a error margin of plus or minus 4 and we have risen up now and so we're getting a lot of interest I know there's a question so we're getting a lot of you know support and interest and you know I want to fight I'm hearing everywhere I go I hear the struggle people are having and really we need to focus on that we need to make lancing work for people once again so that's really what I'm focused yes sir and I know that you have so how can I be sure that you're a strong Democrat when you have come out in support and it has been said that you thought about running re well there were two Lansing consultants this our Lansing game works by the way so it's like trick or treat that's what they work so if you have so if you hire them and pay them money then they'll say good things about you so there's a couple Democratic consultants that I interviewed and I ended up not hiding them right so now they go talk to and then media just want stories so there is a media story that have talked about all these things so she is not really progressive you know all kinds of stuff so this will just go on and on and they will try to discredit me you know because that's the only thing they can do you know and this is going to happen so I've given in about last ten years or so I've given about thirty two thousand dollars to political candidates so sometimes political candidates call me you know and asks for donations and now twenty nine thousand of that happened to be Democratic candidates including Obama I gave Obama's victory from fifteen thousand dollars and I got nothing just a picture but it was a nice picture I got a picture with Obama and Clinton and I realize how short I am every time I look at the two presidents but as an immigrant coming to this country and I'm so so thrilled with the opportunities I got but I got a chance to put my hand up too famous the best of the two people that I respect and but that cost me $15,000 and and that 30-second conversation with Obama know the Democrats 15,000 50:32 I gave twenty nine thousand to Democrats and I got I and I gave two thousand three hundred dollars to two John McCain so now yeah so now there are stories all over the King oh I think so basically what happens is I get invited to these fundraisers I go there the admission price is $2,300 so I gave it to them I go and have a good conversation with John McCain about immigration and I said why aren't you doing illegal immigration why don't you make it easy because we need good people you know we need good people make it easy because these are very 12 look at me I came in with a master's degree in chemistry stayed here and I have loyalty to this country of ours I became a US citizen in 1988 you know 30 years ago create the jobs you know and sometimes I have you know a person coming from our side appreciates what a great country we are you know and so we shouldn't discount that and so I went to talk about to that too so you know media is gonna make all kind of things and my opponents are gonna make big deal out of it but really I'm gonna focus on issues and I'm gonna focus on doing the right thing yeah well I think of the future and the immigrant community yes the future needs yeah and I go to you know downtown Detroit and I I see in the neighborhood and see young kids and they need inspiration you know they need a helping hand and they need they need encouragement and it's not just getting a job I think we need them to have inspiration and encouragement to start their own businesses you know we need to bring under creation the preneur shape and now we need to bring the startup culture here and that's really what I did when I had nothing I started a little business in a crew a little business we need to really create opportunities for young people so they don't have to leave Michigan go someplace else to achieve their American dream they should be able to do it right here in Michigan and that's really what I'm going to focus on the other thing I'm other thing that keeps talking about is that you're an immigrant and you speak with an accent I think people tell me I speak with an accent general anybody agrees so be it but you know we really need to have look at the leadership and we need to learn in look at the passion underneath it look at a personal intentions in doing what view yeah I had more of a comment than a question it was just kind of ladies question in the back um the fact that you did donate to a Republican I think that makes you a stronger candidate because it shows what I think it's been a problem in our country lately is people putting a party over country and so the fact that you're willing to reach across the aisle and talk to people of all parties I think it's a strength yeah rather than weakness oh I I want you to celebrate that and not like shrink ya issue in and say oh no you know yeah make that make that an asset thank you thank you for the comic thank you and we got to we got we are a purple state and you know we need to work across the aisle to make things happen you know we gotta make things happen and so so you know let's let's work together let's work together and so but we have become so polarized you know 15 20 30 years ago people used to cross the aisle and work for a good bill there'll be so much crossover worry it's not happening anymore you know it's all party line and it's all demonizing the other side and that's really what happens all the time and we need to need to work on this and I feel that as a general election candidate with my financial background and my being frugal and my financial savvy a lot of the independence will like my background and my I'm the only guy among the a person running for governor that has created jobs rest of them are all worried about their own job but I'm the only one who has signed a paycheck right and that is a valuable experience that you know I've gone through adversities and I dealt with things and I've lost everything at it and I didn't give up you know I I lost a family member my first wife to mental illness and I dealt with that you know I dealt with raising my children and mental mental illness is such a difficult situation this data so starting with Engler Republicans have cut budget close hospitals you know and if you look in the prison system 60 70 % of people have underlying mental illness you know with locking up people that are mentally ill severely mentally ill you go look in Metro Detroit 18,000 homeless people many of them have seen severe mental illness and we have not been compassionate enough to deal with something like that and then it manifests itself in all of the other different areas and if we don't really get to the heart of it and these are some of the critical big problems we need to solve and I'm not going to worry about my reelection chances and what the polls are saying I'm going to do the right thing you know and if people appreciate they'll elect me again for my second term but because this is not I'm not a career politician I'm just going to go there and do the right thing just want to go there and fix things because you know I feel an obligation our country's given me so much in Michigan has given me so much when I first came to Michigan that was my first job and that's when I dreamed about my American Dream right here in Ann Arbor and I and when I lost everything I came back to Ann Arbor recreated what I'd lost and so I feel tremendous obligation and gratitude towards Michigan and I want to give back yes yeah well I am for Responsible gun control I support Second Amendment but you know we don't need guns in education institutions and the last thing I would ask a teacher to do is carry a gun exactly exactly you know teachers are there to teach and it's not a novel concept teachers are supposed to teach you know and we need to invest enough money in it to make our schools safer that means if you need to put technology use technology if we need to use more security use security keycard access whatever it takes where may schools secure but it's not the teacher's job to be defending and protecting and caring guns you know we we need to I want to ban assault weapons because you know anything that's not needed to protect our Second Amendment right and so my focus would be responsible gun ownership you need to give teachers back their autonomy we need to give that we need to pay them well trust we need to miss our children this is so much I want to do for the teacher so one is we need to hide enough teachers so that we don't have a class full of thirty seven kids in a class the teacher can barely stand in the class that's just not a very good way to learn we need to hire more people we need to encourage more people to go into teaching that means we may want to forgive some of their college debt if they choose to go into teaching yeah you can't even this time of year there's not even any copy paper yeah so how do you expect for teachers to carry guns when there are no where there's no money in schools to begin with so the skills more like a deflection yeah from you know I was real issue in here with controlled and oh absolutely absolutely see NRA never let some organized you know I was at Office Max the other day and I met two teachers Judy and Rachel they teach in the Farmington School District and they had tears in their eyes they're telling me about how they get humiliated in the evaluated and how they come in with a you know yeah so so we need to you know we need to respect our teachers you know they had tears in their eyes they're explaining me they haven't had a pay raise for like fight last five years and you know these two ladies were putting money out of their own pocket to buy supplies for theirs for the classroom I mean look at the dedication look yeah it's the only and that's no way to run an education system we gotta fix that's why that's my number one priority education is my number one priority I know the roads are bad we gotta fix those roads and invest in in our infrastructure but education that healthcare is a big huge problem you know people seniors have to choose between buying prescription medicine or putting food on the table we really have to deal with healthcare we need to cover more people and I'm for single-payer healthcare not gonna be easy but we got to work on that and we got to find a way to cover more people there's this ton of things that needs to be done last seven years the one party who control all of Lansing haven't invested enough and I want to do that oh yes ma'am yeah oh I'm I am fully supportive of women's rights I am pro-choice now this that's what I was talking about when the consultants who didn't get paid who didn't get hired by me I started these rumors and some newspaper reporters reporters love to do this kind of rumor thing and there are articles about it and this happened to me a three two days after I raised in the poll and I had a three percent Lido or everybody else these sort article started coming coming out and so there is no truth to that these are all just rumors people are trying to discredit because this is the only way they can defeat what I'm trying to do yes I know where I'm not even personally proneness I know but but but but do you know what I am thick-skinned enough I'm thick-skinned enough that I don't have to wake up at 3 a.m. and two tweeting so I told my I told my wife and told my staff you know I have a thick skin but it's fasten your seatbelts we're becoming a threat to some people and we will start seeing these rumors and you'll see more of this this is just a beginning of that yes media is dishonest not all media is wrong but some do you know sometime you know it bit is trying to sell their get better ratings or sell their newspapers whatever and sometimes sensational stuff sells and people like to do that but I'm not saying the entire profession is bad or just a few people yeah who should i oh maybe it's great that you talk about paying teachers more and doing the roads and so forth where is the money going to come from to do this good question I think this is you know if I answered it once but I'll answer it again yeah good question and I'll repeat this because it's worth repeating so a lot of things like things like getting a new sue lock things like expanding highway 94 we can get some federal funds for that so there is things we can do where we can get federal funds for we need to redo our tax structure you know our corporations are not paying their fair share their profits are in billions but if you really look at the amount of taxes corporations really pay its amazingly low enough low amount and we need to have them pay their fair share of taxes we don't need to give the kind of incentives that Google and Amazon and a big companies like that don't need money our incentives they have to be here and they have to have distribution Amazon needs to have a distribution center here in Romulus because the best part of their business so they don't need to get incentives from us so I'm going to cut down on big corporate incentives I'm going to invest that into small businesses I will invest that into education I want to once we legalize recreational marijuana that will generate 125 million dollars the tax will generate about 1.8 billion dollars several hundred million dollars we can say from the corporate welfare that Snyder has championed there is a multiple ways will do municipal bonds because investing $1 today will give us five dollar reward five years down the road so we'll do some municipal bonds I don't think we can tax middle class and normal class anymore they've been taxed enough and we haven't fixed our roads and we have raised registration fees and we have raised all kinds of things so so we need to really make this a balanced and that means we need to so the money is there you need to have the will and you need to have the backbone and you need to have strong leadership to make it happen but the money is there and this can be done it's not gonna be easy and it's not gonna be easy working and getting this done through the Republican Senate but if anybody can do it I can because I've dealt with situations like that what changes would you want to make in the corporate tax structure I know Michigan used to have a single business tax actually got real true and didn't replace with anything what would you like to replace it with well you didn't really create any more jobs you know since fire to recession if you look at it we still three hundred thousand dollar jobs short from the time prior to recession so it's all this talk about snyder you know taking victory laps about creating jobs we still 300 job three hundred thousand jobs in short from prior to recession so we this this whole concept of our giving money to be corporations asking them to come open up a shop here our politicians get a photo op then few years later these factors get closed and they move jobs out and nobody hears about that so the net gain of all this corporate incentives is essentially zero we haven't created much of a job so and so we need to really invest in small businesses we need to invest in entrepreneurship we need to invest in start-up culture and that's where the jobs are and the small businesses are the people that are loyal to our state and they'll stay here and they'll grow not the big corporations right so again what you want to replace that with how do you want to rearrange the corporate that's what we need to we need to have a graduated tax in comes off you know being revenues income on income okay yeah we need to the corporation's need to pay fair share and this fear that if we have to give them all these goodies so that they can stay here and create jobs hasn't work all that well we are still shy of jobs and if you look at rest of the country and many of the jobs happen in the auto industry and that's only because of the of our minds subsidiaries that Obama gave them it's not even what what a Snyder has done so we really have to change this thinking I call that a band-aid approach give a little bit of money get a big corporation come in create some jobs and then few years later those go away so we really really need to solve these problems in fundamentally not just a band-aid yeah yeah minimum wage needs to be raised to $15 an hour I will tie that to inflation yeah when I'm hearing from you is very great because I come from always hearing that people that have compassion and start out into politics and work their way up they end up being always owing somebody and like you said you you don't want to any ties and that is so refreshing that is the best thing to hear because you have the compassion and we have you know all the things that Michigan is meeting and usually everybody's talks that way but when it comes to once they're in that position it doesn't happen so knowing that that's yeah because you know I don't need their money and I'm not really worried about reelection if I did good people will elect me and I don't need their money to get reelected so I'm not gonna be beholden to them I'm gonna do the right thing is not involved in politics mainly because in in a work area my work Ford Motor Company in the Union I got terribly burnt paying it and political so if I once you are elected how do we continue to support you rather than just waiting to see what you are going to do how do we still you know I think we need to continue to have a dialogue we need to as a governor I need to come and have town hall meetings and I need to listen to people because I really I am NOT going there with an arrogance of I know everything you know I'm going to work with people and I'm going to be open and when I make and think about and talk about important decisions like if I'm we're talking about education then I will have patterns parents at the table I won't have all stakeholders at the table I want to have the teachers at the table you know when we're talking about distributing money to counties and cities we want people from the city to be there and then when we are going to decide what to do with that money I want the local government to be able to say what their priorities are because Lansing cannot set priorities on what needs to be done in Macomb County and in Ann Arbor yes I have no relationship you know I would I certainly I have no III intend to meet with him and I intend to talk with him I have sent out feelers to set up a meeting you know obviously I'm not going there to ask for his endorsement because he's already endorsed somebody else yeah but I will go there and basically I'm going to say to the mayor is that mayor what can I do for Detroit and because I see a lot of issues in Detroit tell me about it tell me I mean I go I go travel I spend a lot of time in Detroit and I am really you know why do people have to live like we are a third world country you know I see the poverty you know I see there is no hope for our young people you know yeah and you know the people that have come from outside and capitalized and made money the big big corporations and they're the billion dollar families have really benefited but they're supposed to hire Detroiters they haven't you know you just walk couple blocks and I've done that many times nothing has changed in the neighborhood you know there are Auto rates are yeah but you go to eight mile yeah and it's like that is this a ton of thing then it talks all starts with opportunities you know the schools you know there's the schools need to be community centers you know this you know I've seen poor kids they are not proud to go to school because they're they they don't have clean clothes and one school put washer dryers in the basement of the school and so kids can bring their dirty clothes and wash them and they can wear next day we need to think differently you know and then I went you in Bloomfield Hills and I was debating and I saw the schools looked like five-star hotels over the years how can you take that young child yeah and we talking about third grade reading and fourth grade math and we need to train the little kids early in the winter one year old and my grandson Chi he's he's 14 months old and I see how they learn at that early age the kids have so much capacity to learn and you know when you have a single parent who are struggling to just put food on the table you're not going to give that kid an opportunity to learn or worse than that one in four parents are in the prison and often for some minor possession charge or not an inability to pay a debt and we need to find an alternative way to deal with such nonviolent offenses you know there may be another way that they can pay their dues and maybe and we got to give them some skills so they don't end up back again same weight with opiate crisis look at that we as I know all over and and and bill shooting is treated it like a law enforcement issue and it is not aligned for many sure you know people are hurting they need counseling they need support there are pill mills there are doctors pushing this medicine you know my neighbor's daughter she had her wisdom teeth removed and she got 20 pills of oxycodone and in and I'm I'm no no medical doctor but if she was my daughter I'd give her two ibuprofen but you know we and the farmers I know I know but the pharmacy but you don't need 40 pills for a wisdom and the pharmaceutical companies are pushing this we got you know the pill mills and the doctors doing that and this is just a lot of things like that that happens and always you see who's benefiting is the big corporations and you then you see it happens in Ann Arbor we have dioxin in our soil who'd left that the big corporations let that and and nobody hold them accountable nobody hold them accountable we got phosphates running into the lake and creating toxicology right we have that pipeline Umbridge line 560 plus year old pipeline that the covering coatings have gone as a scientist I could tell with the currents underneath that's a ticking time bomb the kind of for we can't afford to have that in there it's doing nothing good to us Nestle stealing our water yes we gotta stop they just approved them taking another 400 gallons per minute I believe of our water yeah they and they pay what $200 to take as much water as they want you know I think you had a question so ask about line six be it's already ruptured yeah and it contaminated a massive area and it's still can't am I know so what do you wanna do and you know what happens is we got to we got to hold them accountable and I'm still yeah we we gotta hold him accountable you know I was at Mackinac Policy conference last year and there was I just peeked in there and there was a little party going on lots of fancy alcohol and good our nerves and I saw a lot of lawmakers in there and I just said whose body is that I'm gonna I'm little nosey simple as a who's part and you know what whose party it was it was paid by Umbridge yeah so I would consider myself of progressive voter but you aren't the only progressive candidate for the Democratic primary how does your campaign differ from Abdul el psy as well you know I did not grow up in privilege III I've lived a progressive life I've seen the suffering of poverty I've seen the stigma of poverty I now dealt with it and you know my positions are as progressive as anybody's but I come with a lifelong experience it's not a speech that I memorized it's a life that I've lived I have created jobs I've treated fairly to my employees you know and I bring all of that years of experience and life experiences to this job and I have proven leadership you know I have been a leader but last 26 years so this one thing is what somebody's policies are and then can that person deliver does he or she has the leadership and the backbone and experience to make that happen is more than inspiring speeches because that's something that your consultant can write you very inspire progressive speech but can you lead what is your life experiences what have you accomplished that's what matters and I bring in with a such a rich experience life experiences executive experiences dealing with things dealing with adversities you know so so that so I think one has to look at that because a governor is a leader a governor is someone that has a vision that takes the state to the next level and that's what we just don't want someone just to make great speech you know we need someone that to make things happen I'm a problem-solver I'm a doer and make things happen and that's exciting to me you know and adversities don't you know I I go fight I'm a fighter I'm tough you know I'm the toughest five foot six injury you know against the pressure absolutely absolutely you know what gets to be going is when things get tough and I look at marine my book it's a free coffee free cup I know you some of you feel guilty taking free copies but I have a solution if you go to my website there's a big red button that says donate feel free to donate a couple bucks if you need to but take my book and see how I have dealt with adversities and you know being a governor is not a 60 job you know it's tough it's tough job you're under a microscope you need to have the the temperament and the strength in your mind to deal with this you know that's really what you need and there's gonna be a fight and there's going to be negotiations and there's going to be working on things and I I think about this you know every waking hour I when I sold my business now I'm campaigning every waking hour I think about this then as a governor every waking hour I'll be focusing on this I'm not much into photo ops you know I'll be working hard I think there's a question there did you have a question back there thank you well I just had an observation and I was been I'm gonna start with how to present it in but I'm listening to you and I want you to know I'm not judging I'm just hearing you say things that we've all heard a year ago if not before he was elected minutes afterwards realized that was all a bunch of and so I'm wondering if how are you presenting yourself to people who are going to be spectacle to that sort of rhetoric because obviously there was a big portion of the country that fell for that yeah it did not see through his you know what he was saying true true and that makes me really nervous I'm wondering are people gonna listen to what you say and immediately dismiss it because they've heard that before and then been lied to yeah exactly I mean how many he has 100 lights every hour and he changes his opinion about every eight hours exactly so so unfortunately and I hope people don't judge me just because I happen to own small businesses they don't equate me with Donald Trump you know I like I said I'm a little more saner than here here's a little less narcissistic many yeah I understand not to win over some of those people that fell for his game yes I know I know but you know he lied what he said if it was true he would have been a great leader right but unfortunately lied is all about him the way he reacts and acts and right yeah you know he hasn't grown his brain hasn't grown since fifth grade and that's what happens when you grow up in privilege you know and and and no Sensibility and he discriminated against people of color back when he only did those apartments and he just is not a honest person he is you know why do we convince those people I mean forget convincing them that he's crazy how do we convince them that you know there is out there but look at the look at the reason you know people are smart people are very smart and look why what happened in 2016 what has happened is people are really turned off and tired of the career politicians especially young generation the Millennials are very tired of this you know we have this very polished career politicians that they make speeches and they act it's all scripted you know you know we're tired of the scripted politician we can't trust them and people got so fed up with that that they chose a person that was obviously very faulty and you know had problems we have now realized he even have bigger problems you know but but that's how the frustration years you know and the need and the appetite and the hunger for someone that is common sense and pragmatics is is there unfortunately we didn't get that the people got cheated out when Donald Trump won and people got cheated out when Rick Snyder won because he came in with no compassion and no backbone he gave in to the right wing in terms of passage of right to right work and you know attacks on women's rights and everything that he did he really did not stood up to he expanded recently citizens united so we have a citizens united on steroids now yeah there was absolutely no reason for him to sign that bill so he really gave him because under civility he talks a lot about civility which civility is not just to give in you know that's not what we expect from a leader and that's not so so unfortunately the two Outsiders that the Republicans gave to our nation and our state turned out to be bad outsiders and I hope they don't judge a good outsider with those yardsticks because maybe third time is the charm yes so speaking of putting over quarters with such a progressive campaign how do you intend on winning over or moderate voters well you know what I'm not gonna give up on anybody and I'm going to look at the choices we have we have two career politicians currently I'm calling this a final four for August Madness you got Judy and Kali on that side and we have a three senator and Gretchen Whitmer on the Democratic side so it's a it's a Final Four it's what it's looking like you know so looks like the two of the all three of them are career politicians shooties Ben alpha for himself another politician very very opportunistic and he's just been for himself and I think he's just been on a payroll government or payroll and just grandstanding hasn't accomplished anything all talk you know unfortunately the establishment has picked a candidate on the Democratic side who is more of a corporate Democrat and I don't know if corporate Democrat is any better than a corporate Republican I don't know what you guys think but it was on one side you get a certain billion dollar families get benefited by them and then the other side helps the divorces and whoever else and the Democratic Party helps the other their own billionaires but you know give us a break you know we need we need to get out of all this and we need somebody that isn't beholden so we don't have very many choices and we could have a recession in the next four years and imagine the nightmare if one of these career politician will never created a job have no financial experience gets into that spot and our state hurts the most in an economic downturn you know we hurt a lot and we need someone I think you have your hand up no not at logic so when a corporation pollutes we got to make them pay for it when there are corporations that have big buildings like you know huge big Walmart like buildings they a little thing that corporations do I tell you a little thing that bothers me so Walmart has this big huge facilities right and they have to pay property tax on their real estate we all pay property tax on our homes so they have to pay property the real-estate so you know what they do they appraise those properties as if they were empty so if they appraise it as if they're empty the valuation is almost half of it so they get 50% break on their property taxes this is kind of a sweetheart loophole that they worked out with the politicians and so be it when you say hold them accountable is we gotta watch out for these things we gotta watch out when a corporation leave chemicals if Umbridge is running this oil through the pipeline we gotta give them a daily fine or have them put some money away so if it ever busts we will have sufficient money from them so that's what I mean by holding accountable not explaining Boettcher we need to have the backbone to and not be beholden which we see a lot of our politicians are we need to have it beholden so that not be here so we can really hold them accountable oh I'm sorry go ahead well basically I want to set high standards for our education I want to set very high standards and because once we set high standards for our public schools we need to set the same high standards for our charter schools and then we need to hold them accountable but when we do that we also need to make a commitment to put enough money in our schools you know they need to have the supplies that we need to take care of the buildings as many of the buildings are in bad shape we need to have make sure they have enough supplies we need to make sure that they're safe so that kids can go to school and not be enterin learn how to worry about that children and teachers can go there and teach and not because there's I one of the things that I've heard from a lot of teachers is the bullying that happens and there's really not some enough support staff there is not enough counselors in school to to help the kids yeah there is not enough counselors we in we are one of the states that has the largest ratio of students to counselors we have like seven we have one career counselor for every 750 students and that's way off from the national average we need to be able to give good career counseling to young people so yeah and we need to bring you know career education and vocational skills in middle schools and high schools we need to have mentorship is there's just a ton of things we need to do because teachers hear that all the time and to teachers that means holding teachers accountable which is you know also claiming teachers yeah the problems of schools it also means that schools neighborhood schools are constantly getting closed so what is holding schools accountable look like to you what you know the one of the thing I want to do is cut down on the excessive testing that goes on we have so many testing that goes on and and all of our teachers are now focused so much on just the test scores because the test scores are used to evaluate the teachers this course are used to evaluate the schools which schools are going to close because of test scores and I want just one type of testing done three times a year because because the teachers what they tell me is that they're so focused well they're so worried about their own racism their own jobs that there are just focused on preparing kids for the test scores and they need to do focus on real teaching those test scores should be only used for looking at progress not evaluating a teacher's performance not evaluating whether to keep us or not keep a school we need to we need to put more money into it and we need to but we need to have high expectations you know we need to have high expectations and we need to set high standards because our kids have to compete globally and they need to be able to be they when they come out of high school we want to make sure they're prepared for college career or they have enough vocational skills that they can go out and get a good-paying job so our schools our colleges need to be provide that to the students and and we need to have our curriculum adjusted such that children are coming out with skill sets that are good and marketable in the economy so they can do good life yeah talking about making accountable one of the things I used to do the schools once proposal a came in and we had to start counting you know FGB and full-time syllabi and there are a whole lot of loopholes in that law having a count day okay ten days forward blah blah blah what would happen and I saw it happening and I reported that nobody did anything was charter schools would pull their kids out just before count day and they would enroll them so that they were present on count day and the funding would pour into those charter schools and then they would let them come back checking in our public schools and that kind of thing it was in the millions of dollars I know and then that's where the rock that's one of the things we need to do with lawmakers to start yeah you know and that's where the profit motivation comes into our public school dollars and that's happened I'll take two more questions and then we will end this and then we'll talk informally yes so one of the problems that seems of in facing Michigan for a while now is the brain drain yes so I think I mean my numbers might be wrong but I think between mm ten mission was the only state that actually lost population I think it's gonna last like point six percent of its population every other state Unites States grew my presumption as somebody who has seen many friends move to other major cities is that a lot of it has to do with the lack of a major urban center but I was wondering if you had any thoughts on how to address you know the brain drain which you know we have great universities but we're not keeping people that we're training so one other thing I didn't get to talk about is you know making college affordable and helping people you know anybody that is 120 thousand or less family and come out and make Community College and public colleges free of cost for them and we want to kind of continue doing that eventually my goal is to have tuition free college so we need to to make that available secondly we need to help people you know with their college dip kids are coming out with so much Khalid Aid and if they stay in Michigan then I would let them forget that they'd be forgiven over time and if they stayed in Michigan start a business create jobs in Michigan then that debt will get forgiven even faster so I have many many fans there I want to help them get into teaching profession if they become a teacher also their debt gets forgiven but eventually our kitchen should not have to come out of college with this huge debt you know that's that's really life stays with that life long time education should not be that expensive and we gotta fix that I'll take one more question and then we'll break I know it's kind of hard yeah oh yeah why not just shut it down before something does have sugar war done yeah we should no no no we need to really you know we should we should have shut it down five years ago yes you know Bill Schuette had every right to do that now what happens there is that we have an easement state of Michigan has an easement agreement with emridge an image has violated that agreement you know number of times and will surely has every right to sue them but this nest needs to be broken using a legal challenge and they need to really challenge them legally first of all I wouldn't make the deal that Snyder made recently within a we absolutely not and I will work with the attorney general and I would Attorney General doesn't work for me but I will work with them because I will be quit my mandate and what I have the support from people I would use my office to make sure the Attorney General takes action you know and there is something that governor can do about an easement this is an agreement with our state and this so so it's not just holding him accountable I mean we need to shut that down yes we just shut that down we need to stop Nestle from taking our water I don't want Michigan water to go outside of Michigan so there's lots of things we need to do and the governor can make a difference and learn that so thank you all for coming once it service from all of us here yeah

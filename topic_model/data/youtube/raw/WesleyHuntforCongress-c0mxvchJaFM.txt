ice agents and sheriffs in texas are suing the bite administration for not letting them do their jobs which includes deporting criminal illegal immigrants for breaking the law our next guest is a veteran running for congress in texas wesley hunt he joins us now wesley good morning to you what do you make of this this is as we see across the nation sheriffs and governors for that matter taking essentially the law into their own hands saying if the federal government won't enforce the law we will and now we see a lawsuit from texas sheriff saying you need to do your job what do you make of it well these are the consequences of failed leadership at the federal level and now we have to take the power back and take control in our own hands to get this right and let's just talk about the contrast and leadership that we've seen over the course of the past few weeks just a couple of days ago we saw president trump with governor abbott at the border at the crisis trying to find ways to rectify this issue and just a week ago we saw kamala harris flying to el paso and i think it was senator cruz that noted that that was 800 miles away from the crisis now that's like having a crisis in new york and then choosing to fly to chicago and that's just not leadership over the course of the past few months we've seen enough fentanyl flow into our country to kill every american four times we've had 180 000 apprehensions just last month which is the most in 21 years this is a public health issue it's a national security issue it's a public safety issue and right now the bond administration is failing us all and we've got to do something about this yeah i think you're absolutely right

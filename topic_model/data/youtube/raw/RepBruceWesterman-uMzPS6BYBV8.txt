uh thank the gentleman for yielding and also for his leadership in the western caucus and on these important issues that mean a lot to places like the fourth district of arkansas uh to all over rural america where out-of-touch policies in d.c have a a negative impact on people's daily lives and just being able to earn a living to pay their taxes and to provide the goods and services that the rest of the world needs so i appreciate you hosting this special order and for years it's been clear to rural america that our federal permitting and environmental review processes are broken while well-intentioned they are doing more harm than good the current system is complex burdensome and ineffective yet the political elite in washington dc wonders why our farmers ranchers and energy producers struggle far left special interest groups have weaponized as mr newhouse said well-intentioned laws like the national environmental policy act and the endangered specie act and they use them as clubs to bludgeon or kill critical infrastructure natural resource management and energy and minerals development projects across the united states delays in environmental regulatory systems are especially acute in 2020 the council on environmental quality showed that the average time the average time for a federal agency to complete a final environmental impact statement through the nepa process again mr newhouse quoted this number is four and a half years but that's the average number one quarter of all projects took over six years to complete peat that's more than red tape that's a roadblock that's why republicans support the builder act to streamline the nepa process and benefit communities looking to improve infrastructure investment my district like many others in the western caucus has built on the agriculture industry and i hear over and over from hard-working arkansans who are simply trying to make a living through the sludge of government regulation over-regulation and stalled regulation ensures that only the biggest businesses have the money and time to navigate the red tape and how hire the lawyers that are needed to even attempt to navigate the process this is the kind of big government that puts local small operators out of business it stamps out small business operators and honest competition in one foul swoop the message from rural america is clear government needs to get out of the way more than that government needs to be part of the solution and not part of the problem i think government's forgotten that it's the government of the people by the people and for the people and if you work for the government you work for the people it's not the other way around there is no doubt that we should be good stewards of our environment and communities but too often the free market unburdened by government is seen as the enemy of both this is simply false streamlining a permitting process shouldn't be partisan political or picking sides it can be a win for the environment the economy and our communities simultaneously we do not need to choose just one in fact a healthy environment and a strong economy go hand in hand there's some somehow we've got this idea that they're mutually exclusive and we can't have one or without the other again republicans have the solutions to cutting the red tape it's called the builder act and by so doing we can empower rural america and strengthen our nation's economy at the same time i yield back to the gentleman from washington

good afternoon and thank you for joining our covid19 teletown hall whether it's your first time joining your eighth time or somewhere in between welcome and thank you for your commitment to staying informed it's because of each of you that massachusetts has been able to slow the spread of this virus but as we have seen in so many states around the country we are a country in crisis right now 41 states are experiencing increased cases and 25 states have seen the number of covid related deaths increase in the last two weeks nationally more than 4 million people have tested positive for the virus and sadly nearly 145 000 americans have died here in massachusetts more than 114 000 people have tested positive and over 8 400 people have passed away from covet 19. each of those numbers represents a tragic loss of life and untold sorrow for families across the country and even as our state continues to contain this virus and reopen responsibly we must do so with the understanding that this virus is extremely dangerous and we all still have an important role to play in limiting its deadly spread while we remain in the throes of this pandemic nationally i'd be remiss if i didn't acknowledge the incredible progress we've made here in the commonwealth according to the governor's team the positive rate is down about 95 and the number of hospitalizations is down 85 percent since april or cover 19 continues to have a devastating economic toll on our families 25 million people remain unemployed because of the virus and we're dangerously close to the expiration of a number of vital relief measures for families across the nation without additional action by congress enhanced unemployment benefits the extra six hundred dollars per week that folks have been getting to offset the costs associated with losing their jobs or being furloughed because of this crisis will expire tomorrow the moratorium on evictions from federally assisted rental properties or homes with a federally backed mortgage expire tomorrow as well and for most families the 1200 payments received in the spring well they've been spent already to help offset the cost of everyday expenses on top of the mounting economic concerns families across this district are struggling with decisions pertaining to back to school and child care like many parents i've spent nights worrying about what this fall will bring for our college age boys and our elementary age daughters with so many questions looming there are a few things congress must prioritize funding for schools funding for our state and local governments and an expansion of the benefits families and small businesses are counting on in order to make it through these difficult times more than two months ago i voted to pass the heroes act which if signed into law will provide three trillion dollars in additional financial assistance to working families to schools to prepare for the fall and get immediate relief to all of our frontline workers specifically the heroes act provides a second round of direct cash payments of up to twelve hundred dollars per person or six thousand dollars per family an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits of an extra six hundred dollars per week through the end of the year for those who continue to be unemployed or forced back into unemployment because of service surges in covid a hundred billion dollars in rental assistance and another 75 billion in assistance for homeowners who need help paying their mortgage utility payments and property taxes 14 billion dollars for our food security programs one trillion dollars in funding to support heroes including our first responders our health care workers and essential personnel working in state and local governments our cities and towns are struggling to keep people on payroll at a time when they're providing emergency services that have been saving lives for months and 90 billion dollars in funding to be distributed to state to stabilize our k-12 schools and our colleges massachusetts would receive 1.5 billion dollars in additional funding for education through this stabilization fund after much delay the senate is finally coming to the negotiating table in the coming days and weeks we expect details of a coronavirus relief package to emerge but we need to act with urgency kids families front line workers and small businesses across our communities are depending on it now i'd love to take a moment to introduce our two incredible panelists who will join me in answering your questions about cloven 19 and what the future holds our first guest hardly needs an introduction especially if you've turned on your tv these last four months or tuned into one of our previous telephone town halls dr ashish jha is the director of the harvard global health institute and kt lee professor of global health at harvard university and in just a few weeks he will be taking over as dean of brown university school of medicine in addition to being a practicing general internist and professor of medicine at harvard medical school dr zha has also been one of the leading voices on this public health crisis i was very proud to recently welcome him to virtually brief the house education labor committee and i'm so grateful to him for taking the time out of what i know is an extremely busy schedule to join us this afternoon dr john thank you congresswoman it's a delight and a pleasure to be here so thanks for having me on oh the pleasure is ours and i'll introduce our second guest who has been doing incredible work for children in the city of lawrence cynthia paris is the superintendent of lawrence public schools and will be leading the way as the city charts its path forward for the school year this fall superintendent paris worked in the boston public school system as a speech pathologist and a principal for 17 years before being named the assistant superintendent of elementary education in newton during her time in boston superintendent paris served as the turnaround principal of william blackstone innovation elementary school where she spearheaded efforts to transform the chronically underperforming school she has been especially busy since the start of this public health crisis getting students in lawrence through the end of the last school year and over the past few weeks she has been working per the space guidance to create three different plans for a return to school this fall i know how incredibly valuable your time is uh cynthia so thank you again for joining us um welcome thank you it's my pleasure to be here today so our first question uh is from william b of townsend and oh i i don't know why the first question always comes to me because i feel like i've done so much of the talking already but william b from townsend asked this will you propose to extend the stimulus to the unemployed beyond next week people are just left out on the street the unemployment rate is still over 20 help uh and a companion question to williams what's the status of congress's extension of 600 for unemployment insurance that comes from james b and hudson well william and james i want to thank you both for submitting these important questions just because our state economy is moving into a phase to reopen it does not mean that we are out of the woods with enhanced unemployment benefits running out for millions of americans at the end of this month congress is pressed uh to act swiftly we're gearing up for a fight or a negotiation there's been a lot of back and forth about whether to extend the boosted unemployment insurance provision in the upcoming release package as you know in the cares act the coronavirus package that we passed in late march we included a 600 per week boost to unemployment benefits which helped millions of workers including gig workers and contractors who were laid off or furloughed across the country new york our country is facing historic long-term economic damage from the uh from covet 19. families are afraid of being evicted they're worried about feeding their kids and i refuse to roll the dice on their lives so unemployment benefits serve as a lifeline and i absolutely support the extension of supplemental unemployment benefits and will continue doing so to prevent these economic consequences from becoming permanent i expected a minimum some form of expanded unemployment insurance to appear in the next relief package which we're in dc right now as we speak working on that uh and just know that i'll be advocating for a robust enhanced ui uh that will keep our families afloat during this difficult time okay dr this one is for you and it's from richard d he writes is it possible to have enough rapid testing in place when schools open in september there will be a huge demand to keep these kids safe it's a great question um and you know testing is an area where i think massachusetts has been doing a very good job of kind of continuing to ramp up just in the last couple of weeks we've seen an additional sort of 30 to 40 percent increase in testing and we're doing about 10 to 12 000 tests a day in the commonwealth um the question is will we have enough for schools this fall and and you really need rapid tests right because you can't have one test where it takes five or seven days to turn around because that's pretty useless what i have increasingly come to believe is that we do need rapid tests we need them available and we probably have to go to other testing modalities and and so right now without getting too scientific on people here the main test we use is what's called a pcr test that's really getting strained across the commonwealth and across the country and while we can ramp that up a little bit more we need these kind of antigen-based tests these swabs other things that are coming online but one of the things that we really need is both the state government really ultimately the federal government to help increase the production of these things so they become much more widely available much more quickly i think that will help in making schools safer until that time i think schools are going to have to rely on the current pcr technology and i'm not convinced that we're going to have enough testing available for everybody as much as we need it based on that old technology so i'm hoping we can get some new technology to bail us out on this well thank you dr zha and uh and you know we've been working hard in terms of uh putting in place [Music] the assurance that we will have the manufacturing capability uh and the uh to produce everything from ppe to rapid testing to what we hope will be a vaccine i i know i've talked about this on calls in the past and you've heard me talk about the pandemic production act but basically having a um a robust federal public-private partnership just like we do with our national defense so that we can bring those manufacturing jobs uh back home uh to the united states uh not become so reliant on a foreign supply chain and have control over the ramp that we need to achieve to get testing kits to get guns masks gloves all the things that we ran short of back in the spring okay superintendent paris the mass department of education and secondary education have introduced guidelines for the fall what are these guidelines what do they look like ask charlie c from dragon yeah great question so the guidelines were released to the districts about a month ago and they really clearly state that the goal for districts in massachusetts is for a safe return for as many students as possible in person it does ask us to design three different plans keeping in mind all the safety and health protocols that are in place and so those three plans include a plan for continued remote learning a plan for full in person and then what we call a hybrid which is a combination of those things and so districts are working really hard we're working really hard in lawrence to gather feedback from our stakeholders of course our families our staff members and community to get a sense of when we design these plans what is the data needed in order to accommodate one of these plans and so that's exactly what we're doing designing for remote learning continuing robust remote learning designing for having students back in our buildings safely and an example of what that will look like in lawrence is that we are what we call pressure testing classrooms so if you can envision a classroom of about 600 square feet that's the average and we have about 25 desks if we pull them apart between three and six feet that's sort of what we call pressure testing and so we get to see what's the capacity in that model and in the model of remote learning is exactly what we have experienced to the extent that we would make it more robust and then of course the traditional model would be just in full with um the students as we mentioned the hybrid model would be a combination of those two oh terrific that's uh that is great you know my daughters attend public schools uh in westford and i've i filled out my survey to provide uh thank you we appreciate that yes you know you have to fill out your census to them you have to fill out your that's right that's right that's right the so the next question is for me it's from david b and he asks the president has redirected the hospital's reporting of daily coronavirus results from the cdc to the white house since science and the accurate reporting of facts is not a strength of the white house by what authority can he do this and what is congress doing to stop this potential manipulation of clinical data and to return control of reporting public health issues back to the public health department well david is paying attention thank you for the question you're right i would agree science and transparency have not been strong suits of this white house and it is incredibly concerning that this administration would order hospitals to change how they report uh covet 19 data to the government bypassing the cdc in the midst of this pandemic house democrats and members of the oversight committee immediately responded called upon the administration to reverse that decision and restored the data collection role back to the cdc uh so that it would just be free from any political interference and following that outcry the administration restored public access to the coronavirus data reported by hospitals on monday the data went live i found a new system called hhs protect which is run by a private contractor called teletracking and this contractor was awarded a 10 million dollar contract in april according to the administration uh this change was necessary because senior officials thought that the cdc system was too slow uh or are unable to keep up with the constantly changing information about the virus but this move is uh it's it's it's nothing short of political we know because the president has um tried on multiple occasions to undermine the cdc's expertise and has defied their fact driven public health guidance so there are still open questions as to whether this data will be kept safe and continue to stay available to the public and like you i believe that we must hold the administration accountable and and put a stop to any sort of manipulation which we're all going to be tracking or continuing to work on this issue to just make sure that there's no foul play i don't think i have to tell anybody on this call because i think you all tune in to hear from experts like dr ja and superintendent paris but during a pandemic the last thing we need is to cause greater confusion um uh with you know misinformation uh especially uh among our you know states where they're relying on this data and the tracking of this data and our hospitals so thank you again david we're on this and i appreciate your your question okay jacques baja this next one is for you it's from joseph uh c and acton and he asks what is the health industry's best estimate about whether they can produce a reliable vaccine and if they can when might when might it be commercially available yes joseph asks the big question that we all want to know the answer to i think i bet you haven't gotten that one before not in the last hour congressman i think i've gotten a good outcome no it's the big question look it's it's really important it is it is that light that we need to know at the end of the tunnel so let me start off with some really good news which is we had two clinical trials out this week um both published in the lancet one from the oxford astrazeneca vaccine another one from the cansano vaccine in china both of them basically using similar technologies um but both of them showed a really robust immune response in what was essentially a phase 2 trial and that's my kind of a little bit of medical speak saying it's early trials we it's not the kind of data that we can use to be confident we're going to have a safe and effective vaccine but it's really encouraging early information what we found in both of these vaccines was it elicited a strong immune response and i have to say i was just very pleased as i went through the data so on to big trials the astrazeneca trial is going to be at least 30 000 people the moderna is doing a trial probably 30 to 50 000 people and we need to let the trials run long enough for safety data we want to make sure that the vaccines are safe because in my mind the question is when will i feel comfortable getting my children and my elderly parents vaccinated and i want to see enough safety data to get there and my best guess this is a guess but my best guess is that we will have safety data and we'll have efficacy data on whether the vaccine actually works or not probably near the end of this calendar year could it be november it's possible october november but i think it's more likely like december but again we're just guessing here um the one of the things that the federal government has done actually quite well and you know i feel like i criticize them for all their mishaps i should praise them when they're doing something well is a pro program called operation warp speed overseen by not surprisingly tony fauci so dr fauci has been overseeing operation warp speed which is getting production of these vaccines going even before we have a final answer so that if it turns out that the vaccines really work they become available so i'll put all of that together and my guess is that we're going to see frontline workers doctors nurses ambulance drivers others emts probably by the end of this year they'll start getting some of these vaccines and i think a lot of other folks february march april there's a lot that goes on between just finding that the vaccine works producing it safely making sure that each vaccine is high quality we want to get it right and even though we're all in a rush we don't want to cut corners in a way that will leave people exposed to an unsafe product i'm confident we'll get there but it will get us at least into 2021 and probably the you know late first quarter early second quarter well that is a reason to be optimistic uh and you know we've we've been getting briefed a lot on operation warp speed and there's no question that we've put significant resources uh behind that program uh so that we can get a a safe uh and scalable vaccine as quickly as possible uh so thank you for that i think i've ever you just uh you just sort of gave uh some confidence and optimism to everyone who is uh listening in uh so um cynthia what are the biggest concerns you were hearing from parents uh and what are your concerns uh this is a question from catherine f in hazel yeah we we um you know in conversations with our families what we've learned is that kids miss each other you know they miss their teachers they miss their community so that sense of connection is really we're having this deep longing for being together again as a community and so that concerns is social emotional the way i think about it right that concerns me because schools are the place where we build community and we haven't been together for months now so how do you support students and families and staff to reconnect during you know still a pretty risky time and what comes first right for us it's really important to reconnect us as a community and to support our social emotional needs and at the same time address the academics so i think families would agree that getting back to school is important for those reasons for the human connection that students need to be with each other and to be with the adults that care about them i also deeply believe that i believe that well that's that's that's what we're in the business of to creating these communities so that is a huge concern of us how do we continue to support each other and while also maintaining the academic piece terrific and you know what you opened with is uh it's so resonant uh you know i've got six and ten-year-old daughters and uh kids are missing each other and you know i am uh often in the committee on education and labor uh you know just fighting for and making sure that we are protecting our teachers and our workers and our students uh but you know we um i think everyone is hopeful uh that we're going to find a way we're going to be exhaustive in our creativity and our innovation on how we can do that and and sort of bring our our students and our and our teachers you know back together because that is uh it's definitely being craved in my uh household and i see those i just see the effects of it um on you know my my um like my children sort of emotions so uh thank you for that answer it's that it's so important to so many of us uh the next question is for me and it's it's linked to what we were just talking about how will parents be expected to go back to work if school-age children are either not in school uh full-time or they're sent home to learn remotely uh if and when covid returns that's from johnny s and carlisle so hi johnny i want to thank you for your question this very question is on the mind of every parent with a young child as our economies and our workplaces reopen like many of you during these times you know i've transitioned to remote work while juggling the demands of family life and i'll i'll tell you it's no easy task being both a mom to the two young girls who are in elementary school and a legislator but i'm i'm fortunate to have help uh from you know my husband my friends and some family members but that's just not the case for so many working families which is why it's incredibly important for us to invest in quality and affordable child care you know even before this pandemic families and child care providers were operating on razor thin margins and the situation has grown even more dire that's why next week while i'm here in washington we'll be considering uh the child cares essential act which would create a 50 billion dollar child care stabilization fund within the existing child care and development block grant block grant program and the child care for economic recovery act which through federal investments and tax subsidies would expand the availability of quality child care and help workers return to their jobs safely and with that peace of mind that their child is safe and cared for too both pieces of legislation are critical to enabling our recovery and also us getting through this the rest of this year uh but frankly child care is an essential public good and it is central to our economy it is it is taking us it has taken us far too long to treat it as such but i do think one of the benefits that we have with electing uh more women to this institution is that everyone understands how critical child care is to our economy that buzzer in the background i wish i could turn off i unfortunately can't because i have to vote uh soon but we're going to get to the next question trust me they allow us plenty of time now so that we can enter the house floor and still be socially distant from each other so we have time for a few more questions and this one is for dr ja it is earl p uh uh it's from earl p and methuen he asks is it possible that one's immune system can prevent covid19 so earl it's a good question and i'm assuming you mean it's for somebody who has not been previously infected so let me take on kind of both parts of it by the way right now based on the best evidence we have we do think if you've been infected and recovered uh that you really should not be able to get reinfected most people won't and we obviously don't know how long that immunity lasts we've only known about this virus for six months but i suspect that it will give you enough protection for at least some period of time i i think earl you may be getting at a different issue which some people have kind of brought around which is the idea that maybe there's a bunch of natural immunity to this virus maybe from cross-reactivity to common cold viruses that can also be coronaviruses this is an idea that has been thrown around but i have not seen any evidence that uh that this is the case nor am i particularly hopeful i mean it'd be great if a lot of people had natural immunity but we just haven't seen the kind of data that would suggest that it's widespread so a science-based answer is we don't really know yet and people are looking into it but based on the data i have seen so far i doubt that very many people have natural immunity to this virus i think most of us are likely susceptible okay thank you um cynthia uh this one is for you so you describe the three scenarios that you're currently planning for uh but can you give us some insight in terms of what you're imagining schools will look like on day one uh you describe sort of the classroom um but you know overall uh throughout the school on the bus and how will that change when covid returns that's a question from david g in boxborough thanks david for your question yes so we are definitely envisioning that if you can if you can just picture a bunch of first graders and high schoolers and you know across the levels kids coming in with their mask kids being asked to wash their hands when they first enter the building deaths between three and six feet apart depending on the size of the classroom and then being very restricted to that space to minimize risk of infection if you can imagine the teacher in front of her students again with the proper ppe carrying on with instruction right you can imagine and we can envision on the first day that kids are going to need things like recess and we'll accommodate that in a way that's safe it's specifically now that the weather is still good for being outside if you can envision us making adjustments for snack time bringing lunch into the classroom versus going into the cafeteria and then with respect to the buses you know the current guidelines us at having kids in every other seat and that's like one student two students per seat so those are things that we're still working out with our partners and our organizations that we work with but it'll be a very dramatic new place very dramatic new place because what we do at the beginning of school is what i had mentioned earlier is we connect with each other and what that looks like is a lot of hugging a lot of hand holding a lot of high fives and so school will start without that school will be a very very different field this year and in addition we're also envisioning that there will be points if and when we have surges that we will return to remote learning and what that means is that we will experience we'll have a similar experience that we had this late spring summer which is students will be back in front of their chromebooks or their laptops and teachers will be on platforms like zoom and google classrooms back to instructing students but it'll it'll feel different you know just the simple fact that we're not going to be able to hug students on the return and off the buses and high fives and all those things that we love about the beginning of school it'll feel and look very different well thank you for painting that picture i stuck with you through all of it uh and as like as a result i'll be able to sort of set expectations uh with my with my own girls uh so i really appreciate that um okay we have we have um i think we have time for two more questions and they're not going to be to me because i want to take full advantage of our expert panel so dr on um sort of following on to that last question what do we know about the exposure of children to the virus how likely is it for a toddler an infant to contract or carry the virus to potential guidelines not mandating mass for k or kindergarten and first graders put teachers uh and students at risk i'm thinking about this for my own kids at school and while we look at reopening and that's from julie b in chelmsford yeah so it's a great question and i'll tell you where we are on the on the science of this so uh there have been a lot of studies that have tried to assess uh you know do kids well a couple of things what we know is that kids are less likely to get super sick but the studies that try to assess are less are kids less likely to get infected we think the answer is probably not i think we get they're just as susceptible to getting infected they just don't get very sick when they get affected then the second question is are they do they transmit the virus as efficiently as adults and that's really important as you get kids back into school is that if they become super efficient transmitters and we're going to have a problem and there are a lot of studies out there but i'll give you my best read of the literature including a really nice high quality study done out of south korea that came out this past weekend i think the overwhelming evidence right now is that kids 10 or younger both of the congresswoman's children for instance and one of mine so younger kids do seem to transmit the virus a lot less efficiently um and that's really good news what the data seems to suggest is older kids high schoolers um probably transmit the virus as efficiently as adults that doesn't it's not surprising right like they're physically like adults mentally may not quite be like adults yet but from a physical point of view they're like adults and that in my mind means we should probably think about k to five differently than the way we think about high school in terms of risk and i have been pushing and i have an op-ed this week in the boston globe about why it's so important to get kids back in and what we need to do to get kids back in safely is that we should have a lower threshold for getting k-5 back in in person and maybe deal with a bit more time of high schoolers trying to do stuff through zoom it's not great and i'd like to get everybody back in but based on the evidence i think we can get most kids back to school in the commonwealth this fall and we should really try to get all the k to five back in it's really important for the kids um good for parents too but but particularly important for the kids so so that's great and thank you for sharing that uh study with us uh because you know in a at a time when they're i don't get to pass on a lot of good news to my uh young ones um i'm eager to facetime them tonight and share this with them it's not so great for our college age boys but uh they're used to um acting like a adult so it won't be a surprise and the last question for you uh cynthia um what did we learn from the spring uh in terms of best practices for remote learning it was such an adjustment for so many of our our students but i'm sure you've been wringing out the lessons this summer that's a question from alicia jay in carlisle thanks alicia for that question yeah you know what we learned is that the resiliency of our kids and families is is enormous and we can't take that for granted and then with respect to the academics what we learned is that kids continue to prefer to have a grown-up in front of them who touches who has touch points what we call touch points with them at least once or twice a week in addition to that zoom or that platform whatever platform they're using right and so it's also true for the families you know i appreciate it when i got a call or email from my teachers and so those two things were really important moving forward that we still are able to make a personal phone call or send an email and that when we do engage in the platforms that there is not just recordings or lessons sent that it's both synchronous and asynchronous opportunities that our students are experiencing as an example of that we learned that our younger kids we when we dropped off physical education sort of care packages what we called like jump ropes and balls and hula hoops those combined with the teacher in front of them right the hands-on things were highly engaging so younger kids meet both our older adults can hand our older students can handle a little bit more independent work but still need a lot of feedback and guidance and structure and those are good lessons for us as we plan for more robust remote learning in the future but i think overall we know that face-to-face instruction is best followed by a combination of synchronous and asynchronous uh instruction but that actually makes perfect sense uh so unfortunately that is all the time that we have for today uh i'd like to thank dr and superintendent paris again for sharing so much important information with us we are so grateful for your time and the expertise that you bring to this discussion and i know that everyone who tuned in uh appreciates you too uh and i want to thank everyone who dialed in uh staying informed by experts is great preparation for the road ahead so for an easy way to stay updated on uh federal and state response to clover19 as well as information on future teletown halls and events please follow us on instagram facebook and twitter at rep lori trahan you can also visit our website which is trahan.house.gov kerbin19 for resources that are important to your family or your small business finally and i can't say it enough we all have a job to do uh for our communities and most importantly for our schools to begin reopening uh our small businesses who want us to come back and shop and dine but we must continue to be vigilant in reducing the spread of this virus and we do that by wearing a mask and by maintaining social distance and washing our hands uh staying home when we can so with that i want to thank you all again uh please stay safe stay healthy and we'll talk again soon

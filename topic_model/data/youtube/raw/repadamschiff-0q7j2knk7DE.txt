  THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO  INVESTIGATE THE ATTACK ON THE  UNITED STATES CAPITOL. LEADING OFF OUR DISCUSSION  TONIGHT IS ADAM SCHIFF, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE AND A MEMBER OF THE  HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATING THE ATTACK ON THE  CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6. CHAIRMAN SCHIFF, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. WAS THIS SET OF SUBPOENAS ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE THE RESULT OF  THE UNANIMOUS VOTE OR AGREEMENT  OF THE COMMITTEE TO DO THIS? >> OUR COMMITTEE HAS BEEN  UNANIMOUS REALLY ON ALL THE  STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN. THERE IS A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF  COMMONALITY IN TERMS OF WANTING  TO GET TO THE TRUTH, BEING READY TO USE WHATEVER TOOLS, TACTICS,  TECHNIQUES WE HAVE TO GET TO THE TRUTH THERE IS A COMMON  ACCEPTANCE OF THE FACT THAT NO  ONE IS BEYOND THE LIMITS OF OUR  INVESTIGATION IF THEY HAVE  RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT  JANUARY 6, AND WE'RE NOT FOOLING AROUND. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WASTE TIME. SO YOU SEE THESE SUBPOENAS GOING OUT TO FOUR KEY PLAYERS THAT  BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW TO DATE  HAVE VERY RELEVANT INFORMATION  ABOUT THE RUN-UP TO JANUARY 6  AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DAY OF  THAT BLOODY INSURRECTION. >> WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO  DONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT THEY  ARE GOING TO FIGHT THESE  SUBPOENAS ON EXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE? >> WELL, IT'S MORE OF THE SAME  THAT WE SAW FOR FOUR YEARS WHEN  HE SAID THEY WERE GOING TO  STONEWALL ALL SUBPOENAS. IT WOULD BE AGAINST TYPE TO  EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE OF THE  FORMER PRESIDENT. BUT, DOWN, I THINK, LOOK, IT'S  AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS BELIEF  OF HIS OWN GUILT AND HIS DESIRE  TO HIDE WHAT HE WAS DOING ON THE 5th, WHAT HE WAS DOING ON THE  6th. HE DOESN'T WANT THE COUNTRY TO  KNOW. BUT THEN WE KNEW THIS ALREADY,  BECAUSE OF COURSE HE INTERVENED  TO TRY TO SHUT DOWN EFFORTS IN  THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO  ESTABLISH A JANUARY 6  COMMISSION. AND HE SUCCEEDED. MITCH McCONNELL DID HIS DIRTY  WORK, BUT SPEAKER PELOSI  APPOINTED THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. IT'S BIPARTISAN, AND WE GO  FORWARD AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO  LET THE FORMER PRESIDENT STAND  IN OUR WAY. >> DOES THE COMMITTEE HAVE A  STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH WHAT  COULD BE AT MINIMUM A VERY, VERY LONG PROCEDURAL DELAY IMPOSED BY DONALD TRUMP FIGHTING ON  EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE A LEGAL  FIGHT THAT HE MAY LOSE, BUT  COULD TAKE IN AS WE'VE SEEN IN  THE PAST LITERALLY YEARS GOING  THROUGH APPEALS COURTS? >> WELL, WE'VE BEEN STRATEGIZING WITH THE GENERAL COUNSEL, THE  HOUSE GENERAL COUNSEL ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE MEET  OPPOSITION, AND WE HAVE TO  EXPECT THAT WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE SUBPOENAS WE ISSUE, THERE ARE GOING TO BE PARTIES THAT  RESIST. AND SO WE'LL MOVE AS  EXPEDITIOUSLY AS WE CAN. WE'LL MOVE IN COURT IF  NECESSARY. WE DO HAVE TOOLS THAT WE DIDN'T  HAVE IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION  IN THAT WE CAN ALSO HOLD PEOPLE  IN CRIMINAL CONTEMPT AND MAKE A  REFERRAL TO THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT. NOW DURING THE TRUMP YEARS WHEN  YOU HAD PEOPLE LIKE BILL BARR  RUNNING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,  HE WASN'T ABOUT TO ENFORCE THE  LAW AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, EVEN WHEN PEOPLE  WERE VIOLATING THE LAW. BILL BARR WOULD DO ANYTHING  ESSENTIALLY UP UNTIL THE VERY  END APPARENTLY THAT THE  PRESIDENT WANTED. BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY  DIFFERENT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, A  VERY DIFFERENT ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND SO THERE ARE METHODS OF  ENFORCEMENT WE DIDN'T HAVE  BEFORE. >> KEVIN McCARTHY HAS COMMENTED  ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION, SAYING  THE ONLY QUESTIONS THAT MATTER  ARE WHY WAS THE CAPITOL SO --  LEFT SO ILL-PREPARED? AND HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT  THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN? KEVIN McCARTHY IS SAYING THAT  YOU ARE NOT INVESTIGATING THE  QUESTION OF HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. >> WELL, OF COURSE WE ARE. ONE OF THE CENTRAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR COMMITTEE IS TO WRITE A  COMPREHENSIVE REPORT WITH  RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE  PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING  AGAIN. BUT MR. McCARTHY DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK INTO HOW THIS CAME ABOUT TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE HE PLAYED A  ROLE IN THAT, AND WE WANT TO  FIND OUT JUST WHAT THAT ROLE  WAS. WE KNOW HIS EFFORTS TO DECERTIFY THE ELECTION, BUT WE DON'T KNOW  A LOT ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS  THAT HE HAD WITH THE FORMER  PRESIDENT OR WITH OTHERS IN THE  LEAD-UP TO JANUARY 6 OR ON THAT  DAY. BUT WE CAN SEE THROUGH HIS  ACTIONS AND HIS WORDS THAT HE  DOESN'T WANT US TO GET TO THE  BOTTOM OF IT. BUT WE WILL. AND WE WILL TAKE A VERY BROAD  VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE  PROPAGATION OF THE BIG LIE AND  THE ROLE THAT PLAYED IN THE  INSURRECTION. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE WAY  MEADOWS AND OTHERS REPORTEDLY  TRIED TO GET THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT TO PRESS STATES LIKE  GEORGIA TO APPOINT A BOGUS  SLATES OF ELECTORS. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO ALL OF  THIS. AND TO DO LESS I THINK DOES A  DISSERVICE TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. >> WILL THERE BE ANOTHER WAVE OF SUBPOENAS COMING BEFORE YOU  COMPLETE THE WORK ON THESE  SUBPOENAS OR WILL SUBPOENAS  FOLLOW WHAT YOU GET FROM  DEPOSITIONS FROM THESE  WITNESSES? >> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE A  SPECIFIC ANSWER YET IN TERMS OF  WHEN THE NEXT SUBPOENAS WILL GO  OUT, BUT I THINK THEY'LL GO OUT  WHEN WE'RE READY. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO SEQUENCE THAT WE NEED TO HOLD THE DEPOSITIONS OF THESE  WITNESSES BEFORE WE CAN DO MORE. I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE  DOING INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE COOPERATIVE. SOME OF THOSE MAY BE VERY MUCH  IN THE PUBLIC VIEW, AND MANY  WON'T BE. WE WILL BE WORKING ALONG  CONTEMPORANEOUS LINES OF  INVESTIGATION AS WE GET  DOCUMENTS AS WE IDENTIFY  WITNESSES NOW THAT WE HAVE  STAFFED UP AND HAVE MUCH GREATER CAPACITY, WE'LL BE MOVING ALONG  PARALLEL TRACKS. SO WE'RE GOING MOVE QUICKLY. WE REALIZE THERE IS URGENCY HERE BOTH IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THE  COUNTRY, BUT ALSO MAKING SURE  THAT WE GET THESE ANSWERS AND WE GET THEM WITHOUT ALLOWING THE  KIND OF DELAY WE DID DURING THE  RUSSIAN AND UKRAINE  INVESTIGATIONS. >> CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF, THANK

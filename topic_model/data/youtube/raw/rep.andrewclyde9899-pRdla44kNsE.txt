I introduced hres 1479 after learning of records that show U.S Postal Service inspectors targeted Americans for advocating for conservative causes I would like to request unanimous consent to submit for the record an article from the Washington Times from September 22nd 2022 titled the Postal Service surveilled protesters with pro-gun and anti-biden agendas without objection thank you ma'am the article also outlines how it was not just conservatives being surveilled but also people preparing to demonstrate against the police after the shooting of Brianna Taylor that were also being surveilled my question is what does that have to do with the United States Postal Service most Americans are not even aware that the organization that delivers their mail also runs a surveillance operation called the United States Postal Inspection Services internet covert operations program also known as icop that tracks and collects Americans social media posts the Postal Service office of Inspector General launched an investigation into the icot program at the request of this very committee and I must say that it was at the request of the top Democrat and Republican so thank you madam chair for working with us on that and with that precedent of working together I hope that we can all agree to favorably report this to the House of Representatives for consideration the resulting report clearly stated that the postal inspector's surveillance overstepped its lawful law enforcement Authority and I quote we determined that certain proactive searches that's proactive searches icop conducted using an open source intelligence tool from February to April 2021 exceeded the postal Inspection Services law enforcement Authority furthermore we could not corroborate whether other work analysts completed from October 2018 through June 2021 was legally authorized it is very disturbing that in over eight months since this report initially came out Democrats have not requested more information or even had a hearing on this matter this is the oversight committee how much money has the Postal Service squandered on this program this icot program we know the U.S Postal Service is in financial difficulty we have certainly had hearings on that we are the committee charged with oversight of the federal government specifically the U.S Postal Service and the Democrat majority has yet to fulfill that Duty why would any of my Democrat colleagues oppose this Roi I hope they don't I hope that you will work with us on this my Roi simply requests documents about the internet covert operation programs monitoring of program pro-life or conservative groups what are in these documents that Democrats refuse to allow Americans to see I hope nothing I hope that that we get every document we need answers and we need them now the United States Postal Service should not be abusing its power with the program more fitting for a police state than the United States furthermore it should not be targeting Americans because they believe in the constitutional right to bear arms or because they disagree with the president I urge all my colleagues from from both sides of the aisle to support my resolution because it protects all of our constitutional rights especially our first amendment rights

the aftermath of the 2016 flood many of you were affected by this crazy policy called duplication of benefits where some bonehead in the administration said that if you got a loan that you couldn't get a grant calling them duplicative of one another we were able to change the law back in 2018 that fixed the problem for about 80 of you because another bonehead decided that they were going to put income requirements on this we committed to you that we were going to continue fighting for that remaining 20 the good news is the house of representatives just passed our amendment that will help to restore that last remaining 20 percent of you that continue to be duplication of benefits victims we told you we were going to keep this fight up the house of representatives just passed our amendment and so we're certainly on our way to solving this problem for all of you

the senator from Connecticut thank you madam president I want to thank the senator from Washington State for her leadership on this issue and for her eloquent remarks just now as well as other senators who have championed this causes i have over years when we have fought rising gasoline prices in the state of connecticut relentlessly and tirelessly and now rise here in support of legislation the close the big oil tax loopholes act which would fundamentally restore fairness to our markets and tax system over the last decade the big five oil companies taken home about a trillion dollars in profits while enjoying tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies and giveaways and sweetheart deals and preferences which undermine the credibility of our tax system and our economy in the eyes of ordinary Americans ordinary Americans in fact are still struggling to make ends meet to stay in their homes to keep their families together to find jobs and in Connecticut the price of gasoline now has risen to more than four dollars and twenty-five cents a gallon from about three dollars just a year ago there are a number of ways to combat that spiraling cost of gasoline including going after some of the illegal manipulation and speculation that may be occurring I propose some measures for example a department just investigation that would for the first time effectively and comprehensively pursue the traders and hedge funds that are at an all-time high in their energy positions but the ending of giveaways and subsidies is about the fairness of our economic system and our tax code our families and businesses in Connecticut are paying these higher cost of gasoline but at the same time providing subsidies that are in no way needed for exploration or refining or any part of the business of these big five oil companies they have made over 30 billion dollars in profits in the first quarter of this year alone representing a fifty percent increase in profit from the last year Big Oil doesn't need help from American taxpayers to make unprecedented profits for better or worse they know how to do it without corporate welfare and we ought to n corporate welfare that makes our job of cutting the deficit and reining in the debt and reducing the size of government all the more difficult this call ought to be an easy one we have difficult choices ahead in cutting spending and perhaps increasing revenue this one should be easy for us and I hope that it will attract bipartisan support because there is truly nothing partisan about this kind of corporate welfare despite claims the contrary ending these subsidies will not increase prices at the pump it will impose basic fairness because Americans will no longer pay out of our pockets for these tax breaks and giveaways to some of the most profitable companies in the world but it will not add to prices at the pump in my home state of Connecticut and across the country people are rightly concerned about reducing our debt and deficit and we will make those difficult choices just as Americans are making difficult choices in tightening their belts and their budget as they struggle to find jobs and make ends meet but as resources remain scarce for some of our most vital program we can ill afford this kind of corporate welfare and I urge my colleagues to seize this moment cut these subsidies protect the hard-earned dollars of American taxpayers taxpayers in Connecticut and throughout the country who basically want fairness shared sacrifice truly shared sacrifice and I urge my colleagues to demonstrate to the American people that we are serious about tackling unfair giveaways and to take this step toward restoring fairness Thank You mr. president

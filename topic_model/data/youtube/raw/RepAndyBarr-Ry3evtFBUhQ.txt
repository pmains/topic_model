this is covet 19 after the lockdown and we are joined on the program by sixth district congressman andy barr uh congressman i appreciate your time thank you very much you know when this pandemic hit us uh last march informally although we've been around for a little bit while we we weren't really prepared for the pandemic how much have we learned in last year and how prepared are we if something like this comes along again well good to be on your show larry thanks so much and i think we have learned uh quite a bit i think it's a mixed bag whether or not we're ready for uh this in the future and i say mix bag because obviously we've learned a lot we've learned that our strategic national stockpile was inadequate from a standpoint of personal protective equipment we learned that our manufacturing base here at home was totally inadequate that we were over dependent on asia and in particular china for personal protective equipment not only did the communist chinese party cover up the origins of the pandemic but then they weaponized the supply chain against us in terms of medical equipment pharmaceuticals and the like we we've learned from that i believe and and there are a variety of bipartisan bills in the congress to strengthen our domestic supply uh chain and our domestic manufacturing capability i hope we learn from that and we have some of the legislation to improve the situation on that front i do worry and i say it's a mixed bag because i do worry that that we haven't learned uh you know when when the secretary of state goes to anchorage and on our own soil allows the top member of the poll bureau of the chinese communists to lecture us on how bad america is when it was the chinese communist party that that was responsible for and covered up this pandemic i don't think we've learned a lot when the president of the united states yesterday uh when asked whether or not he has raised the issue of the origins of the pandemic to uh the culprit the president president xi of china he said he hasn't even done it that's like priority number one priority number one would be to confront the chinese communist party and and and then the president rejoins the world health organization with no reforms whatsoever reversing president trump's decision to pull out of the world health organization uh a co-conspirator in the cover-up of coven 19. so in some respects i think we've learned um in other respects we have not there were some things that we did very very well in response to pandemic operation warp speed for example and the paycheck protection program which is really a lifeline other other areas we just totally failed overzealous lockdowns and unemployment insurance that was mismanaged at the state level and and and just simply uh uh encourage people to not go back to work so some things we did well income did not do well congressman i mean that's now i want to talk to you about the supply chain i mean that was one of the concerns early on um you talked about some of things we've done well some things we have not really learned i mean are we still overly reliant on international markets for health health care supply chains medicines uh uh ingredients to create medicine and and in is there is there any motivation in washington d.c to correct that yes we are still over relent and it's not just a medical supplies it's other parts of our industrial base that we're over reliant i mean look at critical minerals you know uh most of all of the the rare earth elements and and critical minerals that actually go into our weapon systems that are procured by the department of defense for you know the f-35 and other sensitive weapon systems in our military we source that from of all places china and part of the problem is that we don't have a streamlined permitting process for mining here in the united states that has got to change that's why i introduced legislation as part of the china task force to decrease our dependence on rare earth elements critical minerals you know we don't use coal for energy as much anymore but we could use our coal miners to help our defense posture relative to china by decreasing our dependence on rare developments there's a lot of rare earth elements critical minerals that go into our national security uh that come from coal and we need to think about that so and all the way around we've got a lot of work to do on that and pharmaceuticals and medical equipment we're talking with congressman andy barr here in the sixth district uh last segment we're talking about vaccine hesitancy and the importance of the vaccine to reach hurt immunity which i think is is something we should all be striving for do you would you believe that that there's been the messaging around the vaccines and that's causing distrust among the people because there are you know 20 25 of americans out there maybe maybe even higher according to some studies that are hesitant or are reluctant to trust that the vaccine is safe or or that uh it's it's you know it's the right approach towards reaching herd immunity do you believe a lot of that mistrust is due to conflicting messages being being passed along by health officials um you know president trump president biden both administrations do you believe that that's that's been a problem i do believe it's been a problem i believe and and voted for operation warp speed which was a historic unprecedented initiative to drive development and distribution of safe and effective affected vaccines i believe in it because i voted for it i voted for it um 13 billion dollars that expedited the development and cut red tape at the fda i took my vaccines my pfizer vaccines for in january and uh we we need to the american people need to understand whoever is to blame for this there's probably blame to go around uh that americans can can trust on the reliability of the safety and the efficacy of these vaccines you know it's amazing that because of operation war speed and and really i do have to credit president trump and his administration secretary azar and the congress in a bipartisan way for supporting operation warp speed which which made uh multiple safe and effective vaccines available for distribution in early 2021 you know in a manner that was five times faster than any previous vaccine it was really a historic feat in medical innovation and uh we do need we do need people to adopt it and take it take it up i i i do think in the early days there was criticism of the trump's trump administration's response to cobit and so you may have had some people um not trust unfortunately not trust of the vaccine safety and epic efficacy that was wrong dr fauci said it was wrong who was no necessarily a fan of president trump at the same time we hear that republicans now are more reluctant to take the vaccine that doesn't make sense either in fact it was a cr really a credit to the trump administration to roll these vaccines out by that started on third base and you know we we supported 48 billion dollars in the year in covert relief package 48 billion for vaccine distribution so we need the american people of all political stripes and of all backgrounds to recognize that we need uh uptake of the vaccine in order to achieve that immunity and get past this terrible virus that originated from china congressman barr we're out of time it's gone quickly i appreciate the time though thank you very much and i know we'll catch up uh in the near future and we'll talk about some of these issues and a little bit more of a long-form interview but i appreciate the time thank you thanks larry

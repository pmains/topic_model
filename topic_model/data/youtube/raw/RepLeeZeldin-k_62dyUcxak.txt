at the desk Zelda number 16 the clerk will designate the amendment amendment number 9 printed in House report number 115 you - 786 offered by mr. Zeldin of New York pursuant to House Resolution 965 of the gentleman from New York mr. Zeldin and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York Thank You mr. chairman my amendment to HR 200 will provide needed regulatory relief to fishermen from the east end of Long Island in the entire region who are struggling under confusing and arbitrary federal restrictions on striped bass fishing in the Block Island Sound the unique maritime geography of our region means that making the 15 mile journey by boat from Montauk Point New York to Block Island Rhode Island requires passing through a segment of waters considered to be part of the easy known as the block island transit zone for recreational anglers charter boat captains and commercial fishermen this shifting jurisdiction can mean the difference between a nice day on the water and committing a federal offense my amendment would permanently restore the right to fish for striped bass in this waterway and in decades of confusion and arbitrary punishment for local fishermen these are hardworking men and women who run small businesses either on the commercial charter or recreational side and in my district they are the backbone of our coastal economy and part of our islands way of life no other species of fish besides striped bass are subject to this confusing ban which was meant to impact the high seas of the e-z not a small segment of local water situated between two state boundaries fishermen should be able to legally fish for striped bass in this limited area just as they currently can in adjacent state waters we also must lift this unfair band so that the resources of the US Coast Guard can be focused on their important national security and safety mission not wasted on the enforcement of an arbitrary ban in a small waterway a recreational angle or a boat captain on the water off of Montauk Point can easily go from fishing legally and responsibly in state waters to violating federal law once they pass over the three-mile limit where New York state waters end and the transit zone begins many of these individuals lack the expense of GPS technology to know if when they have crossed the boundary and there are no buoys to warn them these are responsible men and women who have the greatest vested interest in preserving the striped bass fishery but they also desperately need relief from confusing government regulations that are hurting their livelihoods and access to local fisheries last Congress my standalone bill to address this issue HR 3078 clarification Act passed this house with the unanimous vote I also passed two similar amendments on this topic through the house last September again with unanimous support this amendment is supported by the recreational fishing alliance long island commercial fishing Association Montauk boatman and captain's Association and newly formed New York recreational and for higher fishing Alliance on behalf of the hard-working men and women of Long Island who rely on fishing as a way of life I asked for all my colleagues supporting this common-sense amendment thank you and I reserve the balance of my time Jim

and i'd like to ask you a question about voting rights as a colleague of mine observed we just honored the 56th anniversary of bloody sunday when in selma alabama john lewis and hosea williams and hundreds of others marched into a storm of billy clubs and police dogs and brutality for daring to demand the right to vote for black americans in the american south 56 years ago congressman lewis had his skull fractured that day as you know for daring to demand the right to vote and yet it was just yesterday that george's state senate approved legislation so brazen and flagrant and obvious in its partisan and racial targeting voter suppression legislation so outrageous that even george's own republican lieutenant governor refused to oversee the debate of this bill because he recognized that there is no legitimate basis for these restrictions on voting and that it is merely an exercise in the abuse of power using force of law to disenfranchise the people to pursue partisan ends so ms gupta should you be confirmed and you will assuredly have my support in your nomination for this position will you commit to using the full power of your office to protect the sacred right to vote which remains under attack in this country to make democracy real for every american citizen yes senator thank you ms gupta

I don't look like most people in Congress. My life is different too. I pushed through college and law school as a single mom and I'm 30 years sober. But struggle made me fierce. My work is to fight for all of us. Clean energy jobs, medicare for all no more corporate money in politics Trump won't hand us a thing if we ask politely. I'm Deb Haaland and I approve this message because the old way isn't working. We must be fierce. Are you ready?

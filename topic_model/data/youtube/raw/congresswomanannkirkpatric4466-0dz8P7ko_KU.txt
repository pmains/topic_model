this is congresswoman ann kirkpatrick and today i released a statement regarding what happened on january 6 2021. i want to read the statement so that we can put this video up on our website one year ago today i arrived at my office in washington d.c prepared to debate the electoral college ballots and ultimately confirm president-elect joe biden's victory what happened that day is not something i would have ever expected when coming to work i knew emotions around the country were high and the city was flooded with trump's supporters we understood and expected a protest but i never dreamed that it would manifest into a deadly insurrection in the halls of the united states congress in my office with my husband chief of staff and legislative director late morning the police alerted us to execute our lockdown protocols immediately in a dark locked room with the tv on mute we watched the escalation occur right outside our building we were silent but the crowd stampeded through the barricades people scaling our sacred building and shattering windows our capitol police were outnumbered it was horrifying other than what we saw on tv we had no idea what they'd planned or what we were supposed to do to to escape it our family and friends were texting and calling checking to see if we were safe ultimately we were okay locked down in the office but the in fear and emotions around that day still show up for many of us i spent a lot of time trying to understand how this could occur and i've tried to understand what led up to it it comes down to this simple fact president trump abused his power and betrayed our democracy and many republican leaders enabled him to do it there's no question president trump incited the insurrection president trump misled his supporters to distrust the electoral process and trump turned their fears into conspiracies and he inspired their anger into action it was an assault not only on the capitol building but on our democracy i now understand how and why it happened we see it happen in other countries with corrupt leaders and fearful followers but is this what we want for america thankfully the insurrection was a failure the transition of power occurred as the voters wanted but now it's our duty to the constitution the country and our voters to share the facts of january 6 and hold people accountable we must protect our democratic system from those who abuse power and hold responsible those who allow such abuses to occur i commend our bipartisan january 6 commission for their ongoing robust investigation and i look forward to seeing more facts unfold the damage of january 6 2021 will not be erased no matter how hard the republican party tries to my colleagues on the other side step up speak up and put your country over party thank you

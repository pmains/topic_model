thank you Senator Tom Cotton Arkansas Republican serves on the Judiciary intelligence and armed services and Joint economic committees as well and we are glad to have you in Focus today I want to lean on the economic part of your Acumen and get your reaction now to the truth coming out about inflation well Harris the truth about inflation is that it's devastating our families across the country that can't afford to fill up their tanks or to buy groceries much less to save a little bit for Christmas or for a family vacation or kids braces inflation is up 13 since Joe Biden took office and there's a very simple reason for that as we just heard too much demand not enough Supply too much money chasing too few goods that's the direct cause of the Democrats failed economic agenda last year they spent two trillion dollars on the economy as we're coming out of the coronavirus pandemic then they spent 700 billion dollars more just last month and at the same time they're showering all that money into the already overheated economy what are they also doing they're constraining supplies Democratic Governors were locking down their economies until the middle of last year Joe Biden is doing everything he can to constrain energy with his war on oil and gas and coal and energy inflation is one of the worst kinds because it affects everyone families and businesses and the goods we make and how they're transported across this country this is the direct fault of Joe Biden and the Senate and House Democrats that's why the American people are going to rebuke them come November I don't know if they see this and this is on purpose that's one thing if they're incompetent that's another those are bad choices all right and when you say I mean you saw what Joe Biden said just last weekend when he was celebrating the fact that inflation is only at eight percent he said just an end here yeah yeah uh a new DHS Inspector General report now shows the border patrol headquarters ordered agents not to assign alien numbers to about 138 illegal immigrants that meant that they could move around the country with no monitoring and the move was to speed up processing at overcrowded facilities but without those numbers those monitoring tracking numbers there's no way to know where those illegal immigrants are now Republican senators are asking DHS for the addresses of the people who are in America who've been given a notice to appear before an immigration judge that's a lot of detail the Senator's writing quote Sanctuary City policies are dangerous and threaten Public Safety these policies allow dangerous violent criminal aliens to walk free without fear or of deportation the Democratic mayor of El Paso says moving migrants out of Border communities is really nothing new it became very public when it became political and I think it's important when we're talking about this morning that we take the politics out of this and understand that we have a lot of people coming across into El Paso but they're not coming to El Paso they're coming to the United States and it's important that we sit there and look and see where they want to go there's a big difference what's your reaction to this latest news well it's very Troublesome but it's pretty much of a piece with what Joe Biden has been doing for two years since he took office we have five million illegal aliens who ever enter our country and we know where almost none of them are whether they get one of the tracking numbers or not all we do is send them into the interior of our country and say pretty please report for a hearing at some point in the future you know whether it's Joe Biden's government whether it's the Democratic mayor of El Paso whether it's Republican Governors it's really unfortunate that we have migrants boarding buses and planes and going north into our country Joe Biden should be putting them on buses and planes and sending them South back to their own countries well they were putting them surreptitiously to States like Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn told me that that these flights with minor children were Landing in her State and other places across the country so Democrats are disingenuous and flat out lying if they say that they have a problem with people being bussed and flown and all of that because they they've done it too I recently visited the border and a lot of the the visuals that you'll see during this program are from my recent visit and it was just last weekend I talked with the president of the Del Rio sector for the national border patrol Council and I ask him this question have you spent any time with secretary mayorkas I have the reality is he just like everyone else on the cabinet are not going to do anything that the president doesn't tell them to do so you know it's I think he can help influence it I don't know I don't know what sort of pressure he's putting or pushing back toward the White House I don't know they are really caught in the middle they're told don't take numbers for these people don't do everything because they're too many of them but by the way we're going to hold you accountable yeah the brave men and women of the border patrol or immigrations and Customs Enforcement are not being permitted to do their jobs it's kind of like Mayors who are not allowing police across the country to do their jobs these men and women in Border Patrol and immigration and custom enforcement signed up to enforce the law to protect our border to defend our sovereignty and Joe Biden won't let them do it and make no mistake what you saw at the border when I saw at the border last year when I traveled there it's not an accident it's not an unintended consequence it's not bad luck it's what Joe Biden and the Democrats want it's what they campaigned on it's the deliberate policy that they have chosen by Design and that's why the American people are going to vote them out of office in November I tell you those numbers uh in that Del Rio sector which are the the most poorest parts and and biggest numbers along our 19 plus 100 miles of Border they are eye-popping the U.S military has adopted another woke policy apparently Fox obtained new training curriculum for the U.S Air Force Academy in Colorado and Cadets were told to stop using gender-specific language like Mom and Dad boyfriend and girlfriend and use more inclusive words instead what would that be it comes as the Department of Defense a sounding the alarm on plummeting recruitment I can't wait to get into this with you let's watch the department anticipates we will collectively miss our annual recruiting Mission despite assessing more than 170 000 remarkable young men and women are short for constitutes an unprecedented Mission Gap and is reason for concern for the greater state of national service why don't people want to join the military now yeah Harris uh young kids don't join the military to learn how to use the right pronouns they join the military to learn how to kill the bad guys and defend this country and if the Biden Administration wants to know why recruiting numbers have collapsed why we have a recruiting crisis they just need to look at their own policies Afghanistan the vaccine mandates the indoctrination sessions radical gender ideology The Witch Hunt for supposed white nationalists the Biden Pentagon looking for the causes of the recruiting crisis is kind of like O.J Simpson looking for the real killer Harris uh just real quickly and one thing popped into my head about Joe Biden and his recent talk about Taiwan and how our military would be there if China stepped up which is not our national policy or national foreign policy at all that's not how we talked about that but he's going to need a military if he's going to talk all big and bad like that real quick last thought yeah the recruiting crisis is very dangerous for our country and it will be dangerous for many years to come if we don't turn it around quickly the way to turn it around is to get our military focused on its core Mission which is preparing for war and fighting War not using the right pronouns or worried about things like gender ideology and lifting things like vaccine mandates we need to turn the page at the Pentagon and make it clear to America's young men and women that we want them to join the military because we want them to defend this country not go to social justice training seminars Senator cotton of the great state of Arkansas thank you very much for being in Focus today thank you

wesley hunt is with us army veteran and texas congressional candidate he wrote this an op-ed on foxnews.com it's on your screens wesley in what way will the catastrophe in afghanistan haunt america in the future spell it out it most certainly will first and foremost i want to thank the brave men and women over the course of the past 20 years that sacrificed so much to keep our country safe by fighting terror abroad thank you your sacrifice is not for naught i can assure you that but prior to this we had a conditions based withdrawal we had 2500 troops in afghanistan and in the last 18 months we only lost one soldier due to combat that's what you call a stable area but right now joe biden has failed us because he wanted to say on the 20th anniversary of 9 11 that we have zero troops in afghanistan and i'm here to tell you as a soldier that's not leadership okay we have 15 000 americans trapped in afghanistan tens of thousands of america's friends trapped in afghanistan they can't get to the airport because it's surrounded by the taliban should we should our troops american troops should they go out and get those people and engage in combat to go get them if necessary what do you think that would be a very tough decision for this week by administration to make but we have already committed 6 000 troops to go clean this mess up and we're probably going to have to commit more look those are our brothers and sisters that are behind enemy lines it is our duty to go get them we get we never leave an american behind that's our motto and that's our mantra and if we can't do that then we've lost what it means to be americans would you like to see the president the commander-in-chief come out and say that and state exactly his position you're not going to get it but would you like to see it i would like to see it you know why because it's leadership and we don't always get things right it is clear that he has gotten this wrong but guess what we are americans we always come back we always do the right thing right now joe biden doesn't want to because it's not politically expedient for him to do so but right now there are lives and in danger and right now the taliban has completely taken over afghanistan we've got to go in and get our men and women

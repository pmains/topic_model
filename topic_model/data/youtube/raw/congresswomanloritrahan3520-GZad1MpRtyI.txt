thank you for yielding mr chairman and i'm grateful to you and chairwoman chakowski for calling this important hearing as a former division one volleyball player this issue hits home like many former college athletes i wouldn't be where i am today without that scholarship my family didn't have a lot of money my dad was a union iron worker and my mom picked up jobs where she could they worked hard to give my sisters and me every opportunity to succeed but there's just no way we could have afforded that tuition at georgetown without the volleyball scholarship i'm the first person in my family to graduate from college and i'm forever grateful for the opportunity and the doors that were open for me after graduation however it's through that experience that i became familiar with how the ncaa conferences and colleges used amateurism or at least the guise of it to build a multi-billion dollar industry on the backs of dedicated talented and often poor college athletes when i was in school i couldn't coach a summer camp for young girls in my hometown of lowell because it would have jeopardized my amateur status that was wrong then and it's been wrong for every athlete after me who was forced to navigate complex rules designed to keep us amateurs while coaches and executives pocketed millions the association's recent nil policy change is long overdue and i believe yesterday's nlrb memorandum on college athletes employment rights is as well for the purposes of today's hearing it's clear that years of reluctance to embrace the inevitable shift on nil means athletes are now operating in a patchwork of state laws governing their rights any federal action we take to deliver for the people who have always been what matters most in college sports and that's the athletes that means guaranteeing them the maximum freedom possible to be compensated for the use of their name image and likeness in the way they choose whether it's teaching the next generation of athletes entering a group licensing agreement or something else so i look forward to continuing our work to achieve that goal and certainly the discussion today thank you i yield back

all right the ever forgetful Joe Biden still hiding out in his Delaware basement bunker so we're now starting a new countdown tonight take a look all right now will the press the president's organizing let's see the largest fastest medical mobilization in history let's see doing three hour press conferences knows everything building hospitals Manning hospitals converting hospitals to Cova nineteen making sure every ventilator is made every respirator every mask every shield every gown all the gloves yeah Joe has been hiding in his basement for 64 long days that was since the last fake news CNN debate if you want to call it that and when Joe by the way has done an event everything he's done in his basement has not come out well it's been a non-stop technical glitch and all-out dysfunction like with Joe look my own let me take off my a-v aters but today it was Canadian geese that were bothering Joe take a look you're gonna hear there's a pond on the other side of my property here a lot of Canadian geese if you hear them honking away it's through cheering that's what they're about [Music] staggering it's been two months since crying this Gordon that mind is it incompetence corruption Trump is out there tweeting again this morning I found President Tweety reopened the country end of quote incompetent yeah you can't even put on a podcast and you didn't throw that great yourself Joe you didn't support the travel ban the quarantine the subsequent travel bans anyway the mob the media you're doing all things defense for the new extreme radical socialist party led by forgetful Joe look at this outrageous over-the-top glowing puff piece on failed gubernatorial candidate from Georgia Stacey Abrams who continues to push for VP slot profile includes a photograph of her looking like she is well like a superhero and describes her as pendemonium ensues as she walks to the far left of the stage like a runway supermodel stops on a dime poses tilts her head slightly and smiles camera flashes explode you think he'd ever read that sort of thing about any conservative Donald Trump from the Washington compost I doubt it here with reaction is the host of hot takes Republican congressman Matt Gaetz along with former Fox News contributor governor Mike Huckabee governor I don't even know what to say the guy was wrong on everything with Corona but his economy without the pandemic oh they did screw up and 1h1 his words was a disaster thirteen million more Americans on food stapes a stamps at 8 million more poverty Louis labor participation who is he to talk hiding in his basement Sean first of all I think the geese made more sense than show this campaign I actually understood what they were trying to say the difference is that you know we a hundred years ago there was a great baseball player that we called Shoeless Joe Jackson today we have clueless Joe Biden who's running for president and the remarkable thing Stacey Abrams isn't just begging to be the vice president that's like begging to be the first mate on the Titanic and she wants this so badly and I'm wondering why well it did she sees in this future that the rest of us aren't saying you know oh by the way congrats on your new podcast mr. Cates I I assume you're auditioning for future jobs I'm just guessing I don't know for sure I'm auditioning to be able to be the Hannity radio guest host that's that's really mine you have been against Tony but you don't want to be again you need to go on vacation again Sean this is what Matt Gaetz says fine how are my ratings don't like oh boy here we go alright so the question is does the Democratic Party keep this guy because he's got a far worse economy he's got more baggage than anybody else and the guy can't string three sentences together at this point or put their hottest yeah there are some who believe that Joe Biden could be replaced as a consequence of clearly diminished capacity it's my belief that if Joe Biden can still fog a mirror they are going to nominate him he's been running for president off and on since 1988 the democrat establishment all coalesced around him out of fear that bernie sanders was marching his way to the nomination any I mean Joe Biden is just simply not a leader presidents Trump is exerting strength Joe Biden is weak president Trump is leading our nation to the great American comeback and I don't think that Joe Biden's a lot out of the basement cuz there probably were he won't be able to find his way home Stacy Abrams wants to be the vice presidential nominee because she simply doesn't think that she would run the show in the Biden campaign because he doesn't seem to have the capability to lead even that campaign much less the country let's say hypothetically Governor Huckabee they say Jill Biden comes out his wife and says I don't think he's up to it you think Bernie Sanders people go away quietly or are they gonna demand probably rightfully so the nomination go to him Sean they're not going to go away quietly even if Joe stays in they're already saying most of them don't want to support Joe Biden interestingly Bernie Sanders has endorsed and is supporting Stacey Abrams so that's an interesting take we'll see what happens all right what do you think does he get does he stay on the ticket Mac aids Joe Biden will be the nominee and we're gonna beat him I think that he's a picture of the past and Donald Trump is going to forge a brighter future for all Americans always play like it's the two-minute drill there's six points down you need to cross the plane and kick the field goal that's my advice to anybody running for office good to see you both

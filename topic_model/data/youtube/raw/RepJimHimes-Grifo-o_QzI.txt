joining me now is democratic congressman jim hines member of the house intelligence committee welcome back to the broadcast good to see you thanks alex we have degrade and defeat that is not the sales pitch that the president gave when he announced these airstrikes about a month ago does he need to consult congress to take it to this new level um he does in my opinion need to consult congress as i think presidents should constitutionally always consult congress as if if you believe the constitution when they get involved in uh in war making look speaking for myself i agree with the president uh isis is a very dangerous pestilence that we need to participate in and in fact lead the effort to eliminate but that that effort really needs to have a bunch of characteristics that don't lend themselves to the kind of uh you know bring them on rhetoric that i think some people have been hoping for from the president congress needs to be consulted we need to have a debate we need to make sure that the american people understand what the limits are and exactly what we intend to do we need to do this as part of an international coalition which includes uh uh arabs and and and muslim countries uh we need to remember that this is now a transnational problem there's a lot of talk about you know gosh do you go into syria or is it just iraq you know i mean can you imagine telling isis that well we're going to go after you in iraq but not in syria um and all of this needs to be done very very carefully and therefore yes it is essential that the congress have both debate and a role in figuring out how we proceed here right as if a border line between the two countries would do anything to um keep isis from crossing over it anyway um let's look at the language that the president used to describe the boots on the ground in syria and here's what he said with the quote being with respect to the situation on the ground in syria we will not be placing u.s ground troops to try to control the areas that are part of the conflict inside syria or inside of syria so the key words here to try to control the areas in your interpretation sir does that only rule out an occupation and necessarily offensive action on the ground well look i i speaking for myself i think i speak for a lot of people i would be enormously hesitant to go beyond the one thing that the united states can do that nobody else can do which is deliver truly stunning uh air power against these guys remember these guys are now moving in armored vehicles across open desert we can do a lot of damage frankly as the president has done in the last couple of weeks to these guys but i personally would deep be deeply opposed to boots on the ground and and again you need to sort of step back and think um you know our mission here is a little like the successful mission against the uh the head of al-shabab in somalia uh killed by the department of defense just a couple of days ago it is not and it must not be to get involved in the civil war in syria you know you yeah and and it's a it's not a bright line right isis is obviously on one side of that civil war but we need to be very careful that we don't find ourselves you know fighting a civil war in syria my god fighting both sides of the civil war in syria if we're still serious about seeing assad leave we also need to make sure that this does not become us being on the shiite side of a sunni shiite conflagration in the region yeah i just took in everything you said and i'm like yep that's pretty heavy stuff there um it's a complicated issue extremely complicated um i spoke with chuck todd this morning he said that the white house policy on isis depends on whom you speak with in the building he says there's no consensus at all so i'm curious about the intelligence community you serve on that committee so the people you speak to the ones who've seen all the evidence what do they tell you look i i i think saying that there's no consensus on policy is not right um you know there has been an evolving policy just as isis you know frankly we've known about isis for a long time but i'm not sure anybody predicted that they would uh you know take a third of sunni uh iraq um and uh you know i i would agree with those who say that the president has not been um as direct and as clear in articulating strategy certainly a line about not having a strategy i think was unfortunate but look americans need to understand that if what they're hoping for is a president who shows up on tv and says we are going to destroy these guys in a week bring them on that sort of rhetoric you know we paid a price for that kind of rhetoric and that approach to foreign policy in the last 15 years this is a little bit more like what george h.w bush did when uh iraq invaded kuwait you build a coalition uh you use your strengths you get international legitimacy you you you stay away and george h.w bush paid a cost for the decision to do it you stay away from you know expanding your mission and nation building that is not something that you that lends itself either to a 30-second uh talking point or to being cooked up you know in a in a weekend in the in the situation room okay connecticut democratic congressman jim hymes good to see you thanks so much

Texas Thank You mr. chairman welcome Madam Secretary thank you for your service similar to September the eleventh two thousand one there were warning signs prior to Benghazi September 11th there was a april 6 2012 crude IED thrown over the wall of the US facility in benghazi on may 22nd 2012 red cross building in benghazi hit by two rpgs the brigades of the imprisoned blind Sheikh took responsibility for that attack on june the 6 2012 US consulate in benghazi was targeted by an ied attacked at blue hole in the perimeter wall again the blind shape brigade taking credit and then on August sixteenth we have this cable that's been widely reported a classified State Department cable warning that the Benghazi consulate could not withstand a coordinated attack and the regional security officer believed our consulate could not be protected at an emergency meeting less than one month before the attack on 911 a contingency plan was supposedly drafted to move the operations to the CIA annex about a mile way from the compound this cable is presumed to have been shared by senior staff it was sent to your office it was sent to the NSC and even on September the eleventh day ambassador Stevens was killed he personally warned about quoted growing problems with security in Benghazi and growing frustration with security forces and the Libyan police were you aware of this cables this eight this August sixteenth cable congressman that cable did not come to my attention I have made it to very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB placed responsibility whereas I think ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road now I think when were you aware of this cable after the our began to you know gather information and material which of course was in my office you within your office did see this cable I'm not aware of anyone with in my office within the secretary's office having seen the cable within the National Security Council I have no information or awareness of anyone in the National Security Council having seen that cable was this a cable surprise to you you know congressman it was very disappointing to me that the ARB concluded there were inadequacies and problems in the responsiveness of our team here in Washington to the security requests that were made by our team in Libya and I was not aware of that going on it was not brought to my attention but obviously it's something we're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn't happen again well I certainly hope so I think when you have a knight States ambassador personally warning about the situation over there sending this cable to your office I if I could 1.3 million your cables a year come to the State Department they're all addressed to me they do not all come groves so what awarded through the be somebody within your office should have seen this cable is my in my judgment can ask one last question I also I just want to clarify you know as with regard to the security requests subsequent to the August sixteenth cable our personnel in Libya had not submitted any additional security requests to Washington at the time of the sep tember 11th attack now there was an ongoing dialogue as you know between Libya and Washington I think it is my time is very limited an emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on August sixteenth by the Ambassador himself warning of what could happen and this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office that's the bottom missile attacks the facts as we have them congressman and I will be happy to have people give you this in detail the August sixteenth cable stated that security requests for Benghazi would be forthcoming the RSO and Benghazi submitted to Tripoli a preliminary list of proposed security recommendations on august twenty-third but no requests were submitted to Washington before the attacks now all right well sound this sounds very complicated and to some extent it is we're trying to simplify it and avoid the kind of problems that I hope we can fix have one last question why was he in Benghazi on September of the 11th I'm gonna go now to mr. William Cal else about that question writing

thank you very much i thank my friend the gentleman from north carolina for yielding me this time mr speaker i rise to earth's passage of this legislation carrying the freedom to vote act and to join our louis vuitton rights advancement act to the senate for immediate consideration to safeguard our most fundamental constitutional right the right to vote we took an oath to protect this country from all threats of foreign and domestic today we face a domestic threat from those seeking to gain and hold power by suppressing votes and nullifying election results congress must combat this threat by ensuring equal and unencumbered access to the ballot box and ensuring an accurate vote count it is time to choose will we uphold our oath and protect this fragile democracy or will we subvert the constitution and fetter the franchise i want to remind the previous speaker that we did not have jim crow before there was jim crow and we did not have jim crow and we had it until 1954. i used to teach this stuff called yesterday and i will say to my colleagues anything that's happened before can happen again it was the lack of the vote that had 95 years between george washington murray who was the last african-american to represent south carolina here in this body until i came along in 1992. why because the right to vote was taken away gentlemen nullified we are not going back are you back

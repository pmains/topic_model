hi i'm state representative eric burleson and wanted to talk with you this week about house bill 1637 and with me is one of my colleagues paul kurtman he's from the 105 105th district which is near st louis um just uh just southwest of uh st louis in fact are you off of i-44 yeah i live about 200 feet from i-44 okay right there so when i'm going to the st louis cardinals games then i'm flying by your by your neighborhood all the time huh yeah i could probably throw a rock and hit your car please don't tell me you're coming well we wanted i wanted to share uh with my constituents about some of the important bills that we're working on this year and some really the more innovative ideas and i really think that yours is a is a is a really innovative and neat idea and uh one that uh i've heard a lot of input on already and it has to do with uh really people's concerns today about what is the value of the dollar and uh making sure that people are investing their money and that their investments are really sound right and so if you could explain uh house bill 1637 it's kind of uh a unique concept in america other states are following similar legislation utah has already passed theirs right now the situation in america is this we have a federal reserve that is in charge of printing all of our money there's not a whole lot of regulatory oversight over their emergency lending practices and so what we found out through a partial audit of the federal reserve is that they've essentially created nearly 16 trillion dollars worth of new money um in the last five years yeah you don't create new money right yeah yeah they they really have are are depl are really reducing the value of the money that we have right we have so many obligations our debts bad and um with all these bailouts that have been going on we have to we have to basically print off new dollars or create or create new money through electronic extensions of credit right so either way whenever we either way the money that you're it's in your pocket right now is worth it it's devaluing because we make so much more of it so the money that i have becomes less valuable because there's so much more out there on the market exactly yeah so in 2008 there was 800 billion dollars in circulation at the end of 2011 there was 2.7 trillion so that's an inflation rate right there of over 300 percent and it's really a tax increase it's a it's a tax to the people well it is because the way the economy works the consumer is always the last one to catch up with inflation so if you look at the commodities index you'll find out that the prices of sugar and beef and pork and cotton are going up by over almost 50 some of them right but nobody's really getting 50 pay raises so the purchasing pal power of our dollar is going down you know you can't you can't buy with a dollar now what you used to buy with it 10 or 15 years ago right so this bill that um we've got in the house house bill 1637 this bill says that people can take what is already legal tender a u.s is that an example of this is an example this is a silver dollar it's a u.s minted silver dollar this one was minted in 2011. well it's worth a a dollar but the actual silver content is worth thirty dollars so if somebody if somebody buys a whole bunch of these what they have to do is if they want to actually spend their money they actually have to go sell them off to a coin shop in order to collect the value okay well this what this bill that i've created does what it does is here's all the statutes in missouri up on the shelf behind me and this bill just makes room in our statutes to allow people to come into missouri create a business give people jobs and instead of me going out and selling this to a coin shop and then spending the 30 somewhere else i could just give this to somebody you could give me a debit card and i'll go out and spend money so i give you a debit card that's got a value of thirty dollars that's got a value of thirty dollars on it and so if i go out and spend twenty dollars on a book you just then i then this no that that value belongs to me right you can sell it to someone else you sell off twenty dollars worth of silver to cover the cost of the transaction that i just had earlier in the day it's the same way banks work use your debit card you spend money out of your checking account the bank sends them money and and if you don't spend it and it's and it's sitting there then the value of this if it goes up to 35 or 40 then that means that then you you have 40 to spend exactly and so when when the government is printing more money you what you really own is not depreciating in value right and in fact like i just told you in the last five years the amount of money that's new money that's been created in the last five years the price of silver has doubled so while the value of your dollar goes down the value of silver and gold continues to go up so it's really inflation-proof one thing i learned as a financial advisor is that if you want to have inflation-proof investments you have to have equity you got to have actual ownership of something real um this is something real so this is inflation-proof because there's a finite supply you can't just go out and make more silver right so this this will protect people's labor and the value of their dollar right and so and some of the criticism you know i've heard people that have not read the bill and they they say missouri is going back to the gold standard and and really after when you really read the bill where it's it's it's it makes much more sense it's very common sense in fact what what the bill is doing could be done today with with money market accounts and it kind of is done but really we're making a a way to do it um a really a clean way of doing it through um i i should say more a more clear way of doing it through um deposits right and this just cuts out the middle man like i said you you could go buy silver and hold it and hope it attains value and then you have to go sell it all off or you can just allow somebody you can employ somebody to sell it off for you right so it's really just more convenient way of liquidating your commodity and monetizing it so you can actually spend the spend it as you sell it off at the exact same moment okay so that's that's really the whole point it doesn't take us back to a gold standard because this this would be all voluntary this just allows people to have the choice hey here's an opportunity and it's not like you're taking gold to walmart no and uh plopping it on the counter no no when you when you buy your groceries yeah and because i mean if if you took this if you had vista walmart i think when people think of the build they kind of picture in their mind the old you know the old westerns where someone brings in a sack of a bag of coins yeah right yeah but yeah and and right now i could i we can already do that right now but if i took the silver dollar into walmart to buy candy bar i'd be putting this down and then probably a quarter just to cover the taxes that we tax people but i could give it to you as a depositor you could give me a debit card and i could go in there and buy 30 candy bars and so what this does is it creates more comments there's two ways to attack economic development um manufacturing or consumer being you know consumer based industries well we have to compete with 49 other states for manufacturing jobs and china right now we're competing with the federal government who's running so many of our jobs out of the country so what we can do another way to attack and bring more commerce into our state bring more revenue to our schools into our roads is to have people conducting more commercial transactions here in our state and so if they have the ability to do that this they'll do it when utah first opened up their depository the guy immediately identified over 10 million dollars worth of brand new capital that was coming into their state to be spent in their state it's a it's a good bill to get if you want to keep funding schools create jobs create jobs improve the economy exactly this is a this is a very novel idea very out of the box thinking this is exactly what we need to be doing i just want to say thank you for doing it and it's it's a pleasure working with you thank you and uh to our constituents back home again i'm representative eric burleson and representative paul kurtman and if you have any questions about this bill or any others you can contact my office my

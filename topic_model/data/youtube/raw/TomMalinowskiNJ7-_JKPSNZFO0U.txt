thank you everyone for hopping on and taking the time out of your busy schedules to be here with us and Tom I'm super happy to see all of you from high schools across the district some people from outside the district as well as you all know we roasted by the high school and college Democrats of New Jersey I want to thank Rachel from the high school Democrats and David from the College Democrats for helping us set this up and Tom for being here as well right now is a super critical time for our generation I think and it's super important for everyone to get involved and become activists and creating sort of positive Democratic Change from the bottom up I myself started out as an intern on Tom's campaign in 2018 I'm super proud to be working on his team full-time as his deputy field director I posted the application for our internship program in the chat it's a great start for anyone looking to get involved in politics on a nationally targeted congressional race in 2020 and now I'm gonna pass it on to David and Rachel to speak a few words and introduce Tom and then we'll open it up for questions so David why don't you start us off sure and I'd like to thank the congressman and thank his staff for inviting us on this call the College Democrats of New Jersey support the congressman were always thankful for you know his supporting key legislation in DC I was privileged to speak with the congressman when he was running in 2017 and for the election in 2018 and I have to say that not only am i impressed by his standing by every single word that he said then but I'm even more impressed by the leadership that he's shown in the past two years in Congress I think that we need a strong elected representative who's going to stand up for the rights of immigrants who's going to stand up for a fair and equitable justice system and who will call out abuses perpetrated by white supremacists that our president you know won't call out and so if there is anything that the College of Democrats New Jersey can provide I think I can speak for all of us when we say we will provide it and we're more than happy to support you because of your advocacy and and it hasn't just been over the past two years it's been during your time as Assistant Secretary of State a senior director of the National Security Council and when you were chief advocate at Human Rights Watch so we know you haven't just been doing it for the past two years but we really would like to make note that you haven't just protected our interest you've been a leader in getting Co sponsorships in DC so we thank you and and we're more than happy to be a part of this goal and in to support you in any capacity possible thank you hi everyone I'm Rachel gergich chair of the New Jersey High School Democrats an organization dedicated to engaging youth in the political process through organizing for advocating for and supporting the Democratic Party I'm sure I don't have to remind everyone here today about the consequential nature of our upcoming election but as a high schooler it's often times frustrating to not be able to vote in an election where we're not only fighting for a blue president but just as important a blue legislature that is why I'm so honored to introduce Congressman Tom Malinowski who is not only dedicated his service to protecting values important to young Democrats but has also taken the time to listen to our voices during his time in office congressman Malinowski has been at the forefront at the forefront of important legislative decisions as a first-generation American myself it is reassuring to know that we have a congressman who has strongly opposed president Trump's offensive immigration measures including the separation of families at the border and the Muslim ban congressman Malinowski has also been an advocate for stronger gun violence prevention policies including an assault weapon ban and strong red flag laws during his time representing New Jersey seventh congressional district congressman Malinowski has also introduced important measures to aid students like me including the higher education to protect the higher education student Protection Act that would hold institutions of higher education accountable for improper amounts of spending on marketing recruitment advertising and lobbying congressman Malinowski has a strong record of upholding New Jersey's values during a time when our democracy is constantly at risk right now more than ever we need a strong dedicated leader who was willing to fight against institutionalized racism and provide coda 19 relief to family is to families in need in 2018 I can this for the first time in support of Congressman Tom Malinowski and I'm so proud to support his reelection campaign for New Jersey's seventh congressional district so without further ado Congressman Tom Malinowski Thank You Rachel thank you David thank you everybody so Rachel you said you can't vote yet but how many votes do you think you you turned out last time just by canvassing probably a lot so you know there are all kinds of ways to have influence in our political process and one person one person is one vote that one person can persuade a lot more than one thought one person can mobilize a lot more than one vote one person can do a tremendous amount of good and so I'm really glad that that you guys are well on your way to being influential leaders in New Jersey and in our country because we're gonna need every single one of you I'll tell you something that worries me a little bit right now I got a lot to choose from right but one thing that worries me is that you guys might think that this is normal what we're going through you know you haven't been you've been politically active maybe for a few years in some of your cases but not for very long you've been aware what's happening in our country and what's being debated at the highest levels of our politics for maybe a little while but not too long and and I worry that you might look at what's happening and think that this is just the way things are supposed to be when you see the US military deployed in Washington DC and National Guard troops helping the police violently disperse peaceful protesters so that a president can cross the street for a photo-op holding up a Bible that he's never read you might think that it's normal for army helicopters to be hovering over our cities to disperse people who are peacefully protesting you might think it's normal to have lived through just one half of one year in which we had a presidential impeachment we lost a hundred thousand of our fellow Americans to a pandemic disease we have 40 million of our fellow Americans unemployed every single day people and highest positions of power seem to be using that power just to advance their own power and self-interest and I don't want you guys to think that this is this is normal cuz it's not it's you know for somebody my age it's it's like bewildering ly shocking because we've never seen anything like this before now that doesn't mean that America has been a happy place for all of my life or of all the history of our country that we haven't had any problems or injustice as my goodness the whole history of America is a struggle to overcome difficulties and and and some of the most terrible injustice --is that you can imagine but you know we've never before been in a situation where the highest leader in our land maybe not since the Andrew Johnson administration for you history buffs we're the highest leader of our land does not go to work every single morning at least asking the question what can I do to make it better most of our leaders have done that we're all Democrats on this call every Republican president that I've known in my lifetime has gone to work every morning asking you know what can I do to make this country better and I disagreed with a lot of their answers to that question but that's what motivated they were responsible and that's what we don't have right now we have a situation where every single day when the President of the United States cease fire and he has a choice between pouring water on that fire and gasoline he chooses the gasoline tries to makes things worse more violent more divided more anxious more fearful more chaotic because he thinks that that's the way he can survive in power interested not in running the government but basically demolishing the government and replacing it with his family we've never seen that sort of thing before and I just want to make sure all of you know this is not normal this is weird stuff that is happening right now and hopefully if we do our jobs you will tell your grandchildren stories about 2020 and they're gonna think you're nuts that's our goal and I think we can achieve that goal because even though it looks like Americans are divided like we've never been divided before and of course we do disagree we sincerely disagree on some real issues like you know people disagree about how to fix our health care system then they disagree about you know what our trade foreign trade policies should be and how to promote economic growth and how do we protect the environment should that be a priority or not people disagree about that but the vast majority of Americans I think agree on the big things right now look at our response to Cove it 19 didn't matter if you're a Republican or Democrat through most of this eighty five ninety percent of the American people thought you got to put public health first yes we need to shut down the economy yes we need to stay home yes we need to listen to scientists and public health experts and we did it not just because some governor like Governor Murphy and New Jersey told them they had to they did it because it was the right thing to do it was the responsible thing to do and right now you know after the horrible shooting in in Minnesota the murder of George Floyd by a police officer overwhelming majority of Americans saw that they were disgusted they thought it was wrong they thought of course those police officers should be held accountable of course people have a right to protest peacefully they should be protesting peacefully and at the same time the overwhelming majority of Americans thought and think that nobody should be using violence nobody should be smashing things nobody should be hurting anybody but that's also wrong like that's most people agree on those things and I think this election in 2020 the one that I hope all of you are going to participate in it's it's going to be should be fought around those basic things that most people do agree on we should be decent we should be kind to each other we should tell the truth we should respect the law we should have leaders who modeled those values every single day and who come to work every morning as I said asking how can I make things better leaders who have a sense of responsibility not people who blame somebody else for every problem but who take responsibility for fixing the problems of this country and I think that kind of message will appeal obviously to Democrats but it'll appeal to a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans were fed up with this mess with this division with this anger with this chaos with a complete total lack of responsibility that we're seeing in the white house and I'm gonna talk a lot about that so I'm I'm pretty hopeful even though this is a really dark moment because I think most people would agree with what I just said and I'm hopeful I know this sounds like a cliche and I'm hopeful because of what I've seen in the young people who I've met in the course of running for Congress and being a member of Congress yesterday I went out to a rally and a march in Summit New Jersey which was organized by high school students to protest the the murder of mr. Floyd to call for justice and for peace we need both of those things in our society right now and at the very end of the march a couple of the students spoke and and one of them african-american high school student just got up and he quoted a statement from President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s and what Johnson said was that the vote the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men now if you ignore the anachronistic sexist language and think about the substance of that message it is so so true and it is so inspiring that despite everything out there that might make a cynical about democracy and voting that is the message that so many young people are leading with there are lots of reasons to be angry and cynical whether it's gun violence in our schools whether it's what just happened in Minnesota whether it's the failure of the government to deal with this pandemic in the way that it should have issue after issue after issue and yet what I hear from young people is not smash things it's not destroy the system that we have it's used that we have people because if we did we wouldn't be having these problems if everybody voted especially if every young person voted we would not be talking today about violence on America's streets and death in America's hospitals and senior homes we would be talking about a bold plan to deal with climate change in health care and equality and fixing infrastructure and all the stuff that this country needs it's on us and so the way we get leaders who take responsibility is for all of us to take responsibility as citizens and as voters because it's our country to save so with that you know I don't need to convince you of that I'm preaching to the choir so would love to hear your thoughts and take any questions that you might have about anything that's going on in our country or around the world today and what we can do about it yes so if you think you want to for everyone who has a question put your questions in the chat and I will try my best to call on you in the time that we have I'm gonna try and prioritize people that had submitted their questions before but I will look through the chat constantly and see if I can call on you guys so your first question tom is from 10 guy who's bunion here guess he just hopped off I'll be nosh has a question for you Tom I'm gonna own me of you Avinash can you hear us hi yes I can all right go ahead hi congressman thank you for being on this call with us today sure as you're on the transportation subcommittee I have a question for you regarding teacher of Americans America's transportation infrastructure obviously it's been aging over the last 50 60 years we're really falling behind prepared the rest of the world what do you think is the future for America's transportation infrastructure and why is it critical especially during times like this such as protests that we have such strong support of public am structure you know there's a lot of that when do we open America and what we really need to be talking about is when do we rebuild America because we are sitting on and using every single day infrastructure roads and bridges and tunnels and airports and ports and train stations that is falling apart it was built in some cases decades in some cases over a century ago and you know any of you who've been to an airport in Europe or Asia have taken a train in any advanced country outside the United States know that we are falling way way way behind we deserve better our economy depends on having better infrastructure in New Jersey we desperately need it because our whole economy our way based on being able to get from point A to point B so naturally as a congressman from New Jersey that's something that's really really important to me so what we are doing in fact just today we introduced in the house a really big infrastructure bill and it does a bunch of things number one very simply it's more money for fixing things and yes that includes highways we're still going to be driving cars for a long time to come and and so we need good highways and all the bridges and tunnels that go with them but it also puts much bigger emphasis on mass transit because we want we want to contribute to that clean energy future that all of us dream about it's got a lot of provisions in there that'll be good for New Jersey we have this massive massive need to repair and replace the rail connection between New Jersey New York and Hudson River tunnel Penn Station bridges with the lead up to the tunnel so we've got money in the bill that can be used to fund all of that and as we do this again we're gonna really really focus on investing in building the transportation network of the future modernizing our electrical grid having more charging stations for electric cars promoting the use of electric buses using green infrastructure where we can to to make to strengthen our resilience against climate change so all these things you're going to see in the bill that we're pushing in the house and you know so every other Thursday the president says that he wants a big infrastructure bill too so although he probably would write it in a different way I think we do have at least a basis for negotiation here and we might be able to get something good at me up Tom your next question is from one of our interns Raphael unmuted Raphael go ahead hi nice to see you my question is you know in a recent statement this week I you know former President Barack Obama talking about kind of the significant changes we need to law enforcement in this country he made the statement that you know most of those changes come from the local and municipal levels you know our police chiefs are appointed by our mayors and you know our police boards are elected by you know the town's members I guess my question is to you with that understanding what do you think are some things that Congress can do on the national and federal level to help help aid and get rid of some of the systemic problems that we see in law enforcement in this in this country now yeah so yeah you're right a lot of the work has to be done at the state and local level and and you guys need to be involved with all those levels if you want to make a difference there's not one that's more important than than any other but there's a lot we can do to encourage that at the federal level and you're gonna see Congress you're gonna see the house take up some legislation this month the names to do it back in the Obama administration we had some of these issues these are not new issues Ferguson Missouri was probably the most prominent case where you had an act of police violence followed by mass demonstrations in the whole world watching us to see what we would do and what we did was the Justice Department in Washington used its authority under the law to basically take over the Ferguson Missouri Police Department go in there and oversee reforms changing their practices how they stopped people the traffic stops getting rid of their leadership the police chief and others until it was a completely different and transform police force that's an extreme case most police forces in our country don't need that but where there are very serious problems there needs to be some mechanism for federal oversight Jeff sessions when he was Attorney General he significantly weakened that authority of the Justice Department these are known as consent decrees you know to use the technical term so we got to restore that that's that's one thing we got to do we can do something about the transfer of military equipment to police departments around the country you know this is this whole militarization of our police is a really bad idea even in symbolic ways I think I think police officers should look like police officers not like the 82nd airborne you know jumping into Fallujah Iraq to fight terrorists because what you need is trust between people and police officers trust that goes both ways and a feeling of comfort when a police officer is in your neighborhood the sense that oh my god thank you for being here you're here to protect me and the way they look the way they what they carry that has a lot to to do with it and and I can't think of too many situations where our police forces you know except for maybe SWAT teams and big cities are really going to need an armored personnel carrier or anything of that nature so those are those are a couple things that we can do there are issues having to do with when when police officers can be sued and held accountable that we are going to look we're gonna look at obviously and this is again more of a local and state thing that I think body cameras are really good development they don't just protect civilians they protect police officers because if a police officer is falsely accused of something and has their body cam on to prove that they behave professionally then that's great that's great too so again everything should be about building trust we desperately need police you know I would not want to live in a country without really good well-equipped well respected well trained police departments but without trust they can't be effective and you end up with problems like the ones we're experiencing today Tommy your next question is from renowned problem you you right now new year us oh yeah I can hear you first firstly I want to say thank you so much for taking time out of your really busy schedule to come talk to us and sort of hear what we have to say and my question is sort of like was there an exact moment in your life where you kind of realized and said to yourself that politics was the thing that you wanted to do an exact moment it was 6:30 to p.m. on April 12th no there wasn't there wasn't an exact moment you know you I don't know how much you know about my personal background but I was I was born in Poland back when it was a communist country and came to America when I was six years old and there's just that contrast between a dictatorship and a democracy even as a little kid you can see it and having that background just made me really interested in different ways in which countries govern themselves and how to preserve what makes America different special from different from other places in the world and I became a human rights activist as you heard I worked for a amazing organization called Human Rights Watch which tries to take that idea that we all have equal rights and apply it to every country around the world I met incredibly courageous people from China to Burma to Saudi Arabia to Cuba who risk their lives to fight for the rights that we have in the United States and they're not out there getting rubber bullets fired at them they're after getting real bullets fired out them and all those experiences just made me read up my determination to to work on these issues and then you know Trump won and I I realized I can't just I can't just think about what America can do to help people around the world experience good democracy we've got to take care of things at home because obviously there's something wrong but that led to the election of such a person it's not just his fault there's something deeper that needs to be addressed and so that's when I decided to actually jump into a an election and run for office myself so you know we all have our personal stories and reasons that lead us to do this and I guess that's mine in in a nutshell Tom your next question is from Vinay yeah Star Wars and I wanted to be on the the right side of the force noting the Vampire Slayer that's another one that was an inspiration I think date me date me completely now I guess that's anyway go on Tom your next question is from Vinay Vinay I just unmuted you Thank You congressman it's great that you're addressing the youth really exciting to be a part of this and my question was about the Gateway project which is something that you're a proponent for um considering how much it will do for not just the economy of New Jersey and North but the entire nation given a prominent a business how the New York City is not just in the US but in the world why do you think the Republican Party in general and people like the president in particular are so adamant in blocking funds for this project when they give money for example to a weber state bus service in Utah which while importance does not add as much economic value as this gateway project yeah so I'll give you a a very short answer and then and then a little deeper answer the short answer is the president doesn't want gateway because we want it's that simple we're a blue state he doesn't like us we don't vote for him so why should he help us or maybe a version a different version of that is well why should I do this unless I get something for it so maybe at some point he thought well you know if I hold back money for the Gateway project maybe I can get something from Chuck Schumer and the Democrats I can trade it for something I want like building the wall money for the wall on the US Mexican border so that's basically more the more we wanted it the less you wanted to want it to give it to us because that's his mindset the the the deeper part of that is and this gets me back to my first comment that this isn't normal that's not the way things are supposed to work and and and they really haven't worked that way in America for a very long time no past president no modern president has looked at the country as a collection of blue states and red states and said you know I want to use my power as president to help the people who support me the people who like me and not the people who don't support me that's just not the way things work in America but it is the way things work in a lot of other countries around the world where you know if you elect a president from your region or president from your tribe your ethnic group your your town then you just as a matter of course know that all the government money is going to flow to your tribe you are ethnic group your region your town and people fight it out over over those spoils it's a horrible way to live we have risen above that in America for for most of our history you know we impeach the president for something that was very similar we impeach the president because he used powers that we have given him under the Constitution to protect our country not part of our country not Republicans not Democrats but the country and he used those powers in this case the power to provide military aid to a foreign country to get a favor for himself personal paper it's the same kind of mindset as how he approaches infrastructure spending it's the same kind of mindset that led him to say to the governor of Michigan well if you're not going to be nice to me and maybe I'm not going to send you protective equipment for the coronavirus it's just not it's nothing you don't do that as America and and for those of us who are again used to the normal way of doing things there's something very disorienting about it you you you kind of pinch yourself wait is that actually happening no that's not I can't actually be happy and yet that's exactly what's happening and we're feeling it we have been feeling it in New Jersey with the Gateway project so again that's why it's so important we have Democrats in the House who can just fight for this and we have some power to that we're using to say no you know what this money is just going to be provided thank you Tom your next question is from Penelope Penelope can you hear us yes hi if you're re-elected what will you do to make sure that the Equal Rights Amendment gets passed you mean when I'm re-elected - no yes yes so what what we need to do I mean you know I'm sure you know the history of this right that it was passed by the Congress in the 1970s it went to the states to be ratified and a bunch of states ratified the the ER a at least at that time not enough to meet the the threshold under the Constitution and we just recently got more states ratified like 3040 years after the whole process began and so what Congress needs to do and I'm I strongly support this is to basically pass a law clarifying that for those who doubt it that those recent ratifications not only did the recent ratifications count but the older ones from the 1970s and the 1980s also still can't so we don't have to restart the process from scratch and if we can get that done in the House and the Senate and the president signs it then the ER a is done it's part of the Constitution of the United States we're gonna have to elect a Democratic majority in the Senate or at the very least a Democratic president I can see potentially maybe some Republicans in the Senate voting for that especially if they get their butts kicked in November Tom your next question is from Fabiano Fabiana i just unmuted you heroes can you hear us Fabiana yeah I can hear you so I'm Venezuelan as are my parents and I'm sure you're aware of the situation going on in that country right now um if or should I say when you're reelected what is Congress's plan with involving foreign relations with the country um well thank you thanks for raising foreign relations by the way you know right now I just had a conversation with a reporter who called me up and and and asked you know can can America still effectively credibly promote our values of democracy and respect for human rights anywhere with this stuff happening in our country and I'm very angry about what's happening in our country but I still believe we can we have to we have to fix what's happening in our country so we set a good example but and in the meantime we still have to try I've been very involved in trying to figure out what our policy towards China should be tomorrow is the anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square June 4th June 4th 1989 and it's a particularly awkward time for the United States to be condemning China for sending tanks into the street but you know we still have to say what we believe and hope and pray and expect that we are going to have an administration soon in Washington that can do so more effectively and Venezuela that's got to be at the top of our priority list because it's here in our hemisphere there's so many people a Venezuelan descent living in the United States contributing to our country and deeply anguish about what's happening in their homeland I have a I don't have a an answer for you that's going to that's gonna be like a lightbulb going off oh my god I never thought of that what what I think we need to do is a combination a very targeted pressure against those in the country who are stealing from people who are responsible for really bad human rights abuses and diplomacy that that is not just the United States but the u.s. working with the organization for American States Venezuela's neighbors Canada the European Union the United Nations the Vatican in Rome to try to get the Maduro government to relent and to give them a exit strategy a way to do so that they they will choose because otherwise I don't think absent some kind of massive uprising which is not a responsible thing for Americans to ask other people to do right we should not be telling other people to risk their lives absent that kind of exit window I don't see how we're gonna solve this so I think it's a combination of all those things run by an administration that actually has respect and credibility around the world Thank You Fiona Tommy next question is from Hawkshaw I said I just unmuted you go ahead I'm congressman Malinowski thank you so much for coming here today uh-huh my question was apart from the coronavirus crisis what do you see as America's biggest issue that should be addressed you know when when I got elected in fact even before I got elected when I was running I said that the first thing that we should do as Democrats in the House of Representatives is to pass a comprehensive a big package of bills to make our democracy work better for everybody to get the dark money out of our politics the secret contributions to political action groups and nonprofits that that spread misinformation on the Internet and try to influence our elections with no accountability to stop voter suppression and partisan gerrymandering that takes away from the majority of the American people the ability to select a majority of the United States Congress to strengthen our our ethics and anti-corruption laws so that presidents have to report their tax returns and divest themselves of companies that they might own so that it's harder for foreign actors trying to influence our democracy to be able to interfere and we did that HR 1 the first bill that we introduced in the House of Representatives did all of those things and we passed it in the House of Representatives obviously Mitch McConnell has no interest in it in the Senate but I think if we win that should also be the first bill that we do in January of 2021 and the reason is that it effects everything else that's why it's kind of an easy answer to what you might think is a really hard question name one thing if we want to fix our health care system in America we need politicians to feel free to respond to their voters rather than their donors we want to deal with the gun issue we got to free people from the grip of the NRA if we want better just a you know a better political climate in our country that allows us to focus on on substantive issues rather than conspiracy theories we've we've got to deal with the propaganda online and the way in which dark money promotes really really bad information pollutes our our politics so it's it's the issue of issues the one thing we could do that would make it easier to solve a lot of other problems Tom your next question is from an eco I just unmuted you go ahead any coke can euros alright I think we'll come back to her [Music] Tom your next question is from Cat Cat I just unmuted you can hear us yeah what was your most proudest accomplishment from your first two years in Congress thanks for asking I haven't even been two years in Congress it feels like about 80 years you're everything that's what's happened but I think I would say a a bill that I got passed through our appropriations process you know when we passed the budget for the the whole US government was to restore all the funding that the Trump administration cut in 2017 from our the federal government's programs to fight domestic extremism and terrorism including white supremacists the Homeland Security Department had some really really good programs working with police departments working with community organizations working with state governments to try to prevent these these acts of mass violence by mostly now people crazy people on the farm right and in 2017 Trump just eliminated all of it and we got all that money back and that was something that you know I that's something I did a lot of lot of achievements it's like 50 people working together of course I couldn't have done it alone but this was something that I took the initiative to do so I feel it wouldn't have happened without us in the 7th district also I'm proud of that all right we're gonna go back to Anika I just unmuted you can you hear us now can you hear us Anika yeah um so in light of George Floyd's murder how do you think Congress can actively take an anti-racist stance and allow for reform to occur within the law enforcement system Thanks so I think I touched on some of these things before obviously a lot of the work has to be done at the state level at the local level with our local police departments but at the federal level I think we you know we've got to we have to look at the militarization of our police in in this country and put some reasonable limits on the transfer of military equipment to police departments across America we need to look at some of the protections that police officers and police departments have from liability from their actions and I think we need to restore the ability of the Justice Department the federal Justice Department to oversee police departments that experience the worst problems okay Siddharth has a question for you Tom I mean we knew Siddharth go ahead can you hear us yeah so thank you so much of course congressman so my question is centered around the eviction crisis that many people are you know essentially forecasting after the köppen 19 virus you know the whole pandemic collapses what steps do you think the federal government should take to help you know renters who are going to be negatively impacted after the economic effects of the virus hits them yeah thanks that's I think that's that's coming we put a lot of money into the economy as you know use it through the cares act and there were a lot of problems and how that was implemented but if you step back it did a lot of good actually I'll tell you an amazing statistic in April average household income in America went up 10% highest increase in recorded history and that was all because of money that Congress pumped into the economy unemployment insurance the $1200 checks we sent out the the aid for small businesses to help them keep their employees on their payroll but a lot of that's going to run out and the economy is not going to come back right away because people are rightly very cautious so we got to do more and that's why we passed the heroes Act in the House a couple of weeks ago and we want to be working with the Senate to get that to the President's desk so he can sign it a big part of that was money that we are housing to deliver to state governments across America to help renters and you know by the way you help renters you're going to help landlords too so you know we're all connected if if a small business goes under its employees lose their jobs then the employees can't pay their rent which means that the landlord's of the places where the employees live can't pay the mortgage and you have this chain of negative effects that can only be stopped if you take care of every link in the chain and renters are one big link tange guy has a question for you Tom I'm gonna you ten guy go ahead I um you touched on the fact that it's hard to not focus on the back right now especially with like all that's going on right now but um especially with your experience in the Human Rights Watch and Obama administration my question surrounds like your thoughts when the events and protests in Hong Kong especially with like the parallels it draws to what we have right now you know so this is a really big deal it's it's a big deal from a from a moral point of view these are people just like us who live in a democratic piece of a an extremely repressive authoritarian dictatorship and you know you guys know the history Hong Kong was a British colony and when it was turned over to China in the late 1990s the Chinese government made a promise that there would be we would have one country Hong Kong and China would be one country that there would be two systems one country two systems that they would not impose communism or dictatorship on the people of Hong Kong they continue to have their freedoms including freedom of speech and ever since then China has been steadily breaking that promise bit by bit and what they recently announced was they were going to pass a national security law that would allow people living in Hong Kong to be prosecuted under Chinese law for things like protesting peacefully speaking out against the government in Beijing so this if implemented will completely suffocate this one bastion of political freedom in in China so what can we do about it well we've condemned it we've said all the stuff that we need to say we're consider during legislation in Congress that would allow us to punish Chinese officials responsible for implementing this law with economic sanctions there's one bigger thing that I think we should do one thing that is much more bold and I'm working on legislation to do this right now and that is to say that the United States would be willing to take in anybody in Hong Kong who is being persecuted for their beliefs and anybody in Hong Kong who has a graduate degree anyone who owns a business with more than a certain number of people basically to say to the Chinese government if you suffocate Hong Kong if you follow through with this then we are going to take all that the wealthiest brightest most talented people we're going to give them a chance to come to America and they can rebuild Hong Kong right here so don't do it or you will lose the wealth and talent of this amazing place to us and your loss will be our game I don't believe that you know 99.9% of people living in Hong Kong want to come to America they love it there it's a great place to live it's their home it's their culture it's where their families are from but the knowledge that they could come here if things got really bad I think would be a deterrent it would help to dissuade the Chinese government from crushing the place because they crushed it they would lose all the things that make it valuable I'm your next question is from amar Tia I just unmuted you and your euros mr. congressman thank you again so much for being on this call my question is similar to you spoke about HR 1 the four people act and how really strengthening democracy reforming campaign finance really ties into every one of these issues and so my question for is your opinion on an amendment to repeal citizens united and its current status in Washington right now thank you so Citizens United for anybody who might not know is the Supreme Court decision that said that corporations of our people and that money is speech and if you put those two things together it means that corporations can spend an unlimited amount of money to influence elections in our country and people can spend an unlimited amount of money if I have a billion dollars I can take half a billion dollars and pump it into this election on behalf of whatever candidate or cause I might want so because it was a Supreme Court decision the only way we can change it is by amending the Constitution I am very strongly in favor of an amendment to repeal the Citizens United decision that could pass the house although I'm not sure if we would get the the two-thirds margin yet that we need to send it to the states and I know we couldn't get it in the Senate with the the makeup of the Senate that we currently have but actually I hope that we you know we've not actually had that vote in the house this year I'm a strong advocate of having that vote because I want to show the American people where we stand and what we would do with the additional power the additional representation that we are asking for the Democratic Party to have tell him your next question is from Sophie I just unmuted you Sophie hear us I can hear you three good thank you so much for speaking with us it means a lot as Tessa students with Trump is power-hungry as he is and with everything going on in the country right now the pandemic the protests and so much more what is Congress doing or what can Congress do to prevent Trump's attempts at massive voter suppression this November so it's a really good question the easy answer but not very satisfying answer as we passed HR 1 which if enacted what would really make it hard to continue these practices but of course it's not going through the Senate and the president wouldn't sign it because it's not gonna sign something that that stops him from doing what he thinks he should be doing somehow for his reelection in the Kerr's Act which we passed to deal with the corona virus we we tried to do something else we tried to require every state to allow everyone to vote by mail to vote from home and to allow early voting to basically make it a lot easier for people to vote during the pandemic and we provided a lot of money for states to improve their their election systems to make those things possible and again the Senate said no to the mandate for states to do anything but they did allow the money which is helping states that have better leadership to make it easier to vote this November including New Jersey beyond that we're gonna have to work state by state county by county town by town we're gonna need to have activists everywhere keeping an eye out for any shenanigans that might happen on the other side the good news is very hard to hide anything in America these days we know pretty pretty much instantly when people are up to no good and we can mobilize against it I was both very disturbed and depressed but also inspired by what happened in Wisconsin when the state legislature there refused to delay the election the primary election earlier this year despite the coronavirus forced people to go out and line up risk their lives to vote that was the worst voter suppression I've seen in America in a very long time and yet you know what people said to hell with it we're still going to go out and vote and the Republicans lost the race therefore the state Supreme Court that they were so desperate to win despite all the voter suppression they lost so you know that's in the end got to be our strategy we are gonna face some structural obstacles in November but the only way to fix our voting system the only way to fix our elections is to win some elections under the system we have and we just have to get people out we have to work twice as hard we can do that then we fix it we've got time for two more questions so I'm going to go to Briana first Briana I just unmuted you go ahead you for taking the time out of your day to do this it's not often that teens really get the opportunity to speak directly with our leadership members of the country so I really thank you my question is in light of stay-at-home orders it has been seen that domestic abuse cases are rising so my question is what plans does Congress have to aid victims and help them get out of poor situations as a result of the stay at home lawyers put in place yeah it's a really it's a really good question and you could have predicted that that would have happened we have to do the state of motors I think it was the right thing to do but obviously it puts some vulnerable folks in a position of even greater vulnerability I'll give you the most practical answer that I can because most of the work that has done too directly fight domestic abuse in our country is done at the state and local level because state and local governments are closer to people and they can set up programs in in communities to to give people experiencing those tragic circumstances a lifeline if they need it to train local police departments in recognizing domestic abuse when they see it and in knowing what to do if they encounter it and so what can the federal government do the most important thing we can do is to help our state and local governments survive right now because that's also a potential casualty of the coronavirus tax revenues for our state and local governments for growing up because the you know businesses are closed and economic activity is slowed down so that means less taxes our state and local governments have to balance their budgets unlike the federal government and so if they're getting less in taxes they have to cut things or they have to raise our local taxes in to you know German in a dramatic way which none of us want to see certainly your parents don't want to see that so in the heroes Act which we just passed the most important part of that bill is that we provide very very generous aid to state and local governments every municipality in New Jersey would get some aid under that bill if we can get it through the Senate and that's going to enable them to just continue to do good more counting people facing those difficulties and if we don't provide it guess what's gonna get cut first right because they have to they have to fund your schools that's not optional but a domestic violence program it's super important but they might decide that that's something that has to go great um Tom your next question is from [Music] Caitlin Caitlin I just unmuted you but high so I currently reside in Warren New Jersey and we've had numerous issues with race in the past um for example we had a blackface incident during Halloween this past year and currently we're having a lot of issues with censorship in our community for when it comes to talking about black lives matter and all this has been met with our town leaders simply just missing or not really fully addressing the problem at hand so with that said how do you suggest we hold our local leaders and our neighbors accountable when it comes to their complicity I didn't know about the censorship issue where's that how's that taking place so in Warren New Jersey we have Warren Township community forum and it's currently run and moderated by three non black indigenous people of color they're I think one of them is on the board of education in our town and so what's going on right now is that we someone shared a document related to I think supporting black lives matter and just like funding and resources for people to look into which I've been seeing like circulating a lot on social media right now but um those people were kicked out and the reason that they were kicked out according to our town was because it was considered a hate speech and so there's been a lot of divisive issues right now within our town when it comes to talking about race and we're not a hundred percent sure how to deal with the issue and I'd seem like a lot of people I think someone just said in the group chat right now that the same problem is kind of happening all over our towns around us so we're not a hundred percent sure how to approach it and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for this well you know you should probably we should probably have a separate conversation about this because that's disturbing to me obviously there are sensitive issues here but there's nothing hateful about supporting black lives matter I just marched with 1500 mostly white suburban kids and parents and southern New Jersey in support of black lives matter what we're doing that you know warns a slightly more conservative town which is fine but this is not you know this is something we're discussing at the national level and we should be discussing it in our local communities as well so I'm happy maybe my team can can sit down with you and help you know to strategize an appropriate way to get your voices heard and to counter any inappropriate censorship if that's what's happening I would say to you that you have like organized young people are a lot more powerful online than some middle-aged person running a community forum so I don't want you to feel helpless or disempowered when something like this happens you know my guess is that you can run circles around these people if you really put your mind to it there's an old saying that or an old phrase what you just did is not just a crime it's a blunder not the words you know what you did isn't just wrong but even worse it's a mistake you made a strategic tactical mistake and and sometimes you can even get more attention or an issue that you care about when somebody tries to prevent you from speaking about it you know if those folks in Warren who we're trying to suppress the speech came to me for advice I'd say man why are you doing this those kids are just going to get more attention right if you let them speak probably no one's good you know that's gonna be another thing on the internet but if you if it becomes a big free speech issue then they're gonna get a lot more attention to their underlying message so maybe they're giving you an opportunity here if you make it a free speech issue to actually get more attention in the community for the message that you want to deliver so you know and I'm sure that that almond Daniel and some of our more experienced interns would be happy to brainstorm ways to to do that with you thank you yeah I'd love to talk about it and it seems like there's other people and other towns that are having the same issue so can keep the dialogue open on that I'm excited yeah that's both bad but also an opportunity for you because you can you know there's strength in numbers if you can find a way to coordinate with them then you know you can you can make some noise you know one way would be to get local media to write a story about and I'm sure that you know we can we can help hook you up with with local journalists who might be interested in something like that have you cream I appreciate it sure sure um Caitlin if you want a private message me or info oh I'm sure I can connect you with some folks on the campaign that sounds great thank you I will do that for sure on that note thank you everyone for being here tonight thank you Rachel and David for helping us host this thank you Tom for being here as well I hope this was engaging and we'll definitely have more opportunities for you guys to speak to the congressman in the months ahead wonderful thank you so much everybody thanks for your interest in enthusiasm and activism and you know stay stay hopeful and stay optimistic you have a lot of power so that you can't see but but I think if you stick to it you're gonna see with patience you're gonna see that you do have the power to change things and it's in all of our interests that you succeed so I'm so so proud you're on my team and I hope you know that I'm on your team I'm gonna sign off thank you Tom um we've also posted so for our internship application on in the chat so feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions about that thank you guys

they leave for august recess and with us now to talk about this and some other topics is virginia senator tim kaine senator good morning thanks for being here you bet lindsay glad to be with you so what would this bill mean for your constituents in virginia and for the american people well it's going to do great work for virginians and others because it will bring down prescription drug costs it will extend premium support for people who buy health care on the exchanges the announcement came out two days ago that the uninsured rate in the united states is at the lowest it has ever been because of this premium support we put into the american rescue plan it will continue that and it will also dramatically accelerate our path to a cleaner energy economy in virginia what that means is offshore wind where we are positioned to be a national leader there's also one other really important provision that's a health care provision that matters in virginia which is fully funding the black lung benefits program that protects the health care of our minors and minor retirees excise taxes that supported that program had expired about a year ago this permanently funds the program so that our minors and their families will get the health protection they've earned senator are you concerned about getting support among your entire caucus we know senator cinema wants to make a couple of changes one of them would be nixing that tax loophole another would be drought funding if if those are added is that something you'd support um look i'm i'm going to be very glad to vote for this bill there's going to be some things in it i may not like and then there be there will be some things that are not in the bill that i wish were but the overall package is is great in terms of fighting inflation and helping our economy expand um so they're right there's sort of three issues between now and when we get to final passage um first the parliamentarian is ruling upon the pieces of the bill to make sure that they all fit within the reconciliation framework second senator cinema and other dems have to look at the final package and say yes we know we'll get zero republican votes for this bill and then third we have to go through a grueling amendment process and hope that there aren't poison pill amendments added that cause a good bill to turn into a bad bill so we've got some work to do over the next few days but i am very confident we're going to get to a good place hopefully by the end of the weekend and put this bill into the house and ultimately on president biden's desk what are your poison pill amendments what can you not get behind well the amendments have not been filed yet lindsay so but what we know is that the trade and a reconciliation bill as it passes by simple majority doesn't take 60 votes but that but the trade is then it's unlimited amendments and so the other side will put in amendments on immigration they'll put in amendments on inflation they try to put in a lot of gotcha amendments and you could conceivably have an amendment that would be so destructive that if it were added then it would raise questions about the support of the bill and that's why i hope democrats stick together we can vote for amendments that will help the bill we should vote down any amendments that will hurt chances of final passage there is a piece of bipartisan legislation senator that you and your colleagues cinema collins and murkowski have introduced that would codify roe v wade protections into law but another couple of your colleagues senators blumenthal and warren they say they plan to vote no because it doesn't go far enough how do you get this across the finish line there there are some who do not believe it goes far enough our goal was a very specific one which is sort of use a time machine and return american law to where it was before dobbs was decided where people get a statutory right to reproductive freedom that was what the constitutional law was before dobbs now some don't like that constitutional law pre-jobs obviously the right wants to overturn it all and some don't think it goes far enough our goal was to show that there is a bipartisan majority in the senate that wants to codify row we can have a good faith discussion about the best way to do that but earlier votes on the women's health protection plan only got 49 votes and i thought it was not a good thing to send a message that there wasn't even a majority of the senate willing to codify roe we've shown that there's a different path it's bipartisan and we've demonstrated that there's a majority to do it i think we're ultimately going to get there on a bill to create a statutory guarantee because the post-doc reality of 10 year olds getting smuggled across state lines to receive an abortion following rape as well as the referenda the powerful referendum results in kansas and other states i think that post-ops reality is is is creating a groundswell of support for a federal statutory guarantee senator tim kaine thank you absolutely all right we want to take

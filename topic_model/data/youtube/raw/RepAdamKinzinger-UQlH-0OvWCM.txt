let's bring in republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois illinois thank you so much uh congressman you know what drives me crazy is there are some of these guys that actually went to law school when they went to law school at really good supposed really good law schools and i've been hearing them lie about what the united states constitution says and what the united states constitution does not say about guns for a very very long time so i just got to ask you sir i'm just curious why is it so important that we have 18 year olds have the right to buy a military-style weapon or two r2 on their 18th birthday that actually is more lethal and deadly than the m16s we gave our soldiers and marines in vietnam look i think it's a good question uh so federally this is i think people kind of mistake what are the laws out there and this is important federally nowhere in this country can you buy a handgun under the age of 21 okay so if you look at that and say but that means that there is no federal red there's no federal requirement for a year for age of 21 for long rifles so if you think about that what was a long rifle and why would it make sense to say 18 and above at that time it was probably a 22. it was probably a shotgun i guarantee you it wasn't the consideration of an ar-15 and by the way look i'm a gun owner you know all those caveats i'm a second amendment supporter but for those that try to imply that a pistol versus an ar situation is the same because they both shoot bullets it is a vastly different exchange of gunfire if a untrained shooter has an ar-15 against somebody that is extremely trained with a handgun it is maybe a level playing field so i think we have to this is very we just raise the age of purchasing cigarettes for god's sakes to 21. the age of buying alcohol is 21. i think the age to buy a gun should be 21. and people can come to me with all the caveats about well they can serve in the military i'll say the same thing about drinking beer by the way between the age of 18 and 21 but i want to remind people that in the military you have access to weapons but the military deeply and and intensely controls when you can have that weapon when you can carry it and when you can have ammo you don't get to take it home and put it under your pillow so that's really important for people to realize and you're trained as you know for months and months and months and how to use that in some states now you don't even need a permit or any training to have an ar-15 um so as you watch this debate congressman uh both as someone who supports the second amendment a republican somebody who served in the military and now someone who's inside for a few more months anyway inside the united states congress do you see any will do you see any way that something will change you're different than after sandy hook when we said this changes everything and it didn't really though some things change at the state level as joe said is there any will are there any republicans that you talk to that you know say we can't go on like this well yeah i mean when i talk to him privately you know that story the same as like the trump issue um look i i gotta say to anybody that's you know in a position similar to mine that would take a vote on this it's really hard to come out the first time and say we need universal background checks even though ninety percent of your fellow americans agree to say we need to raise the age we need to do something about you know high-capacity magazines but the second you do it you get all the text messages that are angry and then you get over it you feel really liberating you can talk to people and tell the truth now let me also say too that as second amendment defenders the answer to defend your second amendments isn't to go out and stand in the middle of the friggin michigan state house with an ar-15 because you're tough and you can do that it's actually to find responsible ways to make gun ownership for those that are willing to obey the law and to be very aggressive about locking up those that wouldn't about locking up criminals and about saying let's keep guns out of the hands of those that can't handle it that's how you defend a second amendment right it's not to you know wear a half shirt and stand in the middle of a you know a state building because you can because you have the right to open carry and by the way all these states like every state can make their own decision on this constitutionally concealed carry i'm a big supporter of open carry uh is a really weird thing when you're walking around with an air 15 just because you can't start it is so it is so bizarre i mean in the nra even used to say it was bizarre and as david french says i mean david's a big second amendment's second amendment rights guy he also talks about how bizarre it is and it also like why would you do that just why would you do that it just it makes no sense it's a fetish it's a gun it's a gun fetish it's like worshiping guns because somehow i think for you know look at these social media accounts it's people that you know maybe it's part of a mental health thing that don't feel they're adequate they have you know they're they're they feel less than they should uh and so they have to pose with guns and it's it's sad and it and it it makes it look cool there's a lot of there's a lot of people doing a lot of things and suggesting a lot of things to compensate for a lack of manhood i won't even get into the tanning aspect of this thank you a lot of people who questioned their manhood right now talking about doing some really really bizarre things uh congressman you're on the committee investigating the january 6th attack on the capitol and want to get your response to the new reporting we have this morning concerning donald trump and his reaction to the chanting that he heard from his supporters on that day outside that capital the chant was hang mike pence the following account from the new york times says according to two people familiar with the work of the committee investigating the attack reading from the times quote shortly after hundreds of writers at the capitol started chanting hang of mike pence on january 6 2021 the white house chief of staff mark meadows left the dining room off the oval office walked into his own office and told colleagues that president donald j trump was complaining that the vice president was being whisked to safety mr meadows according to an account provided to the house committee investigating january 6th then told the colleagues that mr trump had said something to the effect of maybe mr pence should be hanged it's not clear what tone mr trump was said to have used according to the times at least one witness provided this account to the january 6th committee three sources gave politico the same account reporting that more than one witness testified that trump expressed support for hanging his vice president nbc news has not independently verified the claims in this reporting a lawyer for meadows told the new york times he has every reason to believe that the account of what mr meadows said is untrue i guess that's the real problem congressman is you have people that work for donald trump who heard what donald trump said people who worked for mark meadows who heard what mark meadows said and it seems that many of them were deeply deeply offended what can you tell us well look i i wish i could confirm or deny that officially since it didn't come from the committee i won't but we are you know going to have folsom hearings in june so we'll talk about all things related to this but let me just say uh kind of on a little broader of that there's no doubt the vice president was in danger on january 6 with rioters filling the capital and we're going to do a better job of showing just how close that was by the way there's no doubt that the number three in command for the presidency the speaker of the house was in danger and all the way down the line we were very close closer than people realize to basically a decapitation of government underneath the president so imagine now a president of the united states decided he's not going to leave and then people that you know would be number two number three number four all within striking range of rioters you're of insurrectionist you can see the danger that we were in we need we'll lay that out to people and look there's no doubt the president has very little remorse because have you ever heard him express remorse i haven't yeah let me ask you congressman also about mike pence being in danger i'd heard from one of these many accounts that we've seen in books we've seen in books and read about uh in papers about what happened on january the 6th that mike pence and his entourage may have been concerned uh with security uh with and uh with secret service uh and uh and and took alternate steps to make sure his own people were with him can you tell us can you give us any insight there look i wish i could again it's it's something i i don't know what's been released officially from the committee on that and hasn't so i'll just we're going to save it till june when i hope people watch this story from the beginning to the end but look again it's it's we never should be in this position this is the united states of america where we spend billions of dollars rightly every year to ensure that we defend the line of secession of the presidency and the president themselves if we end up in a position where that is in danger where you know people don't believe that their vote counts or they're told that democracy is rigged democracy can't survive it's that serious the good news is we're about to have some accountability and hopefully doj this is outside of a decision by the house doj takes a lot of the evidence that we can provide and decide whether there's criminal charges or not and that's all i can say on that congressman adam kinzinger thank you very much

miss Baker ladies and gentlemen the house all of us through our lives meet people particularly when we were young and i'm sure this happened to people who were with leaders of our country thomas jefferson a young man i'm sure there were people who met thomas jefferson when he was 25 and they said to themselves well this guy's really got his head in the clouds and then he became one of the great people of democracies in our world when I was 23 years of age in 1962 I was working for a united states senator his name was Daniel Brewster from our state of Maryland and that summer he hired as an intern a young woman younger than me but about my age close and we had the opportunity to get to know one another and we SAT approximately 12 feet from one another as a young college graduate and a young wall school student that was nineteen sixty-two through the years I stayed in Maryland that young woman got married and moved to California and just a few years later I came to the Congress the United States and six years later she came to the Congress of the United States after having been the chairman of her party in the largest state in the union having been very much involved with the United States Senate having been a leader in our country not as a member of Congress but in her role as a significant party leader and a member of the Democratic National Committee and salad Burton died herself a member of a distinguished political family this young woman ran for Congress in the United States her father had served in the Congress of the United States that a member the Appropriations Committee been mayor of Baltimore City and been the father of a mayor of Baltimore City how proud he would be of this young daughter he raised it his knee not frankly as somewhat caricatured as a San Francisco but as a Baltimore City Paul I say that with great affection who knew how to put neighborhoods together who knew how to take care of citizens in that city that's where she learned her politics and as Thomas Jefferson had people who attacked him bitterly she's had the same we all have that in this game that we participate in that we care deeply about that young woman that I first worked with in 1962 became the highest ranking woman in the history of our country in our government and now we note some celebrate others note her attaining of a quarter of a century of service in this body and all of us will be able to tell our grandchildren and I have my grandchildren now maybe i'll have more but i have a number of them now and a number of them are young women and i tell them how proud they can be of the leadership in the trail that has been blazedd by this extraordinary and I've talked to a number of you on the Republican side of the aisle of my good friend Roy Blunt and he says to me he said boy that woman has a spine of Steel and that she does those of us who have dealt with her now that she's one of the strongest leaders any of us have served with whether you agree with her or don't agree with her and so I rise mr. speaker to note this anniversary of 25 years of service of Nancy dalesandro pelosi from the state of maryland and the peri Brown ground state of Maryland to have a daughter like Nancy and a state that is proud of its citizen servant Nancy Pelosi and so I now yield and so on and so I now yield he can I so ladies ladies and gentlemen I now have the great honor of yielding to my friend he's of a different party we're both Americans we both love this institution and he is now himself not quite as historic figure because they've been many men who have been Speaker of the House of Representatives but my friend John Boehner Speaker of the House like let me thank my friend mr. Boyer for yielding under the speaker i rise today to commend our colleague the gentlelady from California on her 25 years of service to the substitution you know it's the latest in a series of milestones of the gentlelady from California on January the 4th 2007 I had the privilege of presenting leader Pelosi the gavel when she became the first speaker of the house the first female speaker of the house but you know just as important as as this anniversary is in and of itself it also represents 25 years of commitment and service to this institution now you know the gentlelady from California and I have different different political philosophies and we've had some real battles here on the floor over the 22 years that I've served with her about many of you know that the gentlelady and I have a very very workable relationship and we get along with each other fine we treat each other very nicely and actually have a warm relationship but because we all serve in this institution and we all have work to do to protect the institution and serve the institution and I can tell all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that I enjoy my relationship work with her and enjoy our ability to work together now it doesn't mean all right we're going to agree on taxes whether we're going to agree on spending but uh I know I speak for the whole house when I rise today to say to the gentlelady from California mrs.

Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding in our the political life that we have here in our service to the American people I take great pride and always saying when somebody says to me were you surprised when somebody did this that or this bill did better that I say I'm hardly ever surprised in politics because I know what the possibilities are I am thoroughly surprised today had absolutely no idea that the mischief that that mr. Hoyer was up to going back decades I might add but I thank him for his kind words and all of you for your nice reception and I thank the speaker for his gracious comments as well while he was speaking I was remembering while my goodness were taking up time on the floor and it's person on that but then I was recalling that it wasn't that long ago when we maybe five six years ago we came to the floor to acknowledge of that then speaker Hastert was the longest serving republican speaker of the house and we made much ado about that landmarks though I comfortably accept your kind words since we could have a bet I think and I said long may his record stand at that time the that passes for human humor in certain circles the as a gentleman were speaking I was recalling when I was the first speaker and sitting in the chair to welcome the President of the United States to the chamber for the first time and it was President George W Bush and President Bush surprised me that day too when he opened his remarks by saying to the gathered crowd of that many speakers and had a privilege of speaking any a president's had come to the Congress to speak to a joint session but none of them had ever opened their remarks with these two words madam Speaker and he he then went on to say that although my father had served in Congress with President Roosevelt and President Truman and that was a tremendous honor for him little that compared to the idea that his he said something like baby girl was sitting in the chair as Speaker of the House we that was an honor for me his father honored me for my 25th anniversary President George Herbert Walker Bush on President's Day by inviting me to speak to his library the bush library at Texas A&M we recalled a time of civility in the Congress when he was president and we had our disagreements as as the speaker acknowledged we still do but we did so with great civility and that was what we talked about that day I considered that a great honor and I consider this a great honor to serve with each and every one of you Patriots all representatives independent representatives of your district and that word has two meanings it's your title it's also our job description that we represent our districts and bring the beautiful diversity of opinion of ethnicity of generations of geography a philosophy to the Congress of the United States the beauty and I say in my district is in the mix and while I'm very honored to have served as the Speaker of the House first woman Speaker of the House verse italian-american Speaker of the House 1st Maryland speaker of the house first California Speaker of the House many first it always is the greatest privilege of my life as I sure it is with each of you to step on the floor of the house to represent and speak for the people of each of our individual districts so I thank you mr. speaker for your kind words while as you said we may not always agree on taxes we did at one time when President Bush was president and we work together at that time to on his stimulus package which was tax oriented you remember that and and it was good for the country and it was a good model for us to go forward it's an honor to serve with you a speaker while I with great joy accepted the gavel from you that first time it wasn't so joyful to hand it back over but nonetheless it's all in the chamber and that's where we all serve for the American people Steny you don't know when you know where but one day one day I will repay this magnificent honor you have extended to me by taking me totally by surprise and wait till I talk to my staff about this later Steny Hoyer the great patriot a great Maryland or a great American a great member of Congress a members member a person who respects every person he serves with Steny Hoyer Mr Speaker I know I speak for everyone in the chamber when I say we are proud to call you colleagues thank you so much for this out this big I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back you

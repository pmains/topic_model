thank you let me just say I am pleased and honored to join my colleague senator Harrison senator Merkley and introducing the reunite Act I don't have to tell all of you this crisis that we are in was completely manufactured by this administration completely manufactured we're here today because this administration put in an inhumane policy thinking it was okay for deterrent purposes to separate parents from their children from toddlers it is outrageous as Americans what we value in this country are our families and our kids and always always looking out for the best interests of our kids and doing them no harm and I'll tell you what I don't care whether you are from the United States you're from Nicaragua Honduras or what country you are from we should all be looking out for the best interests of children and their families and my stories are no different I went down to the border I wanted to see for myself not only how this administration was using our taxpayer dollars our taxpayer dollars to house these children and their families and when I showed up at one of the facilities that was housing our de toddlers casa president and it would not let me in that older they have a locked door they even refused to sit down and just talk to me about how they were treating the children the accommodations for the children and how long they have been there and the ages of the children the gender of the children and what we were doing in the future to look out for the best interest to me outrageous outrageous and then I went to Isabel Detention Facility to talk to the parents and Senator Harris is right and we both know as former attorneys general I've been to the prisons in the state of Nevada and this is about detention facility is no different than the prisons I visited as the Attorney General in the state of Nevada these parents are being detained in prison they have no idea what's happening to their children I've talked with six mothers for Father's and each one of them told me the same thing they asked me where their child is and they asked me what was going on in the outside world and how long they were going to be there because what they told me is they have access to one TV and anytime the news comes on about family detention or what's happening to the border the channel has changed they are put in coveralls colored coveralls they're told when to eat when they can go out in the yard and get some fresh air and then they're back in their cells or some sort of detained facility and have no idea what's happening and each one of them had the same story and I will tell you I don't know how you could not sit and listen to the stories that these mothers and fathers said with tears in their eyes and not be outraged by what this administration has done they've come from foreign countries because they are not safe where they are Claire wouldn't pick up their child and take them to a country that is known for protecting others wouldn't ana had a five-year-old daughter and she did that because her daughter was being threatened and she was being threatened with her life and so she made the decision to leave her home country her own country their language that she knows her country that she grew up in who wants to do that she had to be for the safety of her family and she trekked across 3,000 miles 3,000 miles of dangerous terrain and difficult terrain to get to our border knowing what she had been told that Americans will protect you Americans will be there to fight for you and when she saw the Border Patrol she thought my god I finally made it I'm here and she waved them down thinking with my daughter we are going to be protected and what do they do they lock her up they lock her up and then they tell her you need to take your five year old daughter and you need to either put her on that bus or we will do it for you but we're taking your child away from you and it was the first time she and her daughter had ever ever been separated and every single Dora that I heard from those parents was the same Griselda did the same thing with her family she had a small business and they were extorting her for money and we don't pay those gangs and the criminals the money then they threaten you with your life or your children's life or your daughter can be raped and killed and so she came to this country for that protection to protect her family and I said to every single one of these parents why don't you call the police why didn't you go to the police for protection and they looked at me and said there's nobody there to protect us but we know and we've heard that Americans do just that and that's why we're here it was outrageous and I don't care you whether you're a parent you're not a parent this is not who we are as a country but this policy and let's be clear this policy was dreamed up by this administration they never ever had an intent to reunite these children with their parents never never had an intent and believe me I've talked with them it's not in their policies or protocols they've never had to do it before so they've never done it and that's what's happening here and what you have are various agencies whether it's Border Patrol or ice or Homeland Security which oversees those two and HHS which which oversees the refugee resettlement program they're not communicating they don't share information when the families come in they give them an alien ID number and that's it they don't say who they're connected to if their parents came with them they don't say who where they're from other than you've got an alien ID number and now we're gonna sort you like you're cattle based on your gender based on your age I went to the processing center where they're actually keeping these families and some kids in these I I don't know how to say it but it looked like these little cells that were put together by chain-link fence and they sorted them based on their age and their gender it was outrageous and I went to talk to two mothers who had just come here and you could tell they still had the clothes that they came over in they had not been able to take showers and they were standing in front of young toddlers who were sitting on a mat behind them and I assume those were their kids and I said my goodness where did you come what's going on how long have you been here and how long have your kids been there and I said oh these aren't our kids our boys who are their teenagers they're housed right over there in another facility and we can't see them they're in the same building but we can't see them because they are separating them based on their age and gender can you imagine your your child is there but you don't get the opportunity even see or talk to that child it's outrageous so we need policies we need to continue to fight for these families I told those parents I would tell their stories and bring them here and that people in this country are fighting for them and that's what this is about we do not stop fighting because this is about our values who we are as Americans and what we project around the world that when people are in need and there is threat and they're being perpetrator secured or theirs threat of violence against them that we will help them and that's what this is about so thank you so much my colleagues and all of you for caring enough to be here today and continuing to tell this story and fight with us thank you

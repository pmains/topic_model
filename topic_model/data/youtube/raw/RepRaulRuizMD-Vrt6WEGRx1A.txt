the life of local veteran Jennifer Kepner plus I'm Jake and gracio with more coming up on the growing concern in Valley communities about stopping monkeypox spread before major Pride celebrations less than two months away you're watching kesq the deserts News Leader this is NewsChannel 3 live at six a local veteran remembered today at the White House with the signing of the honoring are packed act by President Biden John White first brought you this story about Jennifer Kepner in 2017 and today he was there as this bill was signed into law and John joins us now live from the nation's capital with more on this John what can he tell us well Karen Peter we are here in the nation's capital we are at the White House earlier today and now at the U.S Capitol because of local veteran Jennifer Kepner as you know five years ago she shared her story with me at about that same time she was sharing her story about cancer and toxic burn pit exposure with local Congressman Dr Raul Ruiz and others [Music] and may God protect our troops now I'm going to walk over and sign that legislation President Biden signing the honoring our Pac deck a long battle waged by local Congressman Dr rol Ruiz in honor of Jennifer Kepner and many others culminating in a major expansion of veterans benefits I was there for the signing in the East room and then talked with the congressman on the North Lawn of the White House Jennifer Kepner was The Ultimate Fighter who who until her last breath was fighting for other veterans and she became a very strong source of inspiration for me and it's in her honor and her family's honor that that we got this done the congressman also celebrating with comedian and activist Jon Stewart in this video at the bill signing this guy would come out to the press conferences and spitfire spit facts crush it John Stewart with the Game Changer in this In This Moment In The Name of Jennifer Kepner and the Kepner family and all those better than we fought for Stewart heavily involved in fighting for veterans getting wide praise from the the president and we owe you big man and from veterans groups you often see some kind of superstars show up here to grab attention and testify they really don't know what they're talking about this is a guy that it goes much deeper than even this issue but the day really belonged to those who fought for their country captain Leroy Torres has battled for 13 years struggling with his health losing his job fighting for benefits When I first uh I had my lung biopsy in 2010 that he discovered that I had a lung injury the constructive bronchitis percocular fibrosis that in itself just just the hearing that uh you know it was irreversible and it's permanent then to facing job loss so not only it was such a compound loss not only with my health but then losing my job because of what related illness he was with President Biden for the signing I presented him one of our coins for Grandpa's 360. my sister in honor of Beau and the many affected that are no longer here to present you this coin it just that was oh there yeah then he swapped I can clearly reminded him that there's so then he yeah they presented me his coins so well his wife Rosie Torres started the organization burn pits 360 to fight for veterans who believed they were getting sick because of those burn bits veterans like Jennifer Kepner who left her this voicemail well I'm living in what you have to say and trying to figure out what my next step is so she really you know um planted her flag on that platform and said you know until my last breath I'm gonna fight and that's exactly what she did it was her dying wish and while she knew she was dying she asked me to help other veterans not to go through what she went through and that is very selfless and that is a hero in my book an emotional day at the White House here in the nation's capital Congressman Ruiz invited Jennifer kepner's husband Ben to be here for the White House signing today unfortunately he was not able to make it but she certainly was remembered here for helping to get the discussion started at a time where Dr Ruiz did not know a lot about burn pits and so it took time for people to learn and get caught up to speed on what was happening to a lot of the veterans in this country live at the Capitol John White NewsChannel 3. and you certainly had a hand in that bringing the community that story in 2017. so John what happens next well there's a lot of discussion today about now getting the word out and trying to let millions of veterans know that these benefits are going to be available if they have one of these presumptive illnesses that will automatically be connected to their service time and so uh there's a big effort now kind of a public relations push and people who think that they may have one of these illnesses can go to the va's website and begin that process and you can find a link to that on our website kesq.com powerful story John thanks good reporting from D.C thank you John our in-depth coverage continues now as we have reported the purpose of The Pact Act is to help veterans exposed to toxins while serving and their families get the health care and benefits they need but how do you go about applying for these benefits well if you are a veteran and have not filed a claim yet for an illness that The Pact act links to toxic exposure you can file a new claim online now we have a link to that on kesu.com if you filed a claim previously and were denied but now you think your condition makes you eligible you can file a supplemental claim the VA says that they will preview and review that claim again an important note to keep in mind although the VA is encouraging veterans who are eligible to apply as soon as they can the claims will not be processed until January so you will have to wait officials say they are waiting for funding to arrive from Congress but if you apply now and get approved they will likely backdate your benefits to today NewsChannel 3's live coverage in Washington D.C is supported by the Coachella Valley journalism foundation and does not end here tonight you can find a full breakdown of the changes veterans can expect and links to help you apply along with all of John White's i-team investigations with Kepner on this issue right now on kesq.com

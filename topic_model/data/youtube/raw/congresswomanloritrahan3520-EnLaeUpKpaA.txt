well good afternoon and thank you for joining us we were just having a little moment because we haven't seen each other the last time I saw you in DC we were all behind masks like even close to give a hug and so it's so nice to see both of you but it's also nice for I think us to just chat about what we're working on how it's all going these last eight weeks have been tough and acknowledging that I think is is really important I know I had to juggle being not just a representative to the district that I've lived in my whole life and I love but I'm becoming a teacher to my children juggling all sorts of things that these are are certainly long and I think first and foremost I'm just looking out for the mental health of my children you know if you guys know I tell my ten-year-old grace who I normally share a lot of information with and give her kind of access to all that I'm doing right now it's hard I mean she here she goes to bed crying every night she misses her grandmother and once her a big hug and so explaining that you know in keeping everybody's spirits up has been probably one of the bigger challenges while you know sort of juggling everything that we're all doing in terms of bringing relief to workers and our families and our seniors and our small businesses so one it's just great to see you both and I'm so happy that we get to have this conversation together so I thought in in terms of the proximity of Mother's Day it would also be nice to have other moms or tuning in see that you know we're juggling the same things that they are and that this this Sunday well maybe in past years I would have asked for specific gifts now I'm just asking to sleep in and you know certainly we were all kind of looking out you know for for each other and getting through this together is like what you see in a community right everyone is getting together helping out and so let's let's just get right into it I I want to introduce first and foremost my my esteemed colleague Katherine Clark who proudly represents Massachusetts fifth congressional district she has been a guiding light for for me as a first-term congresswoman she is in our leadership and she communicates and helps me sort of Usher through the priorities of my district to the negotiating table on all of these packages I'm so grateful to call you a friend Katherine and and I'm so excited to see you and to be able to answer questions so please Katherine Clark Oh Laurie thank you it is so wonderful to see you and Ayana I am actually here in DC so I'm missing you both even more flew down today for an appropriations hearing and it was very weird not to have my posse at the airport seeing you all in the halls and on the floor but we will all adjust to that and I can tell you that in my family my kids are a little older than yours so my youngest is a senior in high school and we've been dealing with all that disappointment of having school canceled graduation prom final sport seasons but in all the big ways we know how fortunate we are and I watched my neighbor who's a nurse working very long hours so afraid of bringing this virus home and we know that store plays out over and over throughout our communities and I am so grateful for the the work that you've been doing Laurie really lifting up not only your community health centers community colleges but all the work in being that example of juggling adding to your variable calendar being a full time teacher as well and and we're just you know I'm unconscious I'm seeing in my communities and how people are are reaching out you know the stories of a doctor sleeping in her garage so she wouldn't get her family ill stories that I'm getting from my mayor's about the lines at food pantries and really heartbreaking lines I'm a dad who said he had gotten up too late to get in line and to get any groceries at his food pantry and he said I just have to be more responsible and get there earlier and just those heartbreaking stories but you and Ayanna are just out there talking about the access to health care the inequities that we always knew we're in our system that are coming to play for our low-income communities for communities of color and how they are being hit so hard by this virus and we all want to open but we know that it's going to take a lot of support to get there and we know that women are one out of every three of the essential worker jobs and that women are really already looking at being predominant in the fields of teaching and in teacher appreciation week we certainly want to make sure that we are remembering and honoring those I think there is a newfound respect for the role of teacher and what they're doing in this pandemic absolutely and then my my sister in my class you know I have the I have the distinct privilege of not only serving with you but entering the Congress with you in fact I'm just realizing you all had like you and I'll run for elected office before and so you understood the rigor whereas acting like the newbie aides so well the transition is different we're both a it's remember we have sweet so many you know similar ties that's exactly right which you know I think I harken back to that experience a lot in terms of navigating the halls of Congress but you know what I think of you know my ability to draft off of so many of the unbelievable causes and the activism and just the momentum that you create in a very short period of time in this congress it's it's it's it's one of the biggest honors and privileges to serve with my good friend Anna Presley so good some welcoming I welcome you I just want to say you know while we are physically distancing in the interest of Public Health I do appreciate the opportunity to just come together in virtual community and sisterhood and that is so important especially now and just what I do also want to while we're giving in a moment a love letter not only to our caregivers and frontline workers and all the moms and let me just say as a proud bonus mom you know but I find mom you know very inclusive in a very broad way because what is it to be a mom you know it's to love it's to be nurturing it's to be unconditional is to do you know anything to ensure that whoever you're mentoring or or whomever your child is by blood or by bond that they're never denied or deprive any opportunity in life and so this is an opportunity not only to shout out you know all the moms with a capital M but you know I appreciate a couple of seconds just to give a love letter to the two of you you know you have made captain and I've known each other for ever since she was in the state legislature and so we've always had that friendship in that bond and you know Lori it's been great to part of this freshman class a historic Congress unprecedented number of women serving the most diverse and representative class and to just navigate this this new landscape and in the midst of unprecedented hurt for our country when I try to contextualize her people that you know we came in in the midst of a federal government shutdown and for a lot of people belong Food lines and the disruption of those one or two paychecks being missed for a lot of people this was new to them that there were this many people that were living on the margins that were one disrupted life of it away from complete financial ruin now you Katherine myself pride ourselves on informed by our own lived experiences and struggles but also being close to our district we knew better so when you think about the number of people that were just living on the margins already and those great inequities and those disparities certainly koban 19 didn't create them but it is certainly further spotlighted and worse than them you know so how am i doing about as best as any of us could be I try to just sit in the gratitude and the blessing I had a health scare at the top of our being Congress recessing and I'm blessed that I'm in a home that I could physically distance and isolate and quarantine away from my family thankfully I had the flu and not cope at 19 but you know that we have the space that we can do that I'm blessed that I can work from home when we talk about the disparate impact with copa90 non-black and latin ex women and to Catherine's point about us dominating that essential workforce you know something like one in five African American and Latin X women can work from home one in five so the fact that you know we have the space that I have a home that I have I'm not worried about it but I can work from home is the last thing and then because a lot of people don't realize that we spend five days a week away from our family normally being in Washington and then coming back and wanting to be present in the district and responsive that this is value treasure time for us so you know Cora has introduced me to tick tock I only embarrassed myself with one video you can go check it out here so instead of dancing yeah yeah yeah one one sock video she started out doing a lot of baking I had to slow that down and so we should who transition too much boring you know you know cornhole and all those things and and I'll just close and just say in terms of the online learning and just you know that transition this last quarter Cora got straight A's and in fact to a-pluses won in science and one in Spanish I am pretty certain that if we've been doing homeschooling that those grades might have been compromised so yeah we want to give it up to our educators and we want to give it up to our nurses I think today is a nurse national nurses Appreciation Day so and I certainly want to give it up to you too you know my sisters in service and in solidarity and tomorrow you all tremendously and just I'm grateful for your friendship that's so true I while we're you know sharing experiences and I'm so glad you brought up tick tock I'm sure you adapted to your first tick tock video much more elegantly and gracefully than I did but yes the things that we do to keep our children entertained and I think when I you know I've been doing so many zoom phone calls and meetings online that you know I invested in a tripod but you know the second those zoom calls end at the end of the night Grace has her hands on it she's got the truck bigger plans for yeah that's right but you know what I also love the fact that you you introduce bonus mom to me because before I was the mom of Grace and Caroline I was the bonus mom to thomas being christian and it is just one of those you could you know you've got away with language but thank you for giving me that one because yeah we've got a full house and the issues range from like catherine said you know those rituals like sports and things that you know our kids like whether it's theatre or sports or stem club they just they need those social interactions and for those to be gone just overnight that's been a struggle for them and one you know you just have to acknowledge because it's it's hard for so many people in our community and that's where bless though because we have we have the technology we have hot spots yeah we can actually take the time to dedicate to go over homework and do all of that but that is not the case for so many families and so to Catherine's point where we appreciate just how well you represent us on the Education Committee and that you're centering the realities of most families you know who are managing a crisis within a crisis a public health crisis and economic crisis all the ways in which this has been disruptive and stabilizing for family and many of them are still working I know I it's it is true and we'll get to we'll get to all that in terms of when we talk about our you know priorities but you know we've got the broadband issue has been brought to light the lack of technology I mean I've got families in Lawrence where you know one Chromebook is be wood that was supplied by the district which is great but it's being split between for kids and how do you even make that work when you've got you know office hours and online classes that are colliding with each other and so the technologic the technology gap the homework gap divide all of that we need to account for as we look at the future and what we're going to be faced with school lunches you know that's another issue you know that we've all been speaking security yeah yeah I know you will never look at school the same way in terms of you know what it what it supplies to our children but you know when that building when that school building is closed you realize you know one how hard people are working to keep curricula in the hands of our kids those online learning programs or those weekend packets whatever it might be people are still you know working so hard for our kids all right so let's get to some questions because we don't structure our conversation we'll just go genuine until the device because the dialogue is organic okay but Katherine the my first question is for you so what's been the biggest challenge for you I mean I've gotten to know you know you and Rodney and I've heard stories about Nathaniel Addison and Jared I mean you're having to deal with you know the workload that you have which is enormous you know still school at home all those rituals that have kind of been wiped out as a result of code that 19 when in in addition like what are the biggest challenges you've been hearing from families in your district yeah you know like so many families it is about this abrupt change you know from my youngest son it was really looking at launching you know going from you know looking at college acceptances and dreaming of graduation and where he's going go in the fall and to really not be sure what the future holds for him and for my oldest son he graduated a year ago from college and now is looking at how am I gonna put a job together how am I going to find a career path and how long will this go on and my middle son is now doing college online which for all the reasons we just talked about we feel very fortunate that you know we occasionally have to shut everything down so that we have at least one working Wi-Fi connection but that is far less a challenge than so many families who don't have the technology don't have that reliable broadband in their house that can't work from home that are everyday going out and coming home to expose their families potentially to this virus so it's those sort of the toll as we look at Mother's Day and I think about all the moms out there and how many of them are essential workers and are continuing to have to meet the bills meet the Paycheck get to work in a very different and dangerous environment and we know that you know over 75 percent of all health care workers are women and it's not only our incredible nurses and doctors but it's it's the home aides who I know from caring for my own parents in the past were a lifeline for me in the best of times and now thinking about all those workers going into homes with some of our most vulnerable citizens our older citizens who already have underlying conditions and challenges and and showing up at very low wages often with very difficult access to health insurance themselves and these stories just keep playing out and as we've all seen it's brought everything we knew was their issues around racial and social inequities problems accessing health care has brought it all into stark relief and I think that women are going to be impacted in a different and I'm afraid a harsher way in many ways because it is it is women who have had to continue to go to work who often don't have health care you have a hard time finding you know a lender who they already have a relationship to be able to take advantage of the programs that Congress has put in place for small businesses all the issues that were already there for women and moms continue to to ripple out and to worsen in this so you know I think that we have an opportunity as members of Congress and as moms to make sure that when we are through this that we are putting together the sort of bold thinking that these times are going to warrant to make sure that we are helping families out of this situation it's gonna take a lot and we know that the food insecurity housing issues everything has been exacerbated and they're sort of a pit in my stomach as I celebrate seeing a video of someone coming home especially these moms who are giving birth and sort of wake up and don't even know that have their children and you know but what's gonna happen when those bills come rolling in and as we see an administration that is still in court trying to take away the ACA we're gonna have a lot of work to do to reset our country and make sure that we're doing everything we can not to bake up these inequities into our solutions but do it in a way that is gonna really get at the heart of it because this is just demonstrated in just a gruesome and very sad way how very real those struggles are and that especially for women it's going to have a true impact that is not going to be able to just disappear overnight as we start to reopen the economy the do you want to add anything I don't want to I don't want to structure this too much because I feel as a freshman member of Congress we have cast hundreds of votes I don't know it would be nearing the thousands won over well over 800 I think but whatever it is it's hundreds of votes and I would just say that one of the proudest votes that I cast did not take place in the house chamber and it was to elect Catherine is our Vice Chair in our caucus Oh No okay don't get me emotional because I'm not I need these lashes to stay on but uh but with this honest-to-god truth and so you know just thank you for always offering that moral clarity and just appreciate you so much and you know I think specifically about your advocacy around child care and you know when I think about how much better we could have weathered this storm if those inequities that have been disproportionately bore by women by women of color if we already have people working in a living wage if we already have universal paid sick leave universal paid family leave if we already had Universal child care if we had equitable access to our health care system if women were getting equal pay for equal work you know all of this could be better whether even though it is unprecedented in every way and so when you talk about taking a hard look at root causes you know I always say policy is my love language and the reason why I say that is because you know we have seen hate and discrimination modified through policy you know and so the way to show love is not with words it's indeed and it is through legislation and so this is an opportunity for a reset and a paradigm shift and so when folks talk about they can't wait to be returned to normal uh-uh nobody wants to return to normal ma'am unjust that was insufficient that was an adequate to begin with and so when our colleagues some of them across the aisle expressed their frustration at our trying to shoehorn in our democratic wish list of things I will be at alongside you unapologetic now in the wish of wanting to censor the humanity the dignity you know of every individual of every family of every worker you know so this is the opportunity to you know to go big and so I also when I was thinking about your advocacy on child care I want to share story just to contextualize this I received a call at 11 o'clock at night from a single mom who was an essential worker in her child she is a single mom she didn't have anyone else to watch her daughter and she didn't feel well and she's an essential worker and so she said to me you know I don't feel well I don't have anyone else to watch my daughter can you promise me that if I don't report to work tomorrow that I won't lose my job and it completely broke my heart ya know I'm just thinking about it now it's like what are her choices she can't bring her child to work that's not a safe environment for her child she didn't feel well herself so she didn't need to be working we don't know if she just has a common cold or it could be something else so you know and I couldn't give her any guarantee and that's unacceptable it's it is really about bringing humanity back to the workplace which when you consider the spotlight or the the light that's being shined upon you know those stories that like that is in essence what it we all have our own lived experience I mean look I I remember 10 years ago and I was working in tech and I I had grace and you know all he wanted needed was a little bit more flexibility in the workplace and I don't know how many times you know it when I was granted the opportunity to like work from home I was there was shame associated with a baby crying background or a dog barking in the background you like you basically hid your context right your family commitments that every woman who is oh you know working whether they've got two jobs right they've got the job of but they're going to work to get paid for and then they're they're basically caring for on any given day it's multiple you know people whether it's an in-law a parent get their children and that context is like you know we have to I don't know somehow tuck it away because of the inequities in the workplace and right now I'm hoping the silver liner in or the silver lining in you know this this moment is that everyone has been forced to show flexibility and everyone understands now the need that we have to have paid sick leave we have to have paid Family Medical Leave I mean we have to have equal pay for equal work and and we have to acknowledge the fact that you know women have a different context than others when they show up to the workplace and so you know taking that into account I'm hoping and you know obviously we're gonna fight tooth and nail for it from a policy perspective but also culturally in this country when you consider the disproportionate burden that women are are bearing in getting us through and you look like my sister was a catch is a cashier at a big box store she was one of the first people in her store to test positive for for kovat 19 and even when I think about her access to testing she's through it she's you know but she didn't even have access to a test right way so to that point policy my love language and that why we introduced I'm so glad your sisters okay first of all it just goes to show that this is a virus that does not discriminate even though it is being disproportionately more by marginalized and communities of color it is a virus that does not discriminate and you're you know you're still continue to do your work and have to compartmentalize that you're concerned for your sister and all those things but that's why we introduced the essential workers Bill of Rights you know myself senator Warren representative O'Connor representative Hollen I mean people are just getting the memo but these are essential workers they've always been essential women we've been treating them like they're disposable okay and so they need personal protective equipment they need hazard pay they need paid sick leave they need paid family and medical leave so that if they have a loved one that is sick that they can care for them and they don't have any of those any of those protections any of those things all right and so instead of being treated as if they are essential they are being treated as if they are disposable and so we need to pass the essential workers Bill of Rights and what I would lift it up in that the most would be paid sick leave and paid Family Medical Leave commit I couldn't agree with Jana more and thank you for your work on that bill and for me it's really come down to a focus on child care because I see it first of all it represents all the problems a woman dominated industry very very expensive for families to afford and very low wages for our early educators so it's it's already has that whole structure that is underfunded that is primarily women-owned small businesses that operate on the thinnest of margins in the best of times but it is so important it is the underpinning to our economy and if we want to reopen it we want to be successful if we want to have essential workers have a Equality accessible affordable place to put their children we have to have emergency funding for this industry we can no longer view it you know as a nicety and accessory it is absolutely essential and it's gonna take a while just to catch up but we're also looking at over nine billion dollars a month in costs to keep our providers going and so we're really it's just one example of where we have underfunded underinvested it is about women and children at its core and supporting families and you know I was heartened to see the Boston Chamber of Commerce list this as one of the great barriers to reopening we know we need testing and tracing and that we have to address the public health crisis do it to reopen and address that economic crisis that it's created but we can't do it without childcare and it's one of those issues that has emerged for me in this crisis as you know this is the time we can't continue to say we'll do it another time they have a little bit they have enough and the education of our kids is going to depend on it this is not only been tough on them as far as food insecurity but it's traumatic for a lot of our children what's going through what they've been going through and we need to get back to working with our very youngest learners and giving them that opportunity to quality child care so well we're gonna take care of essential workers we're going to make sure that everyone understands that essential workers are childcare providers and that if we want a strong economy and healthy families we've got to make these investments now yeah captain I so appreciate again just how you bring a holistic view to the issue because you know I think sometimes culturally we can define people's value by their utility but then forget you know their humanity in that and so I think forever the issue of child care was framed around this this important and fundamental service being provided to our children setting them on a pathway that will determine the complete trajectory of their lives and not equal concern and investment for the extraordinary people doing that work right well thank you for just making sure that we we consider the issue holistically and that we can seem to diversify the narrative of who is an essential worker you know it's everyone you know as I think about it it's you know public transit workers its custodians its grocery store clerks it's our child care you know providers its those home care aides and personal care attendants and those so that those developmentally those that work with the developmentally disabled our loved ones you know it's it's it's so it's so diverse it's so far-reaching and so our relief and the justice that we seek to realize has to be just as just as its far-reaching and this is the time there it's indefensible that any excuse could be offered it's it's necessary and I have missed that from the chamber but that's encouraging to hear and I think you know you and others can take credit for that it speaks to the power of advocacy yeah yeah I I'll just add I know we I can't believe how quickly this time I know we have to wrap up which is like heartbreak but I couldn't agree more I mean you know when I think of how people essential emergency workers are getting up every single day putting their own health on the line to care for others or to ensure that everyone else has you know food or the supplies that they need to kind of keep care of you know their home enrolling workers i3 has been redefined right I mean it is it is totally different in this health crisis and well I think the horror of this moment like going right back to the beginning of March was that we couldn't even give them basic protective equipment right we were so reliant on like a foreign supply chain we didn't have the ability to protect people who were protecting us and you know I I will talk to you offline about a bill that I have for the production pandemic Act so that we bring those manufacturing jobs back to our country and have a private public partnership like we do with our national defense in ensuring that not only is it the guns and the masks and the ventilators we've all been in you know hearing about and just you know wringing our hands with like frustration but it's also going to be the treatment and the therapies in the vaccine that we're going to need to scale up so that we protect everybody I mean who's going to feel comfortable sending their child to a to a child care provider when we don't have you know testing at scale to make sure that people are healthy how are we going to reopen our economy without that step right without people having the confidence that you know they're not sick and they're not positive so it's so important as we that's great because that is as much about our public health recovery as it is our economic recovery it's a workforce development issue as well and I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge and I know we'll continue to fight for this in upcoming relief packages you know you represent we all do I mean we have so many immigrant families in our district and they have the the access to relief efforts has not been equitable and we have to continue to fight for our immigrant and immigrant families the Massachusetts seventh is 40 percent and I don't know in any household that doesn't have both the daca recipient you know in our immigrant families a TPS holder or DD or sons and these are folks you know contributing to community who are a common axes that paying their taxes and have been excluded and so that is something that we have to right-size as well as we seek to to get this right yeah absolutely I can tell you what I really appreciate about both of you is that you're always putting the threads together and you always realize that when we're looking at these complex issues that are going to need big structural change to get us through this that you're always assessing where's the most vulnerable and that all of our security is reliant on how we help the most vulnerable in the system and it's it's really a remarkable quality and the two of you just bring it you every piece that you do and the perspective you bring in and the way you look at problems so I'm so grateful two things one I'm sorry for my intrusive water-bottle those who don't know real plastic in your life now listen for those who don't know me I hate to drink water so I've been so proud of myself in the midst of this that I have been killing the water game you know but here's what I wanted to show you put your hands up and look we can all hold it appreciate you it's good seeing you guys well we'll see each other next week oh that's right I'm like oh are we gonna make this a weekly thing let's do it thanks for bringing us all together now Lori thanks for coordinating this good to see you guys

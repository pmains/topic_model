the chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas mr. Marshall for five minutes mr. speaker last night 406 and my colleagues and I voted to pass the stop school violence and the securing our Schools Act as a father of four when I dropped each of my kids off at Jefferson Elementary grade school in Great Bend Kansas I felt confident that they were going to have a safe place where they could learn and grow but today we have seen time and time again that we need to revisit how we are protecting our children the stop school Violence Act will train students teachers faculty and local law enforcement on ways to identify threats and report them he goes back to a message we've been relaying for ages see something say something this bill recognizes that sometimes our children and educators often do not have the training to spot some of the warning signs and that's why it's critical that we provide training so students and personnel can recognize and report threats before they occur we also looked at ways to better our reporting process so that when a threat is made we have an effective way to log and intervene to do so this bill provides funding for states to upgrade their technology and develop an anonymous reporting system through a mobile app hotline and website not only does it allocate funds for violence prevention training and modernize our reporting protocols it also allocates funds to improve school security equipment the stop school Violence Act coupled last night with the securing our school act grants funds for schools to install panic buttons and further hardening and protection of our schools these are steps forward that approach the issue of school safety from several angles and I'm proud to have co-sponsored both pieces of legislation I want to make sure that my message everyone back home today is clear the House of Representatives is listening and our school ground should no longer be soft targets after last night's vote the stop school violence and secure our school acts joins the fix Nick's act that has been waiting on a vote from the Senate since last December fix Nick's with strengthen background checks and close critical loophole today I urge my friends in the Senate to pass these bills so that our nation's schools and children can be safer mr. speaker as droughts continue to work in across Kansas now impacting all 105 counties we are again at the point of seeing wildfires whip across the state of Kansas while so far none of them have come close to the size of last year Starbuck fire there's reason to be concerned today I want to recognize the resiliency of Kansans who have been coming together to help neighbors and strangers alike as well as soldiers from the Kansas National Guard these gardens work in cooperation with local firefighters and emergency personnel to combat fires and say people property and animals I stand today to commend their hard work and thank them for their service these fires are a stark reminder of the devastation created by wildfires last year and provide a reminder of the importance and standing together in the face of difficulty

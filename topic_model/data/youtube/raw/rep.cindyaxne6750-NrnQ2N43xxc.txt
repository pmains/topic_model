yes Thank You mr. chairman and thank you members of the panel for being here and a special thank you to Leo Edelman and his wife Angie for being here today they're from our flooded area in the third District in Iowa and I think they bring an exceptional amount of knowledge about the situation that we're facing they're not just farmers but there are also small business owners in the area so they've felt the impact from an agriculture perspective but also from even though the specifically where their business is located wasn't necessarily flooded traffic isn't flowing well we people have left the area we're seeing a major impact on our rural community so I'd like to take this a little bit further from where mr. Crawford was about the systems the processes and the communications that you've experienced throughout this entire time just to go back and I know that there was some information presented on this but from January to early March we had record snowfall and freezing weather just to put it in context we had 340 individual city record low temperatures in the Midwest in two days January 30th and 31st when our temperatures dropped - yes folks as low as negative 50 degrees and then in February we got about 25 inches of snow just in the Des Moines Iowa area Nebraska Omaha Nebraska got 27 inches north of us about 30 inches so we were we were inundated with snow and cold weather then hit by the cyclone blizzard so one of the most intense this country's ever seen on record and we are the water had no place to go ground was incredibly frozen of course everything was over saturated from the heavy snows and so where did it go it went to our farmlands and lowland areas and and today we're seeing the results of that so I'm very grateful that the President signed the disaster bill into law I'm thankful that in the house I was successful in getting three billion dollars of funding specifically for the Midwest flood because it's very critical that we address this but as Leo said in his testimony he discussed that he's had major flooding before in particular in 2011 when the levees breached about a half mile from your farm I believe and it he stated in his it took four years to clean up the mess so almost until this last flooding and then I my questions and concerns that I've been hearing and we've we've talked in the past we got a lot of work to do with the Corps of engineer and I'm looking forward to working with mr. Allen and mr. Crawford on that will table that for a minute because we know that there's a lot of communications issues there but I've also noticed that within our own structures our departments in government that there's issues there with our procedures and processes and so Leo I'd love to ask you given your unfortunate experience with flooding is 60 days an appropriate timeframe to apply for these important programs in the past yes 2011 were our unique advance and extensions are definitely important because even today you know 97 days in county this flood has been going on 2011 event 140 days so we can't get out there to - for the merge the ECP program we can't get out there to see any damage because there's water on the ground we can't get out there for to do anything to recover we don't know how much of our grain out there is destroyed if in those bins that are landlocked out there whether they're salvageable or not so extensions are very important yes okay so what what does your farm look like at this time we have numerous tracts of land but the home home base the water is going down because they're the Corps of Engineers are getting that breach plugged in fact we might get might get stopped today so the water is going down interstate I 29 opened up two days ago from st. Joe - to highway 34 the entrance and exit ramps are not open so but I have a full tank of gas when you get on there so there's a lot a lot of over the road trucks getting stranded out there I know that so but the roads between are destroyed you know to get from from east to west is impossible those east-west roads are completely destroyed so limited time to be able to see what you need exactly other question is I've heard numerous stories from folks small business owners farmers and homeowners alike that they don't know about all the resources they have access to I know that you're heavily involved in this do you know of all people who have no clue about what things they have access to and how they can find those resources yeah that the wheels are turning on that you know we had a meeting yesterday with Governor Al's on this task force with SBA and homeland security and things like that to get people we've had a lot of issues with temporary housing getting those trailers into our area from those what people are dislodged that some of them living in basements of their relatives or moved out of the area and they want to get back home they maybe get out of somebody else's house to get on their own so getting that temporary housing there's been a huge issue and but otherwise you know it's a real learning curve when you have events that long you know to deal with it yeah wheels are turning absolutely of my time I'm I think okay thank you we have so much more to discuss here but I want to thank you for being here I want to continue this conversation that I think within our government entities we do not have proper processes and communications in place to help our families in need thank you

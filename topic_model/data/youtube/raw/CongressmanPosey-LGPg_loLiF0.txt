speaker i would give one minute to the gentleman from florida mr posey the gentleman from florida has one minute in our campaigns we may be adversaries but usually after the campaign season's over we have traditionally come together for the good of our nation now more than ever in our lifetimes we are a divided nation one of the reasons the resist movement which is harassed harangued and otherwise denigrated the president since the second he became the nominee while his sins may be different than yours or mine they are clearly not treasonous that our men and women in blue who suffered a lot more stress than the members of congress they protected have the time they deserve to recuperate and do the same for millions of americans who feel they've been disenfranchised i beseech my colleagues on both sides of the aisle if you truly want our nation to heal vote no in this resolution it reeks of nothing more than revenge and sets a dangerous precedent may god continue to bless the united states of america

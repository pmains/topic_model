good afternoon i'm congresswoman laurie trahan and thank you for joining our first veterans covit 19 virtual town hall i'm thrilled today that we're joined by two incredible guests director of the va boston healthcare system director vincent ning and general jack hammond our executive director of home base before i turn it over to our panelists to introduce themselves i'd like to take a couple of minutes to provide you with an update on the coronavirus and the steps we're taking at the federal level to provide relief for our state's 380 000 veterans and their families as you all know our state has been hit especially hard and for most of us we have a deeply personal story about depend how about how this pandemic has impacted our lives as of today more than 1.25 million people have tested positive for covet 19 nationwide and tragically more than 76 000 people have died this pandemic has also taken an enormous financial toll on our families and our small businesses in fact the number of folks who are bearing the brunt of the economic crisis caused by this disease continues to grow yesterday we received the updated unemployment numbers 3.2 million people filed for unemployment in the past week bringing the total number of unemployment applicants since mid-march to more than 33 million including more than 960 000 folks right here in massachusetts behind each of these numbers is a moving story of hardship and struggle a story of workers and small businesses doing their part to slow the spread of the virus and to keep our communities safe and i know it's been a long eight weeks but we've been doing this work uh and doing our part that's why it's more than four more important than ever that we continue listening to the experts our heroes fighting on the front lines are relying on us to do our part so that they can continue saving lives over the course of the last two months we've passed four emergency bills totaling approximately 2.7 trillion dollars to provide immediate support to our veterans families small businesses as well as our hospitals first responders cities and towns and research institutions to improve testing and hopefully develop a vaccine these bills have been critical to keeping folks afloat and i'm glad that the cares act our third belief package passed in late march included nearly 20 billion dollars in funding to ensure the department of veterans affairs has the equipment tests and support services necessary to provide veterans with the additional care they need at facilities nationwide however the surge in anxiety and depression stemming from covid19 requires that additional steps be taken to ensure that our active service members and their families affected by mental illness are also able to remotely access mental health care while also protecting their physical health that's why i have also called on dod's defense health agency to permit telehealth services under tricare during the covid19 crisis including telemental health services at all outpatient levels of care but the reality is that veterans and their families in our state and across america need more help and we must ensure that the next funding package delivers for them as negotiations over the next round of relief funding continuing we must also continue to prioritize assistance to our heroes fighting covet 19 on the front lines our state and local governments emergency workers and first responders as well as working families struggling to get by during this pandemic we will get through this crisis but we must ensure that no one is left behind especially our veterans who have already sacrificed so much so now i would like to take a moment to introduce our star panelists who will be answering your questions for today's session director vincent ing an accomplished healthcare executive director ing has a long history of serving veterans in the department of veterans affairs he is a board member of the boston veterans affairs research institute the executive council of the conference of boston teaching hospitals and a member of the boston federal executive association prior to his appointment as the va boston healthcare system director in 2013 director ing served as director for the providence va medical center in rhode island last november director ang led myself and my colleague congresswoman julia brownlee from california on a tour of the jamaica plain va medical campus where we had the opportunity to participate in a round table discussion with female veterans and i'm grateful to him for that tremendous experience under director ing's exceptional leadership the boston va medical health care system has become the template for success not only for veteran health care generally but also specifically for female veterans seeking health services director ing thank you for being with us today i'll turn it over to you to give a brief overview okay thank you so much congressman congresswoman trahan and we in boston va and the va in general is very appreciative for your support and the resources the congress provide to us um for this uh covert 19 uh pandemic uh without that support i think we'll be struggling but now we have the resources that we need to take care of our heroes the veterans we started planning for the covert 19 pandemic a little bit over two months ago because we all know that the veterans population they are a little bit older than the general populations most of them are um there's still some world war two veterans but most of them are vietnam era veterans most of them are over the age of 65. so we started planning and that we as a probably one of the first healthcare system to stop visitation to our nursing home and our long-term care facilities to make sure that the high-risk population is protected so when you look at the transmission rate or infected rate of the veterans in our long-term care unit are in general lower than the general population because of that initiative that we took it was difficult for the family and it's difficult for the patient but just like you and i doing now and with general hammond we're using technology to have those visits between family and the veterans patients um i'll just give you some statistics um so far we treated probably over 230 acute covert plus veterans in west roxbury campus and i'm happy to say that so far we have a success of 70 recovery and that's um we're very proud of that other veterans has gone to our sister hospital for a long-term care at bedford facilities and some of it at our brockton facilities now i i would like to be pretty clear that even those with this pandemic we have not forgotten other veterans we continue to do a thousand visits a day wow and of that thousand visit about 200 of those uh face-to-face visit because there's still a need for that uh 55 of those 550 are the telephone visit and then 25 about 250 are the video uh visit that we have our staff is extremely dedicated so because the veterans cannot come to us because of this pandemic they went to the veterans they visit their home they deliver their equipment they deliver their wheelchair to their home so that they continue to get the service so instead of the veterans come to coming to us we are going to the veterans where they reside kind of the more older days when the healthcare physician go to visit at your home so i think that we are doing very well with the resources that you provided with us to service our veterans we have tested over a thousand veterans for covert tests and then also a thousand of our employees and we also support the chelsea soldier home because their patients our patients we work very close with them and we are extremely happy that we be working together as partner and with general hammond he's doing a great job with the um boston hope we send some patients to him and he'll help us for some of the discharges so thank you general hammond for for your leadership in that area i just like to close with one thing on this part of the conversation i have heard a story about nurse that are used to work in our outpatient area or actually in the operating room and because we are not doing elective surgery we deploy some of the staff and this this particular nurse work in the icu with some of the most intensive care needed veterans her job is to communicate and make sure that she does physical assessment of the veterans so she was taking care of these veterans in the icu intubated uh and in an induced coma and every day she go to she went to the bedside and talked to the veterans about the latest news about what's going on and about five six days later when this patient got better got came out of the coma he said to this nurse i hear the voice of the angel every day and it was your voice so that's how much these front line workers are taking care of these veterans and it's not just us mgh and all the hospital hospital doing the same so just like to share that very touching story with with you and those here no thank you for doing that i mean i i just had to uh um you know rub my goose bumps away because it you know the stories that we hear from what um people are doing on the front lines uh these acts of kindness the way communities come together the way we care for each other uh you know we have to tell those stories because uh there's no shortage of bad news at this time but you know we've uh we've seen so many local heroes uh uh just like the nurse you described so it's important that we uh remind our ourselves of that so thank you and thank you for being so agile uh and you know changing your model uh and adapting to getting care to where people are so thank you now uh retired brigadier general jack cannon uh served for 30 years in the united states army where he commanded troops both at home and abroad including in afghanistan in 2002 and 2011 as well as in iraq in 2003 in 2011 general hammond became the first massachusetts officer to obtain the rank of general in a combat theater since world war ii which is just an incredible achievement following his three decades of military service general hammond was appointed executive director of the home base program and home base for those of you who don't know is a joint venture between the red sox foundation and massachusetts general hospital all of these organizations have displayed incredible compassion and service to our veterans during this time and long before the pandemic hit though i will let general hammond describe further home base in just a moment additionally general hammond previously advised president obama's commission on military compensation and retirement modernization he also advised president george w bush's warrior wellness alliance secretary bob mcdonald's myva advisory committee governor mitt romney's homeland security advisory council and governor charlie baker's healthcare transition team and veteran advisory council i recently had the honor of visiting home base and seeing the unbelievable work they do there and i'm so grateful to have him here in the commonwealth most recently general hammond was asked by governor baker to take charge of the 1000 dead field hospital at boston convention and exhibition center and it's saving lives and bringing immediate relief to our hospitals on the front lines of this pandemic general handman thank you so much for taking the time this afternoon it's great to see you again and i'll turn it over to you thanks congresswoman and and uh my thanks to director ing for the amazing work he does with our veterans every day um the patient population that he cares for um regularly is probably one of the most at risk groups for the covid19 so the work that the va is doing is phenomenal it's critical and and they're saving lives we deeply appreciate them sending some folks here to finish off their treatment before they go home but you know as we all know these front line health care providers are just doing some incredible work through some really difficult times and i think as we look forward towards the future we'll we'll probably have a follow-on conversation on how we're taking care of them because much like these deployments we send our our veterans on for many people this covert 19 experience is much like a a combat deployment but it's fought here at home um with the same type of vigor the same lengthy hours the same bad food and potentially that same after effect that you're dealing with being exposed to the trauma conditions that many of these providers are dealing with and so it's very appropriate to have this conversation because uh we've learned a lot of lessons since the wars in iraq and afghanistan began uh nearly 20 years ago and we we've done really well in in doing better there's still a long way to go um but the the va is dr director ing has pointed out is very agile and adaptive um we work very closely with them we're we consider them true partners we hope you know that we're a true partner as well and to that end several years ago during a conversation with the va secretary bob mcdonald we talked about the potential of having a va person a social worker assigned permanently to home base and three other academic centers that were doing this amazing work and they were worried about you know the whole technical piece of how how would you pay for the position and classify it and i always remember vince stepped up and said well we're still talking about taking care of veterans right and we all said yes and he said does it matter where they actually sit in on the office if they can take care of veterans over at home base then we'll provide somebody and they have so we have a full-time social worker assigned to home base whose responsibility is to facilitate the care for veterans coming to home base from the va system or for many veterans that haven't signed up for the va health care system yet we encourage them to do that and then they facilitate their onward care once they leave home base and they return to wherever home is and so my deep appreciation to vince for leading that on a national level and it's great having a partner here in boston that is dedicated and committed to veterans as he is with respect to home base as you mentioned congresswoman it's a a great partnership um we're we're small enough to be extremely agile large enough to be you know impactful um we're able to develop new programs based on drawing our resources from both mass general harvard medical school and spalding rehab and we're able to pull those resources together with lessons learned from our friends at the va to figure out how can we quickly pivot as a private sector organization and address some of these needs i think our hallmark program is our intensive clinical program that you had an opportunity to meet some of the folks that were going through it and and for some of these some of the most injured folks in america they'll come to boston for two weeks uh and they'll get about two years of therapy compressed into that 14-day period um a challenge we've recently encountered much like everybody is how do you operate in this new post-covet environment because air travel will stop uh all travel stopped and and coalescing in groups like this is difficult uh so we had to make an immediate pivot to telehealth and we're doing a significant amount of telehealth right now treatment via the internet and zoom and a lot of regulatory [Music] burdens that were in place that were preventing us from doing and delivering you know some very good care have been kind of swept aside because of the covet situation and we're going to be working with folks to try and make these permanent so that we can get to folks that live in areas that don't have access to good health care much in the way the va has been able to do i think almost for a year or two now and with great success and so we'll be looking to do more of that we've also stood up a couple programs that are in place now that folks may be interested because we know they're stuck at home and then what do you do about that how do you kind of get some kind of routine and get some type of battle rhythm going and so we we stood up um something called health at home base and if you go to our website every day there are workouts five minute workouts uh there's there are mind body medicine workouts there's nutrition guidance and each day we have videos from folks that are experts in different areas to just talk to you about today's tip for the day on living at home and sometimes a closed-in environment with too many family members that can get a little tight in there and you just gotta get some kind of workout in or you're trying to figure out a you know a better diet because you're sitting around watching too much tv and snacking too much so some great advice on that we also have these zoom sessions uh called slide into home base which is a virtual coffee clutch meeting for veterans to get together on and if you go to our website at homebase.org you can click and register and they'll send you an invite out and you can just get in there and talk to other peers just have a conversation and it's it's a very low-key environment they also have one for family members the military family members that may be interested in it but this covet this post-covet environment is is going to be challenging for us and like the va we're going to be trying to figure out how do we operate in these social distance environments successfully and deliver that same high level of care we always did um because many businesses as we know are going to have to make those same types of decisions and adjustments and we hope to be as flexible as vince and the team here in boston well thank you for that i mean there's no question that um you always have to look at the some of the silver linings or the lessons that we learn at a time like this and so i'm sure you're coming up uh with new approaches uh in ways for folks to stay connected and certainly to reach people uh you know where they are so that they have access to treatment and connectivity and therapy so i'm sure i will continue to work with you on scaling those lessons because you you and uh director ing have been such great uh thought leaders um on delivering care so all right we have to get to this these questions because uh we never we always run out of time when we do these teletown halls um as with previous teletown halls we've received so many questions for our submission portal uh we did our best to select the questions that were widely representative of the folks who submitted and we're going to aim to answer as many of them as we can so the first one is for uh director ing it's from john in littleton he wants to know what services are currently being offered by the va how can i schedule an appointment to see my primary doctor and how can i reach a mental health provider during this time okay thank you uh john for your question um so as i mentioned arie earlier uh we have all services basically available uh it's just how we deliver it differently uh if it's urgent face-to-face we still have you come in and we'll take care of you in terms of how are you going to make an appointment with if you need a primary care doctor to see you um we have a call center number i'd like to give you is call out call 857-364-4418-857-364-4418 there's about 10 to 12 agents that are available to talk with you and then make an arrangement to uh have a primary care physician to see you i hope you have a dedicated primary care physician and that person will and that team will see you the other way to contact them is use my healthy vet it's a secure messaging system between the veteran the patient and the providers and the providers team so if you are signed up for my health event write them a message what you need and then they will work with you if you need mental health care in addition to primary care we have psychologist embedded into primary care team that can help right away but if you need more complex care the call center folks and your primary care provider will it will be able to refer you to our mental health providers uh i just like to add one more thing because um just like homebase and general hammond technology the va has developed a app on the phone for covert coach and if you go to that covert coach you get all kind of helps from stress reduction staying healthy how to be a parent as f as now there are a lot more kids at home and and how to be a caregiver because we have a lot of caregivers in in the veterans community and uh also learn about how to work from home and shelter in place so uh that is free so please use it oh terrific terrific thank you um this question is for general hammond and it's from mark in groton he wants to know is home base part of the va and do i need a va report referral to home base to participate in your program well thanks mark and the answer is no we are connected to the va through partnerships um but you can come directly to us for care there's two ways to do it you can go to homebase.org and that's our website when you go there you'll see a red button that says connect to care just click on that it'll ask you some information that'll go into our our center and within a day or so someone will reach out to you and work to set up your appointment if you'd rather call you can call 617-724-55202 and leave a voicemail again we're working remotely and again someone will return your call within a day or two and and begin the process of setting up your appointment for you terrific thank you uh this next one is clearly for me uh it's from thomas in chelmsford he wants to know where is my stimulus check i was told that being on social security and a disabled veteran it would get to me automatically i still haven't gotten it yet so first thank you for your service to our nation thomas uh and for the great question i get it a lot i know that there are still a number of people who like you haven't received their payment yet and just for everyone's awareness uh the cares act included direct cash payments they're called uh recovery rebates of twelve hundred dollars for each adult and 500 for each dependent child so those who earn 75 000 or below will get the full rebate and then the rebate is incrementally reduced for those who earn more than 75 000 it's capped at 99 000. uh so for most taxpayers no action is necessary and as of yesterday the irs had distributed more than 130 million of these payments however if you receive social security retirement ssdi survivors benefits ssi or va compensation and pension benefits many of those payments just started going out last week which may be the reason you haven't received yours yet the good news is that you are not required to take additional action to get your payment uh you should receive your payment just as you would your other benefit either by direct deposit or by mail uh you can find more detailed information or check the status of your payment by visiting the irs website at irs.gov coronavirus one other thing that i will say about veterans who didn't file a tax return this year disabled veterans who did not file taxes in 2018 or 2019 will now receive their payment automatically however the irs has said that filling out their new web tool on the irs website may speed up that process additionally student veterans who did not file taxes in 2018 or 2019 will not receive their payment automatically and must fill up the irs web tool to receive their payment so visit irs.gov coronavirus for this forum and for that information so thomas i hope that answers your question uh we have time for a few more this one is for director ing it's from jesse in lowell and he asks because of this pandemic all of my medical appointments were canceled my question is i've been dealing with an l5 issue for over a year i was finally placed for a neurologist consult which is of course postponed how long must i wait for another consultation once this is finally over my condition has progressively gotten worse as all this time has elapsed or would i be better off seeking medical services outside of the va okay uh thank you jesse for your question um that's what we are working on now is the reopening of the um uh healthcare system um right now we are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel because the number of uh covert cases are either stabilized on the decrease so we are working on a plan to on a phased reopening of our clinics and our delivery system um so for neurology if it's urgent we'll take care of you right away i also has put in additional resources with the funding that we receive from congress to hire additional personnel especially in a neural surgery neurology area so if you call our lead patient advocate her name is rita at 857-364-2252 reader at uh 857-364-224-2252 that you hear mr ing on the congressman woman tray hand town hall and she will know that uh i refer you to her and she'll take care of you thank you thank you thank you directoring um this next one is for uh general hammond it's from jack in marlborough uh what advice do you have for veterans service members or their families who are really starting to feel the stress caused by the situation we're in both physically and mentally sure well jack i would tell you that number one it's always best to reach out to us reach out to the va um but but start a conversation the challenges we see with folks it's like it doesn't get better with time unlike wine that ages well these type of problems just get worse with time and they usually come out in bad ways when you don't want them to and so it's always best to get after this as quickly as possible if you're starting to feel some of the pressure and the anxiety associated with covert 19 and it's bringing up other things from your your military service and it's affecting your families it's best to reach out and get some help and so i would tell you to connect with us we have clinical care programs for both military family members children as well as all our veterans and so all those are in place and they're functioning now via telehealth if somebody really required an in-person meeting right now we can arrange it but as director in mentioned a moment ago that's really um any type of elective care outpatient care is generally being done telehealth right now but if if there's a must be you you need to get in face-to-face we can arrange for that as well um but more often than not that we can take care of this through telehealth the other thing i mentioned a moment ago the the health at home base i think you can't go wrong you know even as a family working with some of the mindfulness training that we talk about where you work on a little bit of the mind-body medicine uh to basically work on stress reduction anxiety reduction if it hasn't reached that clinical level where you require a clinical intervention this is a great way to stay healthy and that's one of the reasons we brought these out and i would tell you just as a parent you know i think i see more people taking walks in the woods these days to just shut off the tv stop watching that for a little bit and get out in into nature and get some exercise and some nature time you can't go wrong with that but if you need a little bit of assistance and support uh we can provide that through those different levels of programs that i mentioned a moment ago that's terrific and that's actually great advice for all of us i find myself going out uh with my little ones and just going for a walk and getting away from the news and um the technology sometimes uh this question is from chris and lowell he wants to know i'm a senior at umass lowell graduating this year and i'm a marine veteran i'm worried about the job market when i graduate and not being able to find a job right away the va has helped pay for my education will there be another stimulus package to help us bridge the gap if businesses are still struggling into the summer and fall so thank you for your service and for the question chris now that we have begun to flatten the curve it's more important than ever that we continue listening to our experts who are telling us to keep doing uh what we're doing staying home practicing social distancing wearing a mask this is uh this will be key to us continually slowing the spread of covid19 and keeping our emergency personnel safe uh at work the same time a lot of people have been thinking about how we're going to reopen and there's no question that officials on the governor's task force are actively planning uh how we're going to do that as safely as possible but what i think we have to prepare for at every level of government is the economic consequences of the pandemic that could last for a long time if nothing is done to jumpstart our economy and get folks back to work this is something i've spent a lot of time uh thinking about and there's no question in my mind in the minds of my colleagues that an additional stimulus package will be necessary right now we've been mostly focused on uh relief and keeping people afloat during the healthcare crisis you know as a veteran you have specialized skills and leadership traits that will make you particularly attractive as a candidate for employers in whatever professional field you wish to pursue in many cases open positions in government especially the federal government they include a veteran's preference so i would encourage you to contact jorge morales lopez he's the veterans liaison in my local office he's a veteran himself to be sure to receive the support that you need as you navigate but more broadly i just introduced earlier today remotely because i'm not in washington uh how to get people back to work with good paying jobs we've talked a lot about um infrastructure as a way to doing that and uh it's dual purpose of getting people back to work but also revitalizing our communities fixing our bridges and roads modernizing our grid and all of that but one of the things that i was struck by was the the shortage of personal protective equipment and ventilators that we saw early on in this outbreak so i introduced the pandemic production act it'll provide direct incentives to american manufacturers to establish new or expand upon existing production lines of ppe and other medical equipment to fulfill the next demand for surge capacity and that actually includes treatment and therapies and vaccine ingredients all the things that we're going to need to scale up quickly to keep people safe so we have this model with our national defense i'm i'm very much aware of that model because i sit on the armed services committee and i think we need a model similar um to uh to deal with future pandemics but also it will be a way to get those manufacturing jobs back into the united states we miss them so much especially if you're from this part of massachusetts so um i i as we think about ways to encourage demand in our economy again you know we have to ensure that people have the financial ability to purchase uh goods from small businesses in their in their cities and towns and get people back to work so uh thank you for the for that question um i think we have time i'm looking at i think we have time for one more question i'm going to ask uh director ing it's from edward in littleton when will the new england region fix the local system so veterans who are seen at bedford can use the clinic in lowell for things like lab work why are they not expanding services at the large facility to include ultrasound mris and p-e-t-c-t okay uh thank you edward for your questions and thank you for your service um the you can use the service in law um one of the uh barriers for that is because of our electronic medical record the va developed electronic medical record 35 years ago va was the first one so we still have the older platform so we are modernizing our electronic medical record using the cerner system uh it started starting out on the west coast and it will move to the east coast but it will take us 2-3 more years to get it here locally that will allow seamless medical record usage and and ordering uh at different facilities so that there's no barrier so we're dealing with a more vintage system but if you need to have left draw at uh at low and like have your uh prescription field just tell your providers to call the local clinic and we'll take care of you uh we cannot do it as seamless as possible but we can do it in terms of the diagnostic mri test scan and ct scan those are very expensive machine and those cost 10 20 million dollars and you also have to have expert technician to run that bedford is not as complex as the facilities it's more for a long-term housing of the patients and sub-acute level so but the va also under the mission act allow veterans to go to the community to get those services if you are eligible so talk to your provider talk to um if you are part of the local clinic talk to the local clinic and we will work with you on that thank you thank you uh so i can't believe how quickly time goes i sadly uh that's all the time that we have for today um i do want to thank our outstanding uh panelists who have very demanding day jobs uh in many respects more than one uh director ing and uh general hammond again for taking time out of your uh busy schedule to join us you all are such important voices for veterans across massachusetts and your insight has been incredibly valuable uh and thank you again to everyone for tuning in this afternoon and for committing yourself to staying informed you know i regularly update my website to make sure you have access to the latest information on kobit 19 and we'll have much of what we discussed today there as well so please visit trahan.house.gov covid19 to access these and other important resources on how to keep yourselves and your family safe and informed as we navigate this pandemic i know i can sound like a broken record but every day that we continue doing our part is one day closer to the stay-at-home order lifting these next couple of weeks are so important so please continue to stay home as much as you can keep washing your hands disinfecting those frequently touched services if you have to go out in public uh please be sure to wear a mask and and now answer your telephone if you get that uh phone call we've got contact tracing up and running here in the state of massachusetts and it's so important that we all contribute to that data most importantly if you or someone you know are in need of assistance don't hesitate to reach out my office is here to help around the clock uh and i know that the director and the general both have teams available to assist you as well finally i hope you'll take some time this weekend to check in on each other your moms virtually or by phone we'll get through this together thank you all again stay healthy and stay safe okay thank you thank you

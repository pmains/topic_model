thank you very much like he's a familiar face around 517 morning news and there's so much going on in Washington DC right now it's good to have them back on the big red cast yes it's been a while congressman bill hozuki joins us on the big red couch welcome back well thank you I've been missing my Big Red Faction a little while so this is great all right so you're back here in town right now what's what's been happening in DC what's keeping you busy oh not much been going on yeah obviously lots happening and and everything from its budget season so we're making our way through that but trying to deal with the farm bill which which we need to have but the big the big debate there is not about the agricultural part that's only about twenty percent of the farm bill it's eighty percent dealing with food nutrition programs and the massive expansion that we've seen there and how we how we sort of tame that and make sure that those that need that help are getting that help but it's for example lottery winners aren't exempt from being eligible why that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me so it's those kinds of things you know obviously what's been happening internationally North Korea and Libya then you get into Benghazi and the IRS scandal and and this ap raid on the AP phone records really is set the administration back on its heels as well so we're trying to not let that overshadow all the other things that we need to get done and we'll keep moving on that too and we also learned that michelle bachman is not seeking another term learned that this morning she announced that on her website what are your thoughts about you've obviously worked closely with her okay i do we serve on the Financial Services Committee and I met her first one I was a state representative and she was a state senator in Minnesota at a leadership conference in Madison Wisconsin so I've known her for a fair number of years yeah I you can you can tell it when you go and see people take a presidential run it takes a lot out of them i mean it is it is it's a big undertaking she's a very smart lady an attorney and and all those things and you know obviously she's looking at some future things on a personal level and sometimes it's hard to her remember there is a personal outside government life as well so I think it's probably a good decision for I want to ask you about this because we haven't heard a lot of talk about it as much later there's other so there are many other headlines but the sequester where does that stand right now well the quote-unquote sequester or they across-the-board cut that happen really what is not ideal I mean it wasn't certainly what I would like to do because you you take bad programs and you just reduce them a little bit and you take good programs and you've just whacked them as well what we need to do is really go in and garden you know you don't go into your garden and just lop off everything a foot off the ground you go in figure okay that's a weed and that's a that's a plant I want and you dig those those weeds up so we've got to go in and be smarter about it that's what the whole budget process is about right now but that spending level is our new baseline but it is important to note like fรกรกรก is a perfect example of this the FAA budget will actually have more money in it this year after sequester than it did before the sequester so it just really was more of a curving the rate of growth than it was an actual cut and I think that's where you had some people talking about doom and gloom and and all the things that were going to happen if we dared to have this this this really reasonable cut put in place it was going to cause you know democracy to fail well I mean we know it doesn't and we know it didn't we just have to get used to a slightly different spending scale any big projects coming up that you're gonna be working on yeah I doing a number of things in financial services committee a lot of technical fixes with the dodd-frank bill which is really a bit sort of much like the health care bill was a pretty massive federal undertaking on on regulation dealing with insurance and credit unions and banks and those kinds of things so doing a lot of work they're working on the federal prison industries which is trying to reform that make sure that government entities like unicore aren't working against our private sector folks like Herman Miller Hayworth and steel case and others and so there's there's a lot on the plate always right bill that's right coming back yeah yeah good seeing you guys all right it is 718 as we check in with Leon town

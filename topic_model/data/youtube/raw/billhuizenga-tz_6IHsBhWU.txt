caught up we want to get back to that major story that we have been following all day long President Obama's health care reform plan has been upheld by the US Supreme Court 24 hour news 8 political reporter rick albin has been watching the fallout from the high court's decision and he joins us right now with more on that interesting data watch this come down a very important decision the reaction is predictable swith very much along partisan lines as you would expect the president got much of what he wanted and at the same time court may have given him something he did not the Republican argument that this is a major tax increase something the administration has denied from the beginning of the debate on the Affordable Care Act whatever the politics today's decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure because of this law and the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it if you're one of the 30 million Americans who don't yet have health insurance starting in 2014 this law will offer you an array of quality affordable private health insurance plans to choose from really American people were sold a bill of goods by this administration when it said it what it was going to do and how it was sort of casting it but clearly it is a tax on on this economy I think the American people have spoken clearly on this and I agree with them they believe that this is a bad idea and that that we shouldn't have the federal government injected into our personal decisions our health care decisions like it like it has been now the court is ruled but just like we talked about last night this is not the final word the house is going to vote on repealing the health care act on July eleventh if they do that and they send it to the Senate and the president they most assuredly will not go along with it so what's next politically Republicans will campaign against this Obamacare as they call it from now until November while Democrats will frame it as one of the biggest accomplishments for the president's first term how it plays out in November right now it is anybody's guess but it's going to do something that we're going to be watching closely because as with all these kind of issues it's a double-edged sword both of the Republicans and Democrats will have to be careful how they how they frame it going for the issues in this election it's shaping up like a game of chess this this may be one of the more calm selections we've seen a very long time because we're talking about real tangible issues that impact all of us but the perception of how they impact us is different for all of us am so as a political strategist you have to figure out what does this mean when it comes to the ballot box it's going to be fascinating to watch

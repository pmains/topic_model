bernie sanders laying out a plan to pass parts of president biden's agenda if republicans refuse to support the legislation how would that happen well listen we're going to use reconciliation that is 50 votes in the senate plus the vice president to pass legislation desperately needed by working families in this country right now you did it we're going to do it but we're going to do it to protect ordinary people not just the rich and the powerful reaction now from kansas republican senator roger marshall well senator a lot of working people in america have lost their jobs and are worried that some of the measures some of the executive orders that we've seen from the white house right now will not help them get another job back particularly raising the minimum wage which of course is is uh death knell to many in the restaurant business uh we'll be talking about that later but what do you think about bernie sanders idea of how to how to rush some of this stuff through well between bernie and the president this almost sounds mock leveling uh the president is going to do all these executive orders in the first week here committing all of his sins at one time and it is killing jobs it's going to drive the prices up for uh for for americans it's going to drive the cost of gasoline up at the pump it's going to drive the cost of electricity up it's going to make us more dependent upon oil from the middle east and then senator senator bernie sanders plan it's what that's going to create is uncertainty and i know your your business folks don't like that uncertainty of going up and down through this process of budget reconciliation just have it reversed again in two years hopefully but you know who's hurt most by the uncertainty it's not the big corporations they can absorb a lot of these costs the the silicon valley companies have no problems paying they they already pay twenty dollars minimum wage for for most of their workers it's the small businesses uh the ones that have been hurt the most by these lockdowns all over the country particularly in the restaurant business they if if you double their labor costs uh they're never gonna get back in their feed right you know that is right you know half the jobs in america at least are from small businesses and increasing the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour in kansas is significant and what it's going to cause is more a mechanization in some of those small businesses replacing laborers it's going to drive the cost of a cup of coffee up at mcdonald's so seniors won't be able to afford it anymore so the the net net on increasing the wage across the country will backfire and then regulations even more so these small companies can't handle these increased regulations and the cost it does to to run that small business and let's talk about keystone pipeline because not only was that as peter ducey was telling us to slap at our neighbors to the north at the canadians who who spent billions of dollars trying to make jump through hoops and and answer regulatory barriers and they did so uh now that's been canceled uh but it's also slapped those u.s oil workers uh many of whom were getting very well paying oil jobs now they're they're they're going to lose those jobs and of course american consumers are going to end up paying more at the pump yeah exactly some of those people are my friends friends that work for those pipelines that were putting that particular pipe the keystone pipeline in so you're right there are great paying jobs and of course just the the suddenness of this without even having the courtesy to call one of our main trade partners canada is typically a number one two or three uh export for most of the products from this country uh so it was a slap in the face to canada who's been a great partner to america for decades senator if you admit if you will uh bear with me i just want to switch to the pandemic for a moment the new cdc director dr rochelle walensky now saying the federal government does not know how many covet vaccine doses the u.s currently has you are a physician that's your your real job if you will are you worried about vaccine shortages you know i'm not i think that pfizer and moderna both have committed to a hundred million each uh by the end of february we have johnson and johnson and astrazeneca coming online as well but what i'm tired of is excuses you know what leaders do is make the very complicated simple government is making the simple complicated what we do know is that we've already given out some 40 million vaccinations across the the country that need to be put in people's arms so i'm tired of excuses we have the infrastructure that we're able to give three million flu vaccines uh in a day across this country so why don't we use that current infrastructure using community pharmacists the county health departments use that strict infrastructure that's already there we can do this if we just get government out of the way interesting we already have uh uh two vaccines we've got another couple on the way johnson johnson astrazeneca finally i want to move to therapeutics we only have about a minute but i got a personal story about this my wife and i had covert had the covet bug about a month ago we tested positive we immediately qualified for regeneron infusions we got them within 48 hours all of our symptoms were gone all indications are there's an excess of supply of the regeneron antibody therapeutic and there are others eli lilly etc uh but we can't get it out quick enough because of regulatory barriers how can we speed the delivery of those drugs which help for those people who are infected you know this is so frustrating these monoclonal antibodies are miracle drugs and once again we have we have government getting in the way let doctors make the decisions who they think would benefit from the most whatever we need to do to get government out of the way and let the doctors make the decisions that doctor-patient relationship is what's valuable do you think there's a way i know there's a lot of still antagonism between democrats and republicans is there a way you personally can work with democrats to try to get this done because this is a miracle drug and there are still millions of people around the world that are infected by covet 19 despite the vaccines we need these therapeutics can you work with democrats to get this done you know absolutely david but to your point instead we're going to be talking about impeachment all week next week we're not going to have discussions like this on how do we get the vaccines out how do we get these therapeutic agents out when the when the front page is going to be talking about the impeachment we need to be talking about how do we get vaccinations in people's arms how do we get this economy going senator roger marshall good to have another physician in the senate we need people with real jobs in there good to see you sir thank you for being here uh congratulations on your new tenure as senator meanwhile

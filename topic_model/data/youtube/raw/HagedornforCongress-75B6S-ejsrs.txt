well I may concerned and I saw what members of Congress [Music] country new ever ever heard of could make it to how they can make a difference I was on the hill in the 80s from Congress been staying with my work for me and my father before him they passed the bills that Ronald Reagan needed in order to rearm our military in order to bring us back and so I'd like to be part of that coalition out there to help the president get that done now you know hey look Donald Trump was dealt a very bad hand by Barack Obama when Barack Obama took office relatively speaking the Middle East was statement and a lot of pro West or neutral governments and President Obama and for whatever reason decided he had the metal over there and make some deals and make some changes and we ended up with Isis we ended up with Egypt being undercut to the point where the military military had to take over from the Muslim Brotherhood we saw what happened in the Libyan and the refugee mess the fetish crop caused all throughout Europe and to the United States and some degree and so you know these problems that Obama pushed out there not Trump's trying to deal with them North Korea it is the president that stands up just like Ronald Reagan and says you know what we're to stand with our with our you know we're going to stand without allies and we're going to stand up to our enemies and so North Korea does Iran do other things I would be somebody would support the president in that regard now as far as the problems here at home the threats that we face yes nobody has been more of a strong advocate for border security and the rule of law and everything that goes associated with that than me I've been talking about that virtually my entire life I think that it's a disgrace that 16 years after 9/11 we still have a visa passport system where we don't know who's even in the United States anymore people who should have left the country there are five million people here will overstayed their temporary visas I believe they should be found especially if they're from terrorist countries and sent home so they can come here the legal process when it comes to the border and our security now we need to build a wall we need to do everything we can to have the rule of law and if that means regular order on deportations and those types of things that's fine I support merit-based immigration not chine chain migration none of that stuff merit-based immigration so the people that come here are going to help our country and they're going to be in a good position to support themselves and that's very important and when it comes to the issue of Islamic supremacy there have been nobody in the country who's led on this even more than me in the last election before Donald Trump ever made it into the issue I said you know Minnesota has an assimilation and a terrorist problem because of refugees who have come here mostly from countries that hate America and so I called for a refugee program timeout took flak from it from the Libyans and others but it was the right call the president when he would took office started that process and he's made some changes I still think we need a timeout because we have problems but Islamic terrorism Islamic supremacy people coming here from countries that he in America it's a huge threat and I would be someone and not you know I have been not worried about what people say about me not worried about what people think about me we're going to do the right thing to protect our country because the first responsibility of entered any member of Congress is to protect the United States and defend the American people and that's what I would do on your behalf

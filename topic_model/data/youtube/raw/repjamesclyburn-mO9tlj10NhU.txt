well good afternoon evening whatever it might be wherever you are uh we've been having a little debate here uh uh and I've been doing some research uh this time of day it's called a late afternoon I don't think it's good to see a good late afternoon so uh whichever may be the your choice thank you so much for joining us today welcome there are two from public service to Financial Freedom a webinar on the public serve service loan forgiveness program I want to thank attendees joining us by Zoom and thank our special guests from federal student aid and the student borrower protection Center for being here today to share critical information to student loan borrowers in the public sector the public service law and forgiveness program was enacted in 2007. with a promise that after 10 years of service with a government or a non-profit entity and 120 qualifying payments borrowers would see their federal student loan forgiven started in 2017. unfortunately the program has not lived a to its promise if Government accountability office analysis of pslf in 2018 found that the Department of Education denied it roughly 99 percent of applicants for pslf from September 2017 through April 2018. this trend continued through March 2019. according to Geo of the 76 000 and two long forgiveness application that have been processed the pslf service had denied 75 000 138 that's 99 percent as of March 2019. through all of 2019 on the 2000 246 pslf applications were approved by the services out of 161 000 328 applications filed in 2020 296 340 pslf application applications were found only 6 493 applications were deemed eligible by the services to add insult to injury the Trump Administration proposed eliminating the pslf program in its 2018 and 2019 budget on October 6th 20 21. the Department of Education under the leadership of President Biden and secretary Cardona announced a set of actions to help restore the promise of pslf and help more Borrowers gain forgiveness so far more than 175 000 buyers have received more than 10 billion with a B 10 billion of loan forgiveness under the emergency program which is set to expire on October 31st in less than two months this program will expire in some Divine Harris Administration has provided over 32 billion dollars in loan relief to 1.6 million Borrowers in the coming months there are 43 million Americans with federal student loans will receive some relief under President bonds recently announced student loan debt relief plan here with us this evening to talk more about the pslf temporary waiver and the student loan debt relief plan for our special guests Ashley Harrington senior advisor in the office of federal student aid at the United States department of education education and Mike Pierce executive director of a student borrower protection Center and I'm pleased to yield to them at this time and I slip thank you so much sir it's a pleasure to be here this is the second one we're doing we thank you so much for your continued leadership on student loans and helping us get the word out on this and so many issues so we really thank you and your team for putting this together um I'm really excited to be here uh and share not just information about the waiver but as Mr Clyburn mentioned this exciting new news about the debt relief that was announced um that was announced a little over a week ago that representative Clyburn and so many of his colleagues fought for um so I let Mike go ahead and share his screen and we'll uh get started awesome we can go to the next slide all right so we're here today to talk about Public service loan forgiveness and The Limited waiver but we have to start by talking about the overall student loan relief that the Biden Harris Administration has provided so far next slide even before we got to the announcement about a week ago um we had already proved almost 34 billion dollars in debt cancellation for almost 1.7 million borrowers that is more than any other Administration ever this is a huge deal and that includes 10 billion dollars for 175 000 public servants through improvements to pslf 9 billion for 425 000 borrowers through improvements to how we process toll and permanent disability discharges and over 14 billion 14 billion dollars for more than a million borrowers whose institutions took advantage of them so it was already a lot of work being done and then a little over a week ago we announced a new debt relief plan next slide um the Biden administration's new student loan debt plan is going to forgive up to twenty thousand dollars for borrowers who went to college and received Pell Grants up to ten thousand dollars for borrowers who didn't receive Pell Grants and everyone is eligible for this if they make less than 125 000 as a single person or less than 250 000 as a married household so this is going to provide immediate relief for so many borrowers up to 20 million bars are expected to get full cancellation and the rest will have their their payments will be much more affordable we also extended the student loan Applause through December of this year and we have proposed a new income-based plan to make repayment more manageable and affordable in the long term you can find more information about the general debt relief plan at studentaid.gov debt relief we're here tonight to focus on pslf but I hope we want to share that these things work together they don't preclude each other you can apply and you should apply for both you don't want to miss the limited waiver deadline on 1031 you don't want to miss out on access to this debt relief that application will be available by early October you want to get all the relief that you can so that you can better manage your loans and so that you can get out of debt as soon as possible um so we're really excited to be here I'll turn it back to Mike to start talking about pslf all right well thank you Ashley and thank you Congressman for the chance to be here again to join you for a second one of these um Ashley and I are going to get into the guts of how these really exciting changes to Public service loan forgiveness work for folks that are working in public service uh but I'd like to start all of these um workshops out by saying if you've tried to do this before and it hasn't worked for you this is the right time to give it another try uh hundreds of thousands of Public Service workers across the country going back almost 14 years have got tripped up on red tape misled by student loan companies just generally run into trouble trying to get their debts canceled under Public service loan forgiveness that is part of why we're here today what the Biden Harris Administration has done and actually I'll talk more about the specifics of this is try to press the reset button on this program to actually keep the promise to Public Service workers so that if you've worked in public service for 10 years the government will cancel your student loan debt I'm going to talk a lot about the wheels here both about how the program used to work and how it works now and Ashley's going to talk about the steps you need to take to be able to get back on track um but just know that it all seems complicated and it doesn't need to be this way and uh there's lots of additional information on studentaid.gov which is the government's website that talks about Public service loan forgiveness there's also dozens and dozens of frequently asked questions and instructional videos on forgivemystudentec.org which is a website that my organization runs along with a number of large labor unions um there uh is lots of support out there for folks including the congressman district office and the team at federal student aid who can really help you make heads or tails of all this complicated stuff so um with that I want to jump into Public service loan forgiveness and how it works so um for a long time going all the way back to 2007 this program required you to do four different things and if you've tried to sort this out in the past you might have run into this and been confused and so just know that um Ashley's going to talk about how this is all simpler for a limited period of time because of what divide and Harris Administration has done to make good by these promises to Public Service workers but first i'm going to say what the law says so what the law says is that you need to have the right kind of loan you have to be enrolled in the right kind of repayment plan you have to work full-time for a public service employer and we'll talk about what that means for just a sec and then if you do all of those things every month for 120 months and after you do that for 120 months the government will cancel any debt you have left and that happens tax-free it happens after you submit some paperwork and we're going to talk about the mechanics of that um but just know that this was the deal that the law made with people and folks got tripped up at every one of these steps um to figure out if you have the right type of loan uh and we'll talk about how that's changed right now but just for a little while the law says you need to have a direct loan that's a federal student loan made directly by the U.S Department of Education to somebody that has uh sought to go to college and those Direct Loans are how most people pay for college since 2010 but there are lots of older borrowers out there like me that went to college before 2010 and took out loads from Sallie Mae or from a big bank it was guaranteed by the federal government and those loans um there are called Federal family education loan program loans or ffelp loans if you're younger and you went to school more recently and you've never touched these loans don't worry about it forget the drug and forget the acronym but if you are an older borrower like me you have one of these older loans made by a bank or if you have a Perkins loan made by your school you can turn those loans into the right type of loan but you have to take some extra steps and I'll walk you through how to do that today um under the law so what the rules used to be and what the law says is if you take those steps to make your old loan into a loan that works for Public service loan forgiveness you're not going to get credit for any payments you made before you took those extra steps that's all changed and only for a limited period of time and Ashley's going to talk about why but the law says and you may have been told before that if you have one of these older loans you can't get credit for the public service work you've already done so just know that if you've heard that before that was right at the time the vibe Administration is working to change that but maybe only temporarily uh we'll also talk a little bit more about what it means to have a parent loan if you work in public service there is a way forward for you here but it's a little bit complicated um we also have to be enrolled in the right kind of payment plan and for most people that means making payments based on your income instead of making payments based on how much money you make um that uh is has always been the deal millions of people are enrolled in these so-called income driven repayment plans um they allow folks to pay as little as zero dollars per month if you make very low wages and as Ashley mentioned the vibe demonstration is making these plans even more generous cutting folks monthly payments in half starting next year um there are other payment plans that count there are other payment plans that don't count I won't spend time on that because a lot of that's changed but again just temporarily and Ashley's going to talk about those changes uh you also have the right type of employment and we'll talk more about this during the Q a I'm sure um the uh government doesn't care what you do for a living it only cares about who you work for so if you work for any federal state or local government agency if you work for any 501c3 non-profit or if you work for other kinds of nonprofits that provide certain kinds of services like early childhood education or public health um you will qualify no matter what you do for that organization you could be a lawyer in the general counsel's office you could also be a teacher in the classroom and as long as you work for an organization that counts you have a right to get your debt canceled and as long as you're working full-time and that means greater than 30 hours a week based on your employer's definition of full-time and you can tell your employer that working 30 hours a week is all you need to do for the program here there's lots of organizations that will say if you don't work 37 and a half hours or 40 hours a week you don't qualify for benefits they may not consider you a full-time employee for other reasons but you could still be a full-time employee for Public service loan for example so just know that the law says 30 hours a week you need your employer to sign off on it you can sometimes play Let's make a deal with your employer but um the goal here is to just acknowledge the work that you've done the service that you've done in our communities or to our country and to get your employer to sign off on that so you can get on track for PSL app and then the last piece here again I won't go into the weeds because um in a lot of voices it's much easier than it used to be but you have to make payments every month for 120 months there have been some changes in these rules over time and I know that there are older Public Service workers out there that have tried to make heads or tails of this and have been told that making a payment late doesn't count or making a payment early doesn't count or pay too much one month doesn't count um a lot of that is much simpler now the payment counting rules are much more friendly to Public Service workers so I just want to acknowledge that a big part of the reason why we're here a part of the recent things have gone wrong is that these rules around payment counting messed a lot of folks up but they're better now um it's also important to know that generally you have to make payments to have them count except right now in March of 2020 Congress paused the student loan system um that means that everybody that has a loan the government owns hasn't had to make a payment going all the way back to March of 2020. um and those that period of time when you didn't have to make payments because of the pandemic that still counts towards Public service loan forgiveness so everybody that's been in one of these coven forbearances for the past two plus years can still get credit towards Public service loan forgiveness even if they have not paid a bill foreign we talked a little bit at the top about how things have gone wrong for folks and I think Congressman Clyburn put it really well talking about just the scale of the broken promises for uh hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of people across the country that's the case for these new reforms that Ashley's going to talk about now uh we just wanted to acknowledge that tens of thousands of Public Service workers told their government backed up by members of Congress psychographer Claiborne uh status turn Attorneys General and many others uh but this just wasn't okay that in America We Can't Break promises to people that have student debt particularly people working in public service and the Biden Administration asked for feedback from people that have been tripped up and then made their best effort at doing right by everybody and so with that I'm happy to hand it back to Ashley who's going to talk more about what's changed why things are easier and how to get your debt canceled thanks Mike uh great overview I get to talk about the fun stuff right I get to talk about these updates we've made these time limited changes that we started last October um Congressman Clyburn talked about all of the people who were denied prior to this and how much progress we've made since this waiver so you too could be one of these borrowers who gets forgiveness or you could get closer to forgiveness which still helps so um we're happy to share this information next slide so last October we announced something that we call the limited pslf waiver simply it's time limited changes to pslf we're waiving some of the rules so that borrowers can get credit for periods of repayment that normally don't qualify for pslf under these time limited rules you can get credit for any prior period of repayment no matter the Loan program the repayment plan whether you made a payment made the payment on time or made it in full so all the things that Mike talked about about how you had to be on a certain repayment plan you had to make a certain type of payment we're not looking at any of that we don't care what we're payment plan you were on under the waiver we don't care if you missed a payment as long as you weren't in default in school or in a grace period you could get credit you're even counting some periods of defermenting forbearances this is huge we're not looking at any of that stuff we're even letting people get credit for time and repayment on Fell or Perkins loans so you no longer have to consolidate and start at zero that is how so many people have gotten forgiveness or closer to forgiveness you still need qualifying employment we haven't changed anything about that but we are giving credit for for time we normally didn't give credit for we just want to know if you earn something we call Active repayment status and we Define that very generously and these changes are for people who already have Direct Loans people who have already Consolidated to the Direct Loan program and everybody who consolidates into Direct Loan program by October 31st of this year next slide so let's talk a little bit more about that big piece payments made prior to consolidation are now eligible so that means even if you have a fellow Perkins loan you still have one now or you had one before they used to say you're going to start at zero right that was the things you can consolidate you can get in direct loan programs and you can work towards pslf but you're going to start at zero under the waiver that is no longer the case under the waiver you don't start at zero it's huge again we're not looking at your repayment plan we're not looking at your loan type there's a quick there's exception for parent plus and we'll talk about that you still have to be full-time employed in public service and you have to take steps now I can't stress enough how important it is that you take Steps either consolidation and or doing your pslf form which will talk about how you do that later by October 31st of this year because after that we go back to normal pslf rules and you don't want to miss out on getting all the credit you can before the rules go back to normal next slide so you could be a borrower and you could fall into one of three groups you could only have Direct Loans if you only have Direct Loans you just want to make sure you have a pslf form on file that's how you raise your hand the you don't need to consolidate if you have only Direct Loans the only reason you might want to consolidate if you have only Direct Loans is if you have loans that have been in repayment for different periods of time so say you went to undergrad went and then started working in public service and then went back to school to grad school and got another degree and got more loans and now you're back in public service if you consolidate all those loans now before the waiver is over you can then that entire consolidation loan will get all of the credit for the undergrad loans and the grad loans and you could potentially get those grad loans for giving sooner they'll get forgiven at the same time as the undergrad loans but if all of your loans are generally the same amount have spent the same amount of time in repayment and you just have Direct Loans you don't have to worry about consolidating you just want to get that form in if you've already Consolidated to the Direct Loan program you want to submit form for the time prior to consolidation because now you can get credit and if you still have fellow Perkins loans you have the most to do because you've got to consolidate and get that for a minute and you've got I do about 10 31 of this year next slide quick note about Parent Plus Loans right because I'm sure we have a lot of parent plus borrowers here I think we talked about Parent Plus Loans are eligible for pslf and that is based on the parents employment not the students but you won't get any additional credit under the waiver what I mean by that is for the other direct consolidation loans you're not starting a zero right you can get credit for the fellow Perkins loans that's underlying if you have a direct consolidation loan with an underlying parent plus you're not going to get any additional credit for the time when it was purely a regular old Parent PLUS Loan you won't get any additional time there you could get additional time for the time after consolidation if you missed a payment or you were on the wrong repayment plan or something like that but nothing pre-consolidation if you had a Parent PLUS Loan and your own student loan and you Consolidated those together you could then get additional credit based on the student loan for that entire loan but not based on the parent loan next slide so we do want to note a couple of things about consolidation because so many folks have to consolidate take advantage of this and I will say we have taken a lot of this thing out of consolidation prior to this consolidation had a bad had a bad name to it it was for a reason right you start you consolidating you start at zero for pslf you consolidate it you started at zero for income based repayment you did all of these things under the waiver and under the other actions we are taking that is no longer the case there's no longer been there's no there's never been a better time to consolidate so but there are still a couple things that happen your payment will change right because it's essentially a new loan your payment could go down but it also could go up it could increase and that's because once you consolidate if you no longer have a partial financial hardship you may not have access to some of the more affordable income-based plans so just something to keep in mind if you have unpaid interest in fees it'll get capitalized and your principal balance will go up now most of these things you're probably not worry about if you're working towards pslf because you're just trying to get to 120 and get that forgiven but we do want to make sure you know about them your new consolidation loan will generally have a new interest rate it's going to be based on a weighted average of the loans you consolidate again if you're working towards pslf you likely don't care about a lot of this and you don't have to consolidate all of your federal student loans you can consolidate One loan five loan six loans it's up to you but once you consolidate those loans once they're dispersed you can't undo it next slide so another big thing we announced earlier this year back in April was something called an IDR payment count adjustment this is the other piece that took that thing out of consolidation because you're not starting at zero but it also has some other big pieces we want to flag borrowers can get credit now for periods of long-term forbearances so if you have periods of 12 or more months consecutive or 36 more or more months cumulative you can get credit towards IDR and if you certify employment you can also get credit towards pslf this is a big deal and we're going to try to implement and we'll be implementing this automatically later this year and next year but you still have to certify employment we're also giving credit for time and deferment prior to 2013 as long as it wasn't in school deferment and credit for economic hardship deferments after 2013. and again all of this is going to get applied automatically but you still have to certify employment next slide so do we just want to flag quickly that there's a lot going on and all of these things take time so if you're waiting you've applied you haven't heard anything just be patient with us just know that as long as you've done your part you've got your forms in you can you've Consolidated your stuff you've done everything you can do the rest is on us don't worry about whether you haven't heard anything if you do your part you will not be held responsible for how long it takes us to process your form any delays that we have we just want you to do your part as long as you do that by October 31st you are good we also want to flag that many borrowers are being transferred to Mohela if they're already in pslf or if you're a new pslf borrower and you're submitting forms to P to Mohela even though you previously heard about Fed Loan Servicing there's nothing to worry about here transfers are a normal part of the servicing process nothing is going to change about your accounts your terms anything like that so don't worry I was transferred recently it's gonna be okay it's a normal part of the process Mohela is now the pslf servicer as of July 1st next slide I'll turn it back to Mike thanks all right well thank you Ashley for um sharing all the good news about how this has become just so much easier for folks who are trying to get their debts canceled I'm going to talk now through a bunch of the specific pieces that Ashley mentioned um but first this is how you get started uh so to make sure that you are able to get on track and take advantage of this uh new opportunity Ashley mentioned you need to either have a direct loan already or you need to take these older Federal loans and turn them into Direct Loans so to figure out whether you have to take that step first you need to go to studentaid.gov and figure out what kind of loan you have and so you do that by logging in you can create a credential it's very easy you can do it in a single sitting um just register just like you would any other website this is also the same place where you applied for federal financial aid you may use it to enroll in a different repayment plan so you might already have a login but what you'll get is uh what's called your student aid dashboard and that'll give you all the information you need to know about all the loans the government knows you took out whether those are older Federal loans made by a bank or by Sally May or by your school through the Perkins Loan program or whether they're newer Federal loans May directly by the Secretary of Education through the Direct Loan program and um you can see that by looking at the details if you need even more information there's a way to actually download the administrative record for your loan by clicking on this my student aid data um button but uh for most folks you probably won't need that you can just look at your details and you'll see a screen like this and it will show you what loans you have that still have balances it will also show you if you've already taken out a consolidation loan to pay off some of those older loans that's what this person's screenshot chose but if you see things like Perkins loans with an outstanding balance or anything that says ffel or federal family education loan that means you're going to have to take this extra step to consolidate so once you've done this checkup you've taken a look at the loans on your account if you've decided that you do have to take the step to swap those loans out turn them into a new direct loan I'm going to show you how you do that too so consolidating your loan that's just student loan speak for paying off your old loan with a new loan and then owing that new loan to the Department of Education it works sort of similar to refinancing a mortgage you are basically just taking out a new loan from the federal government and using it to pay off those old loans and the owner of your old loan gets paid and you owe a debt to the government now instead and that makes you eligible for the debt cancellation that Ashley talked about at the beginning through this new by the administration initiative that's a 20 or 10 000 the debt relief it also makes you eligible to get on track for Public service loan programs it is a really important step and to do that you go right back to studentnane.gov same place we were before you log in and you go to manage your loans and instead of going to Public service loan forgiveness which we'll talk about in a minute you're going to consolidate my loans and you can fill out this electronic application to be able to consolidate your loans these are screenshots of what it actually looks like but on forget give my student debt.org we have step-by-step instructions and an instructional video on how you actually navigate this process along with frequently asked questions if you need more help but know that you can fill this application out electronically in a single sitting and once you're done the government will take that application and process it uh it will let you select your student loan company because you're here today I assume you're working in public service and you want to get on track for Public service loan forgiveness so you should select this company called mojila uh m-o-h-e-l-a they are the company that the government pays to handle the Public service loan procurements program they're going to help you count up your payments they're also going to help you get on track um and once you select your student loan servicer you'll also be able to go through a couple of other prompts confirm the loans that you want to be included select a payment plan everybody that wants to pursue Public service loan programs should select income driven payment plan and then you'll sign and submit for processing this uh this application to consolidate your loans and then your Off to the Races and everybody needs to do this everybody who has one of these older loans needs to do this by October 31st you shouldn't wait though you should do it right now and normally we would tell folks to do this first let it get processed and then fill out your application for Public service loan forgiveness Ashley's going to talk more about this in just a second but um don't wait do everything at once we're at the deadline now you have just a bit more than six weeks to get your paperwork in process to get your debt canceled so if you need to consolidate don't wait any longer and don't wait to hear back just fill out your consolidation application right now and with that I'm going to hand it back to Ashley thanks Mike um so now we're going to talk about how you actually apply for pslf using the help tool that's the best way to do we really encourage you to use our help tool to apply next slide so we have a really great employer database that um we work very hard to improve all the time and we recently launched a new pslf employer Search tool because normally to see which employers are in our system already you had to have a student aid.gov account log into your account and then you can see it now we have a publicly available database it's really great you don't have to log into your account to see it so please use that next slide but if you're actually applying for psls you're going to want to generate a form that looks like this this is the physical form and while you can download it and fill it out we prefer you to use our pslf help tool because it helps us process your stuff faster next slide so you can get to the help tool at studentaid.gov pslf that's right here and then you'll log in next slide you'll log in using your studentaid.gov account and the first thing it's going to ask you for is your employer information and you're going to need something called an EIN employer identification number it's found in your in your W-2 inbox B it's on your pay stub and it's on um or you can ask your HR department for it directly but you're going to need the Ein for every single employer you want to get credited for and you're going to put it in here to our help tool and I just apply a couple things that could happen with our help tool it's really great but it's not perfect it doesn't have every single qualifying employer for pslf it doesn't have every single employer that exists it's never going to be perfect so you may get a result that doesn't make sense you may get something that says ineligible or likely ineligible which just just means undetermined and you might be like what is going on if that happens still continue complete the form it will create a case for our employer team they're going to look at it and as long as it's later um approved you're going to be okay you've met the deadline if it it pops us pops up as eligible that's great it's already in our system and you're good to go but some folks that's not going to happen for and that's okay and remember you just have to do your part the rest is on us but you're gonna need the Ein for every single employer you want to get credit for next slide so you'll put those in you'll click next you'll take go to this next page that talks about consolidation and covid-19 relief next slide then you'll have this sectional application details which is really just asking you do you have 120 payments or not and even if you think you have 120 payments because you listen to our whole presentation and you know that we're going to counter consolidation stuff we're going to count some deferments all of that and you're definitely going to be at 120. if our system doesn't think you're at 120 yet because you haven't Consolidated yet or something hasn't happened you still have to put no it doesn't change how your application is processed or what we do with it but you do have to put the answer that aligns with what our system believes next slide then you'll get to your personal information all of this is going to be pre-filled out because you've logged into your account but if you want to make a change you can next slide and then you're going to get to review and save you're going to make sure everything looks right you're going to click save next slide and you're gonna get this confirmation page if you had eligible employers you're going to get a PDF that's already filled out that looks like that form I showed you a few slides ago and once you have that now comes the fun part you've got to print it out you've got to sign it you've got to get it signed by the employer and then you've got to submit it to Mohela if Mohela is not your servicer yet you have to submit it by postal mail or by fax if they are your service or you can do it right online but you're gonna have to get signatures next slide and so you want to make sure you're following our signature rules because we have we are very picky about signatures and we will send it back and we don't want you to get yours sent back on the technicality so you can use a signature that's hand drawn on your signature pad using your mouth or your finger that's fine you can use a scanned photo of a signature that was hand drawn on paper and dropped on that PDF that's fine too you can do a literal wet signature where you print it out get an ink pen and sign it and so does your employer that's great those all work you can't use a cursive font so you can't just like go to Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF type out in cursive font and drop it in there doesn't work you can't use digital certificate based signatures so DocuSign things like that can't use those not allowed so make sure you're following the signature rules both for your signature and your employer signature next slide I'm gonna turn it back to Mike all right um so I'm going to share a few tips here um that will help make this process a little bit easier for folks but really if you follow the instructions that we've laid out here today um you should be okay and I do want to make a plug one more time to forgive my student debt.org in addition to Ashley's website in addition to the education Department's website um forget mystudentec.org has a lot of the information that we've shared today too broken down step by step with instructional videos and frequently asked questions and can help clarify some points that maybe we rushed through today because we're trying to get to the Q a and we're we're just trying to to make good use of everybody's time so just know that there's lots of ways to get support out there and lots of good answers to the questions that you have they are probably the same questions everybody has um so a few reminders first when you're filling out forms here and this is especially true when you're going to get your employer to sign a form please don't make hand Corrections on the form the education department's website just can't make heads or tails right education Department's processors just can't make heads or tails of this you're going to get your form rejected I know it's sometimes a pain to get the right person at your organization to focus on this long enough to sign your forms but if they make these kind of hand Corrections because they uh see that you've got your dates wrong or they see that you've got an address wrong it's going to make you start the whole process over so it's better to just print out a clean form do it right the first time when you send it in even if it means a little bit more pain on the other end with your employer and I know that we are running out of time here right down to the wire and that's going to be tough for folks who have to navigate their own work bureaucracy and also the government's bureaucracy but just keep in mind that the cleaner your forms are to start the faster they get processed the sooner we can cancel your debt also don't worry if you see information that seems wrong trust what Ashley told you here today about what these new rules are there's lots of bad information that's still out there it's not actually wrong it's just information about how the law Works before the special Biden Harris initiative to keep this promise to Public Service workers and there's lots of kind of out-of-date information on notices that come from student loan servicers sometimes you'll see this on the education department's website in pages that haven't been updated so just know that there are sometimes things you'll get that will say your loans don't qualify because you have an older loan if you've taken those steps to consolidate you will get on track trust us when we tell you that this has worked for hundreds of thousands of people but you might still get wrong information um also note exactly what Ashley said before there's this place on the pslf help tool where if you have a loan that's being Consolidated and the government just doesn't know that that's in the pipeline because it hasn't been processed yet it's not going to let you generate your Public service loan certification unless you click no I haven't made 120 qualifying payments even if you know you have you're sure you're right you're doing everything we're telling you it's just a block in the system and you have to roll with it to be able to get to the next screen so we just wanted a flag like this is a pain point for folks we've heard from people that have been tripped up because it doesn't seem right uh it's not right but it is the way the technology works and you just have to roll with it uh we also know that lots of people are getting weird information about what payments count from their student loan servicer directly whether that's my fed loan which is the company uh that handled pslf applications up until July or Mohela who handles applications going forward people are getting counts of qualifying payments that aren't right they're not consistent with the rules of the waiver that's because there's just a lot of back and forth happening and hundreds of thousands of applications all being processed at once do know that the education department is the one that's going to notify you when it's time for you to have your debt canceled and if you get something that doesn't seem right in between now and then don't lose hope this is just the system working its way through and your debts are going to get canceled as long as you get your paperwork on time I'm gonna hand it back to Ashley hey Mike actually do you mind finishing this out absolutely do that so um just a couple reminders at the very end here the last things that you need to do to be able to get over the Finish Line um we talked how to do each of these already today so just as a reminder first confirm that you have a qualified employer you could do that using the pslf help tool you consolidate your loans if you need to and we walk through how to do that step by step submit your pslf forms um certifying your service telling the government how long you've worked in public service that requires an employer signature so it does take a little bit of time but once that's done the government can track you and can cancel your debt and reward you for the service that you've already completed uh you have to do all of this so submit your forms consolidate your loans get your paperwork moving by October 31st it doesn't mean it needs to be processed by then it just means you need to have taken the steps that you can take by October 31st so I just want to flag that there are some problems that folks have encountered uh about getting an employer recognized or getting an answer back from a student loan company about your payment count you're not going to be able to get your debts canceled by October 31st if you're just starting this process right now the the line of folks waiting for a debt cancellation is just too long so just know that if you've taken the steps you've done it's actually put it you can do the things you could do by October 31st the government's going to take care of the rest and it may take a few more months but it'll happen um I do want to flag a couple more times that there are uh tons of great resources on the education department's website to be able to get on track here of course the public service help tool that we've looked at a few different times today has lots of great information there's more general information on studentaid.gov when it's time for you to submit your employer certification form your pslf application to your student loan company this company mohila is the company that's going to process that you can submit that by US mail if you're not currently a mobile customer or you can fax it and I know that's a a bad thing to hear right now because it's 2022 and I can't believe you can't do this electronically but if you're not a Mohela customer you have to do this by snail mail or by fax so one thing that we recommend if you're doing this because it's so close to the deadline you probably won't hear back before October so if you're going to submit it by mail go to the post office and get a receipt from the post office shows you mail the letter if you submit it by fax if you go to Kinkos in the library to use a fax machine make sure that you get the confirmation that shows that you sent the fax to hang on to that in case your records get lost or in case processing gets delayed it gives you some proof that you actually did do the things you could do by the deadline if you're already a Mohela customer if you have some Direct Loans that are handled by mahila and you're still going through this process you can electronically upload the stuff to Mohela but only if you're a mokila customer for a lonely government homes um with that I think we are ready to take some questions oh well thank you very very much thanks to all of you who are participating uh Bree uh Nathan who is going to uh conduct this q a Nathan you gonna do it yeah well before we get into the Q a um we actually have someone uh on the call here who has actually been a recipient of uh loan forgiveness through the waiver period so uh I would like to take the opportunity here to give the floor to sharmilyn Fairley um if who can provide a a little bit of her story and attaining forgiveness thank you Nathan um this is shamarlin Fairley I am an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs I'm a psychologist for the VA and I just recently on uh August 26 received Public service loan forgiveness um and it was a little over a hundred thousand dollars that I was forgiven and it was only because of the waiver that I've been forgiven at this point um I started I completed my PhD in 2005. um I was with Sallie Mae and then with navient and with navient they told me lots of stuff that including that I was in the right qualifying payments and I was not um they never even told me about certifying my employment and so um at the point that I decided that I needed to start certifying my employment I found out about that I called them and they said we can't we're not the pslf um servicer and so I did not know that and I've been paying on my loans for a few years um they said that I needed to consolidate so I went through the process of consolidating with fed loans um turning in my uh first ECF Bank pslf form and um I had approximately 50 payments because I've been in and out of forbearance I would call and say I can't afford these payments they would say okay we'll put you in forbearance instead of putting me in an income driven program um so I in 2018 I was about uh have been paying for approximately four years and had about 50 payments when I went to Fed loans um so over the course of that time I continued to pay and then we came into the covert period and so then I started getting credit for the covert period and not paying um but getting that receiving that credit uh when the waiver came out which was I think that was uh in 2020 um I started getting updates from FedLoan saying that we're counting we're we're looking at the waiver we're pounding the things differently just you'll continue to get updates from us and So eventually I went from having 54 payments to having 118 payments and then realizing that I was very close to um being forgiven and part of that was because any payment they said any payment that happened before happened or didn't happen before January 2013 even though I wasn't paying I was going to get credit for that so that really that time between 2007 and 2013 when I wasn't campaign the government because of the waiver gave me credit for that um so that's the deferment of forbearance that Ashley was talking about and so I ended up this year realizing that I was going to be at 120 payments so I I hit my 120th payment on June 1st and again it was only because of the waiver because I probably had paid about five years into the system and I hit my 120th payment on June 1st and from that day forward I was checking Fed Loan and checking student aid checking the department of education site every day to see if my loans were forgiven and finally on August the 26th they were I logged in and saw a balance of zero and I immediately thought they've transferred my loans to Mohela but I called and they said no you congratulations you've been forgiven and approximately that was a Friday so by Monday they had sent me a letter to the Department of Education saying that my loans were completely forgiven that I no longer owed them and again it was it was a little over a hundred thousand dollars which is life-changing for someone who thought that I probably would never pay my loans off and that it would be something that I you know I took to my grade with me um so I am really excited about the program I tell anybody you know you have to do it um I tell them about the deadline but I I'm also just really grateful to the Biden Administration for um seeing the problem and doing something about it because that hadn't been done before June was the first time that I had applied to was able to say yes I have 120 payments so I was never denied but I do know people who were denied and they had paid him for 10 years and were denied for technical reasons um and even though they were given you know information that was erroneous and followed the information they were not forgiven um at that time and so under the administration they have been forgiven so I'm just thankful for that and thankful for the forgiveness and just you know anyone who's thinking about it or is on the fence or you know this is too good to be true I thought that too until I got my uh my zero uh dollar letter saying that I was a hundred percent forgiven for all those loans that I had taken out for graduate school so thanks well thank you thank you very very much uh that is great to hear and I've been uh monitoring the chat room here there are a lot of people who are praying to join you uh Miss family uh and so I also pray that they will meet with similar results the fact of the matter is we know from the statistics over 10 billion dollars already so there are a lot of people uh that are benefiting from this and thank you so much for sharing your story with us now who is monitoring the Q a I see raise hands I'm gonna turn it back to you Nathan okay yeah uh thank you very much sir uh so I just want to let everybody know uh this has been a great presentation and we want to make sure that you have it um ready for you whenever you want to go back and refer to it and so we want to let you know that um this is being recorded and we'll get sent out to everyone who has registered here it will get sent to you uh in the next couple of days uh so you'll get the recording as well as the slide deck that uh Ashley and Mike both presents it on um so we uh cat has actually been monitoring the chat here and so I'm gonna um uh give turn it over to Kat so that she can um help get some of these questions answered here awesome thanks so much Nate um to start with uh to Mike and Ashley we've gotten a couple of questions about um people who might not yet be at their 120 payments and so they're curious if they might be under either 10 years of service or have have less than 120 qualifying payments can this waiver period still benefit them absolutely I tell everyone just get the form in it's not just for people at 120 even if you've only been in repayment two years or five years it doesn't hurt you pslf is not going away it'll still be here it's just the waiver and you want to make sure that we look at your account under the waiver as much as possible because these are more generous rules so go ahead and get the form in it doesn't hurt it can't harm you just get your form in so you can take it into this waiver and then you can keep working towards pslf after that awesome and then for people who say they actually might be on the other end of that either they are post 120 qualifying payments and they're retired um or they're no longer working in public service can they still get credit during this waiver period even if they don't currently have a qualified employer absolutely and that's why this waiver period is definitely for you because under normal rules you have to be a employee for qualifying Public Service employer when you apply for and get forgiveness under the waiver we're not worried about that so if you're retired or you just work part-time or you work in the private sector still get your stuff in now get the credit even if you think you might not have 120 go ahead and get the credit get as much credit now as possible and then later on if you only have like 119 months and you need to go work in a month for a public service org just to get forgiveness maybe you can do that but get your forms in if you're retired you have 120 now is the time for you absolutely um and then we've gotten questions from people wondering so who actually should be signing the form in my building so for example if someone's in a school doesn't have to be their supervisor or the front office and likewise with any job who should be signing that form it's usually someone in your HR department it's someone who is able to certify that you you worked at this on this date for these number of hours for this period so it's usually your HR department some places let your supervisor do it it depends on your employer but it's usually your HR department awesome um and then what was the website again for checking if your employer qualifies you want to go to studentaid.gov pslf um for the help tool so and then um for people who might work at private schools do those count as qualifying employers if it's a 501c3 or a type of non-profit I think it would probably qualify as a public education but if it's a for-profit school no awesome and then also um we have a couple of questions about people who had um in school deferment so I'll ask the first one of those just letting you know there's a follow-up so do periods of in-school deferment count for the purposes of pslf no and then for someone if someone said actually I was in school um I had my loans they were putting it in school to firm it but I actually asked my servicer not to put them in school deferment are there steps this person can take um to get that remedied so they actually said I don't want my school my mom's put in school to firm it but their servicer did so anyway okay couple of things so first your loans going to in school deferment is like automatic you can opt out of in-school deferment only if you had previously been in repayment so if you went to school left went back to school or went back for your second degree and you'd already been in repayment when you go back to school your loans are going to automatically go into in school deferment and then you can say no I want to stay in repayment and you can opt out but you'd have to call your servicer and actually opt out if you've never been in repayment you can't opt out of the deferment um so and if you feel like you asked to be if that if that you're in that prior situation where you've previously been in deferment and you please have been in repayment you tried to opt out a deferment and your slurbisher wouldn't let you then you can submit a reconsideration request and we can take a look at that because that that is wrong information from your servicer so you can submit a PFF reconsideration request but normally you can't opt out of deferment unless you've previously been in repayment if you're currently in school and your loans are in deferment and you're working full-time you might want to opt out of in school deferment if you've been into for payment before because if you're working full-time in public service you could be getting credit for these months towards pslf you could be taking credit pardon the payment pause right now you can get an IDR plan once it's over and if you have previous loans you can consolidate them all together under the waiver and get that extra credit for the newer loans but you can only do that if you opt out of that in school deferment because you can't even consolidate when your loans are running School deferment thanks Ashley and then we've also gotten a lot of questions about people who have um multiple employers so does someone need to submit um a PS live form for Ever every single qualifying employer that they've had you got to submit a PSL employer I mean it pays a lot of form for every single employer in Period of employment that you want to get credit for if you wanted to count towards your 120 there's got to be a form for that it has to be after October 2007 because that's when Congress created pslf but if you want credit for that month we have to have a form and then for people um who maybe said their employer is um current they no longer exist they can't get in contact with the old employer or um they just can't find their Ein are there other ways that they can verify their employment well you're gonna need that Ein because you've seen that for the form but if you absolutely can't get a signature right we want you to get a signature that's your best bet that's your Holy Grail but if you absolutely can't get a signature because that employer closed or you want something from 2010 and they only have records from 2015 on right they can't sign it they don't have those records if that is the case you can submit a W-2 or you can submit pay stubs and deposit records for those months but you are going to have to submit something that shows that you were employed by that employer um and then Ashley people are asking questions about um payment so if someone has a zero dollar IDR payment does that count towards pslr absolutely that's your payment and then one more question another favorite one that we went through during the payment positive people your payments have been paused since March of 2020 do those still count for the purposes of pslf as long as you still have qualifying employment yes so if you've been able to be employed at qualifying psf employer for this entire time or any part of that time you can get credit for every single one of these months if you have it for the full time that's 30 months towards the 120 and you're more than a fourth of the way towards your 120 required for forgiveness that's incredible and then um again one more time does this apply to retirees to people who you know they already put in their 10 years of qualifying service can they still go back and do the pslf waiver yes and I want you to do it now before the waiver is over because I want you to take part of the one piece of the waiver which is you don't have to currently be working in public service to get forgiveness and then really quickly before we get to the next question we've gotten a lot of questions about will this be shared as Nate mentioned earlier this recording is going to be shared so um yes you will get a copy of this um and then we've also gotten a couple of questions about um about um broad-based cancellation and I wanted to wait a little bit towards the end because I wanted to make sure we weren't mixing that with pslf do you mind walking through the process again for broad-based cancellation um and and what um and what what that update is that she went through at the top of the deck yes so if you make less than if you made a less than 125 000 for a single person in 2020 or 2021 so during the pandemic or 250 000 foreign household and you have Federal loans you are eligible for this for debt relief for one-time debt relief it's up to ten thousand dollars if you didn't receive a Pell Grant and up to twenty thousand dollars if you did receive a Pell Grant the application will be available by early October we're working very hard to make it as simple as possible as easy to do as possible so that everybody can get their forgiveness the goal is that once you apply your forgiveness will be processed within four to six weeks and hopefully for folks who no longer have debt after that they will never have to enter repayment again because our goal is to get it done before repayment restarts but that's the parameters for that more information is available at studentaid.gov debt relief even if you're waiting for debt relief right even if you're doing that still get your pslf stuff in because you may have more than 20K or more than 10K and you can get the rest for given through pslf but you don't want to miss out on this deadline you want to get as much relief and have access to as many programs as possible you can get both you one does not cancel out the other and then one quick question Ashley uh just two two more quick ones one someone said for cancellation is that going to be um their actual income or their adjusted gross income it's going to be your AGI and then um we've also gotten a lot of questions I'm switching back to psls so I want to make sure people know that we're Switching gears talking about Public service loan forgiveness people have asked different questions about for example their qualifying employers so it doesn't matter what industry they're in so if they teach at a title one school versus um another public a public school that's not classified as Title One or they might not be a teacher in their school or someone says I work for the government doesn't matter what my job is I see you shaking your head we're not going to ask you that you couldn't see it on the Forum but nowhere on the Forum does it say tell us your job title right we don't care we're not asking you what you do for them we're not asking you your salary we're not asking anything like that we just want to know who you work for who pays you who's on that W-2 who's on that pay stub and if it fits in one of those qualifying employer definitions that's all we care about you are a public servant and you can get credit for your service and then actually for service members um is this something that applies to them as well are there any other steps they need to take or any different forms they might be able to use um to certify the periods where they're in service yes you can get credit for your time and service if you were full-time active duty service and you can certify your employment by filling out that first page of the pslf form right um which just has like your information your Social Security all of that so we can identify you and then you can attach your DD214 if you are a veteran or you can attach your scra printout if you are still in um an active duty status so you can just attach that to that first page and submit all of that to Mohela um and then um Ashley do you mind going through um the process again for people who might have Parent Plus Loans if they're ways that those can qualify yes um if you have Parent Plus Loans um Parent PLUS borrowers can get pslf but uh you want to be on for pslf to really give you some benefit right you want to be on an income based plan because our standard plan is a 10-year fully advertising plan so if you're on a Parent PLUS Loan you're on a 10-year plan or any loan your own 10-year plan you're not gonna have anything to forgive theoretically at the end of your 120. for parent plus borrowers to get access to income-based repayment they have to consolidate once they consolidate they have a direct consolidation loan with an underlying Parent PLUS Loan that new direct consolidation loan now has access to one of the income-based plans because there's multiple right one of the plans it's called icr income contingent repayment it is an income-based plan but it is the least generous of the plans so parents could get a lower payment by staying on an extended or graduated plan which then doesn't count towards normal pslf right so we want parents to weigh that out use our loan simulator do what makes the most sense for them but they would to get an ibr plan they have to consolidate and then they get icr so there are a lot of parent plus borrowers who have direct consolidation loans with underlying Parent PLUS because they want to get icr and they want to get pslf fast forward to the waiver right that's normal pslf under the waiver direct consolidation loans people are getting credit for pre-consolidation time and repayment that's only the case if it's not a parent plus loan so if you had for if you had to reconciliation loans that have the underlying fell or Perkins loans and they're your student loans remember we talked about that you can get time you can get credit for the time prior to consolidation under the waiver but if you have a direct consolidation loan that only has underlying parent plus you're not going to get any additional time when it was purely a regular old just a parent plus loan so you wouldn't get an additional time for that but if after consolidation you missed the payment or you were on the wrong repayment plan you could get credit for that time under the waiver because that's how it works for all direct consolidation loans and if you had a Parent PLUS Loan in your own student loans that's so complicated I'm so sorry if you had a Parent PLUS Loan in your own student loans and Consolidated those together then that direct consolidation loan could get additional credit for the underlying student loan which is not for the Parent PLUS Loan and then that would apply to the entire consolidation loan under the waiver because remember under the waiver when you consolidate you get credit for all of the loans for the entire new loan and so loans can get forgiven sooner I feel like it has got to be a better more simpler way to explain this but I have not figured it out yet and I have said it so many times thank you for breaking that down I know that's that's a more complicated one um actually I'm gonna ask this one more time because I know um just so also people know where to find this we're still getting some questions about what to qualify employers who for example someone says I work in emergency services can that count and then he also tell people where they might be able to find a list of qualifying employers yes you want to go to our help to our employer Search tool and you'll need the Ein and you can look it up and see what we think again our tool is not perfect it doesn't have every single qualifying employer but it gives you a sense um so it has to be a non-profit or a government entity um and yes Emergency Services is a qualifying in in qualifying um service so it it should based on what you're saying qualify but um it has to be a non-profit and you'll have to and if it's not our help tool you're gonna have to submit a form has to go through adjudication financially and then for people who are uh asked to be sure they don't say embrace the services could be a tag hung on some private Corporation that may not qualify but you got to be careful with that yes so they'll go with the title go with the employer yep absolutely right sir thank you and Ashley we've also gotten a question about what someone should do if they're currently in default it's a good question so we also announced an initiative called Fresh Start we got a lot of initiatives and they have cool names so first start we're making it so that borrowers who are in default can now um that we're going to make you current you can continue can continue working um towards uh managing your student loans after that so that will be implemented later this year so you wouldn't get credit for time in default under Fresh Start we're gonna make it so that you've uh as if you were not into fall for a payment boss you could get credit for that or you can get credit for time prior to you enter default like if you've only been in default for three years but prior to that you were in pslf and you remember payment you can submit forms for that but you can't actually get forgiveness until you're out of default so once we take you out of default you can keep working towards that and stay on that and then you'll be able to get forgiveness feel like that was a clear example clear way to explain it but maybe not and then one question I'm sorry to switch gears again but I want everyone now talking about Broadway's cancellation because we've gotten this question a couple times we have some people are currently asking they said I'm currently in school or in people who are currently enrolled in school benefit from the broad cancellation announcement yep that that is for everybody awesome um and I think we have time for um just one more question so I just want to make sure um we get to as many as possible um some people are asking so there are periods where they were working in qualified employment um but they may not have been making um they may not have been actually making payments do you mind talking again about what this waiver how it ex it extends what actually might qualify um and then also some people are asking for example they said um what happens if I consolidate am I going to lose my am I going to lose my previous payments can you do you mind just walking through one more time like the really big changes for this waiver process yep so under the waiver consolidation doesn't start you at zero first big change I know you've heard it so many times over the years don't consolidate you start at zero under the waiver not the case you do not have to start at zero so this is the time to consolidate there's never been a better time to consolidate so under the waiver don't start a zero first big change we're not looking at what repayment plan you're on second big change so we talked about you got to be on IDR there's all these IDR plans there's extended graduate there's standard we literally are not looking at what repayment plan you have been on under the waiver don't care it's as if like there was a column that says payment payment and then here's a repayment plan we're not even going to look at this column we don't care if you missed a payment we don't care if the payment was late we don't care if the payment was a couple dollars short we don't care what we care about is if you were an active repayment status and we Define it very generously as long as you weren't in default as long as you weren't in school as long as you weren't in your grace period you can get credit we're even counting some periods of defermenting forbearances so all the stuff you've heard before about all these reasons you can't qualify a lot of them are gone so please apply please take advantage of this opportunity because this is time limited we are going to go back to normal rules and we want you to get as much credit as possible so that then going forward yes going forward get back on IDR make sure you're doing like you want to do that going for it don't miss your payments stuff like that right but right now we're not looking at that so just do it get into the waiver and then you can keep working toward working towards pslf after that thanks so much Ashley so is that if we come to the end yes sir we can we can close everybody out now let me Begin by thinking actually and uh where's your Sidekick ass I he's gone no he's here Congressman there's Mike thank you Mike uh you guys have been great as you know it's the second time we've done this we had over 500 tonight uh we did this before it was in excess of 700 and there are thousands more so we'll ask all of you your fraternities your sororities Masonic groups your churches your friends whoever you may come in contact with we've got until October 31st to take advantage of this waiver and it's not going to be extended I've been talking uh with the president and others at the white house uh the fact of the matter is we are in a position now that is now or never uh because the Biden Administration has determined uh that they uh will not be able uh to extend uh this Beyond October 31st and I don't need to go into that tonight but I understand exactly why they're not doing it and if I did not feel that in that sense I think all of you know I would be saying it but it does make sense so let's do this now that not me that those of us in the Congress who feel that more needs to be done would not be trying to do so legislatively I'm committed to do anymore legislatively and we are going to continue uh to work on this issue so thank you so much for participating this evening I look forward to interacting with you going uh in the future and let's all uh give cheers to Ashley and Mike

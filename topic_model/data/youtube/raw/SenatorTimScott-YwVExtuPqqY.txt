senator tim scott's been representing south carolina and the united states senate for nine years man he can't back out but his time in politics goes back much further chairman of charleston county council on behalf of county council his political career kicked off in 1995 when he won an open at large seat on the charleston county council he became the first black republican elected to any office in south carolina since the late 1800s if you're a black republican then you just you're like a unicorn so there's only not that many of you so they just it's easy to stereotype you or type cast you into a small place and nothing is further from the truth scott says his passion for his constituents is what pushed his political career further up the ladder after serving on the county council for 14 years he went on to serve in the south carolina state house the united states congress and now the u.s senate i had a great mentor a guy named john moniz he was a citadel graduate he was running a chick-fil-a in the northwest mall and one of the lessons he taught me was that tim you have to take responsibility for yourself and after you do that the first thing you should do is not ask someone to help you but find ways to help them now after almost a decade in the u.s senate has scott kept that promise of addressing his voters concerns but people still have a chance to come and you know pull on my my jacket or say tap me on the back when i'm at the gym so interestingly enough i'm a hometown kind of senator so i'm always out and about through my community and throughout the state so for me it's been easy to stay in touch because i live in south carolina i don't live in d.c scott's been the sponsor of 13 bills signed into law one of the most recent was the hbcu partners act which aimed to strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of historically black colleges we've focused a lot of attention on hbcus we've been very successful at through the previous administration we were able to bring the funding to the highest level ever in the history of the country and then we made it permanent for the first time so there's a lot to be to be excited about in what we were able to accomplish when it comes to reaching across the aisle it's no easy feat for most politicians these days as a conservative republican has scott been able to achieve bipartisanship when you find common ground you're usually using common sense and so we've had a lot of success my goal is to make friends not friends like in friendships but friends like in people who are willing to work together credibly on issues that matter to others well according to gov track scott practices what he preaches he was in the 71st percentile in writing bills co-sponsored by democrats compared to other senate republicans but recently scott went head-to-head with democrats during debates on the voting rights bill as one of only three black senators scott's voice was elevated in this conversation as a person who was born in 1965 with a mama who understands racism discrimination and separate and not equal the grandfather who i took to vote and helped him cast his vote because he was unable to read to have a conversation in a narrative that's blatantly false is offensive not just to me or southern americans but offensive to millions of americans who fought bled and died for the right to vote scott argued that the democrats were using voting rights legislation as a partisan power grab but the issue of voting access has come up time and time again especially in the south so has scott remained consistent in his stance on this issue or has he flip-flopped to please his party i'm stronger on my position that we live in the greatest country ever designed on earth and that this country has to be protected and you do that by putting america before politics and so if i walked away from anything it's the dysfunction of washington is driven by ego and partisanship going forward scott says he's not going to be focusing on partisan politics but rather the needs of south carolinians

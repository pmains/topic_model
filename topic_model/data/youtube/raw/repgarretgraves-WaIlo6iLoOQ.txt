you guys help me celebrate congressman thank you mayor look i know everybody's melting so i'm gonna be very quick uh look first of all i i'm really i'm really glad to hear uh representative carpenter dr carpenter she said something's really important it's all about the kids it's all about the kids i mean think about this for just a minute for six years for six years this is sitting here six years and how are we gonna take our kids in the next generation how are we going to create that next generation of leaders if we don't create the best environment for them to be taught in the best facilities and give them the absolute opportunity to reach their maximum potential and so look we've been working with the school board we've been working with the mayor i've been working with with senator barrow and representative carpenter and my good friend uh councilwoman banks is here shawna banks look this is about the kids this is about the future of baker it's about the future of louisiana and and this is our most important asset our most important resource and so i'm proud of the fact that seven million dollars in community development block grant federal funding for being committed to this i'm proud of the fact that we were able to get fema to reimburse millions of dollars and as noted earlier whenever they tried to shortage 1.3 million we had the head of fema we said you are coming here and we brought them to south louisiana we sat down with them we talked to the numbers and they came back and acknowledged we were 1.3 million off and i'll tell you the last thing after listening to y'all and talking about the cost escalation we sent a text message to some of our folks in our office and said we need to go back because there's been inflation [Applause] and we need to go back and look and see what else because it's not about it's not about paying for what was here in 2016. it's about what's here what needs to be here in 2022 and 2023. so we're committed to going back and doing that last thing is this the mayor has made it crystal clear to us that we need to invest in economic development transportation and most importantly we can't see a recreation and we can't see a relapse we can't see what we saw here a repeat of what we saw here in 2016 we can't we can have the best schools the best municipal building we could have the best people the best churches if it's under water it doesn't work and so that's why we've secured over a billion dollars over a billion dollars for flood protection for this basin which includes over half a billion for the compete project which is not just gonna pull water off the comic river and send it over to the mississippi helping to keep this area dry but even projects like like uh cypress bayou and white spider and batteries body that from here south those are all being improved under this investment to make sure that the new school to make sure that our community stays dry we have a safe place for our kids to learn and we're preparing the next generation the great future at baker in south louisiana so thank you

now Pennsylvania Democratic congresswoman Madeline Dean awfully good to see you in terms of this story you are one of four Pennsylvania Democratic congressmen that are campaigning outright for Joe Biden what is your message to Americans as they watch our former vice president responding to this sexual assault Alec accusation thanks for having me on during this critical time for our country in terms of supporting Joe Biden I'm proud to support him but let's talk about the allegations that have been brought forward by this read number one they are extremely serious allegations and so I was wanting to hear from the vice president what he had to say about them I think anybody who comes forward with such allegations needs to be heard and their claim investigated Joe Biden yesterday through statement and through the interview on your network unequivocally denied the allegations what he also did that I think is incredibly important is that he directed the Senate whoever is the archivist of the records to look for any complaint that Ms Reid filed at that time she says she filed a harassment complaint at the time the records will be checked but in the meantime that the vice president has been unequivocal that this did not happen your investigation in the investigation of many other talented reporters will go forward and I don't want to get ahead of that investigation in the meantime I'm extremely proud to support the vice president in his run for the for the presidency for a simple reason 40 years of public service a man who has the experience the intellect the heart the compassion to lead us at a time when we desperately lack that in our current president and it is to our peril so I'm pleased to support Joe Biden for the man that he is for the public servant that he is for the supporter of women that he has been a very strong endorsement they are not surprisingly given the time that you're spending campaigning for him let's take a look at a new op-ed in the Washington Post right now in which Kathleen Parker says the hypocrisy from Democrats on the allegation is stunning but not surprising and she goes on to say now is the time to feel sorry for Christine Blasi Ford her days as the face that launched a million sexual assault allegations are over thanks to Tara Reid and the blinding hypocrisy of Democrats who sought to destroy Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings and that criticism congresswoman is is being echoed by number of the president's supporters on the right what do you say to that I I have not read his Parkers op-ed and she's a talented writer but I don't agree that there's hypocrisy what I do recognize is that finally we are in an era where somebody like MS Reed comes forward and will be heard and her claim will be investigated and it will be either proven or not so I absolutely disagree I'm a Democrat I called for the exposure and investigation of any kind of sexual assault allegation that women come forward with but if the facts prove it not to have been true that will have to be the story so I don't find the hypocrisy okay here is trying to didn't happen because we don't want to believe it let the storm we don't want to get ahead of this story let's see if the complaint is there if there is some proof in the meantime the vice president has been unequivocal all right let's turn to the Keystone State your state their relative to the coronavirus crisis Pennsylvania Governor Tom wolf announcing that 24 counties have met the criteria to be lifted from the stay-at-home order on May 8th that's this coming Friday the two counties that your district covers not among them so when do you think your district will be ready to open and what about your consist of constituents what are they saying and what do they need right now I'm proud of our constituents I'll tell you that all across this state how people have stayed home and heeded the guidance of our governor of our County Commissioners of the doctors and epidemiologist who tell us what we have to do and your previous guests just talked about this I was on the call yesterday that we have each week a couple times a week with the administration the counties that are being reopened had very very little contact with the disease in terms of the numbers that they have had some in single digits but where I am when I represent as Montgomery County and Berks County and we have had more than 400 deaths in the last seven weeks it is an extremely serious pocket where this disease has hit very very hard Philadelphia and Montgomery County have been the epicenter we were among the earliest in this in this Commonwealth so what I want to say is for people in the southeastern region here to stay put all of your sacrifice is worthwhile all of the sacrifices that our first responders whether they're at our grocery store our department store or in our hospitals and nursing homes must be worth something we have to protect and until we can do math testing until we can trace all of the context very rapidly and until we can isolate and identify how far spread this disease is it will continue to be deadly here in my area I really want us to take this very very seriously and not prematurely open okay congressman Madeleine Dean so be it thank you very much do you stay safe and healthy yourself good to see

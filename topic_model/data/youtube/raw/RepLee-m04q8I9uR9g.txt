hi I'm congresswoman barbara Lee and it's my privilege to represent California's East Bay in Congress I am so happy to be celebrating Black History Month with you Black History Month is a time to remember the many accomplishments of the african-american community and to rededicate ourselves to ending racial injustice in our nation it would be impossible to truly embrace the significance of black history month without acknowledging our nation's dark history of racial bias or remembering the many Giants that fought to end slavery Jim Crow segregation and institutional racism for centuries African Americans faced seemingly insurmountable challenges to realize in the American dream despite these odds african-americans became doctors lawyers nurses ministers teachers and community leaders they made many important contributions to our nation including open-heart surgery the light bulb traffic lights and yes even modern video gaming consoles through their example and leadership they made America stronger and helped open the doors of opportunity a little wider and this fight continues today in 2016 we have much to celebrate our first african-american president President Obama is serving his second term in the White House and the Congressional Black Caucus is comprised of 46 members including 20 women these are signs of great progress however we know that much work remains full equality and justice for african-americans can only be achieved through the tireless work of dedicated advocates and leaders and grassroots organizers committed to social progress today we are confronted by many challenges disproportionately high rates of poverty and unemployment persist in the african-american community our voting rights are under attack and as we've seen our criminal justice system too often fails african-americans and these are just a few examples of the structural inequalities that threaten our work to ensure more perfect union and opportunity for all Congress must take action to enhance and enact policies that ensure all communities share in our nation's growth and future as we work toward this goal we need your help continue to raise your voice against injustice demand equality and fight back against those who want to turn the clock back and undermine our rights for his dr. king told us in his 1963 letter from a Birmingham jail injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere thank you and I hope you have an inspiring and transformative Black History Month

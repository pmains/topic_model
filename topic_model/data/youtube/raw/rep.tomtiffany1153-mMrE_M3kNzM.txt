tom tiffany jump in anytime congressman tiffany who is i are you up in superior are you near the brandon are you able to bask in the afterglow of this magnificent state of the union yeah actually up in superior today and uh you know doing lots of media up here and sharing the story uh much like you just are that uh there's an alternative to that speech and i don't think that speech really did much i mean when you look at the last half of the speech it was basically just a rehash of what he calls build back better they still have this dream that they're going to be able to pass build back better and of course that's not going to happen but they got to continue to rehash that for the base but you represent a part of wisconsin a lot of people maybe don't necessarily get to what does having electric vehicle charging stations do for northern wisconsin what does it do does it is everybody up there saying yay i can't wait to buy a tesla you don't see many tesla's up here you see a lot of f-150s but seriously for people that know superior they know that the twin ports up here it is one of the most important transportation hubs not just in the midwest but in north america you have rail that comes through here all the class one are a number of the class one railroad you have interstate you have air you have the port on lake superior you have pipelines it all comes together up here and here's president biden last night saying that i'm going to go up and talk about bringing these good paying jobs to um to america and i'm sure he's going to talk about that today here in superior well he did plenty to kill those jobs starting on january 20th of 2021 last year when his very first action was to shut down the keystone pipeline and that was just emblematic it wasn't just keystone pipeline he's he and his followers are trying to shut down pipelines trying to shut down drilling on federal lands uh sicking ferc the regulatory commission to stop any pipe they're slow rolling all pipeline projects at this point i mean they've made it very clear they're going to do anything they can to shut down shut down that industry and think about all the good paying jobs and by the way there are two of the biggest pipeline manufacturers in the united states are right in wisconsin joe biden put those guys out of work yeah right and i mean how is it going to play the guy who's got to drive the f-150 um and doesn't have the spare 80 grand laying around or 90 grand laying around for the electric model um how's it going how's it going to be for that guy he gets probably somewhere around 17 18 miles to the gallon when gas is four dollars and fifty cents you know and those are the kinds of vehicles necessary to actually do work in places that aren't madison or that aren't you know green bay um it was so tone deaf that you almost couldn't believe it blaming inflation on small businesses you know blaming all of this this stuff on on everything except his policy his inflation has been driven by the massive amount of money quote free money that of course is never free because we're all paying for it in inflation that was poured into the us and by he took a victory lap on that as well you know the american rescue plan worked no it didn't it's causing these exploding prices and we're only talking about the consumer price index i mean when you add everything raw steel raw aluminum all of the raw materials you're talking about inflation that can take what is estimated to be maybe three or more thousand dollars a year per family out of their pockets which would of course erase all of the good that trump's tax cuts did yeah no doubt about it people are paying twice some people are paying twice as much to heat their home this winter they're paying over a dollar a gallon more for their gasoline but let's talk about i always talk about this in in with three issues job security economic security and national security and you get the first two very well in terms of jobs economic security inflation is eating up people's paychecks but this really has a national security component also because we've seen crude oil go from fifty dollars a barrel to a hundred dollars a barrel who did that strengthen it strengthened vladimir putin and some other tyrants around the world who actually have oil to export how did vladimir putin put together the money to do what he's doing in the ukraine right now partly due to the additional money he's making at a hundred dollars a barrel versus fifty dollars a barrel this really has national security implications also and then when you tie into what happened in afghanistan the debacle of pulling out of there it is very clear to tyrants around the world and this is the most dangerous thing about the policies that he's implemented over the last year plus is that it is make the world a much less safe place and we're seeing that play out in real time in the ukraine and that's partly funded as a result that war is currently uh in part funded by the russian government as a result of actions taken by our president a little over a year indeed indeed and now can you know sending signals saying and we're going to make it worse we're going to make it worse because we're we have a net zero goal we will make it worse um at the same time blaming the fact that we have hundred dollar you know a barrel of oil or exploding natural gas prices on the companies themselves he's on unbended knee begging opec to release more supply and talking about a pittance what amounts to a pittance for the the amount of energy we use in the united states out of the strategic petroleum reserves i mean it is it was so tone-deaf it was it was clear that he assumed that the audience was stupid that's what it was what seemed to me is that he knew you weren't paying attention and thought he was going to be able to pull the wool over your eyes and and it be it began in earnest i think in the in the table pounding about ukraine which of course was just a way to try to get republicans to clap for him out of the gate as well not taking responsibility for not imposing sanctions that might have reigned in russia and he's talking about strong sanctions against russia please define them so he said early on we have to use all the tools at our disposal he took the biggest one out of the box january 20th 2021 energy independence in america having crude oil at fifty dollars a barrel or less that was the biggest tool the biggest hammer that we had in the box and he took it out a little over a year ago and that is the that was the very first signal to vladimir putin that he was going to get his way as well as other death spots around the world and remember when people talk about going to this whole green energy what i call the green fantasy they are you're getting wind turbines and solar panels from china made in china joe biden says i want to make stuff in america well you're not making it in america what you make in america is uh if you have the minerals that you mine here in the united states and make it into things that we can use in america but also you have your energy independence because we produce it right here we're basically trading with the trade is with china and china is winning on joe biden's watch when was the last time we saw a new mine cited in for rare earth minerals in the united states or even just you know metals that need smelting when was the last time that actually happened tom i know it hasn't happened in wisconsin i can't even remember we didn't even get something as simple as an iron mine which wasn't even uh worrisome environmentally but when was the last time we sought to try to break the the dependence that we have on china on russia on ukraine by the way so now think about some of the other gases um neon is a gas that we rely heavily on ukraine in other areas right next door to russia not to mention belarus which is helping russia when was the last time anybody talked about trying to find supply or tapping into existing supply here yeah so the biden administration just shut down the twin metals project up in northern minnesota uh one of the i believe that it was a co i think i believe it's a copper nickel project one of the biggest finds in north america the biden administration just shut it down and now they're saying hey we got to go to these electric vehicles how do you do that when you're not mining the minerals here in america from china or russia get it from china and that is what's weakening america and the despots around the world they understand this and i gotta tell you in terms of foreign policy one place that we should strengthen immediately is we should send additional armaments to taiwan president trump started doing it during his administration there that should go on overdrive at this point because if you don't think president xi is licking his chops watching what's going on in the ukraine in regards to taiwan they want taiwan back and under president joe biden what better time to do it with a weak america a lot of people who are watching this are saying we expect china to move on taiwan maybe by the end of next year and possibly sooner than that but they the the timeline looks looks pretty agreeable um because joe biden will be president and nothing will happen we aren't going to sanction i mean modest trade restrictions that the trump administration had put on china i mean we're talking modest and they actually started to behave a bit better he was also going to make sure that 5g international 5g was going to be controlled here in the united states and the byte administration is dropped the ball on that as well one last thing and that is something that that isn't about these sort of big uh geopolitical uh things that we were talking about tom and that is this using this nine-year-old little boy with type one diabetes to claim that we have to do something about insulin prices i wanted everybody to know that it was the on the first or second day joe biden was president he cancelled an executive order from donald trump that had that had ordered the forced the lowering of prices on insulin and epipens and joe biden canceled that and so now he's got some nine-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes so he can use him as a kitty human shield to claim the drug companies are responsible this is why talk radio and conservative media is so important because otherwise that lie would continue to be able to be spread unchecked there are so many misstatements that are made in venues like this by people like joe biden i mean he has a long history of it right vicky and it is so good that you guys are fact checking him on that because that's exactly right joe biden reversed what president trump did to control pharmaceutical prices and as you said he was bashing big business last night when it was convenient but then of course when it came to pfizer it was a love that exactly this state of the union brought to you by pfizer tom tiffany thanks so much for being on the program today oh it's good to be with you vicki

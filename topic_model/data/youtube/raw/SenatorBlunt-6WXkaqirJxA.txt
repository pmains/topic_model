um on on the point that senator moran raised what's going to happen at the department is going to be an increasing reluctance by this committee appropriate money and give the department flexibility you know we appropriate money for the provider fund we expect that money to go to the provider fund not to go to whatever other fund the department thinks it's better spent so in fact when we appropriated the second 75 billion to the provider fund we absolutely prohibited spending that money any other way or some language close to that and that's all because of the department's actions the the appropriating committee appropriates based on your request and responds to that request in ways we think is appropriate and you can't just decide to ignore that on the vaccine doctor catholic we and we specifically did not appropriate to warp speed we appropriated money to the partners nih and barda my my understanding is that at least 16 billion dollars has come through those agencies for the vaccine up until now hhs has told us that to have 300 million copies of vaccine available they need another 20 billion dollars that they don't have in any specifically appropriated line do you agree with that number sir based on the current situation yes sir that seems to be the number all right dr redfield the plans you expect to get back from the states by november 1 on distribution of the vaccine do you think you'll be ready shortly after that to announce your final distribution plan for vaccine senator it's going to be dependent on the advisory committee of immunization practices which will make the final recommendation for prioritization we will i think i'm asking another question maybe i didn't ask well prioritization i want to talk about that too but surely prioritization will not impact how you send this out to the states might impact the number they get but in terms of the protection of the vaccine the way it's distributed to be sure that you have a plan to get this in response to all these state plans as soon as possible is that your intention yes sir um obviously the the issue that i tried to mention earlier is that and i've said this in our earlier testimony some people maybe not it doesn't seem like they see that important it is important it's a second issue but it's really important and that's my next question where are we on the prioritization and that will be recommended to the states or will that be a prioritization we expect the states to comply with yeah it will be in a recommendation of the advisory committee for how this vaccine whichever ones are approved are recommended to be used and when will that be available that will be available after the committee gets to see the data on the particular vaccine so but to answer your first question because i think it was really important i want to get to it this plan for distribution is what we are now to get and what i was going to try to say is i said before this committee it's as important that we start that plan back in june totally agree as manufacturing and right now we've leveraged about 600 million dollars but we do not have the resources to support 64 jurisdictions to get this plan operational so to me it's an urgency you know that we get that and we've done this in the past we have experience and what it's going to take for us to do distribution and and monitoring safety and get these vaccines as i mentioned we distribute 80 million doses of vaccine here at cdc we have an idea but this is going to take substantial resources and like i suggested in june the time is now for us to be able to get those resources out to the state and we currently don't have those reasons the best i could tell there were no resources provided in the heroes act in the house in both the bill we voted on in the senate and the bigger bill we proposed in the senate we had roughly 6 billion dollars for distribution is that the right number or is that close to the right number uh senator my professional opinion uh i think you've got that really nails i was somewhere between five and a half and six million dollars is what i think it's going to take to distribute this vaccine and you don't have that money right now no sir and you need it to distribute the vaccine i think it's as urgent as getting these manufacturing facilities up yep i think i said in in july and you agreed that if you have the vaccine and don't have either the plan or the resources to distribute it that's a huge failure on the part of the congress to provide the resources that we know are going to be necessary i hope it's part of whatever package we put together this very month to be sure you have the capacity to do that

Thank You mr. speaker what do we think would happen in this country if we said we were only going to lock up a thousand people total for murder well probably after the thousandth person was arrested and locked up you'd have a whole lot more murders not less because people would think they could get away with it the caravans that are forming in Central and South America and coming toward our southern border aren't shrinking they're growing and that's why Democrats don't want us to be able to lock up all the people who commit the crime of unlawful entry into the country because they want to induce that illegal immigration well Mr Speaker we want to stop it and our negotiators are operating in good faith but now Democrats are adding new issues here's my challenge Speaker Pelosi if you've got a bill that can pass with Democratic votes to secure the border put it on the floor because we're tired of negotiating when the goal posts keep moving when the terms keep changing and when Democrats do not appear sincere about securing our border it's like we're negotiating against a ghost and we're tired of it and the American people are tired of it I yield back

turn to a member of the senate judiciary committee where those hearings will take place republican senator john kennedy of louisiana welcome back to fox news sunday senator nice to have you thanks brett nice to be here now let me let me get you react that we can now see i think pretty clearly the outlines of the case at least a big part of the case is going to be made by democrats against judge barrett which is that she will be an inevitable vote uh to strike down the affordable care act as it now exists um what's your reaction to that uh senator stavenal is my colleague and i consider debbie a friend so i i say this gently sell crazy somewhere else we're all stocked up here uh unless unless debbie's clairvoyant i don't think she knows how uh the the uh the nominee's gonna vote or any other member of the united states supreme court but but debbie makes the point the difference between democrats and republicans in terms of the role of the supreme court my democratic friends uh think that the supreme court ought to be a mini congress they're politicians without ropes they don't even need to hear cases they already know how they're going to vote and that's part of the problem that that's not how i view the appropriate role of the supreme court um and i don't think that's how it operates uh you're going to see a lot of evidence free accusations sure senator let me just uh ask you this about about the very process and the fact of the nomination you of course were were around when um when the nomination was made of merrick garland and the senate simply refused to take it up in any way um and the case was made by mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader that the american people this closest in an election year which that was back when the president obama nominated uh judge garland should have a say in the in a supreme court nomination made that close to an election now it seems uh that the roles are reversed uh a president has made a nomination it is an election year indeed it is very close to the election and the eu and other republicans are prepared to move forward with this and which is distinct obviously from the course you took just four years or so ago um that you're being accused of hypocrisy and double standards how do you answer well let me finish my last point first to my to debbie and my colleagues in the in the in the senate i hope they let us have a respectful process we don't need another freak show i mean i i hope they won't get into the foothills of kinky and bring back michael avenatti and all that other stuff let us focus on the nominee now to answer your question i'm rather fond of the constitution i have read it it's provisions about filling a supreme court vacancy are unaffected by the electoral calendar i realized that on both sides britt there's been a lot of circumlocution and attempted church hilly and rhetoric about the president to be followed during an election year feel a vacancy here's as best as i can tell here's the rule when the democrats are in charge of the process they do what they think is right consistent with the collet with the constitution when the the republicans are in charge of the process they do what they think is right and i think that's what our founders intended i think our founders intended elections to have consequences and when they send people to washington of a particular party they expect them to represent their voters and i think that's uh been the tradition and the president i it appears from a constitutional point of view that you're spot on with that um the constitution certainly doesn't say anything as you point out about the about the electoral process in terms of the appointment and confirmation of supreme court justices but would you not acknowledge that what we have here is a serious case on both sides on this issue of shoe on the other foot disease sure absolutely and that's why i say if you in washington as you know better than i do brit you have to watch what people do not what they say and if you watch what has happened in in the history of ever i don't think there's ever been another instance where when the democrats were in charge they didn't do what they wanted and when the republicans were in charge they didn't do what they wanted consistent with the constitution right now we have a republican president we have a republican senate uh if if that were were she were on the other foot then i can assure you senator schumer would would do what the republicans are doing right now um as i said the other day if you don't believe that you know you you probably peaked in high school so you're hoping as i'm sure others are as well that we'll have something other than what you call the freak show in this um but there's some thrill history here the kavanaugh nomination being only the most recent example uh previously we had late unexpected allegations made of sexual misconduct against now justice clarence thomas is it your sense that the senate's appetite for allowing this kind of thing to go on is diminished because otherwise if something like this comes along i'm not sure what you can do about it what do you what can you do well it it if my democratic friends want to uh you know want to want to turn it into a an intergalactic freak show and you know bring back the protesters with the genitalia shaped head gear i can't stop them i just hope they want i'm going to do my job i think she's a a good nominee but my job is to advise and consent i'm going to probe her intellect her temperament her judicial philosophy her character i want to be sure that she doesn't think justices are politicians in robes i wanna i'm gonna answer that in a second i want to be assured that she's not one of these justices that tries to rewrite the constitution every other thursday to advance a political agenda that the voters won't accept um i don't think her faith i mean if the democrats best argument is she believes in god uh therefore she's unqualified i don't think that's illegal in america i hope not uh we have religious freedom and it should be jealously guarded uh they tried that when she came up for a court of appeal nomination um it it uh it didn't work out too well they may try it again as i say votes over with they may bring back michael avenatti but i hope so because it cheapens the process i hope not rather

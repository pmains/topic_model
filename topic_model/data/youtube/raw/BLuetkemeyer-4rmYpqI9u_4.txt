hi this Congress Luke tomorrow in addition of lame bus thanks for joining us this week this week I'd like to make just a few comments with regards to what's been going on in the Middle East I think if you look at the policy that led to where we're at today you can see that the policy of appeasement by president is not working it's the pilots it's the policy of a bunch of bumbling fools to think that everybody else in the world is going to be hunky-dory hold hands with their whatever with everybody else if we sit there and do the same thing the rest of the world's a very dangerous place if we've learned nothing over the last 80 to 100 years people don't like each other around the world they don't like us at all and if we're out here I'm apologize we're inviting more aggression and that's what we saw this past two-three weeks here with our ambassador and three other folks being taken out in Libya this can't happen this is an abomination from the standpoint that we as Americans cannot stand there and let our citizens be shot killed dragged through the streets murdered this is this is this is unconscionable and this president goes to the to the UN this week and gives another apology speech you want a real statesman look at what minute programs to prime minister netanyahu gave the kind of speech he gave United Nations he laid it out he should tell people what should be done he put everybody in their place and he laid out a strategy to try and solve this problem and where's our president probably in Vegas raising woman this does not work this is not how we should be leading the world Ronald Reagan showed peace through strength this president is trying to get our military by not even allowing the sequestration cuts that are coming to be mitigated by the bill that we passed in the house a couple weeks ago it's time to stop the nonsense it's time to put this guy to pasture hopefully everybody in November here will see the light but this is an abomination of the way our fire policies being administered it's going to stop see you next week

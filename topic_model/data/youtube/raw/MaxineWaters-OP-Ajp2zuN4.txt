thank you very much madam chairwoman um I'm pleased I was able to get here even though a little bit late because I wanted to certainly meet mr. Feinberg and to tell him it gives me a level of comfort that you are now in a position to help well to construct and implement this claims process appreciate the work that you did after 911 with New York and I'm looking forward to your creating the kind of protocols that will get us into a claim system that's fair and will compensate those who have been harmed in the right way I have a few questions I'd like to ask you and some of these questions may be a little bit premature given that you're still working on these protocols the first thing I'd like to ask is about the 20 billion dollars that amount was negotiated kind of by the administration and I'm wondering if this includes a cap on liability that somehow those persons who participate in getting compensated out of this 20 billion I can if they accept a settlement they cannot sue is that correct that is correct if they accept congresswoman the lump sum payment that I offer them however any claimant who's eligible and can prove the claim will receive up to six months emergency payment without any obligation of any type to release or promise not to sue so it's only if a claimant comes to me and says voluntarily mr. Feinberg I've already got my six months payment and thank you but I want to now a lump sum payment for the remaining present future damage only if they like that amount do they waive their right to sue BP dead was there a cap on liability in the 911 claims process no nor is there a cap on liability in this process um but and the New York process if you accept it uh whatever amount and you discovered that there was a lingering health problem for example did you have the ability to sue no now in the 911 fund which i administered if you settled with the 911 fun with full disclosure that it was a waiver of any future claim you had to waive that claim and if you didn't want to don't come into the fund you can sue as an individual I'm sorry you can sue as an individual you could sue as an individual if you didn't want to take the back right that same is this that's right okay very good now um I am focused on New Orleans because they had something called a road home program it was a mess and I'm a little bit upset that there was money left over that we eventually reclaimed in this recent conference committee that we just did and there are people who are left who still did not get their money or the right amount of money ah and they still have not rehabbed those homes what have you so I certainly want to see this claims process work a lot better than New Orleans now in in this process here's what I think you're going to find I have gotten to know the black oyster fishermen for example the african-american oyster fishermen with mr. Brian accolade a wonderful man who knows the history for generations of fishermen down there in the area and when they first went into the pre claims process prior to the administration are getting involved in agreeing on this 20 billion dollar amount the initial attempt by BP to get them to way rights if they accept it a small amount was disturbing and I certainly did not want that to be the kind of thinking that would lead us into this overall claims right so you got a handle on that what I'm worried about is this we have we're going to have fishermen without receipts we're going to have fishermen without our IRS filings we're going to have fishermen who maybe are not that literate they fished all of their lives they earn 11 for their families and the villages that they live in but they're not the kind of structured business people that you could say I want your audited receipts in order to prove that you are eligible for this claim what alternatives do you have to help these people get some compensation justly so without all of that kind of documentation what can you substitute for the kind of documentation that I just alluded to mr. Jones you're a fisherman come in and have your ship captain tell me what he paid you I don't need documentation having a ship captain come have your priest come in and verify I need some corroboration some proof I don't need a extensive business records I've gotta poo you've got to demonstrate that you have a valid claim but I'll you will be I will bend over backwards to try and find Ellie will you define this in your protocols yes how you have an alternative system of proof that verification by legitimate folks whatever whatever whatever you'll you'll spell that out absolutely okay that's that that's very good I do not need IRS returns and extensive business documentation I do not need it all right is it dry here well I thought I heard somebody really did um let me ask you this I'm learning a unanimous consent for one minute thank you I'm learning a lot about the oyster beds and I can't I haven't forgot out here because I haven't had a chance to talk with mr. alkylate about it so that he could really explain it to me about these austere beds i was reading last night that the oysters are dying because the fresh water is getting into him and killing them i couldn't determine whether or not these austere bears are natural or they're designed they belong to one entity or they belong to everybody have you gotten into that yet no okay no you've anticipated as you usually do Congress when you be anticipated another question or issue I haven't thought of and I will look into it okay that's real important because it seems to me that if everybody's got access to certain oyster beds you got to figure out you know what what they've got coming to them now having said all of that will you print some kind of pamphlet or brochure that's instructive that people can at least use to say oh this is how the process works we'll have all of that will have it at 35 claims officers will have it online will have it in different languages we will have frequently asked questions here's how you go about filling out the form will help you fill out the form will do all of that less and I've just wrap this up there are a number of organizations that are trying to help people down there the nonprofit's etc but as you know they survive on donations etc have you got a little advocacy money in this 20 billion dollars that you can help pay some of these uh not so big organizations as helping them we'll look into that I must say congressman most of those organizations have not asked for it they're working pro bono they're glad to help regardless of funding from the 20 billion but I will look into that look into it because they come to us later and say we've been doing all this work and we can't get any money for it so if we get on top of it in front of what we might be able to work with it thank you thank you so much for being here

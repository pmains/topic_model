back here on state of the union i'm joined by republican senator dick lugar of indiana and democratic senator mark warner of virginia uh brought you both together because you both are known for working across the aisle in a time when there hasn't been much of that i want to play you something that president obama said on friday so my message to congress is now is not the time to play politics how is not the time to sit on your hands the american people expect their leaders to work hard no matter what year it is the president repeatedly chastises congress on the campaign trail for not working and not doing anything about jobs etcetera but i hear from republicans publicly some democrats privately that the president has not used the power of his office to push some of these ideas that he's out there talking about has there been too much politics on the white house end of this as well senator warner well i didn't get the memo that we were actually supposed to take presidential election years off uh you know if you look around the rest of the world i i think the president has laid out an agenda uh i think well i think he has pushed forth i think there has been particularly in the house a a an almost knee-jerk reaction that anything the president could be for uh they've got to be against but even if you step back and say where can we find common ground i mean the senate worked together we passed a two-year highway bill that would put people to work give a little predictability we recently passed a bill bipartisan senator lugar i the overwhelming majority of the senate to try to speed up approval process for the fda get our whole biopharmaceutical uh sector of our economy jump started so there are things we can do even in an election to get this economy going here's what i'm getting at senator lucas as you hear the democrats privately republicans publicly complaining that they don't hear from the president that this he has not used his bully pulpit to say to congress listen here folks i need you know pick up the phone i need you guys to really work on this have you seen more or less presidential influence um in the obama administration than previous administrations well in this particular year the president is campaigning for reelection that is his total preoccupation he's been criticized for that by some democrats who would say as a matter of fact you ought to be talking about how jobs are going to be created how in fact you have a more comprehensive view of the deficit of the debt of all of these sorts of things this has not been something on the president's agendas but broadly now i would agree with mark that essentially members of congress still have tried to pick up in modest ways we're working on a farm bill for example where we've got a majority and we're hoping to get that to the floor uh this is not a cold whole thing but i would just say simply there have been congressional initiatives quite apart from the president um let me ask you and i want to i don't mean to bring up a source subject here but richard murdoch who defeated you in the republican primary uh was on fox news recently and talked about the idea of bipartisanship and here's what he said i have a mindset that says a bipartisanship ought to consist of democrats coming to the republican point of view now we are hearing uh that you know this election is gonna solve things that there'll be a clear picture after this election of which way the country wants to go the republican way or the democratic way does that sound like to you do you believe that the election is going to decide something are we fundamentally a divided country that can't seem to get congress to work well respectfully i think what mr murdoch said is wacky i think it's kind of the anticipation of anything you know i don't know kind of what constitution he wants to defend i mean the brilliance of the founding fathers were they set up a slightly dysfunctional government to start with checks and balances into house independent senate independent president you have to work together to find that common ground that's what dick lugar has been about that's what been a whole lot of senators in both parties have been about and the notion that this election is going to be so overwhelming for one side or the other that there's going to be a clear picture and one party is going to be able to you know rule the roost i just don't see that happening and with the rest of the world moving ahead we've got to find that common ground on particularly i believe on that debt and deficit issue nothing would do more to jumpstart our economy than to put that kind of bipartisan balance plan tax reform entitlement reform in place to get this economy going i want to ask you about the fiscal cliff after we come back but next up it is about the crisis in syria is the meter tipping away from military support we consider all contingencies at all time we have been focused on the need to bring about a political transition there's still the potential for there to be a peaceful political resolution

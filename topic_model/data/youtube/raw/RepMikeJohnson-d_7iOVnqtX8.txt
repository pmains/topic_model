uh Madam speaker I want to thank my friends for joining us on the floor tonight at this late hour it's been a long day on Capitol Hill but there are things that need to be said here it's December again and of course that means that we're in the home stretch of a new Congress this Congress the 117th and the home stretch of any Congress as we know is when the threat of bad legislating is at its most pronounced we've certainly seen all that here this week government Appropriations have been taken hostage by democrats who want to spend even more they seem to have forgotten about the trillions of dollars that have already spent been spent earlier this year the ndaa has been taking hostage just today by democrats who think the right to vote is under some sort of secret threat I guess they didn't pay any attention to the massive voter turnout in Georgia just yesterday here tonight they rushed through a rule to codify same-sex marriage and create a private right of action that will vilify and supercharge attacks on people of faith Madam speaker this lame duck session is doing serious and Lasting harm to our Republic and I guess it is a fitting end to this what really has been a disastrous Congress overall under the Democrat rule we've had trillions upon trillions in government spending sending inflation for All American families soaring we've had votes on immensely consequential complex thousand plus page bills handed to us just hours before those votes we've had members dial into Congressional hearings from their bedrooms and basements and even while on vacation in Europe proxy voting thankfully this is all about to come to an end mercifully in less than a month the American people have spoken and the American people have given Republicans control of this body to provide accountability and produce results Madam speaker this is a legislative body and it's high time for this body to get back to the work that we are supposed to be doing for the American people and come January that's exactly what we intend to do I thank my colleagues for joining us here today to talk about all of it and I want to yield first the gentleman from the great state of Tennessee Mr Rose

Thank You mr. chairman Table Rock Lake near Branson Missouri is one of the premier destinations in the Ozark especially for my constituents in the seventh congressional district the Army Corps of Engineers is currently undertaking a revision of the lake shoreline management plan and has in place a moratorium on dock permits to halt development around the lake what this means is that if you purchased a home Weir land in this area with the hopes of putting in your dock you can no longer do so if you already have a dock and it needs to be updated you can't even update it I have met with the Corps and the lake community throughout this process and the overwhelming consensus for my constituents is that their voices are not being heard on this issue and that will have far-reaching effects for those living on the lake and for its economy my amendment would extend the public comment period to ensure that those directly impacted by the plan will have they say in it my amendment also lifts the moratorium on dock permits it extends the time frame of the final plan to ensure that the Corps has enough time to incorporate the community's concerns into its updated plan I'm proud to work with Senator blunt and chairman Shuster on this common-sense issue and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment Thank You mr. chairman and I reserve the gentleman reserves

Oh more Democrats approve of the policy but we'll see what happens we've made an enormous concession to North Korea by having them meet with the President of the United States in a in a summit of this kind whether we get commensurate concessions from North Korea we'll have to see the freezing of their material of their program their testing is not a freezing of their program they're making fissile material now they're doing the engineering on their missiles now they are doing the engineering on weaponizing that fissile material right now and so we'll see whether we get the kind of intrusive inspections that will at least freeze their program yeah but certainly we're all hopeful about the talks in Singapore and there was considerably less reason for over six months ago congressman Sherman undeniably the previous 25 years or so of diplomacy and sanctions had not gotten us to where we are now what do you think is working with President Trump well I think the sanctions policy of the last administration was then amplified by President Trump but we're still you know you had Ted Yoho on just a second ago he and I just sent a letter to the secretary of the Treasury questioning why they have not sanctioned major Chinese banks and they should certainly do so they've been willing to sanction tiny financial institutions but not major Chinese banks for their involvement with North Korea now I don't expect anything to actually happen before June 12th but it's got to be clear to the Chinese that their major banks will be sanctioned they continue to business with North Korea we're in the middle of a worldwide watch negotiation congressman and part of that was getting home three Americans how does heartening is it to hear members of your own party kind of toss grass at that I mean Senator Chuck Schumer of New York made it sound like they were just political pawns we got three Americans home and by the way if that's the only thing that gets accomplished that's a whole lot better than where we were as you said six months ago your thoughts well getting those three Americans back is important but we cannot make concessions in peril hundreds of thousands and millions of Americans by letting up on the sanctions and calling it victory just because we get a photo-op in Singapore and a photo op with the three Americans the president said he's gonna walk away if it's not a real deal freezing the testing though I'm having military experts tell me that that is a very good first step well if you're not freezing the fissile material production then they're moving toward a 21st bomb in a twenty second bomb they had done the testing they went through peer they've gone through many periods where they go many months without testing they test then they have to do the engineering then they do the test again now if this test ban is four years that is an accomplishment but a test ban for a few months may be fully consistent with full speed ahead missile and nuclear development not to go to sideways on this but I'd be remiss if I didn't connect these two dots because what the president does with North Korea and what the president just did with Iran are connected on a global scope people see it last question to you and it's about Iran the the deal that we just pulled out of right now are Democrats like yourself willing to walk up to the table and say let's work on getting a better deal if that's the road that we can go down in the next 90 days well I'd certainly like to get a better deal frankly I was the first member of Congress to be on the floor urging Congress to reject the deal that being said I think the way Trump is going about this alienating Europe is is not the right thing to be doing at this time Europe was willing to sanction Iran additionally for their missile program and sanction Iran until Iran agreed to more intrusive inspections we should have pocketed those advantages and then resumed our concern in a few months instead we have a circumstance where we're on a collision course with Europe and we'll have to see what President Obama was able to do is get Europe to join us in cutting off a ramp now those were successful broken sanctions no no no Europe cut off a ramp and then we cut the deal now some people say we had such good sanctions under Obama we should have gotten a better deal I was one of them but those were really good sanctions because we had persuaded as well as pressured Europe to be helpful we do not have good sanctions against Iran now and it'll be difficult to see because of whether we can recreate them because without European participation you can't sanction Iran effect we'll see if they continue side dealing with Iran for it to stay in the deal I I mean they have a choice there's European countries congressman Sherman I want to bring you back Democrat from California great to talk to you today thank you good to be with you

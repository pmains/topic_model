hi I'm senator mark hi I'm senator mark Dryden robocalls I'm Senator Mark Warner as the tech guy who founded the wireless company Nextel I'm a big fan of cell phones but what I'm not a fan of are those annoying robo calls we all seem to be getting these days yes even US senators last year Americans received an estimated twenty six billion robo calls and if you're sick of them as I am I've got some good news the president just signed legislation sponsored called the trace back the bipartisan bill would require service providers to stop these calls before they reach your phone it would also give regulators new tools to crack down on the spammers behind illegal robocalls and impose stricter penalties against the worst robocall offenders this is something that both Republicans and Democrats agree is annoying as anything and I'm glad we're able to work together to get the Tres Act signed into law hey I got to call you back

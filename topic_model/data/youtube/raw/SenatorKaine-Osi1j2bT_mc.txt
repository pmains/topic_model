at the end of this administration as a strong friend and supporter this president and as a strong friend of everybody around this table I think we've made a complete hash of thee and that's a diplomatic phrase of the doctrines of war both domestic and international we are in we are engaged in an incursion into the sovereign nation of Syria without their permission against their will we're trying to criticize Russia for engaging into an incursion into another nation against their will and we're asserting as the difference that we're doing something good and they're doing something bad I agree that we're doing something good I agree that they're doing something bad but that's not a limiting principle because everybody's going to say what they're doing is good and so at the end of this administration with the complicity of this Congress I think we've basically come up with a war doctrine that says wherever and whenever as long as the president feels that it's a good idea without Congress even needing to do anything about it the problem is if that is the rule and I think that's become the rule that's a rule that I think will haunt us domestically under future presidents and congresses that I could see and I also think it's a rule that can easily be seized by any other nation to basically justify all kinds of things that are horrible and so I you know we're only six months before the end of the administration an administration that promised three years ago March of 2013 that they would try to work with Congress to revise the 2001 authorization that is currently being used as a justification for actions not only in Iraq and Syria but Yemen and Africa and these Arabian Peninsula there has been virtually no work done to put any limiting principle and that certainly not in any kind of a negotiation with Congress that I'm aware of and so we're going to basically be in a position where we've turned a 60 word authorization from 2001 with a lot of administrative gloss that wasn't even in the authorization into an all-purpose wherever whenever domestic justification and then we've taken common international principles of law and basically we've that if our motives are ok we can incur into the sovereignty of another nation because we're doing the right thing but then that takes away our ability to effectively criticize other nations that get into the sovereignty of other nations as Russia's doing in the Ukraine so mr. chair this is not a subject that we're going to resolve today but I just as we reach these new milestones of escalation I'm just going to keep putting on the record a deep concern about the precedent that we're setting for this nation but also the example that we're setting for other nations

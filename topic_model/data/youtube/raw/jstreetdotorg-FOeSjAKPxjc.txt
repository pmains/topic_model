so I want to start this way Israel's looms large in this election we know that but there's also very different ways of interpreting what's the greatest threat to Israel on the one hand we know that the Prime Minister Prime Minister Netanyahu has said and I believe bill you have also strongly agreed with this that the greatest existential threat to Israel now is posed by Iran and the possibility that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon and certainly the statements that the Iranian leaders have made in their past behaviors make this threat a very real one on the other hand there are also many people including now the Deputy Prime Minister of Israel Mufasa who've said that the greatest threat to Israel is not an outside threat it's really the threat posed by the lack of a two-state solution they that the problems of occupation and the fact that there hasn't been a way of dividing the land between Israelis and Palestinians ultimately is the greatest threat so I'd like to ask each of you why is why isn't the other threat most important bill why isn't the lack of a two-state solution more important than Iran and Jeremy why isn't Iran more important than then a need for a two-state solution and you could toss a coin as to who's going to first alright so first of all let me just say thank you as well to the clergy and to the congregation of B'nai Jeshurun and to both Bill Kristol and Jayne Eisner for this evening this is a congregation it's very dear to me since the first date that my wife and I had was coming to Shabbat services here so in addition to the connection through collegiate and the monnet Jeshurun is really a night to come home so I appreciate that I think one of the fallacies of the debate and in really underlying the question is the notion that there's one threat that has to be dealt with either or in fact the threats that face every country are multiple and multifaceted and for the Jewish people and for the State of Israel the threats are not just a you know either-or between Iran and the lack of a two-state solution there are long-term threats across the region the threat that I think we probably would agree on is is the United threat of moderation versus extremism in the region that extremism within Israel extremism in its neighbors versus the the moderate more democratic movements that's that's a fundamental rift in the region that I think is may define really the overarching threat so I don't know that the the frame of the question having to choose one threat is really the right one and my argument would be that israel needs to be in every country needs to be capable of dealing with multiple threats at once and iran is a potential threat the development of nuclear weapons by Iran is a threat not only to Israel but to the world in terms of nuclear non-proliferation but I would say that the existential threat of a lack of a two-state solution that's certainly what motivates me it's what motivates J Street it's what causes us to get up and fight in the morning because without a two-state solution over the coming generation we do know that Israel will have to choose between being a Jewish home and a democracy and that's a choice that Israel shouldn't have to make so bill how would you respond well let me also join Jana Jeremy and thank you for having us here and saying how great it is to be back at bji our daughter I was last year five years ago for our daughters off roof with Elliot silver and his parents a year John and early and they assured me before this that I thought an offer would be an impressive connection with a shul but it's not as good as first date I mean I so I think I'm really at a disadvantage here you know i mean the the anyway i won't we can we can get beyond the the dates issue and the fisher you know and then orally and john assured me that the most of you of course would be sort of on my side of this debate i didn't they didn't assure me of that and i wouldn't have believed it since i grew up on the Upper West Side of New York and I I think I know I know what the general views of people out here but it's great to be here it's fun it's it's always good to have this kind of discussion no I don't think it's a close call I think a nuclear-armed Iran is the threat to Israel that way transcends various domestic difficulties political difficulties that Israel has or the difficult question of how to divide up the lands or give up most or all of the lands that were won in the war in 1967 that's for 45 years history all has had its current borders or really actually gave back some land and withdrew from Gaza obviously in 2005 so slightly slightly smaller Isis occupies control is less land than it did a few years ago I don't know that that's really I supported that but I don't know that it's much increased chances for for peace or for solution in the region but that is a problem the people should work on solving but it is not an existential threat to the State of Israel it's not the case in my opinion that if the current borders exist not for forty five years but for 65 years or 85 years the digital will cease to be a Jewish or a democratic state that shows a real lack of confidence I think and the people of Israel and their ability to keep the state both Jewish and democratic the two great threats are a nuclear Iran and the D legitimization of Israel of which there is a concerted effort obviously worldwide and which needs to be resisted almost as much as the as a nuclear-armed Iran dedicated to the destruction of Israel but but bill what do you say about the demographic argument that even if the people of Israel now and Isis I assume you're talking mostly about the 80 percent or so who are Jews can do their absolute best to maintain a democratic society you have growth in both the indigenous population but also in the occupied lands that could warp the number of Jews living in this larger space it's not net worth no serious projection shows that Israel would become less than a majority Jewish really for forever for the foreseeable future they are but the Arab birthrate is actually declining as which is what usually happens when when people get wealthier giving up Gaza obviously removed an awful lot of of non-jews from the terror the total territory currently controlled by Israel so it's I don't believe that's the case and I think and looking for where the K I'm not for keeping office all the occupied territories if that's the term we're using tonight for convenience I'm not gonna quibble about it but I'm not for keeping you know the government of Israel will have to decide what it can safely withdraw from and whether it can find a negotiating partner to whom to hand over the areas from which it withdraws consistent with its security with the general security of the population there but it's not going to be the case that the issue the State of Israel is going to become that might already Jewish so Jeremy how do you respond well I didn't know we were gonna disagree on opinions I didn't know we were gonna disagree on facts the the population between the Jordan and the Mediterranean today is about 12 million people and half of them are Jewish and half of them are not I mean that's simply the fact of the number of people who live on the West Bank in Israel pre 67 in Gaza so those are the the numbers according to the Hebrew University demography Department which in fact found that in 2010 of the people in that area Jews actually only made up forty nine point eight percent of the people and so the question really becomes relatively quickly not in 85 years now in 65 years but within this decade will everybody who lives in that geographic area have equal rights or will a minority and continue to have the sole political power over a majority that isn't Jewish and and that's not a very pretty picture and it's not type of democracy that I think you're in favor of as somebody who favors the you're counting Gaza and that I am Kennedy and you think that's now part of Israel somehow it is under Israeli control yes and you think the Israelis have not tried as hard as they can to give Gaza back to its residents well when they allow the free import and export of goods and they don't include weapons including people in and out students who would like to simply go and study abroad who are not allowed out as long as the borders are fully controlled by the State of Israel then yes the area the geographic area is under Israeli control don't you don't see it that way no and I don't see it it's a huge problem do you seriously you're sitting here and telling me the ten years from now if the current borders exist if the current political arrangement of exist the current such a situation of a Arabs in Israel of course having full citizenship Arabs in the West Bank having limited right political rights but obviously if quite a lot of freedoms Arabs and Gaza unfortunately having very little in the way of rights but they're governed by Hamas you're telling me that Israel will not be a Jewish and democratic state ten years from now if there are two hundred thousand four hundred thousand higher if there's a higher growth rate among the Arab population and the Jewish population when people who had a different skin color than you and I had limited rights in certain parts of this country was that a full democracy is that what your idea of a democracy is no and I am NOT for an Israel that includes Gaza and I don't think anyone in Israel is atotal it's a total red herring I'm not for an Israel that includes most of the West Bank and ORS the Israeli government nor is the Likud Party nor is Ariel Sharon and so what's the issue there I'd be thrilled most Israelis would be thrilled it's not my call but I think ninety percent of Israelis would be thrilled to be able to get out of the huge bulk of the populated areas of the West Bank I'm still sort of a little stunned though at the notion that the people who live on the West Bank who are under Israeli control that you would consider that to be a democracy to have limited political rights based on the racial background of the people I didn't say anything about the racial background of the people they're not all up on race why have you put race into college do you believe they're a separate race Palestinian oh you think that's a race it's a nation it's theirs well it is a national identity and that's why I would be happy if there could be a two-state solution with a peaceful Palestine next to a peaceful Israel and I believe that Israeli governments of both parties have tried extremely hard for that solution and I do not believe it is likely to happen in the very near future not because of Israel but because of unfortunately of the sentiments of too many people living in those territories and if and outside agitators who unfortunately fund some of the worst elements in those territories obviously so as we head down the road over the course of the next five 10 15 years and there are in fact more non-jews than Jews in the Land Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean and the political power belongs to only the Jews that doesn't disturb you I think it's an unfortunate situation absolutely but what's the solution to it the solution I supported Sharon getting out of Gaza the solution you think they get out even more they just throw the borders open and let people come they do let an awful lot of people come in and out and I think it's not quite fair to the Israeli government what you're saying and you're pulling Gaza that's what you were more yes an awful lot of people are allowed in and out of Gaza some people are allowed in and out of Gaza some people right there's a view you want to take the position that they should just open the borders and hey any time come on across no problem is that your position no my position is that there should be a two-state solution in the be an independent state that controls its own borders and the State of Israel should be in independence that's fine well the the state of Palestine is going to be a democratic state that will get to choose its own and how are you ensuring that it's a democratic state that's what they want the the that is what they want and that's what Hamas wants which in our rules Gaza and the people I think most people would like it but they have the power to make that happen over Hamas over Islamic Jihad over the Iranian backed and others and saudi-backed groups that operate in that and territories well the Palestinian Authority did hold elections at the request of the Bush administration over the objections of the State of Israel and it did in fact result in the Hamas party being voted in in an election that's what democracy looks like that's not what democracy looks like that's what the end of democracy looks like the end the end of democracy is when people that you don't like win and election is that what Hamas is just a group I happen not to like no Hamas is a terrorist organization that has fought for the destruction of the State of Israel that is true as well but they ran in an election and won an election and that is what democracy looks like so the way that the United States and Israel should be pursuing the empowerment of the moderate forces is by helping them to achieve a two-state solution by actually having something to show what what was wrong with the unilateral withdrawal was the lack of any results that Mahmoud Abbas or Abu Mazen was able to actually show for achieving any sort of independence from Israel because it was a unilateral withdrawal there was no benefit accrued to the moderates the way that that Fatah and Abu Mazen are going to defeat Hamas and the more extremist elements of Palestinian society is if they can actually deliver on a course of diplomacy and negotiation they had been building a state on the West Bank for the last several years under the leadership of Abu Mazen and Salam Fayyad economic growth is up their security there is policing there is all of the basic institutions of statehood that are being built and when that process is done which it practically is they deserve to have the independence that they have worked to achieve if they can't deliver that the Palestinian people will reject those who have been forcing negotiations and moderation over the last 20 years and trying to achieve a result look I totally agree with your account of helping Fayed I think the Bush administration and the Obama administration in a very pretty consistent way have tried very hard to do that I think in fact the biggest setbacks have been when they have gone from intelligence step-by-step attempt to help people who want to make a decent society and a successful and peaceful society and non terror society on the west bank there has been great step by step progress it's the biggest setbacks have become perhaps when expectations were raised that they could somehow magically be a solution in the next few months or even in the next few years but anyway I agree that that's a you know that's a complicated problem for us policy makers to deal with and I think governments of both parties here in the u.s. have tried to help the Palestinians get to a point where they can be entrusted responsibly with a state that will not be a terrorist dominated state that will not be a state that will cause war on the West Bank and they've reached that point I hope they've reached that point they certainly haven't reached that point in Gaza I think I think we're well beyond that part of the national body has made the judgment that they are fully ready for statehood the issue is that every day every week every month more and more settlers are moving across the Green Line and eating up more and more of the land that is eventually supposed to be part of that state and today there are well over 550,000 people who live over the Green Line and Palestinians are doubting whether or not there is still a chance to have a viable state of their own in the land across the Green Line and if that isn't stopped then it's all well and good to say we want them to have a state we want to have a two-state solution but if at the same time that you're negotiating over the size and this they're the slices of pizza that you're trying to negotiate over but you're eating the whole pizza there's nothing left to negotiate over I mean again I think the idea that Israel is flooding the West Bank with settlers especially in the last 10 years that they're eating the whole piece that they are alone responsible for in moderation and terrorism and extremism and lack of commitments now it's a democracy that is pretty much what you said to the west bet on the West Bank five hundred fifty thousand that includes every so everyone who's over any part of the sixty-seven line in Jerusalem 5-2 there's fifty thousand so they are so if I said five hundred fifty thousand people are living the settlers are living across the green line they are living on territory that was not you think and you think they shouldn't be allowed to live there no I think that there should be a negotiation about what the wait what's your position on that is it allowed to live there went not illegally but no but there is no legal base so you would uproot the 550,000 people all the people in Jerusalem well wait what is the well what are you complaining about them what I am saying is that without a border the entire I would like to have a border too but what kind of answer is that I mean what do you practically want to do well the answer is you either come up with a border or you give everybody equal rights those are the two choices you can't have two classes of citizens disagree the current situation is better than a unilateral withdrawal from the entire poky 1967 back to the into the pre 67 borders or giving everyone in equal rights including the people in Gaza I would just say that you can say that it's under those are the only two choices they're not the only two choices the third choice is basically the status quo which is not an intolerable status quo as you just said on the West Bank people on the West Bank are in their economic conditions are improving they have have you been there recently that a year ago do you I'm not pretending I'm here as an American I'm not here as a participant in Israel I'm not Israeli I'm not sure what I would come down on a lot of these complicated choices they have to make I don't like sitting here in America and cavalierly talking about five hundred fifty thousand settlers who were just I don't know what flooding into the West Bank would know right and that is if the entire Israeli government has no hasn't thought seriously about this as if Israelis more than us wouldn't wish to have a successful separation from the Palestinians who wish for separation obviously there are a lot of Arabs within Israel itself and presumably people wouldn't be prohibited from moving and buying land in those areas etc but so I'm not willing to sit here and second-guess the actions of every Israeli government but I would say for an American point of view we are supporting the Israeli government in what is a good-faith effort to try to balance very difficult things to balance which is to move towards a two-state solution while preventing a Hamas type terrorist dominated war causing State on the West Bank or in Gaza for that matter so let's just pick up on that for a moment so does that does that mean that you agree with the current way that the Obama administration is handling the situation and if you don't what should they be doing yeah I've been mostly supportive of the Obama administration in the last couple of years after they gave up their foolish attempts to cause huge efforts it's because a huge diplomatic crisis because one apartment building is going up in a part of North Jerusalem that was in any way in any case going to be part of Israel under any conceivable set of borders that would have been agreed to I think the Obama administration has moved to the center and really is now behaving not very differently from the Clinton and Bush administration's in much of its Israel policy they also have toughened up a lot after a terrible failure to support the Green Revolution in 2009 that toughened up on Iran and the president has said which I agree with that you cannot contain or deter a nuclear Iran was the greatest threat to Israel he I believe has said that so I guess he would come down on my side of this the question you asked at the beginning so I'm happy to sit here and agree with President Obama to a considerable degree at least as the policy has moved in the last two or three years with respect to to Israel in the Middle East can I just ask whether or not the emergency campaign for Israel is therefore going to commit to not run attack ads against President Obama for his policies towards Israel that was a devastating repose no as the last I looked it's a free country and we're allowed to criticize President Obama when we don't agree with President Obama and I'm allowed to praise him as I just did when I tend to agree with him I think on Iran he has moved a lot from where he was in 2009 do you think he's exactly where he was that I do he laid out a very clear path he said you have to try diplomacy and if diplomacy doesn't work you have to go do you agree with the failure to support the Green Revolution in 2009 I don't think it was a failure to support I think that if the United States had weighed in in the middle of that that it would have in fact backfired in many of the Iranian democracy forces said the last thing they needed was a vote of support from the President of the United States so I think that it was completely correct and the president has actually made some very very good calls case by case and country by country as to the right way to proceed so yes what do you think the Obama administration should do to bring about what you think is the right policy in Israel and Palestinian well I think that it is very very hard to imagine I just came back last night actually today morning from from Israel and I spent some time on the West Bank you know looking at the settlement construction I spent time in Hebron I spent time in Ramallah and I think is very hard to conceive of these two sides on their own sitting down and working out their differences in it in a negotiation process in which they have voluntarily agreed to come to the table I think that the missing ingredient in achieving a two-state solution right now is the presence of a very very active and engaged third party I'd like to see the United States play that role because I think the United States has the best interests of the State of Israel at heart I think that the international community should be more engaged but I think the most important thing the president should do is put down on the table the parameters of the two-state solution that if you do indeed support it bill I imagine that we we would agree that it's going to be based on the 1967 lines with swaps that it's going to have a capital for both peoples in Jerusalem with the Arab sections of the city as the capital of the state of Palestine and the Jewish sections in the State of Israel that there won't be a right of return for Refugees that the state of Palestine will be demilitarized I think I've just summarized the basic parameters in under 60 seconds and this is what President Clinton laid out it is what was the vision of President Bush in the Annapolis process it was where Olmert and Abbas nearly got to but what we need is a president and an international community that's going to put that question in front of these two leaders you may not think the Palestinians are serious others may not think that the Israeli leadership is serious it is time for us as an international community to call the bluff of both sides and say if you're really serious about bringing an end to this conflict if you really are serious about ending the generations of bloodshed and war we all know what it takes we all know what a two-state solution looks like so put those parameters on the table and ask mr. Netanyahu and ask mr. Abbas are you ready to come to the table based on these parameters and that's the kind of active diplomatic leadership I would like to see the President of the United States take so what can I say right I don't think the US should be in the business of quote calling the bluff of the Prime Minister of Israel I don't think the I don't think the United States should be in the business of assuming that the blame for the failure of peace or the failure of a peace treaty though there's a de facto reasonably peaceful situation actually right now that the failure of a peace treaty is equally responsibility of obstinacy or failure to compromise on the part of Israel and the Palestinians to say nothing of other Arab neighbors who help push the Palestinians in unfortunate directions so I don't agree that we should you know the we we need to come in and make those childish Israelis and those childish Palestinians who apparently could never get to an agreement themselves that we're going to have wonderfully come in with not just us but the international community which is so wonderfully fair and even-handed when it comes to its understanding of Israel I'm not willing to pressure Israel in that way the US should take the position that we think is best obviously for the region and that will include obviously a lot of diplomacy as there have been Clinton and Bush and Obama administration's attempts to work with the Israeli government but I am not willing to to impose some sort of even-handed solution or try to impose and even had a solution on Israel the Palestinians and I didn't use the word impose and I also didn't say only call the bluff of the Israelis for those of my friends on my right who believe that President Abbas is not serious about pursuing a two-state solution I say call why do you want to call this glove because it isn't it then you find out that there will that be a better situation six months later well we might feel better that we've called their bluff but it will be better to have talks that break down and collapse an acrimony than the current situation the credibility and the national strategic interest of the United States is at stake this is what's the credibility in the national strategic issue the United States helped or hurt by the collapse of Oslo in 2000 and the subsequent Intifada the the credibility of the United States has been deeply damaged by its inability to bring about a resolution this conflict you have wears has been damaged all across the world oh really the internet world is sitting there saying you Americans you're supposed to magically absolutely this is something I don't know what world you live in it I don't know what world leaders of state of the United States Hillary Clinton has said in numerous speeches that when she was first lady 13 14 years ago and she would travel the world the issue of Israel and Palestine just didn't come up today when she travels the world a Secretary of State this is often the first issue that world leaders all across the world raise why is the United States not doing more to end this conflict when it has the leverage and the capability to do more than it's doing in order to end this conflict it is undermining American credibility when it goes to the United States and it vetoes a resolution in the Security Council condemning the settlement enterprise that uses the language of United States policy over eight administrations it undermines your credibility and your legitimacy as the world's sole superpower and it is now a fundamental national security interest of the United States to end this you know it's a fundamental master see it's a much more fundamental national security interest in Iran from getting nuclear weapons I would say but it would be very good if this conflict were quote ended I don't think it will ever be or unfortunately the foreseeable future be fully ended it will be the situation could be improved it could be more radically improved perhaps than I realized and if that happens that will be great but that will only be with a willing participation obviously of the people in government of Israel and the people of and and their governments in the territories and I think for now actually the Obama administration is sensible in trying to pursue step-by-step efforts in not allowing the UN to suddenly throw the question of Palestinian statehood on the table and forced in a sense of confrontation between the parties and encouraged I would say a less good outcome again I just come back to it is just not true incidentally I mean I think I'm yeah it is probably more true 15 years ago at the height of Oslo and they were great hopes and when people really thought and maybe not without reason that the Clinton administration can make this happen then international discussions were sense they are it is really I dear that in the worldly living now with China and Russia and the Arab Spring and Iran that the Secretary of State goes to any I would almost say literally almost any serious country in the world including it's not only the Arab countries and other Muslim countries and the first thing they have to talk about is Israel and the Palestinians it's just a myth I'd like to turn this conversation now towards the election we've talked a lot so far about the issue of Israel but there's a real question about how important that issue is to the average Jewish voter certainly we see a lot of polls that say in fact it ranks pretty low that people are Americans and they're worried about the economy and they're worried about health care and they're worried about Iran so what is your assessment about how important the administration's policies towards Israel are when it comes to making a decision about who to vote for for president in November well as you say Americans are Americans Jewish Americans are Americans Christian Americans are Americans they're utterly entitled I've never told people what to you know what what basis they should vote or how they should rank different issues I would utterly respect that if people choose to reg Israel as one of eyes eyes I do actually when I vote as one of several issues and Israel is only one of several foreign policy issues we're fighting war in Afghanistan we've fought a war in Iraq we have Iran getting nuclear on a path to nuclear weapons they're perfectly reasonable for people including Jews not to make not to be single-issue voters on Israel I yeah sorry that is fine I think many Christian Americans in some way you said well Jews and Americans Christians are Americans many Christians care an awful lot about Israel they're entitled to vote on that on that issue if they wish as well I don't think it practically speaking in this election campaign I don't think it's going to be that big an issue I think the issue of whether we're doing as much as we can to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons may or may not be an issue depending on what happens over the next five or six months but again I think President Obama has moved sufficiently on these issues from the Cairo speech of 2009 to the AIPAC speech of two months ago that the difference between the parties is simply more less than it was I don't think foreign policy doesn't look like it's going to be the major issue in this president for race I hope citizens take seriously our foreign policy responsibilities around the world and vote and obviously some will vote one way and some what about the other way depending on their views of how we should conduct our foreign policy but so I hope to remember that foreign policy is an extremely important responsibility of the president of the United States but yes I think most American Jews will not quote on the basis of Israel on this election I agree that Jeremy what do you think right well I mean the facts in this case are on bills side the surveys that we've done and that other organizations have done have shown that really only 7 to 10 percent of American Jews do and mention Israel is one of the top two or three issues when they consider who to vote for but it does raise the question as to as to why people do then run such vitriolic campaigns based on this issue you know what is the the purpose if it really doesn't move votes the types of campaigns that are that are run by organizations like the Emergency Committee for Israel that really do tend to scare policymakers they they run ads and attack campaigns that box people in as anti-israel for taking a policy position when it comes to these issues and I think that the way in which Israel's turned into a political football is not good for the State of Israel it's not good for Israel is not good for the Jewish people it's not good for our relationship with Israel and I would love to see it removed in a sense from the kinds of vitriolic and over-the-top attacks that have tended to happen in the last couple of election cycles you know there are some theories that on the reasons particularly in the Republican primary that there was some so much talk about Israel and Iran was actually not to court the Jewish vote but to court the Christian evangelical vote bill you're in the inside on that what do you think I think most of the Republican candidates I knew strongly believed that we should strongly support Israel and strongly believe that we cannot permit if the president has said Iran this regime in Iran to get nuclear weapons I don't think there's any great miss and people were saying what they believed Ron Paul who was the one major outlier this also said what he believed and I think the good news is he didn't do well and got less than 10 percent of the vote which is good for the Republican Party I mean the big story in the Republican Party over the last thirty years I'm personally very happy about this as a Republican is the eclipsing of well first the eclipsing of I'd say the Bush Scowcroft baked or traditional it's unfair to say hostility in Israel but lack of closeness and warmth for Israel I think it's fair to say and I say this is someone who served in the first Bush White House and has a high regard for for the first President Bush but it was not it was an Arabist old-fashioned Republican Party which was skeptical which was certainly tried to very concerned with our relations with Arab states that were not friendly to Israel and skeptical of perhaps of the case for Israel that's that they have really been eclipsed I think by the rate that's called the Reagan George W Bush McCain kind of tradition of a more sympathetic attitude towards Israel and greater support for Israel and then the other thing that for 20 years now has been a worry up from any of us on the Republican conservative side was the rise of a sort of Pat people not the rise up but the return of a kind of Pat Buchanan and then Ron Paul type of hostility to Israel and the good news is that that doesn't have much support in the Republican Party in Congress it didn't have much support among the presidential field it doesn't have much support among the up-and-coming young Republican as the Marco Rubio's and Paul Ryan's and chris Christie's and the people who probably will be the future leaders of the party so if you're asking me if yes the Republican Party I think it's pretty uniform actually pretty United in being strongly pro-israel and that's a good thing and and is this a I'm a I'm curious that the the direction that the Republican Party has taken where the denial of the existence of a Palestinian people and the embrace of a one state solution and the notion that there's really no that need for a Palestinian state that seemed to mark all of the presidential candidates from Newt Gingrich to Rick Perry to Rick Santorum I mean is that a good move as well I mean oh we are we excited that that's where the Republican Party is headed towards a one state you know anti Palestinian party is that really the views of Governor Romney do you think without the views of the Bush administration the views of all of the other candidates who denied the existence of the Palestinian people and one person who wrote an op-ed in The Washington Times just this past week saying in fact that the two states I will put on for Israel I will put up the Republican members of Congress against the Democratic members of Congress any day in terms of their support for all there were few outliers on the Republican Party but I am proud at this moment prouder than I was 20 or 30 years ago to be in a party that is strongly supportive of Israel not all of them are expert on the details of of the have as north should they be ignored the Democrats obviously of us Israel policy they can occasionally Newt Gingrich tried to make us could a clever historical point an echo Golda Meir and saying they would never was a Palestinian people it was a silly thing to say it was not it was not embraced it was wrong yes I mean it's a complicated historical question of whether there was a Palestinian people prior to 1948 and that's a legitimate issue but it doesn't matter now Palestinians now have national self-consciousness and I would be very very happy if they were a Palestinian state yes and Mitt Romney did not embrace what Newt Gingrich said and last I looked Mitt Romney pretty easily won the nomination and we are going to have a very mainstream Republican foreign policy and there'll be bipartisanship he'll make Joe Lieberman you'll make I don't know if you were laughing at the idea of the bipartisanship of the Romney administration or or gasping and horror that there might be around the administration I think there's likely to be one I think Joe Lieberman could well be Secretary of State I think it's quite you heard it here first I'm Lee Berman his foreign minister in Israel so you heard it here first I'm just I'm just making a prediction but if that doesn't make you all you know with that's not good if that's not a good thing for your for your point of view that's fine too anyway I think we will have a mainstream Republican foreign policy you know set of positions articulated by the Romney campaign and I think it'll be probable position Jeremy is that how you see Mitt Romney's foreign policy towards Israel well I will say there was a big distinction between Mitt Romney I would agree with you on that there was a distinction between Mitt Romney and the other members of the presidential field and I was encouraged when Mitt Romney refused to pander on the issue of the embassy being moved to Jerusalem and when asked if he would move where I guess they were all asked in one of the debates and they were sort of competing over who was going to buy the truck and drive it in order to actually move the embassy Mitt Romney took a much more considerate approach and said he really would consult with the government of Israeli consult with diplomats who consult with others in the region I thought that was a good sign that he was not willing to pander immediately but the entire rest of the Democrats have never talked at all of his running you know any promise have never talked about moving the embassy to direction it is and it is wrong when it's done by Democrats and it's wrong when it's done by Republicans and so I would hope that a Romney administration would in fact be the kind of mainstream bipartisan foreign policy that that I believe we did see towards the end of this Bush administration when Condoleezza Rice was trying to actively participate in the diplomatic resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict and that was actively pursued by George Bush's father I don't quite agree with your characterization of him and the policies that he pursued but that has been a bipartisan approach and it actually is moderate it's in the sense American farm policy to recognize that this is an America's interest and to play an active role in resolving it so that would be my hope but but didn't he say he thought the Obama administration through Israel under the bus he did and I think that was the extent I mean really he has not gone into any of the lengths that the other candidates went and that seemed to be a sort of pro forma line but I don't hear within what he has said so far necessarily going down the road of not playing an active role in trying to help the the conflict to be resolved and not pursuing a fundamental American interest so I'd like to ask each of you a specific question related to your work Jeremy I'm going to start with you and some of the criticism that you hear about J Street is that actually the Obama administration and some Democrats have moved away from J Street for I read that for example there was a quite a high level person from the about Obama administration coming to your first conference not so the most recent one that the AIPAC speech that the president delivered a couple of months ago was very much more in line with what AIPAC believed and how and and that you Willie J Street hasn't made a dent in in a PACs popularity in the White House or in Congress I think half the members of Congress attended that speech when it was delivered at the AIPAC conference how do you respond to that well I you know I don't try to put what we're doing into the context of a US versus a PAC in an institutional way what I think we're trying to do is to create enough political space for a sensible American foreign policy to be pursued and I think we've got a very very tough road ahead of us I think we've made some headway I think there is greater political space I think the fact that this conversation for instance is taking place in a synagogue with six or seven hundred here is symptomatic of a far more open discussion about what it means to be pro-israel today in the United States I think that is washing into the political system I think you see far more members of Congress speaking out today for the notion that American leadership to achieve a two-state solution is a pro-israel position that's simply standing with Israel right or wrong and backing every piece of legislation that comes along that that is a you know military that ensures Israel's military superiority that's fine but it's not enough in order to really be pros ramai see progress on that front but it clearly we have a long way to go and redefining what it means to be pro-israel is a gargantuan task and I think we're doing a really good job after only four years Bella are they doing a good job yeah no I think Jerry's done an excellent job of building J Street it seems to be very formal it has regional offices and lots of people working for it and puts on big conferences and as they ever hear every right to do they they circulate letters which they get some members of Congress to sign and then we criticize those members of Congress for citing those letters for signing on which is I believe legitimate in a public political debate and that's what political debate is about it's hard for me to judge honestly how much things have changed for years I think we've had a little bit of a back-and-forth President Obama was certainly you know I think it's fair to say less I seemed to be claps closer to where J Street is than other Democrats running for the presidency in 2007 2008 and I think the Cairo speech was I you know the kind of speech that I don't speak for Jeremy here but I mean I think that people who on that side of the spectrum was sort of happy to see an American president give I do think he's moved back to the center and I think an awful lot of Democrats in Congress if just looked I honestly think at the situation on the ground it just decided you know they may personally be not entirely comfortable with Israel settlement policy they might wish that Bibi Netanyahu were slightly different Prime Minister or even that someone else were Prime Minister of Israel but given the fundamental issues facing the u.s. in that region right now that the notion that pressuring Israel to be more reasonable with respect to the Palestinians compared to the questions of how to deal with the Arab Spring how to deal with the threats of radical Islam in parts of the the Middle East and around the world how to deal with a nuclear Iran above all that that just isn't as central perhaps as as Jeremy would like it to be to their thinking but I'm not you know I think it's impressive the organization he's built up and I hope they continue to have very I hope the organization continues to flourish and to have no effect on actual US policy okay a question for you bill we mentioned before Jeremy mentioned ECI Emergency Committee for Israel something that you have created and you are one of the board members it has been accused of really using smear tactics against President Obama and other Jews just want to read one couple sentences from a recent New Yorker piece said and while the truth is generally an early casualty in the political heat of an election year ECI stands out in its disregard for it of the five principles quoted in an EC CI ad in The New York Times for have objected to how their words were used and if I recollect among those four were a procs man from ADL David Harris from AJC and Alan Dershowitz who I think most of us would agree is not characterized as a flaming liberal so is this appropriate do you how do you justify these kind of tactics and it is this the way the conversation ought to happen look I mean we'd have to go into the detail this is really not if I might say I'm not gonna complain about questions but I mean you read a hostile article extras from a hostile article in The New Yorker people didn't we correctly and accurately quoted the people you mentioned discussing they didn't like being used they didn't like us amplifying a point they had made because they felt the administration had sort of backed off and others have backed off in the for three or four weeks I guess since they said those day miss but those statements were they were accurately quoted and that ad and I'm happy to stand behind that ad absolutely but they don't think they were accurately that's not true that's not true they didn't like being quoted not a single one has challenged actor the quotes are absolutely accurate they're shaken you know from the public record but many of them said they were taken out of context I mean I talked to Dershowitz myself about this I don't believe it's true you can go look up the quotes and see if it was that gotcha he just didn't like the fact that he may perhaps wanted to get along better with his Democratic friends and didn't like being used his quotes being used by yeah anyway you know what I mean J Street gets criticized a lot he said I gets criticized a lot that's fine that's fine people will judge whether our general position on I mean it's a small organization we've intervened tried to do a little bit of good I hope we had think we have done some good and actually energizing the pro-israel community and in not making it seem and this was a great achievement of Jeremy early in the days early days of J Street and making a scene that all the momentum was on one side that the entire Jewish community and other parts of the American political community more broadly we're all moving in the direction of the J Street point of view I don't think it seems that way now I don't think it is that way now and I hope you see eyes played a little bit of a part in pushing back against J Street Jeremy do you see those equivalencies well I think there's a couple things I would say one is I think the nature of the types of ads that ECI ran in 2010 and I'm anticipating that you'll run again in 2012 have unfortunately turned criticism of policy into a question of whether someone is anti-israel and I think that that's been a real important line in the Jewish communal conversation whether legitimate debate over policy somehow crosses into being diligent ization of the State of Israel or being anti-israel and I think frankly that that ECI has pushed the line too far and that while there may be disagreements obviously between where UCI and and your point of view and J Street and where I would come out neither of us is anti-israel and no one who we back is anti-israel and the implication that people who support aid to the Palestinians or who feel that the blockade on Gaza was a little too tight which in fact the Israeli government then loosened a bit in line with what the people that you attacked called for you know I think that you've pushed the debate too far you have the impact of silencing people on a policy question and I think that that is an area that we should talk about whether or not it's responsible and whether or not it's good for the State of Israel and frankly good for the Jewish in just a few moments I'm gonna begin to take your questions so if you have questions written on those cards please just hold them up and wave them and someone will come and collect I just say well please I don't you know we'd have to have the documents here and really go through the relative merits and truthfulness of J Street and ECI publications and and advertisements and the like I am proud of what ECI has done we have acquired the J Street agenda and still say that they were in the mainstream of the pro-israel community I would you have a letter signed by 54 members of Congress when you have votes in which 20 or 30 members of Congress vote against the huge rest of Congress they are totally entitled to make cast that vote it might even be a profile encouraged to do so but we're entitled to say as a matter of fact this person took a position that is not in the majority it's not the majority position of the Democratic Party and that a lot of piece serious people think would be a position that would damage the security of the State of Israel we are allowed to make that argument and that's what we've done you know I would argue that the the did did the difference is whether or not you argue over the merits of the policy or you begin to name-call and and you use the type of you know attack ad theatrics with the ominous music and the dark photographs and all of that to imply that somehow a member of Congress who courageously stands up and says that perhaps denying corriander to the Palestinian people is not a national security interest of the United States that that person is somehow out for the destruction of the State of Israel I think it just goes too far and what it does is it does Quelch a serious and and real debate about what is the best policy of the United States and and I think that one of the reasons that you only get 50 60 70 80 members of Congress who are standing up and signing these types of letters is because another 200 are scared to do it and and the atmosphere of fear has been created is not good for Israel it's not good for a serious American policy policymaking process and I don't think it's serving us as a Jewish community I mean only here honestly could one get away with saying and happy applauded for saying cavalierly that well all those those hundreds of congressmen on the other side I suppose Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand they're there someone is you just said that just living in fear they don't honestly believe that perhaps trashing the Israeli government for enforcing the blockade of Gaza was a bit irresponsible given what was going on on the ground at the time what had got on the ground in Gaza just before and that it was better to step back and let this work out as it has worked out a little bit better over time but that you think that they couldn't honestly have that view but they're simply just intimidated certainly not by you see I we don't have the ability to intimidate anyone but by who who's intimidating them well I actually wouldn't do that cuz is it possible that constituents actually just agree with that well I mean I I very seriously and and absolutely do believe that a significant percentage of American members of the House of Representatives in the Senate are intimidated on this issue that is a and it is not good well I can't speak I spend a lot of I spent more time I don't believe that's fair to either Republicans or Democrats I spent a lot of time with Republican members and I think that's simply not the case of the Republicans I'm they believe what they believe you may think they're short-sighted you may think that their beliefs ur simple-minded but I'm just here to tell you that really I can I'm trying to think of all the Republican senators and House members I know very few of almost none of them none of them I'm now gonna say I'd like to know a single one whose doesn't the whole is saying pro-israel things because he's intimidated rather than that he happens to believe and he also happens to think his constituents believe that the case for Israel the moral and political case for the u.s. standing side by side with Israel is a very strong case those are two radically separate statements I would say that there is near you've won the war we have won the war ninety nine percent of the members of the Senate in the house believe deeply in the us-israel relationship that has been established on a bipartisan basis and there may be you know you've got a handful of members of your party like Ron Paul who don't agree with it maybe there's a handful of members on the Democratic side who don't believe it but that's the far outliers 99% of the people on both sides of the aisle strongly support the us-israel relationship but when it comes to a sensible nuanced rational discussion of what is actually in the United States best interest in Israel's best interest many members of Congress in the Senate do keep quiet because they are worried about what the ramifications will be of speaking out and that's simply a fact and it is a very cheery man isn't it kind of bad debating technique to say many members are intimidated and not give an example well the problem is that they won't speak out publicly I have had numerous conversations behind closed doors and I know many people in this congregation here today who I know about your conversations you have had those conversations as well and people feel that they cannot stand up and talk about Israel and talk about the israeli-palestinian conflict talk about the need for a two-state solution in a fair and balanced and reasonable manner because they're worried about the attacks that they will receive and that isn't good for the making of American foreign policy who's going to attack them I mean your emergency Committee for Israel will be at the top of right because why I mean I'm thrilled that we're so powerful we have the New York Times and the major networks and NPR and all on one side J Street which is you know considerably larger to say the least and the Emergency Committee for all they're all on one side and little old emergency couldif Israel is just just pump that's intimidating I suppose these Democratic members from saying the truth right what I mean and last I checked are these guys in highly competitive races incidentally these are folks that could you mention like an actual I mean I do think it's a little bit much I mean who is who is someone you're proud are you do you have very well disposed to these people who were so cowardly that they won't say what they believe no I I actually am well disposed to the people who did speak out who you attack that's the people I'm well disposed to okay because they showed courage standing up for what they believe how about we switch to a different topic and a little bit I'm gonna ask you each to ask a question to each other but I do want to include the audience questions there are several here asking for your opinions about the new unity government in Israel what do you think well I mean it's a little too early to make a judgement over exactly what that government's going to stand for right now all we know is that in a midnight deal that served the political interests of both shall mph as the leader of the Opposition and Bibi Netanyahu the Prime Minister they reached an agreement to build a unity government they've made commitments to do certain important things reforming Israel's governance system dealing with the issue of draft conscription for the ultra-orthodox passing a budget and dealing with the peace process that's what they've committed to do so the question is going to be after six to nine months will they have actually achieved significant results in which case it'll be one of the more significant government's that's ever govern or at the end of six to nine months will look back and say this was just another midnight political deal that helped to save one or two people's political career for another six or nine months it's way too early to judge what do you think bill I have no that's the sensible answer it's too early to judge I'm no expert on the long ago tried to even gave up even trying to understand the what's going on Israeli domestic politics and so I have no I don't differ with Jeremy at all I mean I do think it is if one thinks this real faces great threats which i think is clearly does from a nuclear Iran or possibly nuclear Iran and I think on the whole one would be happier to have a more broad-based government with distinguished leaders of different parties in the cabinet having said that I don't think it means necessarily that any particular thing is going to happen in the next six to nine months and I think the I think Jeremy's right and suddenly that the again I'm not Israeli and I'm not in a position to really make a detailed granular judgment on exactly what their policy should be in all these different areas but I they strike the basic manifesto strikes me as being pretty sensible and I hope they can succeed and in implementing so we haven't talked tonight at all about settlements or very little and a question came from the audience would you support a moratorium on West Bank settlement why or why not I think my answer yes let's I'm not in the position of normally of taking positions on the internal Israeli matters I think there is I my sense is that recent Israeli government's about a sensible made sensible efforts to stop provocative settlements in areas that would be beyond the likely boundaries if and when there is a two-state solution I am not in favor necessarily but again it's not my call honestly and this is a compliment that's on Yahoo had a ten month settlement freeze then they that didn't do any good so then he decided to allow natural growth in the settlements and people to move into the quote settlements which I guess suppose enclosed includes huge neighborhoods of Jerusalem there aren't settlements really in any real sense so I think it's up to the Israeli government and you know I think that the single greatest threat to Israel's long-term future of being both Jewish and democratic will be the extension of the settlement enterprise to the point that you can't separate the Palestinian and Israeli territories any longer and that and that's the real threat that the settlements pose it isn't you know about a particular neighborhood of East Jerusalem it is about the for instance in East Jerusalem the government supporting an American billionaire buying a house in the middle of an Arab neighborhood and then moving in ten families and putting in a hundred security guards in the middle of that Arab neighborhood so that it becomes impossible to draw a line dividing East and West Jerusalem anymore that's the death of the two-state solution and so it's not the neighborhoods of Ramat Eshkol and gielo and the and the other areas that would stay with the state of israel it's the development in East Jerusalem in areas that are clearly going to be the Arab capital of Palestine and areas on the West Bank like some of the settlements that are being built on Palestinian owned land that the Supreme Court of Israel is saying have to stop and the government of Israel isn't and that is the end of the rule of law in a democratic state so that's though those are the threats it is if it's not about apartment buildings in gielo which I don't oppose but I think it is about the rule of law and it's about the ability to still draw a border so you can reach a two-state solution and you assume that no Jews could live in anything across the green line then after there's a two-state solution no I think that the the so the problem for the rule of law I'm not I don't feel I can sit here and say that there's no more rule of law on the State of Israel my sense is that in the 190 nations in the world Israel will be extremely high in the ratings of those who will take seriously the rule of law by by the rule of law have a Supreme Court that has done a lot of very tip is made there's overruled US government to Israeli government actions and made them do things they didn't want to do but I so I respect the rule of law right in that's really what I'm not capable to just you know say in any particular instance exactly what whether decision is right or not but well what happens when this when the Supreme Court of Israel says that an action by the government of Israel is illegal and then the government doesn't stop doing well if if it were as simple as that I suppose we would all simply say and nod and agree and say it would be very bad for government should have a courts I think we agree on that I think the Israeli people agree on that I think Israeli political leaders agree on that of course sometimes it is not quite as simple as you've just said it but I believe the rule of law is quite strong in Israel are a lot stronger than in any other nation in that region an awful lot stronger than in an awful lot of nations and comparable to the will of law anywhere really so one of the things I vowed to myself as I stood on the West Bank last week and I thought about tonight is that I wanted to invite you to come with me because in all seriousness it actually it actually is that simple it isn't you know it is that simple the Supreme Court of Israel has said that the settlement of me and the neighborhood apana are illegally dead this is what we as American Jews have to do there's a controversy in Israel and the Supreme Court has come down one way and they're having difficulty perhaps I'm stupid I don't know much about it enforcing a decision on a very tiny little thing and this is the top priority for American Jews to go over there personally and to berate the State of Israel I'm not berating I'm simply saying this is a challenging moment this the fundamental nature of American democracy and the separation of powers was defined when the executive branch agreed to carry out the rulings of the United States Supreme Court that is a fundamental tenet of democracy and for 64 years the State of Israel has abided by that as well and we are at a critical moment the very foundations of the State of Israel that I care so deeply about that you care so deeply about and that we cite as one of the reasons for our close relationship is it's democratic nature that is at risk and we should care as friends of Israel we should care that the fundamentals of democracy under battle system Isis so I'm not going to I can go but I can go you know let's let's go together I don't really would I prefer to go with other friends frankly and and I do not like I will say this I am slightly offended that people are offended people can do whatever they want they can applaud for whatever they want I personally would not sit here in the comfort of the upper west side of the United States of New York and the Upper West Side of America hear someone say the fundamentals of democracy in Israel or at risk and set which is exactly what you said and have yes we can really feel good we are wonderful everything here is just so wonderful and we would never given the difficult conditions therein we would never make some of the tough anyway please I don't agree I don't agree it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine I don't agree that the fundamentals of democracy in Israel are a risk that is a deep disagreement between us Jeremy believes that that is why his organization spends an awful lot of time working on and publicizing the kinds of issues he's just talked about I do not believe the fundamentals of democracy in Israel at risk I'm not sure I'm capable of judging all these extremely complicated political and legal issues within the State of Israel and I believe that as Americans what we can do is of course encourage Israel to do what we think of the right is the right thing domestically but above all stand by Israel against existential threats and terror threats but Jane I mean this really is this this is what has been wrong with pro-israel advocacy in this country for over a generation now that the only thing you're allowed to do is to stand by Israel right or wrong and that's not a relationship that the American Jewish community is going to tolerate anyone you know we this is Israel Israel is a nation of its own citizens and its own citizens have to vote and make the decisions about what it's going to do but every Israeli prime minister has said as well that Israel is the state of all the Jewish people and it does represent us and we do have a stake in what goes on there and we are asked to participate we are asked to lobby we are asked to give money we are asked to send our kids and we have the right to speak out and to say the way in which that country behaves is deeply reflective of the character of the Jewish people and the principles and the values on which we were raised and if the rule of law and if democratic principles are going to be put at risk which they are bill and you should go and look into these details because you can't say I'm not interested in the details I'm just going to stand by Israel that's not going to fly with the new generation in particular of young Americans you I have please I have I have I have greater confidence in the new generation of American Biju's than you do I think they will be happy to stand by Israel as their forebears have I'm not embarrassed by sixty years of American Jewish get the advocacy on behalf of Israel on the part of the American Jewish community out of non Jewish Americans incidentally I don't think that's something to be ashamed of I don't think we've had twenty years in which somehow the whole advocates Jewish advocacy effort has gone off the rails so I fully expect the younger generations of American Jews will stand by Israel as older generations have and I fully expect the younger generations of Israelis will argue among themselves and work out democratic solutions to the very difficult challenges they face but the way to work out those they are very difficult challenges and there are real trade-offs between security and well there were many many trade-offs and it's a very difficult and complicated situation so that's bill what question do you have for Jeremy you know I don't really have any question for Jeremy I think he's a very very been very articulate and explaining his point of view and I I don't I didn't come here to play gotcha or to throw some J Street letter or something he said once that he probably regrets you said at him so I've just I'll pass Jeremy do you have a question for Bill should I be as Gallants as he just was No you know what I but I want to go back to some a the very beginning of the debate or discussion which is that you said the status quo is just fine and and you basically said there is this third choice and and I just want to understand what Israel looks like in the coming 5 or 10 years in your eyes and and how we continue to defend it the way that you are doing is sort of unblemished and the only democracy and better than 190 other countries if we're if we're going down a road in which more than half of the people that live in this geographic area do not have rights that are equal to the rights of the Jewish people in that geographic area so there isn't a full democracy how do we justify that to ourselves and to our people after all the years of oppression after all of the countries in which we didn't have rights in which we were an oppressed minority how do we justify that I think we justify it the way we've justified the last 45 years I mean I don't think the last 45 years of Israeli history have been a humiliation to Israel or an embarrassment to the Jewish people I would love it if they could get out of further if they could separate much further from parts of the West Bank I wish the separation from Gaza well that it will work better and I think it in any case at least it is separated so I'm hopeful and I'm all for her engaging with the Israelis and with Abu Mazen and Fayed in peace processes were possible I don't believe we can snap our fingers though and make it happen immediately and unfortunately I think in the current circumstance if anything I think going slow a great incremental process as the Bush administration to Clayton well Knox North's Clinton but post Oslo the Bush administration and the Obama administration have tried to embark on is a reasonable way to go but over five to ten years fine and Abu Mazen aren't going to be there anymore and they're going to be replaced and what's going to follow them is a one-person one-vote movement that's going to gain momentum all across the globe and you may call it D legitimization of the State of Israel but it's going to be a movement that will be probably the movement around the world for democratic rights for the rights of an oppressed people and and can we stand by and let that happen to a country that we care so deeply about I don't believe that's going to be the main movement around the world I do I believe we've had major movements in Arab countries in the last three or four years which I'm hopeful about which had almost nothing to do with the State of Israel or Israel's treatment of the Palestinians and I say I hope there is a two-state solution but simply saying it would be nice that there is a two-state solution does not mean that we right now have the conditions on the ground for a responsible and safe and peaceful two-state solution here's a question from here's a question from the audience should the Palestinians recognize Israel's right to exist and when 1988 they did so I think that one you can the the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in 1988 the PA accepted it in 1994 so that that's one of the mistaken assumptions in the American Jewish community is that somehow the Palestinians haven't accepted Israel's right to exist they did 25 years ago do you agree with that bill let's pour this way I think on the ground and the actual schools that are being run by the PA the textbooks that are being used etc to say nothing of Hamas there is not an equivocal acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state there's not an unequivocal acceptance of the existence of a Jewish state in the Middle East and that remains the fundamental reason why there has not been peace full peace for 64 years of the existence of the State of Israel so the Arab Peace Initiative that is sitting on the table offering full acceptance of the State of Israel into the entirety of the region by 23 Arab countries that's been sitting there for 10 years waiting for an Israeli response what more is needed from either the Palestinians or the Arabs in order to say we recognize the right of Israel to exist in return for achieving an end to this conflict in it and the achievement of a two-state solution is that a question or your recommendation I suppose to the Israeli government so far as one we recommend two things destroy its take yes for an answer and you think that that is you think those 23 Arab states are just fine with the existence the State of Israel and that the guarantees that are the lack of security guarantees in that document there's no problem there at all well I think that you make peace with your enemies not your friends and we're looking at a way to end a conflict then there were 64 years has festered and and led to four or five Wars and I think there is a deep interest on the part of the Arab world in putting an end to this conflict and they have put forward and offer and it is an offer it isn't a final peace treaty what it needs is a counteroffer that's how negotiations work and the offer is sitting there and the Arab League is just waiting for Israel to respond and the Israeli civil societies come up with an Israeli Peace Initiative but it's time for the American government to make use of the Arab Peace Initiative and the Israeli government to make use of it as a platform to be fully accepted into the region I mean it lasts I look the Prime Minister Israel was happy to sit down with the head of the Palestinian Authority and have negotiate on the ground about the actual issues that confront them maybe that's not enough maybe they simply have to accept this dicta from 23 Arab nations who have who's I think good faith in some cases can be called into question and use that as the basis of negotiations why can't the Israelis and Palestinians simply negotiate well I think that the goal is actually to get regional peace with the entirety of the Arab world so it's a very good offer it is not a dict on it's an offer and every Arab leader who has endorsed it continues to say it is in effect and they'd like to sit down and begin to talk about it we have a number of questions about Hamas and I'm wondering if each of you can just respond in this way what should what should the American policy towards Hamas be and how would you like to see that implemented I mean different policy would matter what happened he make policy recommendation with respect to her boss it would be greater from us could be weakened and and more responsible elements in the palace in the West Bank but especially of course in Gaza now could come to power in American policy right now is appropriate Hamas has not renounced terror it hasn't renounced violence it hasn't accepted Israel's right to exist so the official American policy is to not deal with Hamas until they do that and that's the correct approach the Israeli government has dealt with Hamas indirectly around the Gilad Shalit negotiations it has dealt with it indirectly in relation to some of the prisoner negotiations just this weekend with Egypt playing as a mediator so if Israel chooses to deal with Hamas indirectly I don't think we should stand in the way but that's up to to Israel to decide so so there's a concern among some of the people in the audience in terms of the questions that they ask that this kind of very robust dialogue which is you know kind of so Jewish and so American could really be misinterpreted by people elsewhere in the world and we've certainly seen a rise of a lot of ugliness in Europe against Jews in terms of Israel but also just in terms of being Jews how much responsibility do we have to keep this kind of dialogue open or more circumspect in terms of protecting the welfare of other Jews well I think the notion that open debate and discussion about Israel somehow fosters anti-semitism is wrong I just don't buy that I actually think that the more that we discussed these issues and the more that we potentially move towards a situation in which the the worldwide Jewish community comes together and recognizes the interest in ending this conflict it's a good thing for the Jews so I actually view it just the opposite I think that the that anti-semitism is is rife across Europe it is rife in the in the Arab world and it is there to stay something that we will always have to deal with but to use that as an excuse not to have an open discussion about how we feel about these issues is I think yet another attempt to staunch the debate and to silence dissent do you agree bill no I'm for vigorous debate I mean that's what yeah I'm vigorous debate on Israel and I'm against arching debate and I'm for so I'm happy to agree on that Wow would you please note so and I don't think debate has I mean Isis trying to say earlier I think it's a bit of a canard to say that's over these you know in the past there was this horrible stifling of debate and people weren't allowed to speak up but now suddenly light which has come and people are saying there's been a very vigorous debate certainly among within Israel and among the Friends of Israel the US and elsewhere since the beginning and before the beginning of the creation of the State of Israel and I don't I think this is a continuation of that and I don't regard it as particularly alarming honestly or is something to be suppressed I suspect this is one of the things we agree upon we agree on where maybe others some of the other Jewish institutions who I think have created a bit of a mythical history that at one time there was this total consensus about everything and that it's really unfortunate to expose these debates to outsiders I think that's a it's just impractical okay you can't conceal these things and one shouldn't try to conceal these things anymore the American Jewish community is strong Israel is strong Israel can sustain a very vigorous domestic debate the American Jewish community can sustain a very vigorous debate within itself and in the broader American public on issues related to Israel so let me just press you there a little bit though who should be outside the tent certainly you've been critical of people in the boycott divestment and sanction movement BDS should that be sort of beyond the bounds of acceptable debate well it's not enough to me to say what's acceptable debate and I don't I don't own the tent unfortunately hey so I can't really kick people out of it you know I myself would have limits of people I would appear with to debate and I people who I really do think who I felt were really sought to destroy the State of Israel or were so even if they didn't intend to were so unbelievably Cavalier and the kinds of they endorse like a boycott and divestment like boycott and divestment and sanctions that I would personally not appear with them and would not want to if you will legitimize them not that I have the ability to legitimize a diligent wise people and I'm sure everyone has to make his own decisions about what he considers a sort of respectable if mistaken point of view as opposed to a really a point of view that he doesn't wish or he or she doesn't wish to be in any way not only associated with but even to be I guess debating but we don't control that you know it's a big country it's a big Jewish community there are a lot of different people in there with a lot of different views we have people on the Republican a conservative side whom I certainly don't approve some of them some of whom I don't disapprove so much that I won't appear with them and that I've urged that they be expelled or not welcomed into the Republican Party I was said a year ago would be happy for on call left and ran it's a third party Kent I was very happy when Pat Buchanan was allowed really encouraged I would say by George W Bush and others I played a tiny part in this maybe in 98 99 to go off and run as a third party candidate in 2000 and so to simply left the Republican Party I Pappy ER to have a Republican party without Pat Buchanan and then with Pat Buchanan but everyone's got to make up his own mind about where to draw that line and and of course politics is different from intellectual things so you might decide in politics that someone has to be repudiated it doesn't mean that the person you couldn't have an interesting intellectual arguing with him so your red line would be with the BDS on the other side of it where's your red line Jeremy well I mean in terms of discussions I think that you absolutely should engage the BDS movement in discussions you know I don't see any reason not to appear with them I I disagree with the movement J Street is opposed to boycotts divestment and sanctions as tactics in achieving our goals but I don't think that there should be a boycott on the boycotters in terms of a discussion and so we have engaged in debates we've invited people who support those views to speak at our conference and we take a lot of criticism for that but I'm a big proponent of the the view of Justice Brandeis that the best antidote for speech that you don't like is other speech and it is not correct to shut out those views and we're a stronger community the broader that we allow the discussion to be I mean no one just would say I mean Jeremy should whatever after this organization but no one's talking much shutting down views or quiet or silence he views but of course when one does invite people to speak at one's own conference what is saying this is somehow a view that is least within the pale of legitimate debate and I take it you think the BDS movement is such a view well I think that the people that we have invited represent views and our people who are within the legitimate spectrum of debate I haven't heard people who are calling for the destruction of the State of Israel who are anti-semitic who are very only anti-israel we would never invite but there are people who believe that the use of certain tactics may advance a two-state solution may advance the resolution of this conflict and I don't think that that crosses the red line well we are just about out of time but I can't resist bill asking you a question since you had such a big role in picking the vice presidential candidate in 2008 for the Republican ticket who do you favor this year seems like that's somehow a question I'd be better advised not to answer for them yeah for the sake of the Republican tickets and governor Romney's victory in November so I I assume he'll make a good vice presidential pick the good thing about Republican Party and I you know I've had many many years and I guess decades I have a frustration or the Republican Party is I do think they're awful lot of I hope he does to take someone younger actually and I think there are awful lot of capable younger Republicans ranging from far-right in the house to Marco Rubio and Kelly Ayotte the Senate a lot of Governors like chris Christie and Scott Walker at others I couldn't resist throwing that in just to have just just to get that but just to get that a little a little one last little rise from the audience you know make sure everybody still awake exactly so I hope Governor Romney picks what did someone like that as his running mate any predictions Jeremy Joe Biden will be the vice president well thank you all you really have been an extremely wonderful audience I appreciate your passion and your attention and frankly your respect for this very robust exchange

our next guest has signed on to that legislation joining us now Republican senator from Georgia carrot Kelly Leffler she is a member of the Senate committees on Veterans Affairs health agriculture as well as the Joint Economic Committee so tell us how this would work the bill if it passes would allow Americans to sue tech companies you know Google Facebook others if they feel that they have been censored and and ask for political I'm sorry for compensatory damages right that's right John thanks for having me on and happy Father's Day you know what we're asking is that we look at section 230 and make sure that we're holding big tech accountable where they cross the line and moving from a platform to a publisher and you know I'm very concerned that our foundation of free speech in America is being eroded but in particular conservative speech in fact when the president's tweets were flagged and censored I wrote to the head of the FCC asking him to review section 230 and to understand where we are today with complying with those requirements for limitations on liability and on the other hand you have someone like congressman Doug Collins that is asking to slow down investigations into big tech siding with them when we need to be holding them accountable for limiting free speech and for limiting conservative speech and so that's why I signed on to Senator Holly's bill I'm gonna continue to fight for Georgians rights particularly for conservative speech and you'll see me continuing to hold big tech accountable section 230 obviously part of the Communications Decency Act it might not be part of the everyday lingo of Americans want to talk to you about something else how is it going in Georgia Georgia is really one of the first states to try to reopen its economy after the corona virus pandemic hit the number of coronavirus stats in Georgia as of 2:00 p.m. today about 63 almost 64 thousand cases and more than 2,500 deaths are you seeing problems or any kind of a spike as a result of the reopening well we're moving through the phases of reopening very carefully and I want to thank governor Kemp for his leadership vice president pence was down in Georgia a few weeks ago recognizing the smooth reopening we've had we're working hard to keep Georgians safe and I want to thank all Georgians for continuing to adhere to the guidelines look we've kept the hospitalizations trending flat to down that's critical that was part of the one of the goals of flattening the curve that's what we've been doing most recently I've written to CMS administrator administrator Seema Verma thanking her for her work with regard to nursing homes and keeping our seniors safe but looking into those states that didn't adhere to CMS guidelines we need to understand why in this country 40 percent of the deaths occurred in nursing homes if we have a second wave we need to understand that and I want to thank her for her leadership and recognize governor Kemp's great leadership and getting our state reopen because Georgians want to get back to work they want to get back to school to church to synagogue that's what we're doing and we need to continue to follow the guidelines one of the president's top economic advisors Peter Navarro was on another network this morning and important me said something kind of interesting about the origins of coronavirus listen to Peter Navarro here that virus was a product of the Chinese Communist Party and until we get some information about what happened in those labs or what happened in that web market we know that that virus was spawned in China that what I said was that virus came out of China the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for it and it was he hinted although didn't offer back up that it was a a laboratory product of the Chinese virology lab are you of that opinion or is it still to be determined well look the vast majority of Americans agree that we need to hold China accountable so whether this was an intentional and/or inadvertent spread of the virus what we need to do is look at the Chinese Communist Party's actions here they were they made the w-h-o complicit in keeping this information this vital life-saving information about the virus silent they withheld access to their markets so that we could understand what was happening within China but what we need to do now is look ahead how do we prevent this from ever happening again how do we hold China accountable that's why I've introduced legislation it's the beat China Act Joni Ernst and Ted Cruz have signed on to it it provides incentives for companies where our medical supply chains depend on China to come back to the united states to manufacture medical products pharmaceuticals in our country not only does that lessen our reliance on China but it also creates jobs and that's what we need to be doing in our country that's what President Trump has done so well is stand up to China to make sure that we have fair trade not just feet free trade no president in our lifetime has been more tough on China than President Trump and I'm going to continue to support those efforts legislatively Georgia senator Kelly Leffler Republican thank you thank you John

well hi everyone and welcome to another edition of hot seat with hinson i'm congresswoman ashley henson representing iowa's first district running in the new iowa second district but uh we are so pleased today to have with us a candidate uh from the des moines area but he is running to help us flip iowa's third district from blue to red so i would like to introduce everybody to a former colleague of mine in the iowa legislature uh zach nunn zach just won your you just won your primary last week so congratulations on that you are officially the nominee in iowa's third district so welcome to hot seat with hinson and tell everyone watching a little bit more about yourself congresswoman henson thank you well first i learned all my best moves from ashley hinson she was my junior when we came into the iowa house together i was one year ahead of her and as the whip she immediately came in as a freshman and just kind of shook up our entire caucus in a really exciting way so we have been thrilled to see uh congresswoman henson do so well going forward and serving the people of the first district so third district's new right we have a brand new district here it basically goes in the very east from wapolo all the way into the west to cass and atlantic and then in the north we've got green and really the nucleus of the district is des moines and the polk county area along with dallas and the waukee area so we're excited about it we've had the privilege of serving in the state senate for the last four years and four years before that in the iowa house purple district long time uh it originally started out blue we turned it to red by double digits primarily by working hard to talk to everyone in the district not just republicans but moderates and independents we'd like to be able to do that again here ashley in the new third district and by way of background you know i grew up in the polk county area we've got four kids we just took on two fosters so i'm trying to keep up with the ashley henson to fill the entire minivan maximize that vehicle and um yeah i'm a military guy so this is this is exciting for us looking to search so you've literally been serving our country and our state already so talk a little bit about that you know you talk about having those conversations with folks in the community in the in the community that you know and represent here in iowa how is that informing not only your race for congress but your priorities what you want to make sure that you're getting done uh for iowans in in washington dc yeah thanks well so we've been out to all 21 counties now in the new third repeatedly and overwhelmingly you know what we're hearing the same things that are impacting our family and your family is that you know filling up the minivan is not an easy task anymore get in the truck to be able to get to work is very expensive putting food on the table or planning in the field has become exponentially more costly and i think a lot of people are very hurt by this personally and it doesn't matter what political party you're from this is a 5200 a year cost to iowa families and increasingly i hear you know what works in iowa what you helped lead with one of the largest tax cuts what we passed again here this year with the largest tax cut put billions of dollars back in iowa's pockets and they invested that in their family in their main street in their business and they grew the economy versus kind of what's happening in washington dc where we see trillions of dollars being spent that gets blasted out but does never really get invested in a community in any time but drives up the cost of everything else for everyone else that's the issue we are here loud and clear that it's about how do i best take care of my family dc is making it harder let's do more what iowa does and make it better yeah well when we're hearing things and i talk about this consistently with constituents i was on the plane back yesterday and i had a conversation with a woman sitting next to me and when i told her you know not only that did uh those bills and that excessive spending last year send checks to prisoners checks to japanese citizens was living in japan paying for golf course modifications and expansions i mean when taxpayers hear that and they are faced with these challenges truly eating into their bottom line no wonder people are offended and think we need to go a different direction in washington dc and these these this overspending this spending spigot that's been turned on by by nancy pelosi by president biden by chuck schumer in the senate um this is what i've been calling the trifecta of trouble it's trouble for iowans trying to make ends meet it's trouble for businesses trying to grow and i'm sure you continue to hear those stories um in your district zach so um you know when you when you talk to people do they realize that it's time for a change i mean uh what is what is your message out on the campaign trail to people about making a change in iowa's third district no actually you're absolutely right and so whether you're talking to soccer moms or tractor dads the reality is is that people are feeling the pinch in their pocketbook and they're feeling it at their dinner table uh one of the biggest things that we are hearing from folks is there's 70 of the things we all agree on let's focus on that and move something forward most importantly what we are sharing and hearing from folks is it's not just about winning in november because iowa's third congressional district is now the number one pickup seat at present for winning back a majority in congress and this isn't just to win to win it's when to serve and actually get some legislation passed that's helpful to families but also to hold the white house accountable for what they've done the last two years you look at the last 18 months where we were then with gas prices with the growth of the economy with pensions that you could retire on if you're a retiree we've gone completely the opposite direction both in the economy but also on everything from our national security which is important to you and me our border security which is in our face every day and our abandonment of literally americans in afghanistan but also people who want to come to this country the right way do great things for america who aren't being let in but we'll let two million individuals come in with no check whatsoever that's a hardship on everyone they want to see pragmatic results come out of dc not more of this partisan bickering and that's for people of all political stripes nope i agree with that 100 and unfortunately you talked about accountability and how important that is uh we have seen just mistake after mistake with this administration and you know you you actually you touched on afghanistan and i want to go back to that for just a minute because you have served our country um and your military service has inspired you to already take actions to help support your district and to help support people as a result of this administration's failed policy so can you talk a little bit about uh your experience in helping with that situation uh that was a completely botched withdrawal from afghanistan yeah so very quickly on the 31st of august after serving multiple combat tours in afghanistan we saw the administration abandon american citizens and allies some of whom had served nine combat tours with us in the field including an interpreter for the iowa national guard where i most recently served as commander we raised money of donors across the country as volunteer veterans we were up at two in the morning coordinating aircraft flights out we flew multiple aircraft into mazda sharif in the north of afghanistan and evacuated thousands of people including those american citizens who'd been left behind by our administration it should never be the role of a bunch of good intentioned volunteers to have to execute foreign policy for the united states most importantly we shouldn't be the ones bringing americans back home after a two-decade war in afghanistan that was destroyed so badly that we left billions of dollars in the country american forces behind lost u.s lives in a debacle that was wholly preventable but then we never hear any kind of accountability from the administration or even ownership of that we still have people in afghanistan today american citizens who can't get out that's unacceptable every american recognizes that and that's what we should be having a conversation when it comes to national security everything from energy independence to border security here at home absolutely and um i applaud you for your efforts in doing that you're absolutely right i mean look at what you were able to do as a citizen our office was working directly with the state department to try to get people out but the state department really dropped the ball here and that's a direct result of this administration's policies um top generals were telling uh the president don't um execute in this way it's going to result in loss of lives and now we have the taliban that's emboldened and that sent a message around the world too right about how our foreign adversaries are emboldened because they know we are weak on the global stage so i look forward to having you as a colleague in washington dc uh team henson is 100 behind team none and we want to make sure that we can again hold this administration accountable and just you are obviously so experienced and so talented and thank you so much for your service to our country already um i look forward to again having you as a colleague so that we can help make sure we fire nancy pelosi in november and restore some iowa common sense uh to congress which is what we absolutely need to do so um again we're 100 behind you everybody watching today i'm sure wants to learn a little bit more

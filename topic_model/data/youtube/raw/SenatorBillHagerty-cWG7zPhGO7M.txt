secretary marcus welcome i just checked your department's website this morning and according to the data on your website 92 percent of the people that of the illegal aliens that ice has deported have been convicted or charged with crimes here 92 percent yet the ice deportations under your administration have plummeted dramatically now we know the surge is occurring at the border we know many more people are arriving here illegally yet the deportations have gone down that means that we have more criminals being deposited into our nation every day i want to talk with you about the resources that we've committed to this problem and how law-abiding americans can feel more comfortable knowing that this increase in criminal elements is occurring in their communities it's occurring in my state of tennessee isn't it correct that you're choosing not to deport these people that ice is not deporting these people and increasing the risk to american citizens a senator that is um that is actually not correct and if i if i may i served for 12 years as a federal prosecutor and some of those years i was privileged to have our current attorney general in the department of justice headquarters here in washington d.c um the criminal justice system is based on qualitative outcomes not quantitative and we are focused on the greatest threats to public safety because we do not have limited resources and so our focus is on three priorities national security public safety and border security and we're delivering consequences as well we should to most effectively serve those priorities it's qualitative not quantitative and from a quantitative perspective what we've seen is a massive drop in deportations last year between 10 and 20 000 deportations per month under your administration that number's dropped to three thousand twenty five hundred per month you've got twenty five hundred agents twenty five hundred ice agents they're down to deporting one criminal per month versus five per month last year the number of criminals dropped that much i i didn't mean to interrupt senator let me let me put this in in context because there is one data point that we shouldn't um take off the table and neglect to consider which is the fact that for um a good deal of the year thus far and certainly with respect to the fiscal year our agents our brave men and women on the front lines were addressing the covet 19 pandemic and for a period of that time they were not fully deployed for reasons that we can all agree upon and so we have to remember to consider that and the constrains on our facilities and our resources in a time of extraordinary pandemic but be that as it may the fundament the fundamental point is key that it's qualitative and i would rather as an individual supervising law enforcement and as a former assistant united states attorney prosecuting crimes i would rather dedicate resources to an individual who poses the greatest public safety threat and the apprehension and removal of which may take a greater amount of time and a greater amount of resources than someone who's been here for 25 years who has not committed an offense and yet can swallow up resources that we can best otherwise use i'm talking about people that have committed crimes that have been charged with crimes last year during the pandemic you mentioned the pandemic as an excuse last year even during the pandemic we were deporting 6 000 per month now those numbers have dropped to less than half of that senator we have if i may we have defined our public safety national security and border security threats to most effectively address them and combat them so that our consequence regime is brought to bear on the greatest threats that we confront so we see a dramatic decrease in the number of criminals being deported as a result secretary is it true that you've received more funding from this this committee on a bipartisan basis for your criminal alien program more funding than you had last year i believe that is correct that is correct isn't it true that you've got more funding for fugitive operations than you had last year that is correct as well senator and isn't it true that you've got capacity to house between 18 and 20 000 deportation prospects that's going unused right now that is correct as well how is it then that with more resources you're accomplishing such fewer number of deportations how is it that the results could have plummeted so much with more money from this appropriations committee senator um if i may repeat uh an answer i provided uh which is our focus is on uh quality not quantity and sometimes achieving qualitative results can consume considerable resources well i think going beyond ax murderers to people that have committed other grave crimes should be your focus as well you should utilize this capacity and utilize the funds that we've provided you more effectively senator thank you so much

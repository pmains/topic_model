as you know i'm extremely concerned about the current state of the relationship between the joint commission and the va like i said beginning of this hearing the joint commission consistently gave the clarksburg va a passing score for accreditation before and after the horrific murders occurred at the facility the joint commission was even on site at the clarksburg va for a review which clarksburg passed they passed it that was less than eight weeks before the murders uh began that year the va paid the joint commission almost six million dollars for their services it really doesn't set right with me knowing the amount of money that we've invested there and the return we got as a senator or as a west virginian it all comes back to accountability it really does and i look forward to hearing your answers to my questions and i'll start mr perlin with you on this question here how did your joint commission miss this blatant oversight during their may 2017 on-site survey and so you were not in charge at that time and i want to clarify that again

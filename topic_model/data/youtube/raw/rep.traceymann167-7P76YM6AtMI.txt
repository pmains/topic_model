on the phone with us this morning big first district congressman tracy mann and he also has another congressman he's showing around the big first as well good morning tracy hey good morning nick good to be on with you guys this morning all right so i know that you have the ranking member of house ag committee gt thompson from pennsylvania in kansas this week as well so what are you planning on showing congressman thompson well uh you know we're delighted to have congressman thompson uh in our district he's the top republican on the house ag committee uh which matters a lot for us advocating in in d.c also if republicans win the majority he'll then have the gavel of the house that committee wouldn't do the farm bill next year so on speaker funding here in finney county we're going to tour a feed yard this morning tour a packing plant uh tour an active oil well through a farm and do a whole bunch of stuff around finney county and then we'll be in k-state and manhattan touring in bath and other things tomorrow afternoon all right well it sounds like that the goal here as always and it has been for the big first for quite some time although there was a brief period where the big first representative was not on the agriculture committee but i'm not going to go back into ancient history relatively speaking the goal is to be sure that the interests of agriculture in kansas are brought to the table when you write a farm bill right uh yeah that's exactly right hey hey nick good morning it's congressman gt just uh really proud to be here with uh tracy mann you know uh the uh yeah it's not just about how important agriculture is and obviously the big one here but it's how important the big one is to american agriculture with everything that's produced here and i'm just really pleased to be here this morning and really pleased to be with a gentleman that just friend a colleague that does such a great job on the agriculture committee he is at the table working on policy uh working with a vision too of uh you know what's over what are the issues today and what what are the needs for kansas agriculture but frankly american agriculture over the rice as well well forgive me um with how many districts there are in pennsylvania what part of pennsylvania do you represent congressman well right now pennsylvania 15th congressional district there are currently 18 congressional seats and i represent 24 percent of the landmass of pennsylvania agriculture is our number one industry in pennsylvania uh the the districts we are going to lose a seat so my uh my district will still be pennsylvania 15 but i'm going to go from a quarter to land mass uh one-third of the state of pennsylvania with the uh uh with a successful re-elect and come january wow that's a that's a big patch of land of again forgive me i'm maybe these are just simple questions but what do they grow out in pennsylvania that that you need to pay attention to well um i'll be honest with pennsylvania our number one industry zag our biggest commodity is dairy uh but we have some of the really the most highly valued hardwoods anywhere in the world uh proud that that's my congressional district mostly cherry is a species that's so so in demand and and valued uh at a really good price but we there's uh but we have corn soybeans uh some wheat uh we have we get up around the great lakes we've got some some great grapes here down the southern part we've got some orchards we're actually helping georgia out earlier this year was sending down some pennsylvania peaches to the packing houses in georgia because they were struggling for different reasons apples we have hogs and cattle poultry now not to the scope and size obviously we're going to see today and that's based mostly on the geography of pennsylvania uh but it's uh it's it's pretty varied in terms of well i i can't leave out uh we're the number one producers of pennsylvania mushrooms there you go if you like fungus uh most of that's coming from pennsylvania well it sounds like you've got uh you've got everything for a great wood-fired pizza there gets a get get some cherry wood and some mushrooms and and and everything going on in that regard so again our thanks go ahead the cheese from those cow we got the cheese from those cows as well exactly all right so tracy turning back to you for just a second that the thing that ag producers need to know about i guess with regard to this conflict in ukraine is that's going to have a big time effect on commodity prices it already is what are you seeing with regard to that and what are you hearing in washington about the long-term effects of that yeah well it's all playing out right now gt and i actually had a pretty good briefing from a couple different folks last week on this very issue remember that ukraine has around 40 million people but they feed 400 million people and so when you've got almost a third of the wheat grown in the world in russia and also on ukraine and then also in russia you know a big big question becomes what does production look like for them how does production levels dip the concern is that you know that would destabilize a lot of the countries that they feed a lot of the countries in the middle east um egypt kind of north africa so the ripples effect we don't know yet it's imperative that we support ukraine that we stand ukrainian people for their freedom also they're able to get seeds in the ground here right now as their spring planting is about to start very important for for agriculture but you know american agriculture producers will have to step up and produce more uh you know something that we've done for a long time is stepping up when need be and i'm excited to see it where are we with nbaf how close to built and rolling is it well you know it's mostly built there's a a project like that there's a long punch list a lot of final items to do should start to be operational in the next year or so you know it's got to be construction got to be completed and then it has to be commissioned and then has to be tested and then a move has to happen so for the final move to occur we're still a ways away from that but we're closing in on it and that's going to be very exciting for the state well and i know you haven't toured yet congressman thompson but how important do you feel that this security provided by having the ability to test for these pathogens in in the central part of the country is that's incredibly important when you um when you look at uh just how important the question is just how important is food security and and it's immense i mean without food security you you don't have national security certainly don't have economic security as well and so having the ability with these pathogens that um you know we uh where we see you know uh uh their their presence uh some of that involved with poultry uh in the mid-atlantic areas of the of the country that's you know we're dealing with that now we uh uh the african swine is in uh the western hemisphere and the dominican republic and so you know uh the the ability to be able to have the the laboratories the biosecurity resources is incredibly important for food security going forward okay congressman man the the thing for kansans to know is that kansas and the big first which stretches all the way up to manhattan uh it is is a central point for this safety and and you forget or at least i do when i sit down to the dinner table just how important it is to have all of the the assurances that our food is safe and ready to go until you see conflict like we had in have we had in the ukraine and russia where now not only do they have to be concerned for their life right now but also for the long-term food security in that part of the world and with international commodity markets everything gets affected like we talked about earlier on um from your perspective with the u.s department of agriculture taking over the nbaf project from department of homeland security do you still feel confident that the usda is going to be able to use this new facility to continue to keep our food safe going forward yeah absolutely and in bath is a big portion of the threats currently but the future threats you know heading into the remainder of this century i think you have to remember that food you know security is also national security and it's also about freedom nick we know we are the free country that we are in large part i would argue because we have never had to rely on another country for our food and that's incredibly important that we maximize production here that we have the right policies in place and also uh that we make sure that that food is secure and that's why things like end bath are incredibly important i tell people that um you know the cdc is to humans which is based in downtown atlanta what is what inbath is to animals in many ways and so to have that project in kansas kind of right in the middle of cow country is really important for the food security not only of our country but of the world well and as things go forward with regard to figuring out exactly what impact the conflict in ukraine is going to have on markets and on agriculture that's going to be really important one other thing to touch on real quickly before we get off of here because i know you guys have an eight o'clock appointments is the fact that at least as far as i know right now the the usda lunch program that was related to covid where all the kids in schools got free lunches i think that's gonna end um what do we know about about how to continue to to get these commodities to schools going forward even if this program sunsets because covet isn't as much of a threat as it once was well that's something that we um and that that's really a big part of what we're doing today uh these next couple days here in kansas is bringing the voices of uh kansas agriculture to the table for the 2023 farm bill and that includes the nutrition title and so we uh well i will say we're way behind uh unfortunately we're in the minority i don't i don't have the gavel uh and so we don't set the schedule uh you know when we did the 2018 farm bill which included a significant amount of oversight on the nutrition title let alone a commodity title conservation the whole thing we we did over 130 different hearings and listening sessions nick and so far we've technically done for and preparing for the next corn bill it's very frustrating uh quite frankly because the only way we get the farm bill right is when we when we really bring the voices of american agriculture to the table and that includes the nutrition title that you talked about we we have not had hearings where we've had oversight we've heard from usda why did the secretary discontinue to farm the family food boxes you know tell us about the impact of you know some of the uh the waivers and the flexibility that with that we put in a 2018 farm bill that was really helpful in making sure american families during a time of coverage or any time of that plague had access to the nutrition that they needed so that's that's what we need first of all we we really need to have usda before the committee so we can ask the tough questions and they can share the relevant information and then then as far as i'm concerned it's congress uh that will make the decisions that's the way it's supposed to work and those decisions have been executed and administered by the administration all right and i hate to swing to politics and i know we're out of time tracy but the hope at least from your perspective is that you're actually hosting the eventual chair of the committee right do do you expect it to swing back to republican control in 2023 you know there's no crystal ball certainly uh are hoping absolutely hoping that expecting that we have a lot of work in front of us if the election were today i feel pretty confident that we would win the majority and gt here would have the gavel of the house ag committee but as we all know the election uh here is not until november so we will see so i would call it likely but not certain i like the rain forecast here in in southwest kansas oh hey yeah no no kidding about that thank you both congressman for your time thank you so much congressman thompson for being so generous to be on with us this morning and thank you again tracy you're always so good with your time appreciate it bring me both great okay thank you thank you so much

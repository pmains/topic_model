the subcommittee will come to order good morning we are starting this hearing much earlier than usual in an effort to accommodate those senators who will be attending the joint session with the prime minister of japan today's hearing addresses the issue of youth homelessness and more specifically hud's efforts to prevent and end youth homelessness i am absolutely delighted to welcome our distinguished panel today including cindy loper who is a grammy emmy and tony award-winning artist who co-founded the true colors fund in 2008. this organization works to bring an end to homelessness among gay lesbian bisexual and transgender youth i had the great pleasure to have dinner last night with cindy and i know her extraordinary passion for this issue this effort also includes the true colors residents the first project of its kind to provide a permanent supportive and secure home to homeless and formerly homeless lgbt youth in new york city it includes a partnership with federal agencies five federal agencies to test strategies to prevent homelessness among lgbt youth representing the administration this morning is jennifer ho senior advisor for housing and services to the secretary of housing and urban development prior to joining hud she was the deputy director at the u.s interagency council on homelessness also joining us this morning is deborah shore the executive director and founder of sasha bruce youth work which is one of the largest and most experienced providers of services to youth in washington d.c ms shore is also the chairman of the board of the national network for youth an advocacy organization that educates policy makers about the needs of homeless youth and last but certainly not least the discussion of youth homelessness would certainly be incomplete without our hearing from those who have experienced homelessness firsthand brittany dixon from auburn maine is here today she demonstrates what hard work and determination can achieve when a young person is given the opportunities and support to succeed and that is what hud funding helps to make possible for homeless youth across the country i told brittany this morning that her testimony is so important we deal with a lot of facts and figures but when you put a human face on the issue of homelessness it makes all the difference so thank you for traveling to washington to share your story according to hud's 2014 point in time count there are more than 194 300 homeless children and youth representing nearly one-third of all the homeless population of that total more than 45 000 were unaccompanied homeless children and youth which is nearly 8 of the total homeless population 86 of these unaccompanied children and youth are between the ages of 18 and 24 with the remaining under the age of 18. now it's important to note that those figures reflect a single point in time there are many more young people who find themselves homeless for a period of time throughout the course of the year that are not captured in that point of time survey so that survey actually considerably understates the enormous number of homeless young people in the year 2010 the administration published opening doors federal strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness which sets the goal of preventing and ending child family and youth homelessness by 2020 successfully ending youth homelessness cannot be done with federal funds alone it requires cooperation and coordination across federal agencies at all different levels of government and in partnership with philanthropic and non-profit organizations to achieve this goal we must understand how hud's programs can be strengthened to better support homeless youth while operating within the unfortunately tight fiscal constraints that we face i am proud to have joined senator patrick leahy in sponsoring the runaway and homeless youth trafficking prevention act that regrettably failed to advance last week even though it received a majority of votes from the senate our amendment would have reauthorized those critical prevention and treatment services that help homeless youth across the country the three basic programs in that are authorized by this law have helped thousands of young homeless men and women meet their immediate needs and provided long-term residential services for youth who cannot be safely reunited with their families i will continue to strongly advocate for the passage of this essential legislation i've seen the importance of federal funding in my home state of maine and meeting the needs of unaccompanied youth new beginnings in lewiston and the prevalent street resource center in portland have used these resources to connect young people who need food safe shelter health services and educational support with those who can provide those services opportunities exist for better collaboration among hud the department of education the runaway and homeless youth and child welfare programs of the department of health and human services one such areas coordinating federal policies and guidance around the housing needs of youth who are aging out of the foster care system and then find themselves homeless there are other areas where stronger coordination is needed and i look forward to hearing the suggestions and advice of our witnesses again i am proud to welcome our great panel of witnesses and look forward to hearing from them i now would ask senator reid who has been such an advocate for the homeless for so many years to give his opening statement

do you think the world is more dangerous less dangerous after the death of Soleimani it's definitely less dangerous I think I think most people even agree on that the world is better off without soleimani the IRGC is much further weakened because of it I do not believe this narrative that the Iranian people are now all of a sudden behind the Supreme Leader Khomeini they are not and you know what I would like to see is if we united is if every member of Congress started tweeting out hashtag free Iran that would give moral support to the Iranian people to continue their fight for freedom that's what I would like to see they are not all of a sudden on the side of hardliners we have to remember something there isn't an honest democratic debate in Iran okay the supreme leader Khomeini is the single voice and you know that hasn't changed but he has become severely weakened and more importantly they've had to recalculate how they deal with the United States now they know that we have red lines and the honest truth is they did not know that before they were increasing their attacks they were increasing their escalations and violence and they were moving from non attributable proxy attacks to attributable attacks that is a huge change because they thought we had no red lines remember Khomeini tweeted out before that attack to President Trump you can't do anything those were his words you can't do anything so they were they truly believed this and that has changed radically so we have effectively reestablished deterrence with all the information that we have now have effectively effectively reestablished a sense of deterrence that's extremely important going forward

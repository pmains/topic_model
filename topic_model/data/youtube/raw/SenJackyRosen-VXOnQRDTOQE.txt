SO I DO THINK THAT THIS BILL  WILL SAVE LIVES. THERE'S HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN  MENTAL HEALTH. WE KNOW YOUTH SUICIDE IS A HUGE  PROBLEM. THAT INVESTMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH IS GOING TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OF COURSE WITH SCHOOL SAFETY,  GUN TRAFFICKING,HEHE BOYFRIEND  LOOPHOLE AND ALL OF THAT.

(drumming) (crowd cheering) - I'm here with all my friends and light hearted spirits for the Second Annual
Women's March in Chicago. I'm here supporting Lauren Underwood, Congressional candidate for
Illinois, 14th District. She's gonna make it happen for us. She's strong, she's
experienced, she's qualified, here to celebrate all
women and Lauren's future. - [Man] She's an amazing

well many of you have probably heard about the new guidelines from the cdc saying that anyone who is fully vaccinated can resume most activities without wearing a mask or social distancing well in response many national retailers have actually dropped their mask mandates you can see a few of those stores on your screen right now you have bj's wholesale club costco public starbucks target walmart and several others on there so now many are asking were masked for the fully vaccine just public theater all along well let's ask someone who called out dr fauci about that very topic months ago kentucky senator and medical doctor rand paul senator welcome back to the show thanks for having me hey senator dr fauci was on good morning america yesterday um here's what he said when asked about masks being political theater before the cdc made the recommendation change i didn't want to look like i was giving mixed signals but being a fully vaccinated person the chances of my getting infected in an indoor setting is extremely low well that's interesting he now says that he's following the science right and he's not going to wear a mask that makes sense right it sounds fairly familiar take a listen to this what studies do you have that people have had the vaccine or have had the infection are spreading the infection if we're not spreading the infection isn't it just theater no it's not a vaccine and you're wearing two masks isn't that theater no that's not here we go again with the theater let's get down to the facts senator you feel a little vindicated well i'm just glad that dr falchi is now chosen to accept vaccine science basic vaccine science says you can't get it after you've been vaccinated that's why we get vaccinated and yet he was unwilling to accept it and he was performing theater wearing masks because he didn't want people to see him without a mask it wasn't the masks worked or that he needed it you heard the way he phrased it he didn't want someone to see him without the mask so really it was theater but here's the other question you know all these retailers are now saying no mask i don't think the mask ever really did help to tell you the truth when you do studies of the cloth masks 97 of virus-sized particles go right through the cloth mask they really don't work when you do controlled studies in hospitals you find that most of the cloth and surgical masks don't work for influenza sized particles interestingly the one mask that does work is the n95 mask has to be worn properly but if you ask any doctor in the country would you go in a covid patient's room who's sicken on a ventilator with a cut up piece of your undershirt as your mask they would say no they won't do it the only the hospital won't let you in a covered patient's room without an n95 mask because it's the only one that works so all the other masks were theater you know recently host of msnbc's morning joe mika brzezinski said she's still going to wear a mask despite being fully vaccinated listen to this i am working with a team here and there is one person on the team who is not vaccinated i'm wearing a mask around that person you know it is really if you want to follow the science then there are times you need to still wear the mask you know senator it seems like because biden and fauci took so long to trust the science that now people are not having so much confidence in the vaccine you know well mika needs to go back to elementary science class i doubt she ever really took any science but if she had the idea that she's been vaccinated and wearing a mask around someone is unvaccinated it really has nothing to do with the unvaccinated person it has to do with the vaccinated person she's vaccinated she has a very very high chance that one she won't get it at all or if she gets it she has at least some immunity to be able to fight it all so she's sending the wrong signal to people we still would like more people who are at risk to get vaccinated but if we send them a signal that they're just making up this science and that they're treating us like imbeciles and they're doing things for show it actually discourages some people who are hesitant to get vaccinated i think high risk people should voluntarily i wouldn't tell anybody they had to but over 65 85 percent of americans have figured it out they've been vaccinated i think that number still could go higher i would add to that people over 40 who are overweight i would call a high risk category over 40 and overweight i would recommend they get vaccinated but i wouldn't be out there telling 12 year olds we're not going to let you go to summer camp or we're not going to let you go to school or get on a plane unless you're vaccinated if you want to be vaccinated fine for kids but it really is not something that i think we need to mandate or say you can't go to school unless you have been vaccinated so we need to really not treat this as a one-size-fits-all this really should be individualized and that's the way healthcare should be in a free society i agree yeah it's it's ironic that these guys talk about trusting the science unless they don't want to trust the science themselves interestingly senator last night when i got home in the mail i had a letter waiting for me from rand paul so excited to be able to talk to you i thought maybe you wanted to get ahead of the interview but in this letter you talk about the life at conception act and ironically just yesterday the day i get this letter the supreme court says it's going to consider the legality of a mississippi abortion law that seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy president biden says he's caught up he wants to codify roe v wade you really make the case in this letter that this act needs to get passed to codify life the definition of life where do you see this whole issue going right now you know i think when the court looked at this in roe v wade they said that congress had never really defined when life began and so they got into a murky area so i think congress should define when life begins we've had several bills that have come forward talking about when the baby feels pain and i can tell you a few years ago i interviewed with a very prominent woman over at cnn who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time and she was goading me about being against abortion i said when you realize at 20 weeks that the baby can feel pain avoid needles and the baby goes through excruciating pain if you try to destroy the baby and interestingly this anchor edited the show took out that clip because i think she felt guilty seeing as she was that pregnant at the time and so i think even people on the left when they see pictures of 20 week old babies and they see a baby trying to avoid and realize that when you do surgery on a 20 week old baby in the womb like let's say you're going to fix their kidneys they actually give anesthesia because the baby feels the pain of the surgery this corrective surgery that's done in the womb they actually give anesthesia so i think these things all argue for there being a person there a real baby and i think it gets harder and harder for them to argue there's nothing there um so i think we're winning in a way and ultimately uh we're going to save lives if we keep it up thank you senator appreciate your time yeah if they just listen to the science on this matter appreciate your time tonight thank you

i want next uh to discuss something that i know is top of mind for every parent in georgia and as the the father of a six-month-old baby daughter uh something that i can relate to intensely which is the concern about the safety of the products that families buy whether it's strollers or cribs that are under the regulatory purview of the consumer product safety commission and that concern that a product malfunction or an error in manufacturing could lead to the death or serious injury of an infant or a young child it's every parent's worst nightmare and in recent years the cpsc has obtained the recall of certain products that pose risks to maternal and infant health you issued or the gao issued in november 2020 several recommendations for the consumer product safety commission in terms of the management of case processing investigative timelines and how it measures the effectiveness of its recalls how can we help make the cpsc system as timely and efficient and effective as possible at ensuring that no parent has to suffer the loss of an infant baby or a young child because of a preventable defect in a product that never should have hit markets or should have been recalled once it did and will you commit to the people of georgia and to my office this committee and the congress that you'll follow up with us on the progress of the implementation of those recommendations please yeah absolutely you have my commitment on that i'm a grandparent of seven grandchildren so i i share your concern about this uh there's nothing more worrisome than the harm that can occur to an infant or others uh and we also have an open recommendation to congress here to create an entity that can ensure effective coordination across the government solve jurisdictional issues between areas also a high risk area we have senators on food safety our food safety systems fragmented and so we'll brief your staff on those issues as well thank you georgia parents will be relieved by that commitment and i look forward to continuing to work with you thanks for your testimony senator thank you thank you senator ossoff

. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. SMITH: THE PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING OUR FIRST BILL OF THE 11TH CONGRESS REFLECT OURS COMMITMENT TO AMERICANS AND AN OPEN LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE STEELE AND I FIRST INTRODUCED THIS BILL IN SEPTEMBER. MEMBERS WERE GIVEN MORE THAN 2 HOURS NOTICE PRIOR TO TODAY'S CONSIDERATION. 72 HOURS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME FOR MEMBERS TO READ THROUGH THIS BILL. IN FACT IT'S TWO PAGES LONG AND COVERS ONLY ONE TOPIC. IF MEMBERS WISH TO VOTE ON THIS BILL THEY MUST BE PRESENT IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER BECAUSE PROXY VOTING IS NO LONGER AN OPTION. NOW LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT REPEAL THETS VAST -- REPEALS THE VAST JERRETT OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FUNDING THE DEMOCRATS ENACTED LAST YEAR TO PAY FOR THEIR GREEN NEW DEAL. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE FUNDING IS TO HIRE AUDITORS AND SUPPORT STAFF TO SAYSLY EXPAND I.R.S.'S AUDIT CAPACITY AND NOT JUST AUDITS ON WEALTHY AMERICANS. WITH THAT CAPACITY, I.R.S. CAN BRING IN MORE REVENUE BY AUDITING MORE MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND MORE SMALL BUSINESSES. FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING URN THE WEIGHT OF INFLATION AND SHORTAGES. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND WORKERS AT ANY WAGE. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF AMERICANS FOLLOW THE LAW AND PAY THEIR TAXES. THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS MORE I.R.S. AGENTS KNOCKING ON DOORS TO CONDUCT AUDITS. YET THIS I.R.S. FUNDING IS PART OF THE BROAD BIDEN ADMINISTRATION STRATEGY TO TAX AND AUDIT EXPONENTIALLY MORE AMERICANS BY LOOKING INTO THEIR BANK ACCOUNT, REQUIRING ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES TO REPORT THEM, AND WHEN THEY SPLIT A DINNER CHECK WITH FRIENDS OR PAY THEIR BABY SILTER AFTER A NIGHT OUT AND TARGET THEM USING 87,000 NEW I.R.S. EMPLOYEES. AMERICANS DESERVE TO KNOW THAT GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR THEM, NOT AGAINST THEM. TODAY, MR. SPEAKER, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR DEMOCRATS CLAIM THERE REALLY WON'T BE 87,000 NEW I.R.S. EMPLOYEES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE HOUSE WILL BE IN ORDER. PLEASE TAKE YOUR CONVERSATIONS ELSEWHERE. THE GENTLEMAN MAY RESUME. MR. SMITH: I IMAGINE THEY'LL SAY NEW EMPLOYEES WON'T TARGET MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND REPUBLICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT I.R.S.'S CUSTOMER SERVICE FAILINGS. LET'S FOCUS ON THE FACTS. WHEN A FEDERAL AGENCY HIRES A NEW EMPLOYEE TO REPLAY ONE WITH RETIRES IT DOES NOT INCREASE THE AGENCY'S HEAD COUNT. YET THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S OWN DOCUMENTS SAY THEY ARE INCREASING HEAD COUNT BY 87,000 OVER THE NEXT DECADE WITH THESE FUNDS. SECRETARY YELLEN'S OWN INSTRUCTIONS TO I.R.S. STATED AUDIT RATES OF FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN $400,000 SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE AUDITED AT HISTORICALLY SIMILAR RATES. UNDER THOSE INSTRUCTIONS, NINE OUT OF EVERY 10 NEW AUDITS CAN TARGET FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN $400,000. AND BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE COMMITTED TO DELIVERING A GOVERNMENT THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE, THIS BILL RETAINS FUNDING FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I.T. MODERNIZATION AT I.R.S. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE ACCOUNTS WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED THROUGH REGULAR APPROPRIATIONS. TO ENSURE I.R.S. HAS THE RESOURCES TO MAKE MUCH-NEEDED IMPROVEMENT TO TAXPAYER SERVICES. MR. SPEAKER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS REASONS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IT PROTECTS FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. IT ENSURES AGENCIES ARE FUNDED APPROPRIATELY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT STOPS AUTO PILOT FUNDING FOR AN OUT OF CONTROL GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS PERHAPS MOST IN NEED OF REFORM. I.R.S. NEEDS TO FIX ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RETURN PROCESSING PROBLEMS NOT FOCUS ON AUDITING FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AMERICANS WANT AND I.R.S. THAT WORKS FOR THEM, NOT AGAINST THEM. THIS BILL IS A GREAT FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMA

to begin with a question for you one of the areas where housing needs our most acute are on tribal lands in south dakota and across the country native american reservations have a housing stock that has suffered a severe underinvestment that stretches over decades now one of the reasons for that is because we have what we call tribal trust land in which the government holds in trust the land which belongs to the native americans but when it comes time to build a home showing that you actually have ownership or the ability to own the land and thus the location where the home is becomes rather challenging and there are limited numbers of uh financial institutions that have expertise in working through that particular issue but this is a an item that has literally been there for decades um where do you think congress should start when it comes to improving housing conditions for native americans and um i'm probably i'm going to ask you a follow-up when we're done but just to start things off can you give me your thoughts about these are rural areas and so they're different than a lot of the rest of the country but to me this is critical for a population that really does have a very high level of poverty senator rounds thank you for that question it's a very important one so um as you noted there are a handful of lending institutions that have mastered the price providing mortgage credit on tribal lands and unfortunately we haven't had a regulatory framework in which our financial regulators have used the carrots that they have in order to incentivize lenders to do more in this space so there are a couple of things that we are actually championing one is the use of a program called special purpose credit programs now this is a program that has been on the books for decades it was it it is a construct of the equal credit opportunity act but it's really never been used it's similar to affirmatively furthering fair housing right we've never had implementation of the affirmatively furthering fair housing provision of the fair housing act and so we haven't realized the benefits that the law really holds it's the same thing with the equal credit opportunity act because we haven't had um really usage of the special purpose credit program provision we haven't seen the full scale of its benefits so we are really encouraging the department of housing and urban development to work co-jointly with the cfpb and the prudential regulators to issue more guidance to give lenders a higher degree of confidence to uh create and implement special purpose credit programs which can be designed specifically for uh serving native american populations you know i'd like to follow up a little bit on that because um i'd like to know whether or not you think there are items specifically with regard to the hud section 184 loan guarantee program that might be improved upon for this particular because that's really a native focused housing program are you familiar with it and and are there some things that we could do specifically with that particular program senator rounds unfortunately i am not very familiar with that particular program but i do know that special purpose credit programs can be used with any uh federal mortgage program so they can be used with va they can be va loans usda loans fha loans and i'm sure that they can be used with this uh loan project that you product that you just mentioned again there's a there's severe under utilization of the special purpose credit program but it is specifically designed it was put in place to meet the special credit needs of marginalized and underserved communities and native american populations are ripe for that opportunity thank you for that and i noticed that you mentioned the va program i i have to uh recall that i think it was either 2016 or 2017. the minneapolis-based office which is responsible for several states for for va loans on native american reservations the minneapolis office was given an award for having the highest number of va awarded mortgages in the nation they had five now think about that in terms of the the failure of our country to provide those types of loans to to native american veterans and so i do think that there are some things that we can work on that and i i just uh but thank you very much for your thoughts with regard to that um and i see mr chairman i i think i've gotten a little bit of time left uh uh you really you really don't but go ahead anyway well then let me just say this thank you for doing this particular uh uh item and i think that this is an area that we can find some bipartisan agreement on with regard to improving housing programs that were well intended but that may very well need just kind of a review to make sure that they're actually doing what they were supposed to do in the first place

republican congressman adam kinziger is asking what is the red line with putin what will it take for the u.s to act kenziger adds that the threat of putin using chemical weapons in ukraine is very real a warning we of course have heard from u.s officials as well joining me now republican congressman and iraq war veteran from adam kensington thank you very much congressman let's talk about what nato could do what can the u.s look at nato do that it is not doing what do you want to see yeah i mean look i think it's important to note a lot of what we've done so far has been good as we all know nobody expected such unity that we've seen uh intensity of sanctions that's good i think the banning of russian oil was was a smart move for the united states i was very concerned with the kind of vetoing of the migs to ukrainian control instead of working on a way that works with that and i personally think we need to do a no-fly zone i recognize there's risk in that i i think we've gotten to the point though where there is significant risk in inaction and there's a lot of people that see uh this kind of confrontation with russia as it would have been 30 years ago with the soviet union it's a very different moment and all putin has to be willing to do is to threaten the use of nuclear weapons chemical weapons and that puts us in a position where we're letting him set the tempo set the marching orders and set that red line congressman uh what do you say to the military response which is that how do you take out his his air defenses you you would have to attack russia to take out those you know sam 400s are you willing to do that because how do you create the no-fly zone first you have to clear the the space and control the space before you can have a new fiso and how do you do that without attacking russia proper well look there's there's risk in it and i think here's the key that we have to look at it there's different iterations of no-fly zones we can declare one over all of ukraine over the western part of ukraine for humanitarian reasons or just an area of a humanitarian corridor and it's pretty simple look at the request of the sovereign nation of ukraine who has a right to request help defending their sovereign airspace you know we can come in and implement whatever that looks like could it lead to the us shooting down russian jets it could could it lead to if a sam paints a u.s jet and fires to the destruction of that yes right now you are seeing thousands and thousands of ukrainians killed potential use of chemical weapons and a threat of nuclear look i understand the concern over the risk but i think we have to just start looking at this and saying what is the risk of inaction and where does this stop and i hope frankly i hope ukraine is able to hold off to cast off their russian oppressors we can look back and say i'm glad we didn't have to do that i just want us to start thinking uh that this may end up getting bigger before uh before we see anything else happen um i understood you've really laid out what the terms are here um no good options but you're saying we have to defend ukraine before ukraine is wiped out thank you very much congressman and adam mckinsey force on iraq

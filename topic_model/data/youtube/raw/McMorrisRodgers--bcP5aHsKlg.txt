committee ms mcfortra mr mcmorris rogers for five minutes thank you chair to get and republican leader griffith thank you to our distinguished panel first let's set the record straight regarding the covet 19 vaccine development and distribution president biden started on third base yet democrats in the media suggested that he hit a triple we keep hearing disinformation about what president biden inherited the first false claim is that president biden had to start from scratch on january 21st cnn reported that anonymous biden administration sources said quote we are going to have to build everything from scratch three days later president biden's chief of staff ron claim perpetrated this claim and vice president harris repeated it just last month this is disinformation dr fauci you publicly stated that the biden administration did not start from scratch the day president biden entered the white house more than 1.5 million new doses were administered let's not forget the nationally televised 60 minute segment with general purna on the trump administration's distribution plans that was in early november before we even had a covet 19 vaccine to distribute the trump administration first outlined their plan in september in october the the administration even announced partnerships to administer free vaccines another false claim is that the trump administration did not contract for enough vaccines on march 2nd president biden claimed that quote the prior administration had contracted not for nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in america again this is disinformation it's false last year the trump administration entered into contracts with multiple companies to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of coven 19 vaccines to date between just the three companies who have eiu euas we have enough doses to vaccinate 300 million people far more than our eligible adult population and that's not to mention the options for purchase of additional doses including that included in those initial agreements which the biden administration appears to have recently used i'm disappointed that president biden and democrats refuse to acknowledge any successes of operation warp speed vaccines normally take more than 10 years to develop yet we have three safe and effective vaccines in less than one year imagine how many lives will be saved every american democrat and republican alike should be proud and thankful for its success we should not be uh we should be looking at this model for america to lead a new era of innovation for medical breakthroughs not downplaying its success to under promise or score political points i now want to turn to school school closures let's be clear school closures are having a devastating effect on our children dr hassan the division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at rwj barnabas health in new jersey put it quote the mental health crisis caused by school closing will be worse a worse pandemic than covid worse than covid yet schools remain closed one year ago today this day governor ainslie closed the schools in my home state of washington and we've been too slow to open washington ranks 46th in the nation and getting students back into the classrooms this is unacceptable why is it taking so long governor ansley it's time our kids return to the classroom schools remain closed because of fear and politics not science dr wolinski on february 3rd you stated quote schools can safely reopen dr fauci for months last year you agreed school should reopen as you put it last fall close the bars and keep the schools open but unfortunately the teachers union continues to stand in the way president biden should be leading to get our schools open but following public backlash from the white house about your remarks dr wolinski the cdc published guidance that kept many schools from fully reopening we now know the cdc misinterpreted some of the research it relies on four doctors wrote in usa today and confirmed fear not science led to harmful policy enough is enough our kids are in crisis today i call on you dr wolinski and dr fauci to do as this administration promised follow science and truth up update the cdc guidelines to open our schools immediately surely that's something that we can all agree on thank you i yield back

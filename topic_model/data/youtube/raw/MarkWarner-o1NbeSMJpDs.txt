be on the phone is Senator Mark Warner he represents the Commonwealth of Virginia he's a democrat senator your reaction to president Trump's press conference I'm shocked I'm disappointed I tried to give the president the benefit of doubt on Monday I was disappointed it took him more than two days to call out the vile actions of people who were racist white supremacist neo Nazis KKK members that descended on Charlottesville I talked to lots of folks who are in Charlottesville that city is healing for him to come out today just seems like he can't help himself and and reopen this and then equate and somehow moral equivalency of both sides Wendy I don't know the exact percentage but the overwhelming majority of people who came out the counter this alt-right group for people from the local community they didn't want these this group defending on their city and for the president to in an offense reopen this today if I guess at this point I shouldn't be surprised anymore by the actions of this president city continues to surprise and frankly shocked me what do you think the reaction will be in Charlottesville a town that is still in healing there obviously one woman was killed a 32 year old paralegal there were 19 that were seriously wounded some of them I believe are still in the hospital this is a town that is in psychological pain people were fearful remain fearful the police chief just yesterday said that there continue to be assaults what effect do you think the president's words will have this is not this is not leadership this is not what mayor's presidents governor's do in moments of crisis they call on us to rape and affect life through our better angels and unfortunately this presidency to take it from the opposite direction again we saw on Saturday I I know I was receiving calls on Saturday as as this act of domestic terrorism if this individual drove through innocent bystanders not dissimilar from what we've seen in France I had senators from both parties calling me saying hey we feel the pain and then that was happening in your states and we condemn it and but there was this pride of hey helps in positions of leadership across political parties you're stepping up and standing up to this the president missed that opportunity and then again I got some criticism I try to give him the benefit out for for at least for saying the words yesterday but he just couldn't from he couldn't move on I think people in Charlottesville will be enormous ly disappointed but probably not surprised and that's what you find a point on it senator but what happened on Saturday was it was a domestic terrorist attack by a white supremacist that that's what happened he drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters the individual who did that is in jail and thankfully the justice system the full weight of it is being brought down upon him it is hard to imagine if that domestic terrorist action had been committed by somebody who was instead of a white supremacist terrorist a Muslim terrorist it is impossible to imagine President Trump saying that both sides are responsible for the violence saying that the people who came out against these extremists are equally to blame your honor percent right I mean that the hypocrisy of then-candidate Trump who constantly challenged President Obama for not using the phrase if want to care of them this president is unwilling to use that same standard to describe what happened which was domestic terrorism created by a neo-nazi on Saturday and he's not willingly used that same standard that's not leadership and and the idea is represented by these alt-right groups there's nothing in them that reflects America's creed in terms of all equally created by the creator and frankly this is it's an abomination to values that we hold in Virginia for that matter across the country Senator Mark Warner thinking some

objection scientists have documented carbon dioxide increases from 283 parts per million in 1800 to 315 parts per million in 1958 to current 411 parts per million Americans want Congress to act according to the Pew Research Center most Americans currently list the environment is one of the top policy priorities for Americans under 30 more than three-quarters of those surveyed think the environment should be a focus and we need to listen to them the good news is we have already begun acting despite public miss Kant's misconception in the United States leads the world in reducing emissions while we are growing our economy in 2006 the US GDP was slightly over 14 trillion dollars and co2 emissions peaked at just over six gigatonnes by 2019 our economy had grown by 55 percent to 21 point seven trillion dollars while our co2 emissions dropped 3.6 percent to 5 point 8 gigatons during this time we also witnessed a decrease in energy cost however there is much work that remains and there's much that we can do that's why I introduced the trillion trees Act as part of a broader initiative to offer practical solutions to this complex global problem while the potential for emissions reductions in storage offered by trees and wood products as outlined that this policy is significant it is not the only answer there are two components to this legislation that I want to make sure everyone understands first this policy will result in reduced carbon emissions in case you missed that I will repeat this policy will result in reduced carbon emissions it will reduce carbon emissions through an incentive-based tax credit up to 25 percent rewarding sustainable construction based on 3criteria part of the credit will require reduction in energy used and carbon emitted in manufacturing and transporting building materials to the job site part of the credit will require a reduction in energy used and carbon emissions to heat ventilate lot and operate the building over its lifetime the remaining portion of the credit will be based on the amount of carbon stored in the completed structure this policy will also result in reduced carbon emissions by capturing energy from dead residual biomass materials that are already on a pathway to becoming atmospheric carbon this will offset the equivalent amount of carbon emitting energy that otherwise would have to be used to meet energy demands let me repeat again this policy will result in reduced carbon emissions the second component of the legislation that I want to make clear is that this policy will result in reducing co2 concentrations that are already in the atmosphere think about it if all man-made co2 emissions were somehow miraculously stopped what do we do about the 411 parts per million of co2 already in the atmosphere the answer is trees unequivocally the most pragmatic proactive economical and large-scale solution to reducing atmospheric carbon levels is sustainable forestry and I respectfully ask anyone to offer a better solution in every tree miraculous science is constantly taking place every second of every day quadrillions of sub cell organelles called chloroplasts are at work in a single tree doing what they do best combining water sunlight and carbon dioxide to make carbon rich plant food while releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere that carbon stays in the tree even after it's cut down and turned into buildings furniture and a whole host of other products in fact 40 to 50 percent of the dry weight of wood is carbon 40 to 50 percent of this Dyess by weight is carbon why one trillion trees one trillion is a big number even for the planet but we already point where we need a bold goal to focus our efforts on being the best stewards of our environment and America has a history of leading the world in bold endeavors the trillion trees act acknowledges this bold goal and commits the United States to doing our part the trillion trees act however is not only about planting more trees it's bad policy to simply plant trees and walk away hence the trillion trees act is all about management of our forest keeping existing forest land in forest and managing these forests were practical to improve resiliency and growth the trillion trees Act also recognizes that the planet has limited growing space for forests by contrast there is no limit to how much carbon forest can pull from the atmosphere if we consider not just the trees that are growing but also the wood products that these trees can create sustainable wood products manufacturing transfers carbon stored in the forest to the wood products and therein uses resulting in a sustainable increased in carbon stores year after year in turn harvested wood make space for new trees restarting the cycle of sequestration the United Nations projects 2.3 billion new urban dwellers by 2050 by employing bio-based materials technologies and construction assemblies with high carbon storage capacity and low embodied carbon emissions we can create a durable human-made global carbon pool while simultaneously reducing co2 emissions associated with building sector activities mr. Chairman I would like to also submit this paper from Nature sustainability titled buildings as a global carbon sink every American can support planting a tree if we can connect that action with sustainability and carbon storage we are one big step closer to solving a complex problem mr. Chairman I thank you for allowing me to highlight such a practical piece of legislation and I look forward to answering any questions from your other members of the committee and I urge swift adoption of this legislation

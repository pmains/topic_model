we'll start this segment by getting an update on flooding in the Midwest by talking with to legislators during the time of this program in this half-hour joining us on the phone right now representative adrian smith republican of nebraska serves the third district good morning sir good morning thank you for having me remind our viewers the areas that are most affected as of today of the flooding that's going on in nebraska well it's the most vast a disaster I think Nebraska has ever seen it's not just one waterway it's not just one watershed it's not just the Missouri River it's multiple waterways across central and eastern Nebraska was hit with a blizzard right about the same time so I represent 75 counties and across the state we have 93 counties 74 of our 93 counties have declared disaster at the local level when it comes then to the damage done what's the extent of that to date and also what about injuries of this or loss of life have you seen those there has been loss of life there still and I think there have been two deaths and a couple others are still missing the damage is varied there was a dam that broke up in northern Nebraska and the Spencer dam and that caused a lot of damage obviously forced some communities to evacuate washed out bridges and roads not only on that waterway on the Niobrara River but other other waterways have caused a lot of damage as well and also that the ice and that was on top of of these rivers and once the water levels came up and washed the chunks of ice downstream and those chunks of ice caused a great deal of damage as well the hill and other publications saying that Nebraska lawmakers are making an appeal to the Trump administration for relief or help with this what's your appeal who have you talked to well starting at the local level in emergency managers getting things lined up there for the request to the governor and then the governor requesting to the president and certainly the our nebraska delegation is fully behind that i know that there's some other pending disaster payments that await some action and i'm hoping that we can address all of these at once now you sent out a tweet saying that you had a conversation with the vice president on this issue that is correct or a grateful for his visit okay you know see from one end to the other but he did see a very accurate view of the devastation around the Omaha area Council Bluffs Iowa and so this the loss of livestock for example on the value of the loss of livestock is preliminary about 450 million dollars worth and add to that another 400 plus million in terms of infrastructure damages that the governor is is hiding and so there's there's a long recovery and to take place have you or any of the Nebraska legislators heard directly from the president I've been in touch with with the administration I know that the president has responded to the governor and I know that communication I think has been fairly good and so in the next couple of days what are you watching out for it's the extent of what's going on and what else could come because of this flooding well they you know we want to make sure that these dollars end up where they need to go we want to be reasonable in the requests and so you know it's still even though some of these roads that that are damaged to uneven paved they're still vital to many of these rural communities and those will require some funds to repair those it's just it it's so vast that the the local responders I'm very impressed with with what they have already done but also I think maintaining good communication moving forward and to make sure that the federal dollars hopefully that we are able to secure will end up where they need to go representative adrian smith who serves the third District of Nebraska Republican from that state we thank you for your time

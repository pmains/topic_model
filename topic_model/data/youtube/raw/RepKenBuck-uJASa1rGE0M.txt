in America there are multiple lawsuits alleging the social media platforms such as YouTube Instagram Snapchat and Tick Tock are addictive defective inherently dangerous and therefore the companies are legally liable for the harm and the damages there's a suit by a public school district in Seattle in a suit in California there are other suits challenging the way social media companies Target their customers with information and police information on their sites Ken Buck is a former Federal prosecutor a former state district attorney and a current member of Congress who has developed an interest and an expertise in social media and big Tech and he joins us now welcome to you Congressman Buck I guess the counter argument is technology as is agnostic or benign but how we use it determines whether it's for good or bad I mean which are which side of the argument do you fall on as it relates to social media and big Tech well clearly Trey big Tech has developed techniques to hook young people on social media they understand that when young people see positive images they get a hit of dopamine and it brings them back over and over and over again and the the consequences that we saw with Instagram some of the reports that meta produced were really stunning that uh the these young girls had body shaming issues and depression and even higher suicide rates and what what meta did what Instagram did was they doubled down and they went for an even younger group of of uh uh girls and it's it's it's disturbing and and I hope to see this lawsuit and this Theory uh successful it's certainly the same theory that uh was used against the tobacco companies uh earlier and uh it's a product liability Theory I think that it may very well be successful in in Seattle and you know congresswoman that is exactly what was going through my mind when you were describing it that this is big tobacco this is this is what this country went through with nicotine and as we know I mean alcohol and some prescription pills and tobacco are are regulated so do you see Congress stepping in I mean I think you have to be what 18 or 21 I don't know how old you have to be to buy cigarettes but you got to be a certain age I mean there would be Mutiny if you said you got to be a certain age to use these social media platforms so what what do you see congress's role is or as well I think Trey I think what we need to do is we need to create competition when parents see the harmful effects of Instagram on their kids and there's an alternative or five Alternatives and those Alternatives involve uh images that are only from the shoulders up or non-images and it's safer for kids I think parents and kids will make that kind of decision together when we only have one uh one company occupying a space and of course now Tick Tock is competing with Instagram but for a long time it was just Instagram uh that you you had no alternative and and consumers didn't have a choice all right Congressman in addition to a distinguished career as a prosecutor and you're currently on the Judiciary Committee you also an author in the subtitle I want to get this right Big Tex war on Free Speech I mean you are not a guy prone to hyperbole you're actually pretty understated war is a big word what do you mean by that well uh Trey we know that the Biden Administration has contacted social media companies and asked them to take people off of social media because they disagreed with the Biden administration's narrative on vaccines or masks or some other issue we know that the these companies have actually discriminated took Clarence Thomas's uh video off of of YouTube during the uh Black History Month we know that they are doing uh they're suppressing positive stories on Republican members of Congress and and presidential candidates and that's a war in my mind when you control the flow of information in the Democracy you control elections and that's scary and I think the American public needs to know and needs to make sure that they support efforts again to create competition and to make sure that we don't allow a few companies to control the flow of information in this country we got about a minute left you're on Judiciary I assume you're going to be on the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over this what do you imagine the role for the Judiciary Committee in the house to be in terms of getting Witnesses and documents that you need got about a minute well uh We've we've for the last three and a half years we have investigated we've proposed different bills and the Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer have made sure that those bills didn't get to the floor I'm hoping that Kevin McCarthy as Speaker brings bills to the floor we get a vote on those bills and we force the Senate to vote President Biden says he's in favor let's see if he'll sign him Ken Buck we will be watching you uh on the on the house Judiciary Committee put your prosecutorial skills to good use thank you for joining us on a Sunday night

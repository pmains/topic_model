hi I'm congresswoman Marcia fudge I am pleased to participate by video in today's my brothers keepers events there are many issues facing our nation's youth some are particularly challenging for young men of color as it relates to education black and Latino boys are less likely to graduate and more likely to be suspended young men of color also have higher unemployment and incarceration rates leading to poor economic outcomes my brother's keeper was created to address these and other pervasive problems based on positive community support and mentorship the program aims to help young men of color succeed my brother's keeper gives young men a different outlook on life and opens doors of opportunity for their families I strongly support my brother's keeper and look forward to its implementation in our region we must do all we can to improve the lives of our youth thank you for being here enjoy the rest of the program

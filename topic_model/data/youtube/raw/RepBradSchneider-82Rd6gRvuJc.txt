Mr. Speaker,
I rise today in support of the Conrad 30 Waiver program, set to expire at the end of this
week. This program helps match medically-underserved
communities, both rural and urban, with much needed doctors. Currently, foreign medical students studying
here using a J-1 visa must return to their home country and wait two years before they
can apply to work here in the U.S. This makes no sense! The American medical education system attracts
the best and the brightest, and produces the best-trained medical graduates in the world. When so many of our communities are struggling
to attract medical professionals, we should be creating incentives for these newly trained
doctors to stay. Through the Conrad 30 program a limited number
of new physicians can stay if they commit to work three years in an underserved community. Continuing the Conrad 30 visa waiver program
is a commonsense step toward helping underserved Americans. Iâ€™m proud to introduce H.R. 2141 with Congressman
Issa of California to extend and expand this program, and I urge my colleagues to join
us.

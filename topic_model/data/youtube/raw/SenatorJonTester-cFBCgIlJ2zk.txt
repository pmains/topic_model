Thank You mr. chairman senator from Montana I want to thank Senator Isakson for his words I want to thank the chairman of today's Senate currently sitting in the chair for his work on the Veterans Affairs Committee I want to talk a little bit about Chairman Isakson before I talk about the Care Act over the last year I've been able to work with a great man from Georgia who has done great work you know when we started out we talked about doing stuff we could agree upon and set the stuff I disagree on apart and it's ended up where we've agreed on a lot of stuff and we've been able to get a lot of stuff done and and I would just say in a body that is full of impasse over this last year chairman Isakson has been a great guy to work with because the fact of the matter is is that we have set aside the political labels and we have worked for our veterans in that committee and not only Johnnie and myself but members of both sides of the aisle in that committee have worked so very very well together and communicated so very very well to make sure that we could take care of the needs of our veterans across this count through whether was in rural America where there was nerve in America but our work is not done the Care Act that chairman Isakson talked about is a very important piece of legislation it's a bipartisan compromise it's a bill that we all negotiate on so not everybody got everything and there's always things in it that you wish would be better regardless of where you're at in the spectrum but this program does a lot of good things for our veterans it first of all will eliminate the veterans Choice Program which to know it and replace it with one that is much more easier for our veterans to navigate in a system that puts in place where the veterans can seek his care and it puts that system in the hands of the veteran and the doctor now this is a bill that has the passed out of committee 14 to 1 and it has 26 veteran's service organization presenting millions of Americans many millions of veterans I should say that have endorsed this bill it's a good bill I wish the Veterans Administration who we worked so close with on this bill would come out and forcefully endorse it I think that would help a lot but what it does is it established a veteran community care program it merges 7'v a community care programs into one program with one set of rules for both providers and the veterans it puts a decision of where to seek care in the hands of the veteran and their doctor no more one-size-fits-all eligibility if a local VA doesn't have the equipment for a certain test and there is another VA locally that can provide that test of that can go to the community doc if the roads to another VA facility are closed for snow veterans can go to their local doctor rather than waiting for the roads to clear which is a big issue in rural America if a nearby VA clinic has a type of doc a vet needs to see but there's a community doc closer and the vet has a bad back that vet can see that doc in that community as an example it offers convenient walk in care so vets can get care closer to home for minor illnesses third-party administrators a.k the govern government contractors will have a smaller role at the local level and the local VA will have the flexibility I went to use them for scheduling so what makes most sense for the local VA won't be decided by bureaucrats in Washington the second thing it does is improves accountability and transparency of VA spending it requires the VA to give Congress more notice when funding levels for programs that impact veterans are running low it forces the VA to put together a businesslike plan about how it's going to spend taxpayer dollars and it gives Congress more visibility into VA contracts it requires accountability at the Medical Center regional and the federal level if the clinic isn't brought back up to snuff we know who has failed to do their job I could give you a timeline on what's going on in the last three years with the choice program and not having enough having more than enough money not having enough money that will end when we pass this bill Congress will be able to have the oversight over the over the community care program that it needs they will give long-term certainty to our veterans because a lack of long-term certainty is devastating to those veterans and it will give those of us who have served as the consistency and the certainty that they need no more band-aids we need a cure third thing it does is it improves VA resources in health care veterans tell me time and time again once they get through the door they love the care that the VA gives them I've been told by a number of veterans that VA has saved their life the problem has always been getting through the door and the biggest reason for those delays to get through that door is workforce shortages so our bill incentivizes medical staff to work in rural and underserved areas and tribal VA facilities deploys more mobile teams to provide additional care it removes the veterans for removes the barriers for veterans to access telemedicine including mental health care closer to home and it brings more nurses and heart-lung specialists to work at the VA and clinical staff to work at vet centers the answer to the VA is not privatization it is to build the VA and use the private sector to fill in the gaps that the VA cannot provide that's what this bill does it also expands the VA Caregiver program to veterans of all eras and their caregivers right now the VA Caregiver program only applies to post 9-11 veterans well we've got a whole lot of veterans especially the folks from the Vietnam War that are getting a lot older than this caregiver program expansion to the veterans before 9/11 are is absolutely critical so the bottom line is this we've worked well on the committee we've put out a good bill we put out a bill that works for the taxpayer and most importantly for the veterans and this bill is a long-term solution we don't need another band-aid fix the care act is that long-term solution it provides the VA the needs it needs to hire staff for top-notch care it provides an internet in an integrated network of community providers to fill in the gaps for that care and it is a balance between those two and the veterans with the VSOs are on board they were part of the discussion on this bill the VA we talked to extensively to make sure this bill would work for the VA and they agreed as I said earlier I would love to have the VA come out forcefully for this bill I think would help get it passed in this body one thing in closing we're gonna pass a temporary stopgap measure for our budget and VA choice funding will be a part of it probably I will tell you that this is the last band-aid that I'm willing to put on the choice program we need a long-term solution and if we don't get that long-term solution we're not doing right by our veterans in this country with that mr. Chairman I would just say one more time thank you to chairman Isaacson for his leadership and his good work on the VA committee and when we come back here in 2018 hopefully we can get this bill passed early in the session because it's the right thing to do for our veterans I yield the floor

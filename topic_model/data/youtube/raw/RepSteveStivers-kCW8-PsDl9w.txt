[Music] today and everyday I'm thankful for our law enforcement officers across this country these men and women are dedicated public servants who protect and serve us and as a congressman I'm committed to making sure that our law enforcement officers have the resources they need and that's why I support the Byrne Jack grants that get many police departments in municipalities and other areas the resources they need to help do their job I appreciate our law enforcement folks and I'll continue to work hard to ensure they have the resources that they need to succeed in protecting and defending us so to all our law enforcement folks happy law enforcement appreciation day you

well thank you for being here I want to thank Congressman Newhouse congressman carbajal and Congressman valadeo for being here today the leaders from United Farm Workers including my friends Arturo Rodriguez and Teresa Romero Chuck Connor from the National Council of farm cooperatives and Rebecca she from the American Business immigration Council we are all here this morning with a simple message next week is our last best opportunity to address the labor crisis in American Agriculture and I would say maybe our last best chance to save Family Farms in this country and all of us have come together around a targeted Common Sense proposal to do just that our proposal responds to three urgent and related challenges first America's farmers and ranchers don't have enough workers that's what I heard from Robert zakata a vegetable farmer in bright in Colorado when Robert visited my office he handed me Flyers to advertising his farm equipment and I asked Robert why are you selling your equipment why are you selling your implements and he said it was because he didn't have enough labor to harvest the crops today they don't even grow vegetables anymore at cicada Farms only row crops I hear stories like that all across Colorado and I've heard them for the last decade and everybody here knows why that's happening if you look at uh which chart we have since 2012 the cost of farm labor has gone up nearly 50 percent much more than other workers in the economy and if we don't give uh Growers certainty we're going to see a lot of them go out of business entirely at the same time we have hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers living in the shadows in this economy and these are people who are working every single day to feed the American people we wouldn't have an agriculture economy if it weren't for these people that are living in the shadows people like Lulu Guerrero who lives in Weld County Colorado she gets up at 3 A.M every morning to plant watermelons onions tomatoes and pumpkins she's been doing that for 20 years without status without protections with no legal recourse if someone takes advantage of her the status quo is terrible for workers and it's terrible for Growers and it's terrible for families who have seen their grocery bills shoot up as you can see in the past year grocery prices are up almost 12 percent faster than any time in the last 40 years apples that are up 7.4 percent milk almost 15 percent potatoes 16 percent eggs 49 and you can draw a straight line from these higher prices and the crisis of farm labor and we're here because nobody up here and the people that we represent back home can accept the status quo and we have a plan to fix it the affordable and secure food act our proposal Builds on the legislation that our colleagues in the house passed last year I congratulate them for the strong bipartisan vote they had on a really significant piece of legislation and the newer version that that we've been working on with the people behind me increases the number of h2a visas and opens the program up to year-round jobs for the first time ever it creates wage certainty for Farmers to protect them from harmful swings and labor costs under this plan Farmers would save 23 billion dollars over the next 12 years and over 2 billion dollars more in this in the version that we're here to talk about today than in the house version it creates a mandatory e-verify system for Farm Workers Nationwide and finally it establishes legal protections and a pathway for undocumented workers to apply for a green card after they've worked in agriculture in this country for 10 years that's not amnesty that's a recognition that anybody who spent decades working to feed America should have the opportunity to apply for lawful status this plan is broadly supported by Farmers by labor by immigration Advocates and business there's no reason that we shouldn't get this done and we all know what's going to happen if we don't more farmers and ranchers are going to go out of business more Farm Workers will remain in the shadows living with fear and uncertainty in the country they feed every single day with the sweat of their labor and more families will have to make impossible choices between groceries and the rent medicine or school supplies for their kids if Congress can't get this done it would not only be a massive missed opportunity but a dereliction of our duty to the American people to the rural economy in this country through into agriculture we have to get this done so I'm going to stop there and turn it over to Congressman Newhouse from Washington State who led the effort in the house and unlike most people in this chamber actually is a farmer and therefore knows what he's talking about congressman thank you at least about some things but thank you very much for that introduction Senator let me just say thank you for all of your work to get us to this point today uh you bring the tremendous leader in the Senate so as you know I I I'm a member of Congress absolutely but more importantly I'm a farmer from Central Washington and so the issues that we're talking about here I actually live on a daily basis and so do my neighbors and so do my constituents you know we're here as you know because for years the agricultural industry in our country has been struggling due to a lack of Labor and now coincidentally Americans are paying the highest food prices that they've paid almost ever partly you know all the inputs are going up every input you can think of is getting scarcer and more expensive and one of those important inputs is the human input of Labor it it truly is not something that should be so difficult it's not rocket science to figure out how we can have an adequate labor force that's legal without that you know what's going to happen our crops will go unharvested and are already very delicate food supply chain will be placed at further risk that's why I and many of my colleagues in the house Republican and Democrat introduced the farm Workforce modernization act and let me just correct the senator it was passed twice in the house two different congresses to address these labor shortages and Ensure that we not only have a reliable Workforce but a legal Workforce which is as you just heard it's it's better for the workers better for the farmers and it's better for our country and by ensuring that we can ensure that we have a food supply we can secure that food supply we can strengthen our national security because it truly is a national security issue we can reduce food costs which as I just said are up dramatically and we can raise wages reduce unemployment not just for Farm Workers but for all Americans who are involved in creating value-added Upstream American Products so today the Senate will introduce a version of our bill which we're very excited about that we thank them very much for their hard work for and you don't have to print this for finally getting to this point because their title is adequately and accurately named because it is that's what this is about if our formers don't have the labor they need to get the job done then we will not have grocery grocery store shelves that have the options for us to purchase when we're when we're in the midst of a labor crisis let me ask a rhetorical rhetorical question why would we not pass labor reform when the when we're in the midst of a food crisis why would we not Implement changes to keep Americans fed and when we're in the midst of an inflationary crisis like we are why would we wait to lower fruit food and production costs that Americans are desperate for so I think and I've said this many many times it's past time for us to deliver Solutions and quit giving Americans empty promises not only to American citizens but to our Farmers or ranchers and most importantly our Farm Workers so let's stop stop waiting start acting and I'm just very happy that we are at this point today we need to reform our broken immigration laws and this is a huge step and ensure that those who wish to pursue a legal pathway or come to our country to contribute to our American agricultural industry can do that legally we can protect our communities we can strengthen our national security we've been cons this is a big part of securing our Southern border which is key but also recognize the contributions of immigrants and bolster our local economies our producers and our small businesses so let's secure our food supply and ensure American families as you just heard can afford the groceries that they need to feed their families and if it's with reforms like this that we can finally do all of those things and provide a lasting solution for farms and Farm Workers so thank you very much with that I would like to introduce next on to the microphone my good friend fellow farmer from the state of California David valadeo well good morning everyone I'll be brief because both Senator Bennett and Dan Newhouse Congressman Newhouse made a lot of great Arguments for this bill as a farmer I understand the importance of this this is something obviously we've known for years it has to get resolved when we look at the border that's going on right now and I know that's a reason used by a lot to not support legislation to solve our problems but us solving some of the Visa issues some of the guest worker programs will relieve pressure on the border this is a way of us helping the situation there and coming up with common sense legislation is important and this is one that's been in the process for a period of time it's got bipartisan support but it's also got support across the industries as well our ad groups across especially my state of California do support it and Across the Nation the sodas ufw standing here behind me it's not very often you get this many groups in the same room together negotiating having conversations and solving problems and this is one of the few times we have the opportunity to do it no we're coming up on the end of the year and it's crunch time but it's important that we do this and it's important we move forward so again I want want to thank my colleagues both Senator Bennett and Congressman Newhouse for their leadership on this it's too important for us to not move forward on this so I appreciate the time now we get to introduce my friend and colleague from California Congressman salute carbajal neighboring District also a big AG district and one of the ones that we rely on for many of our wonderful fruits and vegetables across the country so thanks let me start by thanking Senator Bennett for your leadership in continuing to ring the bell and the sense of urgency I also want to thank my colleagues uh Mr Newhouse and Mr balado and representative Lofgren who in the house not once but as Mr Newhouse said twice have moved the farm Workforce modernization act which is the foundation of the legislation that we're considering now uh I have a unique perspective the number one industry in my district is agriculture I understand the needs and the challenges especially the neighbor the labor needs the water all the issues that our farmers face every day because I represented them in local government and now in Congress I also have the distinction of being the son of a farm worker I joined my father many of Summers working in the fields different Commodities strawberries tomatoes cucumbers onions I know what it's like working in the fields this is an important piece of legislation it's been bipartisan in the house we see it coming together in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate it's imperative we move it forward to both allow those that live in the shadows that are providing extraordinary essential work as we now have come to understand even better in light of the pandemic essential work but yet we haven't been able to do the essential work to recognize their labor and their work and their toil and their sacrifice we're at a time where many of our fields are going unharvested it's known that we have these challenges food Security in the United States is National Security but yet we have failed time and time again this is an opportunity to bring Justice to our farmers for our Farm Workers and for all those families during this inflationary period that are having a challenging time to put groceries on the table where I come from we call ourselves the salad bowl of the country if not the world and we want to continue doing that and doing it productively and with the help of our Farm Workers so with that I just want to recognize you uh Senator Bennett all the stakeholders the United Farm Workers the Western Growers the California Farm Bureau others that have come together in an extraordinary way to ring the bell and say we need to get this done now we're at the end of an extraordinary opportunity that we have and we can succeed if we just put politics aside and focus of what's in the best interest of our country thank you very much I'm supposed to introduce someone else I had a speech but I thought I'd go without a speed and now I wanna they call boats and we gotta go but let me introduce Chuck Connor with the National Council for food court cooperatives thank you very much they called votes all right well Senator Bennett thank you um for the opportunity to participate in this important press conference and thank you so much for your leadership on bringing us to this point in the Senate American agriculture ladies and gentlemen is being threatened to its very core by labor shortages and skyrocketing labor costs you simply cannot today call yourself a friend of the American Farmer and not be involved in fixing this problem the legislation being proposed by Senator Bennett is a compromise but it represents a huge win for American agriculture with real and tangible help to the farmer Rancher and grower it should be passed immediately some say there will be opportunities to deal with ag immigration and labor issues in the next Congress or perhaps at a later time this is wrong a sharply divided Congress in the years ahead will not have the appetite to deal with this issue no one from either side of the political aisle disagrees on this on the solution to this problem or perhaps I should say virtually no one why wait ladies and gentlemen do not delay the help for American agriculture act now to support us thank you and I'm going to now introduce Theresa Romero head of the United Farm Workers Union and certainly our partner in coming to this compromise thank you thank you uh thank you Chad good morning and thank you all for being here today I want to particularly thank Senator Bennett for his leadership the United Farm Workers welcomes the introduction of this legislation it urges everyone on the hill who cares about Farm Workers to work as hard as Farm Workers and turn it into law these bipartisan compromise strengthens America's food security while honoring and rewarding the contributions of the Farm Workers who have already been living and working here for decades Farm Workers have made enormous concessions in this legislation in order to get to this point this legislation creates a temporary renewable legal status for Farm Workers who are already here in this short term with the opportunity an option to earn permanent legal status several years into the future this is the very least we owe the hard-working men and women who break their backs every day to put food on our tables in return this legislation includes some very difficult Provisions for us Provisions that have we have opposed in the past and that we will continue to oppose should there be any attempt to move them separately but we're here to say we are prepared to see this legislation through because it is the status quo of fear and exploitation that is the most intolerable for Farm Workers every day Farm Workers endure while liking the basic rights to know they will still be able to stay with their families tomorrow is a Day Too Late what we're proposing here should not be this complicated it's it is a simple provision if you work to feed America you deserve the right to stay in America this is a moment for action Farm Workers expect nothing less now please allow me a moment to address workers directly hello Communications perfecta Center is a sin miedo significance families is parallelogram thank you and um let me introduce now Arturo Rodriguez United Farm Workers president emeritus thank you very much Teresa United Farm Workers president current president it's an honor to be back here advocating for farmworkers here in Washington yet again when the pandemic hit farmworkers were told they were essential while the rest of us got to stay home farmworkers kept going to work you can't pick a potato over Zoom farmworkers put themselves and their families at risk to keep America fed and when Farm Workers did their work during the pandemic they didn't ask if the food they were harvesting was going to be eaten by a Democrat or Republican they just went to work now it's time for Democrats and Republicans alike to go to work for them Representatives Dan Newhouse Zola Lofgren salute Carvajal Mike Simpson they've done their work Senator Bennett has done his work what we need is some Republican Senators now to do the work necessary to make this Bill possible listen to the stories it is now is the time many of us have been at this for a long time Chuck right 22 years trying to get this legislation passed and I can say this is the closest we've ever been so let's truly make this a season of celebration for everyone and ensure the passage of this legislation Carlos Herrera Fabian will be our next speaker he comes from the state of Florida and he's also a member of the United Farm Workers Foundation Carlos good morning my name is Carlos Herrera Fabian I'm currently a student at Michigan State University I am the son of Farm Workers and the grandson of Farm Workers I have worked in the farm field since the age of seven and all has worked in the fields for 15 years my father for 10 years and my grandfather for nearly 50 years growing up we migrated all along the east coast migrating between Delaware Maine North Carolina and Florida we picked cucumbers sweet potatoes peanuts cotton tobacco corn apples peaches asparagus tomato Chili Peppers watermelons oranges blueberries and even mandarins we have contributed contributed to the economy and food security of this nation life is an undocumented farmworker often means being threatened silenced and often exploited under the work conditions and which Farm Workers face as a son of Farm Workers I saw my parents break their skin their backs and mental health to give me and my siblings the bare necessities all while making below average pay in Florida we picked oranges because of my mother's legal status at the time she couldn't um be eligible for child care programs as a result of that my mom took me into the fields at just the age of a toddler laying me under the orange trees that she picked the oranges in the hot Florida Summers by the time I was 12 I spent all day clearing weeds under the orange trees with just the machete squatting from sunrise to sunset with the temperatures reaching easily over 100 degrees in Maine we picked apples my mom is about five feet tall weighing no more than 100 pounds climbing those 12 foot ladders carrying 50 to 60 pounds of apples on her shoulders the top her body weight also she could sacrifice her long-term Health just to give us her children the bare necessities not only did my parents sacrifice a lot for me but also for this nation we are the reason why people have food on their tables and food and grocery store grocery store shelves it's not fair to get treated without dignity all we want is legalization so we no longer have to live in the shadows and have that fear instilled in us that's why I ask and urge you all to prioritize the legalization of Farm Workers thank you and now I will introduce my colleague Maricela Martinez Juarez who is a Georgian a farm worker from Georgia and as well I will also introduce Brian Pantoja Asana Farm Workers who will be translating thank you okay uh good morning good morning my name is Brian thank you Carlos for introducing us um uh I'm a fellow Georgian here with Maricela and I will be translating for her I am a child of Farm Workers and I have been a farm worker myself buenos dias my name is good morning my name is Marisela Juarez I'm here from the state of Georgia I have worked in agriculture in Georgia for 15 years I have harvested oranges Tomatoes broccoli cabbage grapefruit strawberries peas and potatoes and various fruits and vegetables el dia our job is very difficult we work early mornings to late at night and we leave our children all day it is we come home very tired and all our all our children want to do is hug us but at times we have to say no because we are covered in dirt mud and pesticides Hermosa even though our job is hard I love doing it I love seeing the green of our vegetables breathing in the fresh air and seeing our product grow and seeing the plant um go seeing the fruit grow from our plants is we know that we are feeding millions of people even though we don't know them it's a way that we feel connected with them go if you happen to eat anything today it's thanks to farmworkers this is why I think it's just to have a legalization for Farm Workers it is very difficult to live a life as an undocumented person even if we needed to travel to a job site or even just take our kids to our school to their school we couldn't work we don't have licenses even the most simplest things we'd have to do in fear siento que is I think it's very important for new opportunities to be presented to Farm Workers for the betterment of themselves their children and this country is muchas gracias My Hope Is that this bill will become a reality so that many farmworkers like me are presented with new opportunities and we can continue to work here doing our job and living with our families thank you I will not present Rebecca she from of the executive director the executive director of the American Business immigration Council thank you thank you so much um good morning my name is Rebecca she I'm the executive director of the American Business immigration Coalition um we are a bipartisan Council of 1200 employers across the country really sorry you can do it um a big action fully endorses Senator Bennett's Bill and we're so grateful to your leadership and we're grateful to Congressman Newhouse and Simpson's Valiant efforts in the house um our employers one of our employers yesterday he's a farmer from Kansas homie I need this bill because I have 20 workers and this bill will save me 42 000 uh 108 dollars next year I can keep my Farm open and this will also mean a Lifeline for my workers I trust my workers sometimes more than my children and they I gave my keys to my workers when I'm on vacation so they can also take care of my house um I have one worker that has been picking crops and taking care of my life stuff for the last 20 years and she hasn't gone home to see her family and I like her to do that before she dies um in addition to these numbers that you see here um the net worth of American households took a nine percent dip for the third consecutive quarter hit by Rising inflation and out of control food prices there is a reason why the average American is angry at Congress this bill Senator Bennett's Bill Cuts inflation protects U.S food security gives Farmers the workers they need controls their costs and Farm Workers legal status as well as a down payment on border security a senator Bennett has put forward a solution that the Senate should have the courage to pass thank you oh it is my pleasure to introduce the CEO of U.S Apple Jim there thank you very much and good morning I'm Jim bear I'm the president CEO of U.S Apple Association thank you all for being here U.S Apple industry we Harvest 25 billion apples a year in the United States and every one of those apples has to be hand-picked there are no robots to do that every one of those 25 billion apples is hand-picked more than weather or markets the number one issue in our industry is the lack of people to harvest those 25 billion apples I meet with family Farmers almost every day who tell me that they had to leave apples on the tree to rot because they couldn't get enough people to pick them that's offensive to me I think it's offensive to anybody that cares about hunger and adequate food supply in this country I grew up on a farm and my dad used to say don't make any excuses don't tell me what you can't do show me what you can do and thanks to the leadership of of Senator Bennett who refused to take an excuse and uh and look the other way thanks to him and to the gentleman who spoke earlier from the House of Representatives uh they're showing us what they can do uh we have a bill in the house we now have a bill in the Senate and the only thing left is for Mr Bennett's colleagues to come together and show us what they can do so I want to say thank you to the senator and appreciate his very hard work and Leadership on this thank you you can't I think I speak for Jim when I say you can't pick an apple on this room either is there anybody else for a week is that a lot of people enjoy it now thank you that's true oh sorry yeah thank you I apologize uh I'm cam Quarles I'm the chief executive officer of the National Potato Council I can thank you Arturo I can confirm that you cannot pick up Potato by by Zoom um just potatoes one of the most widely produced vegetables in the United States we have production in Senator Bennett's uh State uh in Mr valadeo's District Mr new House's District across the United States and the single thing that we hear from producers in every single one of those growing areas is concerns about access to the most valuable piece of their business which is their is their workers I think Senator Bennett has created a path here where we can finally get to that solution that has been so elusive for so many of the US who have worked so hard for getting on two decades now to to finally come to some type of resolution of what is a growing crisis in U.S agriculture we're simply asking the leadership on both sides of the aisle provide the opportunity the window to move something forward in this Congress that can finally get to the president's desk and start providing relief to to all of the incredibly valuable Farm Workers as well as their employers across the United States the time is is really now so thank you Senator thanks um

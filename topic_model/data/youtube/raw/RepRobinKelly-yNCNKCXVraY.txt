E GENTLEWOMAN FROM ILLINOIS, MS. KELLY, FOR FIVE MINUTES. MS. KELLY: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT WHICH INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE FIGHT FOR HEALTH EQUITY. AS SHARE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS HEALTH BRAIN TRUST, I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT FOR CENTURIES BLACK AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND LEFT BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HEALTH CARE POLICIES. NO MORE. HEALTH CARE ACCESS IS AN ESSENTIAL RIGHT AND WE MUST DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS, REGARDLESS OF RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOME, OR ZIP CODE HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. I AM PROUD THAT I DRAFTED THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT TAKES A STEP TOWARD THAT GOAL. WE HAVE INCLUDED SEVERAL KEY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO FOLKS. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL PREVENT CHRONIC ILLNESS LIKE HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES. ENSURE EARLIER DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF CERTAIN CANCERS. AND TACKLE THE BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH CRISIS. THERE IS SO MUCH GOOD INCLUDED IN THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT, BUT TODAY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST THREE OF THE MOST URGENT HEALTH EXWIT ISSUES THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS. THE FIRST OF THOSE PRIORITIES IS SAVING THE LIVES OF MOTHERS. THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT PROVIDES FOR A MANDATORY EXTENSION OF POSTPARTUM CARE FOR NEW MOTHERS UTILIZING MEDICAID. IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, WE INCLUDED AN OPTION FOR STATES TO EXTEND POSTPARTUM CARE FOR 12 MONTHS AFTER DELIVERY. WHILE SOME STATES HAVE TAKEN UP THAT OPTION, IT WILL EXPIRE IN FIVE YEARS. THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT GOES A STEP FURTHER IN MAKING THAT EXPANDED POSTPARTUM COVERAGE MANDATORY AND PERMANENT. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 1 SLB 3 OF ALL PREGNANCY RELATED MATERNAL DEATHS OCCUR BETWEEN ONE WEEK AND ONE YEAR OF DELIVERY. BLACK WOMEN ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF EXPERIENCING SEVERE COMPLICATIONS OR DEATH. NO MORE. NEW MOTHERS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO POSTPARTUM CARE REGARDLESS OF WHICH STATE THEY LIVE IN, EXTENDING POSTPARTUM CARE UNDER MEDICAID WILL SAVE LIVES, ENSURE THAT MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO SEE THEIR BABIES GROW UP. ADDITIONALLY THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT INCLUDES A SOLUTION TO PERMANENTLY CLOSE THE MEDICAID COVERAGE GAP. THERE IS STILL 12 STATES THAT HAVE REFUSED TO EXPAND MEDICAID, AND AS MANY AS FOUR MILLION PEOPLE CURRENTLY LACK ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF THE COVERAGE GAP. NO MORE. ENSURING THAT MEDICAID IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDS IT WILL REDUCE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, ALLOW FOR AN INCREASED FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE CARE, AND SAVE US MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. . CLOSING THE GAP WILL HELP AND BECAUSE OF IT MANY WOMEN ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CARE BEFORE THEY BECOME PREGNANT AND BY THE TIME THEY GET APPROVED HAVE MISSED MONTHS AND WEEKS OF PRENATAL CARE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF PREGNANCY. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF PREGNANCY ARE CRUCIAL IN PROTECTING AND TREATING PREGNANCY RELATED COMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH MOTHER AND BABY, CLOSING THE COVERAGE GAP WILL ENSURE NEW MOTHERS HAVE ACCESS TO CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. WITH THE BILL BACK BETTER WE'RE TACKLING HEALTH EQUITY ISSUES FROM BABIES TO OLDER ADULTS. ONCE WE PASS THE BILL BACK BETTER ACT WE'LL BEGIN INCLUDES DENTAL, VISION AND HEARING COVERAGE FOR SENIORS AND MEDICAID PART B. DENTAL COVERAGE INCLUDES CLEANING AND X-RAYS, EXTRACTIONS, ORAL DISEASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AND DENTURES. ALL VITAL DENTAL PROCEDURES AND CARE THAT SENIORS BOTH NEED AND DESERVE. MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ARE IT BUT ORAL HEALTH HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON YOUR OVERALL HEALTH AND POOR ORAL HEALTH HAS BEEN LINKED TO HEART DISEASE, KIDNEY DISEASE AND DEMENTIA. INCLUDING DENTAL COVERAGE WILL HELP SO MANY PEOPLE AND IT WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO A KIZER FAMILY FOUNDATION STUDY, 71% OF BLACK MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND 65% OF HISPANIC BENEFICIARIES WENT WITHOUT A DENTAL CHRIS ANYTIME THE PAST YEAR COMPARED TO 43% OF WHITES BENEFICIARIES, NO MORE. ULTIMATELY THESE POLICIES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SAVING LIVES BUT IMPROVING LIVES. WE ARE INVESTING IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE LONG, HAPPY, AND HEALTHY LIVES WITH THEIR FAMILIES. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS BEEN PUSHED TO ITS LIMITS THROUGHOUT THE PAST 18 MONTHS AND WE HAVE BEEN SHOWN UNDER BRIGHT LIGHT THE CRACKS IN ITS FOUNDATION. BUT IT'S NOT BEYOND REPAIR. MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT, WE CAN REBUILD OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE AND ADDRESSES CENTURIES LONG CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY. THE BILL BACK BETTER ACT PRESENTS A ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ADVANCE HEALTH E

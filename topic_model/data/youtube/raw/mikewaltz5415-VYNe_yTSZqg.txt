33 billion dollars in aid for ukraine congressman mike waltz joins us the president has tied aid to ukraine with extra covet spending what's going on here yes dude that's that's a political gimmick uh and it's shameful and i certainly won't support it we that we have been flooded as you've covered on your show for for you know over a year now we've been flooded with coveted many of it as being much of it is being abused there was a trillion dollars still left unspent by federal agencies when biden took office and he passed another two trillion on top of it we need to get the ukrainians the heavy weapons that they need they should have had it two months ago they should have had it before the invasion i will certainly uh support that but he can't couple this just like he did build back better in infrastructure and i think that's going to fall flat in congress how about the president saying that he's considering forgiving student loan debts by the way for giving ten thousand dollars per of debt per borrower means writing off 321 billion dollars worth of loans because i've editorialized on this i call it buying votes vote buying what so you you know it is buying votes too and it's also an insult to everyone who did the right thing and worked hard and paid off their student loan look i have a i have an 18 year old that's about to go off to college and the cost of higher education is out of control it's doubtful what you get is in return for that in terms of return on investment i don't know that every university needs a climbing wall and a whole foods in their cafeteria and this bloated faculty uh that that pumps a lot of nonsense into our into our kids uh but meanwhile we're handing 18 year olds these kind of unlimited loans uh we've removed the the democrats removed banks from the equation in terms of evaluating if you're going to get a four-year degree in basket weaving you know is that a good return on on on their loan you're going to be able to pay it back uh and this is just moral hazard and pouring more federal dollars like the progressives want to do onto this uh higher education industrial complex which is what it is yeah it's an industry at this point particularly with tenure where folks can't be held accountable is exactly the wrong answer all wrong

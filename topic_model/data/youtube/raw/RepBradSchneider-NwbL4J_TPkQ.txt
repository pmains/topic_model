a gentleman from Illinois mr. Snyder's recognized for five minutes Thank You Deputy Attorney General I believe you touched earlier on this but I want to confirm your answer do you agree with unanimous finding of the Director of National Intelligence and the 17 agencies of the intelligence community that Russia on orders of Latimer Putin actively worked to interfere in the 2016 presidential election I agree with the assessment of the intelligence community yes well this time in an October interview with the target us a podcast you stated the following quote if we have foreign countries that are seeking to interfere in our elections I think we need to take appropriate actions in response and quote I wholeheartedly agree with you unfortunately on several occasions including recently before this very committee attorney General Sessions stated that we're not where we need to be on this issue and there's no review underway by the Department on what steps it should be taking you've said that protecting the integrity of our elections a high priority you seem to indicate earlier that you have had conversations with the Attorney General and FBI director have a simple yes or no question has there been a formal review of the attacks made on the 2006 16 election and what do gene DOJ must do to protect the integrity of our 2018 elections congressman that's the second time this issue has been raised and I I did not watch all the Attorney General's testimony and I'll have to check but I believe he may have been referring to a review of legislation as opposed to review of it know if I can reclaim like I asked him very specifically what steps had been taken following the appearance on the Senate side and a question asked by senators asked if any steps had been taken to review the elections and to take steps to protect our future elections I'm asking the same question of you simple yes or no has there been a review of what Russia tried to do where any other agencies tried to do to interfere in our elections last year and what must we do to protect our elections next year I believe the answer is yes but I can get further information for you if you like if that answer is yes it has not been shared with us as of today we've had no information shared I think this is an important issue the elections are a short time away and we need to make sure they are secured have there been any specific actions taken by the Attorney General before this committee you talked about meetings or is there anything specifically you can share with us as actions to protect our elections yes the FBI has the Attorney General I met with a team of FBI experts and discussed a variety of things that they're doing some of which are classified in addition to that Homeland Security has a role to play in this too in coordination with state and local elections officials so there's a lot going on in that area I appreciate that but I think we have to expect that 2016 wasn't the first time the Russians have tried to interfere in our elections they've been interfering in elections around the world they're gonna try to interfere in our future elections there are tax are gonna become more aggressive more intensive more complicated we need to be staying a step ahead of them twice now the Attorney General Sessions first in front of the Senate and then recently in front of this committee said not enough has been done the meeting you were talking about did that happen before November or is that subsequent to mr. sessions appearance here I don't recall the date congressman I'll have me happy when we take a break to review it but I don't think there's any concern well mister session committed committed to me that the Department would brief this committee on any actions taken last month after his appearance I sent a follow-up letter asking for that briefing before the end of the year ideally before this weekend and they intended adjournment of Congress unfortunately I have not even received a response let alone a scheduling of a briefing are you willing to commit that we can have a briefing that you will update this committee on what actions are being taken to make sure our elections are secure next year if the Attorney General commits that congressman I'll make sure it happens and I will make sure we respond to your letter as I mentioned earlier we make every effort to and I'm sure it's in the queue thank you I would hope that this moves to the top of the queue that this is not a priority of a long list of items that may get to eventually I think if the confidence of the American people in our electoral process if the confidence of you American people in our democracy is damaged as the Russians clearly have tried to do in the future of the Republic is challenged we need to this is not a partisan issue it's not Republican it's not Democrat we need to make sure that people respect our elections know that their votes will be counted know that their voices will be heard I am imploring the Department of Justice to work with this committee to work with Congress to make sure that the American people can be confident in the future of our elections I don't think accounting you to work with us absolutely and I want to be absolutely clear that is near the top of the list for us and I know it is for the Attorney General as well thank you I look forward to hearing back on our letter from last month I yield back

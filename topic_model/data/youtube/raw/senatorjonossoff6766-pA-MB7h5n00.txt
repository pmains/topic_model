hey y'all john ossoff thank you again for joining us on the road this week today has been an outstanding day we began in augusta where we inspected the georgia cyber center led by officials from augusta university this amazing facility which is growing is providing a home for tech companies as well as publicly funded research and development we then went to craig howden elementary school where the georgia department of public health is administering vaccines on a drive up basis we left augusta went on to macon where we visited with the leadership of macon bibb county schools at heritage elementary school and i announced that through the american rescue plan macon bibb county schools are going to receive 106 million dollars in direct economic support this year we then left macon and proceeded to albany we're at albany area primary health care our community health center i announced 8.8 million dollars coming to that facility that's just part of 21 million dollars going to community health centers across southwest georgia if you're wondering what community health centers do they provide health care services to everybody regardless of wealth medicaid recipients as well as discounted health care services to folks who have difficulty paying and senator warnock and i fought hard to make sure that georgia's community health centers are fully supported by the american rescue plan thanks so much

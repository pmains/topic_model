u.s congressman jim hines a democrat for connecticut he's on the permanent select committee on intelligence congressman heinz i've been reading your stuff reading your quotes you voted no today why i did well uh chris two big things one uh we just gave up our leverage on constitution day to do something the constitution demands that we do which is to authorize this kind of activity now we're off to war without a congressional authorization and that's not a good thing number two chris it's bad enough to be on one side of a civil war we're now on two sides of the same civil war with a group of people that will be arming and training that we do not control we won't really know who they are and we really won't predict the outcome until we're underway and we are getting uh in all likelihood blamed for the activities uh that will that this group will undertake when we train and arm these people we think are going to be fighting isis they could be fighting assad they could be fighting through al-nusra us how do we know what kind of guarantees do you hear we're getting that the arms and the training we give to this group in syria will be used against isis and not against somebody we don't want them fighting well chris guarantee is not a word you use in the middle east and of course what you do is you assume and if you look at what happened in afghanistan in iraq in libya you assume that the plans that you make and what you think you're going to achieve probably aren't going to happen so yes how are we going to know that these guys and i've met some of them uh are in fact going to go after isis because we tell them to they hate assad they're going to go after assad so what do we do and i expressed this concern to the white house do we tell them that on one day they go after assad on the next day they go after another group that is also fighting assad that is fighting again both sides of civil war john mccain says that this group was formed to fight assad in damascus it was not formed to fight isis well that's uh that's true uh look these are and as i said i've met some of these uh guys and they are people who have been badly badly abused by assad now you know isis is a you know profound threat to them as they are to many people in the world but it is not clear again what their mission will be is their mission anti-assad or is their mission anti-isis and by the way if it's both do they have the capability to do two missions at once well today the president insisted the united states won't get involved military at least on the combat ground forces against isis let's watch i want to be clear the american forces that have been deployed to iraq do not and will not have a combat mission as your commander-in-chief i will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in iraq after a decade of massive ground deployments it is more effective to use our unique capabilities in support of partners on the ground so they can secure their own country's futures and that's the only solution that will succeed over the long term you know this is the strangest war in the world we're fighting a war the american people say they want us to fight but also saying our latest polling in wall street journal nbc they don't think we'll win also we're fighting a war without our army what kind of war is this where we're hoping to find the hessians out there somewhere and the hedges by the way lost to us in a war people you gotta find another army if you want to fight a war but you don't want to fight it how do you win it you're asking me that question chris yes sir look um i take the president at his word when he says he's not going to commit ground forces the reality is that the american public is not going to tolerate a major commitment of of ground forces now there will be those who say that you can't get rid of a group like this without armed without people on the ground right they will not be our people i take the president as his word but you know are we expecting the saudis uh to provide those ground forces and by the way why aren't we talking about the only way you eliminate these groups which is by doing away with the conditions that give rise to these groups political repression lack of economic uh possibilities the fact that an awful lot of our allies in the region are actually funding these groups you know until we change those things on the ground we can bomb these guys into caves but they'll still be there we can put boots on the ground as we have in afghanistan and iraq but guess what they're still in afghanistan and iraq so we got to be thinking a little deeper than just a military approach here okay thank you so much congressman jim heims for joining us today you

Madam President I want to begin my remarks the way we began this trial with the oath we each took to do impartial justice now any other day we walk into this chamber as Republicans and Democrats but in this trial we have a much greater responsibility the allegations against this president are grave the house managers presented a compelling case based on the testimony of more than a dozen witnesses and the remarkable thing about the dozen witnesses that we saw clips of all of these witnesses were either appointees political appointees of President Trump or career public servants and the fact that these dozen plus witnesses had the courage to speak truth to power when they knew that their careers their reputations would be sullied in many ways speaks volumes their testimony and the house managers case presents a clear fact pattern a fact pattern that even many of my Republican colleagues acknowledge is true this evidence reflects a corrupt scheme to solicit foreign interference in support of this president's reelection the president both unlawfully withheld aid to an ally at war with Russia and he withheld a White House meeting that would have strengthened our relationship with a democratically elected leader of Ukraine a leader that was trying to prevent further Russian occupation of his country the president used these powerful tools of American foreign policy as leverage not leverage to further advance America's national interest but leverage to secure investigations into a political opponent you also use these as an opportunity to try to expound on the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory a notion that has been repeatedly debunked by mr. Trump's own law enforcement and intelligence agency heads a theory that somehow it was Ukraine not Russia that attacked our democracy in 2016 a theory by the way that currently has been and continues to be promoted by the Russian spy services since this information came to light the president has attempted to confound the House of Representatives constitutional role in the impeachment process the White House issued a blanket refusal to provide any witnesses or documents without any historical precedent or sound legal argument to support this position for this reason President Trump is also charged with obstruction of Congress frankly I understand some of the points the president's defense team has raised concerning this second article of impeachment there are legitimate questions to consider about executive privilege and separation of powers but we cannot except the absolute immunity arguments this White House has invented this absolute stance and the evidence we've seen about the president's corrupt actions and intentions do not reflect a principled good faith defense of executive privilege rather it suggests an effort to denied Congress the constitutional authority to investigate presidential wrongdoing and ultimately to prevent exposure of the president's conduct in reviewing this evidence I've tried to stop stick to my oath of impartiality I've tried to keep an open mind about what witnesses like John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney people who were in the room with the president could tell us if anyone can provide new information that further explains the president's actions it is them but I don't see how the White House's desperate efforts to block witnesses is anything but an admission that what they'd say under oath would not be good for this president and I'm deeply disappointed the Senate could not achieve the majority necessary for a full fair trial so consequently the defense of the president that were left with is thin legalistic and frankly cynical instead of disputing the core facts which are damning on their own terms the president's lawyers have resorted to remarkable legal gymnastics the notion that even if the president did what he's accused of abuse of power is not impeachable the foreign interference is not a crime that even calling witnesses to seek the truth about the president's actions and motivations might somehow endanger the Republic and then when professor Dershowitz made his bizarre argument that abusing presidential power to aid your reelection cannot be impeachable if you believe your own election to be in the national interests I play close attention frankly closer attention to what Professor which said in this chamber then I paid when I was in his class back in 1977 but you don't need a loss Harvard Law School degree to understand what utter nonsense that argument is and where it could take us if we followed it to a logical conclusion the framers wrote impeachment into the Constitution precisely because they were worried about the abuse of presidential power and if an abuse of power is what the framers had in mind when they crafted impeachment then the two questions remaining in our deliberations are simple did President Trump abuse his power and should he be removed from office the house managers had presented a compelling case that the President did pressure Ukraine to announce politically motivated investigations again a number of my Republican colleagues have acknowledged these facts acknowledged that what the president did was wrong and frankly it's clear why he did it does anyone here honestly believe that Donald Trump wanted an investigation into the Biden's for any other reason than to damage Joe Biden politically and therefore aid in his own reelection time and again this president has shown a willingness to attack any one who stands in his way and on this he's ecumenical Republicans Democrats members of his staff members of this body nobody is off-limits there is nothing out of character about this president using every available tool to damage an opponent regardless of their political party now I don't find fault for the president in his unorthodox style that is not an impeachable offense the long list of things I disagree with this president on are not impeachable offenses either but the Constitution draws a line that is much clearer than the president's lawyers have tried to argue the president crossed it he abused his power he commandeered America's foreign policy not to advance America's interest but to advance Donald Trump's political interest and despite his efforts to cover it up he got caught now each one of us must vote guilty or not guilty I will vote to convict the president because I swore an oath to do impartial justice and the evidence proves the charges against him are true there must be consequences for abusing the power of the presidency to solicit foreign interference in our elections if the Senate fails to hold him accountable we will be setting a dangerous precedent we will be giving the green light to foreign adversaries in future presidents that this kind of behavior is okay I will vote to convict the president because it is the Senate's constitutional responsibility to uphold this bedrock American principle that no one is above the law not even the President and especially not the president thank you madam president and I yield the floor

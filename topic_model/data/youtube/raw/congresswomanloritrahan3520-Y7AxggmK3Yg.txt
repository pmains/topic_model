uh thank you chairwoman to get and chairman fallon for holding this critically important hearing uh my thanks to each of the witnesses look your steadfast leadership and dedication and combating the pandemic has been critical to our crushing the virus and a comfort to our constituents that better days are ahead for our country and for the world i so appreciate you taking the time to appear before the committee you know as a mother of six and ten-year-old daughters i'd like to continue to understand the impacts of covid on america's children although they may be less likely to experience severe symptoms from covid we shouldn't minimize the fact that many have suffered very real harm over the past 12 months and you know to no one's surprise the same covert related health disparities suffered by black and hispanic adults have also befallen children of color it was indicated earlier in this hearing that high school-aged children might be able to start getting vaccinations this fall and younger children will get vaccinated by the first quarter of 2022 in the meantime many families across the country are anxious to return to free pandemic activities and as adults line up for their vaccinations they're they're craving guidance on how to live work and socialize while we wait for our children to get vaccinated dr wolinski let me just start by saying that we are so proud back home to have you at the home of the cdc thank you for your tremendous service to all of us in massachusetts and now to our entire nation wearing these unprecedented times as as the vaccines clinical trials among children continue more adults become fully vaccinated and states begin to loosen restrictions what if parents need to know about the ongoing risk to their kids from the virus specifically is there guidance other than mask wearing and social distancing that you can give or that might evolve for vaccinated parent and grandparent interactions with children under 18 awaiting the vaccine thank you for that uh congresswoman you know our initial guidance um that what can you do when you're vaccinated um was really a first uh step into uh recognizing that in fact there are going to be relatively low risk children who want to see their vaccinated grandparents and those children are going to be unvaccinated and our guidance actually permits that as long as children don't have a high risk condition and their family members don't have a high risk condition among the things that we really need to recognize is as we want to lean into more more of our day-to-day activities school sports is a really common one to discuss that so much of how we are able to do that depends on how much disease is in the community because in fact that disease comes in from the community into the schools we have numerous mmwr's that have been or published published on on uh football outbreaks on outbreaks that are happening in these extracurricular activities and they happen when um there's enough disease in the community and we're not taking these mitigation efforts so i think what's going to happen is as more and more adults get vaccinated we will see um i hope um and and as we do it quickly um the community rates come down and our ability um layered on top with with screening strategies as was previously noted by um dr schreier to to um to be able to engage in some of these day-to-day activities with our children great thank you um i also want to just touch on the mental health of our children others have mentioned it already today but there is an urgent need to invest and strengthen uh mental health resources and services to our youth and the pandemic has only exacerbated this uh the cdc recently found that compared to 2019 mental health related emergency room visits increased 31 percent for children between the ages of 12 and 17 from march to october of last year i recently partnered with uh congressman cardenas to introduce the youth mental health and suicide prevention act which sends funding directly to school districts to support positive mental health promotion and suicide prevention efforts in high schools but the numbers show that our children need help right now so dr fochi with our remaining time what efforts are currently underway within nih uh and across the broader federal government to understand and respond to youth mental health challenges that have been brought on or worsened by the pandemic yes thank you for that question in fact uh the infectious disease institute that i direct is by no means the only institute that's involved in addressing a comprehensive response to the pandemic the national institute of mental health is now getting deeply involved not only in recognizing this problem but by also trying to study its intensity and how we might respond to it your point is extremely well taken we consider this one of the most serious issues related to spin-offs of the outbreak that really were not anticipated when you just think in terms of an infectious disease well thank you the effects of the pandemic will be far-reaching and uh and long-lasting and uh i appreciate your your being with us here today we must be able to all not only meet their needs now but also in the future thank you i yield that

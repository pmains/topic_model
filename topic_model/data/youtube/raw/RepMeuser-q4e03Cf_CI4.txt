my guess is he will move in he has to do something russia will be held accountable if it invades and it depends on what it does it's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do etc but if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the force amassed on the border it is going to be a disaster for russia welcome back into the show as we've been telling you now today marks one year in office for joe biden january 20th he believes the country is a lot better one year later than it was a year ago a lot of americans though disagree inflation now at a 40-year high at seven percent he's got a 33 approval rating which i think says a whole lot about what the american people think about our president right now joining us now for more is pennsylvania congressman and member of the house foreign affairs committee dan muser congressman good morning great to see you again um i i want to put up a tweet that you put out a day ago you said in president biden's first year in office he created a national security crisis embolden our adversaries and created an unmitigated disaster in afghanistan he also emboldened russia and refuses to hold china accountable your top line thoughts on that two-hour debacle yesterday afternoon that took place in the east room of the white house well it was typical biden a lot of explaining a lot of blaming absolutely no real answers and a lot of pointing fingers you know rob a year ago today i did stand outside the white house or excuse me the congress building listening to um right outside the capitol listening to joe biden's speech his uh swearing in and he talked about being united rob i mean he's been divider in chief he again the blaming that takes place and last week in georgia he referred to anyone who doesn't believe with his party's attempt to take over our elections basically as racists okay and then and then take it into as you just mentioned uh the national security issues that exist we have the border crisis which is an unmitigated disaster you couldn't put that any any better um the uh certainly clearly the issues surrounding russia at this point in time surrounding the ukraine and here we have joe biden during his speech yesterday actually give somewhat of a green light to certainly a yellow light or green light to to putin related to let's see how much of an incursion he makes into um into russia well that will depend right that will depend do you think that he i don't i'm comfortable saying green light um his exact line was minor incursion if he uh if he you know his response to what's happening if it's a minor incursion uh the u.s will respond a minor incursion is to me that sounded like a green light for an invasion it it sounds like what happened in 2014 when putin invaded crimea quite frankly it sounds like like neville chamberlain and 1939 uh hitler invading poland all right that's what a minor incursion is it starts there he's already trying to minimize the errors that are about to take place uh reminiscent of afghanistan right they they talked about that like oh what a wonderful withdrawal we're going to have so as far as the report card goes as united absolute f as as far as uh national security because the list goes on there f as far as code response f particularly what he could control uh testing you know i've been screaming since april about how we uh the lack of testing in pennsylvania we have blinds one mile two miles long and he apologizes yeah for getting that one wrong congressman we're tight on time so i want to play a quick sound bite joe biden apparently he claims that he addressed covet origins with the president of china take a listen then we'll get a quick quick reaction the answer is that we did i did raise the question of transparency i spent a lot of time with him and he uh the fact is that they're just not they're just not being transparent transparency on the crota virus origins yes and you did during the virtual summit is there a reason your press staff was unaware of that and what did you say to the chinese president and they weren't with me the entire time look i made it clear that i thought that china had an obligation to be more forthcoming on exactly what the source of the virus was and where it came from okay congressman you're a member of the house foreign affairs committee easy question uh do you believe the president i don't uh and in fact i don't think the president believes the president maybe he brought it up but this was a cover-up and the biden administration is aware of it we're aware of it through our china task force right all the data points to that it occurred in a the virus came from a lab in wuhan where it was accidental or deliberate that's where it came from and uh he's not even attempting to get to the bottom of it yeah congressman dan muizer great to have you on this morning we appreciate getting your uh your take on everything that took place yesterday good to see you thank you you too rob thanks very much

let me get to my guest it's Trent Kelly Congressman Kelly from Mississippi's First District good morning sir how are you good morning Paul how are we just handling breaking news here so grinder is out we don't know uh where this guy goes I'm sure he goes back to Mother Russia or wherever or wherever it happens to be but uh it's it took a long time to gather didn't it it did but I mean it's my first of all you probably should have never been arrested and all that stuff and uh you know for minor crimes and we're swapping her our great negotiator of a president is swapping her for The Merchant of dad uh you know he's against uh all semi-automatic weapons yet a guy who sold hundreds of thousands to our enemies automatic weapons and explosives and uh surface-to-air missiles he's going to release this guy so he can sell more to the bad guys while he tries to take away our rights I don't think there's anything that's happened in this uh Administration that makes sense uh certainly the one of the things I want to talk to you about is the vaccination situation Rand Paul had this yesterday and if we'll just spend a couple of seconds on here because he leaves kind of the groundwork of uh of what the situation is are young men and women in the military deserve better the Biden administration's vaccination mandate has forced our nation's young patriotic men and women to choose between their faith and their career between their meta autonomy and their career at a time when the military is struggling to meet their targets for recruitment the Biden Administration is firing soldiers we invested in and trained some will argue that the vaccine mandate in the military is not new that is correct but there are several factors unique to the covid Maxine that make it different than other mandates first the CDC acknowledges that the covid vaccine does not stop transmission so the argument that the Mandate will stop incapacitating spread in the close quarters of the military is not applicable second the kobit vaccine has a risk of causing inflammation particularly in young men particularly the young men that comprise over 90 percent of our military recruits in addition several scientific studies including a very large one in Israel and another one by the CDC have shown that a heightened risk of myocarditis for children and teenagers after taking a second covid vaccine dose because of this scientific evidence European countries began restricting the vaccine for certain age groups Dr Paul Offutt a former member of the cdc's advisory committee on vaccines resigned over this policy he also said that even though he's pro-vaccine he's been pro- everything vaccine for 40 years that he wouldn't give the vaccine to his 24 year old son third the Mandate ignores naturally acquired immunity eighty percent of our young military recruits have had covet by compelling the young people to inject a vaccine into their bodies they're accepting a risk of myocarditis in fact it is inadvisable to take a vaccine if you've recently had covet even the CDC admits this our service members have spent their entire lives dedicated to protecting our country and making sacrifices to defend the Constitution Congress should take action we're taking action today by saying we will not vote to get on the ndaa the defense authorization Bill unless we have a vote on ending this military vaccine mandate after that explained exactly where we are with this one Congressman Kelly well I don't know boy our speaker doesn't want this to go away uh she's uh using this covid to keep people proxy voting and to keep metal attacks and all that stuff but uh we won't pass the ndaa through the house without Republican votes and we will not vote for an ndaa on the Republican side our leader Kevin McCarthy has said that that does not include a repeal of the vaccine mandate and let me tell you it didn't stop transmission you're talking about a healthy population which you're inoculating for something that uh listen initially it was a good idea but you know leaders when they make a decision based on the best facts of the time they figure out that that's not the science anymore they change and our president and our secretary of defense has uh refused to change their stance it's all about I'm the boss and I'm right and not about doing what's best for our service members and it's um it's killed us in recruiting we've lost uh great warriors uh due to this vaccine mandate so we will repeal it in the ndaa or the ndaa will not pass by what what is or by the way are you on a speakerphone you get off of it I'd appreciate it it just gets too much too Hollow oh that's that's a hundred percent better I I do want to ask you what is the latest that you've heard from uh the president because at one point he kind of indicated but then again you never know if he remembers what he said 15 minutes earlier he kind of indicated that he would revisit that and then on Monday of this week John Kirby comes in and says this secretary Austin's been very clear that he opposes the repeal of That vaccine mandate and the president actually concurs with the secretary that we need to continue to uh believe that all Americans including those in the armed forces should be vaccinated and boosted with covet 19. so is that the latest stance you've heard from the White House no I think the secretary of defense is pushing very hard to keep it in I think the president has made a commitment I think he will stick by that uh I think he's getting a lot of pressure from the speaker of the house and from the Secretary of Defense and from outside sources to back off of that and but but uh the bottom line is uh they cannot pass the National Defense authorization act through the house without Republican votes and Republicans will not vote if it does not repel it what does that do to the is that the to fund the military infrastructure in our in our country or what does that act uh comprised of what does it do it funds the entire defense it's the authorization of all the things that they appropriate money to uh it's also all the policy that runs DOD and that is uh all four of our services that is everything Paul so uh listen we passed this thing 62 consecutive years and if the Democrats with the house and the Senate and the presidency don't pass this thing it is a travesty and and it is all on them it is their job to get 218 votes and that means repealing the coveted mandate if they don't want to do that they'll have a hard time getting 218 bucks would this put any military installations as far as their funding uh in Jeopardy or maybe the the paid of the soldiers what it does is leave them on a continuing resolution and leaves the old policies in place and so it doesn't put them in doesn't furlough any that's the funding mechanism that comes next but what it does is they don't get pay raises they can't do new contracts for technology and Equipment they can't have maintenance contracts and so what that does is put us at a risk at a Readiness level can't buy new ammunition all those things that they need to do you're a military guy what is is it anything in here to push along with uh excluding the vaccinations to get those people who've been kicked out reinstated yeah I think uh what I think is some of it and uh we're still like getting the language they're still negotiating that pawn I don't think they get reinstated I think they can reapply and there will be no negative uh no negative uh dishonorable or general discharges allowed on those folks who were gone because of the coven mandate and this is a really tough situation Paul because initially the science did kind of support that a vaccine was going to work and all that and so and soldiers have to follow orders when you you hit chaos and Anarchy when soldiers don't follow orders but now we've gotten to the pack where the science shows that is not true and now our leadership needs to that would be the Secretary of Defense that the president needs to say no vaccine mandate Ben could you say the same thing about Ukraine because it looks like when January gets here in the house uh the Republicans get the gavel well the the checks are not going to float to the Ukraine I don't know if you've heard what I just played a little bit earlier on the Ukraine from Tucker Carlson Bob is the do you think the house is going to cut those checks from the Republican part like the Democrats have been doing I don't think it then there's going to be some accountability uh we're going to make sure that things are flowing where they're supposed to flow that they're going into the hands of people where they are you know and I feel the same way about uh listen we need to support Ukraine with weapons and systems to fight the Russians Putin is a bad guy but that being said I feel the same way about AG we need to send bags of rice in ag not cash for some corrupt dictator to spend and the same way with these weapons we need to send weapon systems and make sure they get in the right hands but we don't need to give them money that can be misappropriated or misspent on things that it's not supposed to be so there has to be a heavy accounting so I think you will still see some money go but I think there will be a heavier level of accountability uh when you do the Republicans take charge I was I was listening to the entire interview and some of the things that Tucker was talking about some of the money and literally millions of dollars going to support nearby countries that have been affected in one way or the other but there's no accounting on that at all and it's our money Joe and Josie in in Middle America and elsewhere who are paying for this through our taxes but I want to ask you a little bit more hang on back with Congressman Trent Kelly when we return okay let's get back live in the instruction Studios to uh Trent Kelly Congressman First District I'm just uh Curious what what does it feel like around there knowing that this is uh already the eighth day of December and January is going to be uh a little bit different when this January rolls around what what's the preparation what's the committee assignment uh preliminaries look like give me an overview of the field there yeah it's uh well you know everybody's focused on the speakers race for January 3rd you know we need to get Kevin McCarthy across the line I'm a huge supporter there's nobody who can Garner over 10 votes who's running against him and we need to unify because the bottom line until we have a speaker they can't do committee assignments they can't populate those committees they can't do the steering until that speaker is chosen so any day we go past January 3rd is uh just cutting into the time we have to govern as a republican majority in the house uh I should say on the intelligence committee the armed services committee and also the agriculture committee uh all which are so important to Mississippi and my district and so that's what it looks like but unless we get the speaker elected you know and listen I'm fine that they have things and to negotiate and listen have some good rules packages and things come out with those negotiations but the bottom line if you can't uh when when you nominate someone in a primary you don't vote for the Democrat then and that's what they're doing by challenge McCarthy he was uh he was selected by our conference with over 90 percent of the vote and so uh no one can get over 20 votes I would say if they can even get that so we need to make McCarthy there's no viable alternative here I was going to say there's not really a a viable Challenger or a challenger that that um that's got any more behind them any motivational or uh momentum behind him yeah I mean these guys are my friends but I think they're just dead wrong on this they're negotiating uh with themselves and it's just not good for America and the bottom line is we need to get the speaker elected and if they've got a viable alternative put them on the table but they don't and then let's get started with business and get our committee assignments and let's start oversight and all the things that are important to the American people have you have you met or had a powwow with the new Congressman uh from a Mr Ezell Mike Iselle yes I have uh he's uh a nice guy we're working on trying to get him committee assignments you know uh pushing real hard uh to look at either uh armed services Ag and Homeland Security uh we will push for those things through the steering process it's a very difficult and convoluted process we're working hard to get Michael guess where he wants to do to be and uh I'm just wanting to stay where I am I'm very happy with the committee assignments that I have but you have shown them where the bathrooms are I have he is uh he's gonna be fine he's going to listen and I think he's going to be a great uh a great person from Mississippi I think he's going to be part of the Mississippi team and the Republican Mississippi team and I think he will be in addition we're going to miss Steven who's a great friend of mine it's just uh you know this is business you work with who you have up here and Mike's going to be a great addition with the Revelation that uh Herschel Walker did not win they've got 59 to 41 51-49 um which renders koala even more useless than she was before but that said it's even more important that the the house has been won by the Republicans and I'm going to tell you Paul they're voting for 30 days and we're voting for one and so we've uh listen that's the rules I don't like the rose I I voted against everything that does all the early voting and all the things they've done but the bottom line was that's the rule in your state uh you you better play by the rules of the game or we're going to continue to lose races we shouldn't lose well I mean I got to tell you as far as McCarthy is concerned I'm not as concerned with him uh but I I am concerned with Mitch McConnell I'm concerned with Ronald McDaniel because and she's got some competition now I think it's a little too late but there's a very viable opponent who announced yesterday and I guess it's just if we keep if we keep doing the same things and I I don't think that the Georgia election was more testimony to that that we've got to be thinking out of the box and the Republican party has got to bring itself up to date with the base I I agree wholeheartedly uh you know and I don't know about right I don't deal very much with either the senate or with the RNC I deal mostly in the house and so I you know I'll let them deal with their leadership elections all I'm focused on is getting McCarthy across the line because that's good for Mississippi it's good for America he's a proven conservative and we would not have the majority either the last time we have it or this time without Kevin McCarthy anything else you want to mention before we let you go sir no man I just thank you and uh everybody have a Merry Christmas and uh hopefully we'll get Nancy to do her job between now and Christmas and I'll get home before Christmas day but if not I hope everybody uh back home has a merry Christmas Paul and YouTube you gotta thank you man appreciate it very much yes sir Merry Christmas to you Congressman Trent Kelly from uh District One

will now begin with questions members are limited to five minutes but we may have some additional rounds I'll recognize myself for the first round of questions mr. Wilson thank you so very much for traveling all the way out from La Paz County out here to Washington DC under the current process most counties get little to no money from solar and wind power generation that takes place within their borders energy development on public lands takes a toll on your county roads requires the use of precious water resources can disturb scenic views federal lands are also not taxable I know you touched us on touched on this in your testimony but given these factors doesn't it make sense that local governments receive a share of the revenues from the sale of energy production that takes place within their borders mr. chairman representative Gosar it makes absolute sense the counties are mandated to provide certain services to their citizens including public safety health and public welfare providing those services all take money and the additional burden placed by these industries on lands that don't pay taxes is a critical part of being able to adequately provide those services to our residents so also the expedited permitting process how would that help the county's mr. chairman representative Gosar as stated by mr. Fetzer Arizona wants to be the solar capital of the world the state and counties have all taken steps to expedite processes and make sure that everybody is aware that we are open for business and part of that is expediting our internal processes so that businesses can be responsive and the county government can be responsive to the need of those businesses we recently had a industrial client that needed a rezone and with advertising and other requirements we were able to get that rezone through the entire process in less than two months that's the kind of responsiveness that we would like to see from all aspects of government so it really helps creating an environment for jobs right absolutely gotcha now some of the revenues that are returned to the county would they go with some of these be used for education mr. German representative Gosar I would anticipate that most of the revenues at this point would probably go for infrastructure cost shifts and sweeping of her funds that have occurred in Arizona have severely impacted the county's ability to maintain roads and and we are pretty much behind the eight ball our Public Works fleet of small vehicles right now all have over 200,000 miles on them those vehicles are going to need to be replaced we have county roads we were where we've had to extend grading and maintenance schedules we need to get caught up on those there's no doubt in my mind education in Arizona does need some help but it's not a mandated service to the county at this point we need to focus on those mandated services when it returns the revenues to the county that they can jurist have jurisdiction on where to appropriate those funds I'm sorry so we would appropriate the funds back to the county so you'll have the dictation of where those funds go yes gotcha mr. Fetzer can you elaborate on how HR 596 will help Arizona become that solar capital of the world we kind of want to move Germany on out of there mr. Gosar basically when you look at the the amount of federal and public lands in Arizona and you look at our development pattern around the Phoenix metropolitan area and even others the state you start pushing out into a lot of areas that are federally controlled state controlled and so forth when you start looking at needed infrastructure specifically for power transmission and so forth you always end up touching public lands with what the push out of you know our development patterns you'll start seeing these public lands become more viable suitable and more needed for this type of instructor structure specifically solar development so this would actually incentivize states and counties so they're sharing because they're sharing on the revenue to help expedite but also be very cognitive of the streamlined process wouldn't you agree yes mr. gosar in fact when I worked for a community we always tried to keep all the development within our community so we could get the taxable property and the basically the secondary property tax and so forth for those and in fact when we had developers come to us at the time because we weren't able to share in world royalties we'd actually try to get them over to private lands as opposed to any type of public land what this bill does is actually incentivize those state local communities the counties and so forth to development of public lands because they're able to share in those royalties as well as mister as mr. Wilson stated you know being able to pay for infrastructure thank you very much

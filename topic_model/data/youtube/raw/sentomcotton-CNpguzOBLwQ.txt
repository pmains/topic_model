joining us now is Senator Tom Cotton who has long warned about Tick-Tock Senator that's quite a list and that's just scratching the surface what does that tell you about the revolving door of power to influence peddling in Washington especially on behalf essentially of the CCP well Laura it was a great interview you had with my friend Mike Gallagher last night he's right tick tock is like a kind of digital fentanyl or trojan horse on the phones of America's youth if you have it on your phone you should delete it and probably get a new phone as well and these former members of Congress and Congressional Aid should know better than lobbying for a company that is directed by at the behest of the Chinese Communist party that is part of its massive surveillance Network that is going to give access to hundreds of millions of Americans phones going for today and going forward if it's not removed from those phones if it's not banned nationally in this country Mike Gallagher and I also have legislation that would close this loophole he spoke about that would require any person who's lobbying for one of these Chinese companies to register not just as a lobbyist and require diligent journalists at places like Washington examiner to go fair at the mail but rather register as a foreign agent because in China there simply is no line between the Communist Party and Chinese companies yeah I mean that seems like such a no-brainer at this point Senator so I'm so glad you're pursuing this but today at the New York Times deal book Summit the CEO of tick tock addressed criticism that they are just controlled by the Chinese government watch this we take all these concerns very seriously for us you know no U.S government no foreign government has asked us for U.S user Data before really to happen and if they did we would say no Senator I'm sorry does that even pass the straight face test no and if you said no we might go the way of Jack Ma and be disappeared and never heard from again either look Tick Tock is under the thumb of Chinese Communists it has to answer to the Chinese Communist party it has to do what the government says it can access all the data on your phone to include all the other apps and your content and your text messages your emails your browser history you can even remotely control your camera and your microphone you should delete tick tock from your phone and probably get a new phone if you have it on there now and that's to say nothing of the kind of content that the Chinese Communist Party allows on Tick Tock in their country which is basically respect your elders and do your homework and eat your vegetables and what you find on it here in America I'm not sure they're even getting vegetables Senator but uh it's good to see you tonight thank you

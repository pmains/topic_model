joining us on the program right now is our friend pat toomey running for senate in pennsylvania how are you doing i am doing great how are you now you're one of these guys i like to have on the program because you're just not you're not a political hack we could talk economics we could talk about the health of our economy in this nation and you'll put it to the people straight when you see a political party who sees its political interests in growing a tax consumer class that that can't come with the general health of the nation no that's it and it's a pity that has come to that because you know there were many decades when many democrats did not take this approach john f kennedy stood up in front of the american people and talked about how lower taxes will lift the the quality of life the standard of living for everybody you know there was a time when you could be pro growth and still be in the democratic party now the party's clearly been captured by a liberal left wing that uh i'm i'm concerned you're right you know they wanna they wanna grow the number of people who are dependent reduce the number of people who are paying uh paying all the bills and uh and just keep growing government this is uh this is not a a recipe for a successful society the website is to me for senate dot com pat toomey used to be with the club for growth now he's running for you know arlen specter i hope you i hope your campaign people are looping that act like a lady i hope you guys are looping that over and over again in your campaign spots well well we're not running any campaign spots yet we've got a little ways to go before we get to that point but but i gotta tell you there are a lot of other people doing that for us there's been a lot of exposure to that it should be act like a lady vote for pat toomey well i i i think that people will uh will will connect those dots you know he he's really well just way out of touch and out of step i mean who talks like that to somebody you know i mean it's so patronizing and condescending and so arrogant let's get back to the to the kennedy era democrats you're running in pennsylvania you you you would have to pennsylvania is still by and large a blue collar not necessarily socially blue state it's still considered a blue collar state you've got steel you've got mining yeah you've got a lot of what i call callous hand democrats yeah back in the 1960s john f kennedy saw globalization and he saw modernization as a way to combat globalization and went before a joint session of congress in 1961 and said if we want to compete we have to reduce the tax burden on business so they can grow and hire more americans there was a time when democrats understood that the working man couldn't get a fair shake if he wasn't working exactly right there was a time when there were many democrats who understood that business is not the enemy of america for crying out loud it's a source of of jobs and prosperity and that the private sector has to pay all the bills ultimately you know government doesn't create wealth governments they can destroy wealth and redistribute wealth but it's ordinary men and women who get up every day and go to work and make things and and provide services that's where prosperity comes from i think john f kennedy understood that completely and uh unfortunately uh that that thinking in the democratic party uh among elected democrats anyway seems to be uh hidden in a closet somewhere i just i just don't hear that message coming from elected democrats now where along the way do you think that got lost because when i look at speeches given by jfk when i look at speeches being given by old school democrats on up to reagan who had the reagan democrats it seemed to me there was an understanding that economic health came from a symphony a symphony of profit driven individuals small businesses and companies all getting together to engage in beneficial traffic transactions and when that happened when you had small business big business individuals people making money and spending money the government too saw saw you know it's its revenues go up yeah uh well exactly and of course that's that's the irony of it if they understood the dynamics uh better they would realize that uh all problems but where along the way do you think this happened because you're obviously you're obviously coming up with messaging to take to take on arlen specter in in pennsylvania where along the way do you think the democrats lost their way with understanding how the economy benefited everyone when the government didn't overburden the economy um it's a good question i don't know that i've got a great exam answer as to exactly when that became the dominance of thinking within the democratic party my my gut tells me it was probably during the 1970s when a time when we even had republicans who lost their way on this i mean remember richard nixon imposed imposed wage and price controls i mean clearly a terribly bad policy for for economic growth and he was a republican so we were mired for a full decade jimmy carter's economic policies were disastrous we were mired for a decade in economic misery often thinking that well maybe the soviets didn't have it so wrong i used to hear people say that and it took ronald reagan to to really restore the common sense uh and and uh it's not a coincidence that he was enormously popular and enormously successful the website is to me for senate dot com the reason why i'm kind of needling you on this is because i i you know i know you from the club for growth and i know that this is where your strength lies and i think the voters of pennsylvania need to hear this they need to understand this that class warfare never benefits the lower classes it never benefits the working man that class warfare is just a political game designed to get certain people elected it's about control not about growth and growth is good for everyone and what's funny is they say you got to get over reagan you got to get over reagan reaganomics trickle down economics wasn't it jfk a democrat who said a rising tide lifts all boats absolutely and there are there are significant segments of john f kennedy speeches where if you weren't watching it if you were just reading a transcript you wouldn't know that it wasn't ronald reagan uh so uh so i i don't for a minute think that we need to uh forget about ronald reagan he learned us he he taught us some important lessons but let me go back for a minute about the message you see i i don't think that uh pennsylvania voters need for me to tell them about the uh the fallacies and the trap of of class warfare and ever expanding government and attacking the productive private say i i just they already get that and i think my message is to make sure that they understand who i am where i come from what my record is and where i want to take uh our commonwealth our state and our economy and and i think they a big majority of them andrew they agree with us you know i run into people every day who are not particularly political who are appalled by what they see happening in washington they some of them will tell me they say look i voted for a change in 2008 but boy this isn't the change i had in mind and and so i think it's a it's a function of myself becoming known so that people understand where i'm coming from and who i am my background in small business for instance uh that's that's what it's going to take and i think that's going to lead to a victory in this election all right we're we're talking to our friend pat toomey formerly of the club for growth now running for uh senate in uh pennsylvania as a republican the website is to me for senate dot com do you fear anyway because and not not i'm using the phrase game change not related to the book uh republicans in connecticut had to change their strategy when dodd announced at the last minute i mean they gamed their strategy against christopher dodd and now dodd is pretty much done for do you fear that there'll be a last-minute effort to remove arlen specter uh well hard to say i mean i i don't know that arnold inspector wins this primary you know i i think uh his credibility is so damaged um i think voters are very skeptical and they have a hard time trusting him and that's voters of of either party why why would democrats believe that this man's conversion is in any way sincere when he admitted that it was motivated by the fact that he couldn't win a republican primary so i i don't know that that he wins the primary but you know i really think that he whether it's arlen spector or joe sestak they both voted for all the bailouts they both voted for all the stimulus and they think we need more stimulus they want higher taxes more government cap and trade deny workers a secret ballot government takeover of health care they are both signed up for that entire program and more and it's just so far out of step with where most pennsylvanians are that um i i'm honestly i'm really not worried about who wins that primary i think we're going to prevail against either one now the funny thing is you're hearing democrats they're still blaming bush and they're sort of you know chatting at the idea that well you're going to hand it back over to the people that made it this mess in the first place but if you look at a lot of the people who are running as republicans they weren't in government when this when this was supposedly done to the people quote unquote by republicans you look at kentucky you got rand paul you got florida you got marco rubio uh texas you have michael williams uh pennsylvania of pat toomey uh you have you have people running in for these seats that were not the quote unquote republicans that the democrats claimed were responsible for all this is a whole fresh crop of people well that is certainly true but it's also the case i think we really have to look at you know what did get us into this mess uh i think a big part of it was a failed monetary policy on the part of the federal reserve which created a bubble and created a credit bubble led to a housing bubble a big part of the problem a big part was a federal legislation that encouraged people to buy homes who weren't ready to buy a home you know the idea that everybody should buy a home whether or not they have any money in savings whether they have any ability to sustain an economic downturn whether they have any equity i think that makes no sense then you had federal legislation forcing fannie mae and freddie mac to buy subprime mortgages forcing them to lend money to people who probably wouldn't be able to pay them back now it seems to me that the people who were big advocates of those policies barney frank and chris dodd come to mind they were at the helm and they were even when they weren't in the majority they were advocating for these policies so i think we need to be clear-minded about what got us into this mess what are you looking for tomorrow in uh in the state of the union all of a sudden obama is acting like some big budget hawk it's his own budget that he's talk that he's talking about this is his budget this is this is fascinating i mean i i'm curious as to how he's going to square this circle and how he's going to uh make this consistent this is the president that gave us this massive stimulus bill as you point out proposed unprecedented size deficit in his spending plans and he said quote we've got to spend our way out of this now he's advocating for a freeze well does he think we're out of it or has he given up on the idea of endless borrowing and spending i hope it's the latter if that's the case then let's rescind the unspent portion of the uh the stimulus let's end the tarp program and just put that to bed for good um let's i want to see if he's really understands that borrowing and spending is not the the source of prosperity in which case we could have much better policy going forward um but we'll you know that we'll find out when we hear the details now it seems to me the democrats are playing on on emotion you know we saw yesterday on cnn one of the anchors uh was holding up a book and it was a thousand page book written of success stories of the stimulus and it was you know anecdotal stories like you know mrs johnson's fourth grade class got a computer you know how could you oppose that and we're they're we're seeing the constant propping up of police officers firefighters and and emts and public school teachers you know you you sound like an ogre when you oppose that but by and large what i see and tell me if you agree is we're ignoring the fact the government is buying labor that it doesn't need at a price it can't afford and that won't bring a return on investment uh absolutely right and see i i'm really the reason i'm so confident about the future of our country is though i think people get it they understand you know what federal government goes out and spends a trillion dollars of course they're going to create some jobs with that money it's all the jobs they destroy by taking a trillion dollars out of the private sector that we've got to be concerned about and the fact that on balance they end up doing more harm than good i mean the people i think get it you know you sure you could grow government you could increase the workforce in in uh state capitals and the the federal capital who's going to pay for all that it's it's it's the people in the private sector and so i think people are not fooled and and you know they'll they've got the spin that they've got on their stimulus but i don't think they're fooling anybody with it one of the things that i see and tell me if you see this we're talking to pat toomey the website is toomeyforsenate.com he's running in pennsylvania formerly with the club for growth that their you know obama said that they weren't here to kick the can down the road but when you borrow 787 billion dollars and it is 787 billion dollars of borrowing you're ignoring the time frame that you have to pay it back so yeah you created a job today and you built a road today and mrs johnson's fourth grade grade class got a computer today but what about when that bill comes in you know let's talk about the kids who are mr smith's eighth grade class four years down the road but i i would argue that you are destroying the jobs today and tomorrow because when you take that money out and you you hire that government worker with the borrowed money that money had to come from somewhere and it was money that would be saved and invested with the private sector company in the alternative not only do we impose this burden that costs jobs down the road for the people who have to pay higher taxes to pay the money back but even in the meantime we've taken the cash out of the private economy which means we are destroying the ability of business to expand and create private jobs from day one now one last thing before i let you go uh once again we're talking to pat toomey the website is twomey4senate.com the assumption here and you're seeing this uh coming from left wing pundits that what the government is doing in essence by borrowing and spending 787 billion dollars by creating these government jobs they are quote unquote supporting demand in that you know the government all these workers on the road crews are going to go out spend their money at the local tavern and the waitress will have tips and that they're trying to make this this trickle up thing i i guess or trickle out thing or that if we put this money into play it will be spent but if they're also threatening the businesses where these people are going to spend their money let's say you know we're going to go after walmart and we're going to raise taxes through vat tax and through cap and trade and we're gonna take over on the auto industry if they're gonna go ahead and raise taxes on the corporations where these people spend their money they're going to raise their prices to compensate why would any company want to be business friendly if they know in the end any money they make is going to be taken away from them right no they they are having a chilling effect on business because of all the uh the attacks and the threatened attacks on on business here's the other thing to keep in mind you know if all you have to do is spend more money if for the government to spend more money to get back to prosperity why then recessions would be a laughing matter right it'd be the easiest thing in the world and we certainly couldn't be in one now because we're spending a staggering amount of money so you can't just conjure up demand from the clear blue sky the way they think they can it's all about production you can only consume when you're producing we have to be a productive society creating output and that's going to come from the private sector that is enhanced by incentives that encourage investment encourage risk taking encourage growth of business and you know when we figure that out we'll we can restore economic growth but we've got to get off this path that we're on i agree with you all right uh pat toomey thanks for coming on the program the website is twome4senate.com we'll be talking to you throughout the year thanks for having me andrew

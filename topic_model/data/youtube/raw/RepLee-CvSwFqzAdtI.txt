burning me on the phone now is California congresswoman barbara Lee congresswoman thank you for being with me obviously Oakland is your district I am so terribly sorry about all of this what can you tell us about the communication you've had with the mayor and the different city officials there about their efforts sure I've spoken with the mayor and we're about to have another so they should say this is a tragedy beyond proportions it's terrific it's something that we can't even imagine and so right now I think everyone our prank we're praying and offering our condolences and addressing the real grief and mourning that that's taking place in the city it is so important that families of loved ones loved ones with friends called the phone number and I'm pleased that you have the number posted the five 1038 to 3,000 that is the family notification center because we don't know what is taking place in terms of loss of life you know first responders are fire chiefs of firefighters are doing a phenomenal job but they still can't even enter the building and so right now I think the mayor is correct we've got to focus on the compassionate care and humanitarian concerns so people who are grieving of the communities is grieving we certainly at the federal level will bring in all appropriate federal resources once we know what's appropriate and needed congressman smoky is called the offer her time so I'm so sorry to interrupt congresswoman stay with me I just learned we have another press conference updating everyone on the situation let's listen in sergeant ray kelly so that that has slowed things down we continue to have our Family Assistance Center up it's actually functioning very well now I just talked to the mayor and she's going back over there to meet with the families again the Oakland Police Department has some updates in regarding the activity in this part of the city what's going to go on here for the next 48 hours we will anticipate that we will be here at least through a sunday maybe early Monday morning we'd like to get that this place back functioning as quickly as possible but officer Watson we'll talk about that Thank You sergeant Kelly so for this evening until monday morning this will be our media staging area so if you're already here we will not change this location if you anticipate coming here the location is thirtieth Street International entrance from 30th on to international will be the ingress and egress so we're leaving media staging for briefings until monday morning we'll assess then at that time additionally tomorrow morning at eight o'clock we will hold a media availability the media availability will provide any updated information that had occurred over the evening or over this evening if there's a significant development tonight all right we'll continue monitoring this press conference out of Oakland again they don't seem to have any more updates on victim numbers for us at this point in time we'll bring you more information as we have it back with me on the phone is representative barbara Lee of California Oakland is in her district let's talk about the victims because I spoke with the freelance journalist earlier from the area a number of his friends were at this warehouse a number of them are missing and he said a lot of the people at this party last night were key members of vocal ins music community artists what can you tell us about some of these people obviously we're not releasing their identities we don't have their identities at this point in time but tell us a little bit about this this you know musicians community well you know and again in respecting the family and loved ones of the victims it's very difficult to really talk about anything as it relates to them other than the fact that our condolences and prayers go after the victims but you know Oakland is a community of artists creative people of people who really had visions and understand the importance of culture and art and so once again to really hone in on this I think we have to focus on just making sure that all the family and victims are supported and cared for during this moment and that the grieving and the mourning process can't get you know move forward in a way that leads to some healing it's hard to imagine you know how people are feeling that because I know for myself personally it's something that I can't even begin to explain in terms of the emotional reaction to this tragedy so we have to you know as we move forward and as first responders attempt to get into the building really focus on supporting them lifting them up and finding every resources necessary and again at the federal level I'm going to make sure that all appropriate federal resources are brought to bear but right now we have to really address the humanitarian and the compassionate care for those who are suffering as a result of this tremendous loss and Congresswomen our thoughts with all those families and also our thanks and our deepest gratitude to the first responders working throughout the day and the night on this trying to get access in that building and you know and properly treat the remains of the victims congresswoman barbara Lee thank you

from Isis genre blows is less than a kilometer from Turkey turkey semi-official under Luigi says it was the last major community on the syrian-turkish frontier held by that terror group US Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Turkey hours after that offensive began Biden is there to reaffirm America's support after a failed military coup against turkish President Recep type air diwani we now are joined by congressman brad Sherman who is here with us to discuss some of these very important issues he's a senior member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee so Biden is in town he has been talking to President erawan who has said repeatedly to the United States via media that there is no excuse for not turning over Fethullah Gulen who is here in the United States who he believes is behind the coup is the United States prepared to do something that or even considering doing this it could be an incredible dishonor to the United States to turn over someone with no evidence and they presented no evidence this cleric mr. Gulen has been at a political opponent of Erdogan for for a while they were once allies and for us to turn we've already kowtow to turkey because of their political position we refused to call the armenian genocide and genocide we have an Air Force Base there which until last year they wouldn't allow us to use against Isis and keep in mind here to GaN has been support has been hand in glove with Isis right up until about last summer and of course he will dispute that good for his part has denied any involvement in this in this coup but turkey is in a very important spot strategically speaking is our relationship deteriorating I mean this seems like a real problem between the United States and Turkey I think our relationship is actually better than it was when turkey was working a almost hand in glove with Isis as they were up until last summer Isis has turned on Turkey you see all these terrorist attacks against the Turkish people but there was a time when all the foreign fighters went through turkey and all the oil produced by Isis went to Turkey so I think we're turkey has decided that they continue to think of opposing Kurdish forces including those allied with us as their number-one goal but at least their number two gold is combating Isis give us a sense of though how vital turkey is United States you did mention that there is a base there that we've been trying to use and now are using in the fight against Isis how vital is Turkey to the United States considering that there are a lot of unstable countries in that region well not near as vital as we are to Turkey I mean turkey is in a very dangerous neighborhood we and relies upon the united states now that Isis has trained their terrorists on Turkey turkey needs our support to try to push Isis off their borders and it looks like that effort has been successful as far as the immediate border area I want to move on to Iran we saw some pictures that from the Navy of what happened in Iran today and you know as as the relationship there has at least they're speaking right the United States and Iran is there having conversations they have come up with a nuclear deal an agreement but then you see pictures like this where the Navy says that for Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels conducted what they called high-speed intercept of one of the naval vessels from the United States and when you see something like this is this being done for what reason is this being done because of the differences in opinion about the United States inside of Iran this is being done because many and Iran view us as the enemy that friday prayers they're chanting death to America and this is a way to kind of stick it to us and stick it to the United States Navy and we should not be fooled we have a deal on the the the nuclear side that deal has is not a binding treaty it is virtually no standing but it is a deal that is going forward at the present time but ran remains the number one state sponsor of terrorism and very hostile to the United States then I want to ask you this because this is something that Donald Trump has spoken about a lot and said look things like this are an example of why we can't trust Iran is there any danger of this deal sort of going away and suddenly we're back to where we started where one well I don't think anybody thinks we can trust Iran or very few and certainly the Obama administration has never said trust to rent as to the deal keep in mind that the nuclear restrictions are temporary the sanctions relief is permanent one would expect that a subsequent administration will be demanding that if the sanctions relief is going to continue the nuclear restrictions if President Obama can can go bed calm knowing that that Iran has only a certain number of centrifuges why should a future president have to accept a greater number of centrifuges that presidents sleep and our in our and our nation's security is just as important next decade as it is this decade so I would suspect that we will not continue sanctions relief unless Iran continues to limit its nuclear program to have it be more equal when it comes to those two situations congressman Sherman you have a lot of good point a lot of insight and we appreciate you coming on the show thank you very much

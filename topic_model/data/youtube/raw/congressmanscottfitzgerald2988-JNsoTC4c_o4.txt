[Music] [Applause] welcome back to wake up America violent crime continues to go unchecked by the Biden Administration Nationwide as a result police officers are retiring in droves for more we are joined by Wisconsin Congressman Scott Fitzgerald sir thank you for joining us the blue cities like Chicago New York La they're seeing the worst increases in crime but the left continues to be soft on crime yeah absolutely I mean what we saw last week on the floor of the house was a number of bills that the Democrats rolled out trying to just kind of save their own tales as they go into the November elections uh we know what they did they defunded the police they followed the lead of the squad and now they're trying to reverse that and the problem is uh that there are some long time effects on a lot of these Sheriff's departments Municipal police officers who are who are now saying Hey listen um you know I'm going to retire as you mentioned or they are having uh significant problems in trying to recruit new squads as they as they develop these uh these plans for new classes of police officers these people are so disgusting um you know it used to be that on the news we'd say oh Brazen crime or happening in broad daylight now that's the default this stuff happening you know you're out with your kids shopping here we got one from a Walgreens we were showing you another one at a jewelry store it's just unbelievable but this is this dystopia that the left wants this is the America they want here's the New York City subway right there again middle of the day congressman is this enough to offset abortion come November yeah I mean most of the polls that we're seeing and that the nrcc has been talking about is uh you know listen the abortion issue is somewhere about eight to ten percent of Americans are concerned about that when you start talking about crime it's 38 39 40 percent because that's what people are seeing on a daily basis uh you know the video that you're running is just the tip of the iceberg right we know that there's a significant amount of incidents that are happening in and around the major cities across this country that quite honestly uh you know no one wants to make the arrest and then even if they do you've got these soft DA's across the country that are uh not willing to follow through with the charges and if they do then then you've got issues related to bail so it's it's kind of a Cascade of of really horrible things that are happening right now across the country yeah congressman only it's also happening in smaller cities too we're seeing it across the country but what I heard President Biden say recently is that it's important to fund the police so it really seems that some Democrats are taking the opposite way because they're seeing how important uh and this crime issue is we've got 30 seconds your reaction yeah yeah I mean some of the political ads that are running right now the hypocrisy is just unbelievable how you know these Democrat members of Congress have just worked tirelessly to make sure it was more funding for the police it's laughable it really is Congressman yes or no have you seen that that Dahmer Series in your home state Jeffrey Dahmer on Netflix have you watched that yet I have not yeah very familiar obviously with the horrendous crimes that were committed decades ago but yeah I've not seen it actually in and around Milwaukee um it's it's it's very interesting and the timing is is fascinating as well with crime uh happening all over the country uh Congressman Fitzgerald great to see you have a good weekend thank you thank you good to be with you all right

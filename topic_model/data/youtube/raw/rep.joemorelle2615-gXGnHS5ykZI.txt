earlier uh today i was with a constituent susan susan is 72 years old she's not working not because she gets to enjoy a comfortable retirement but because of disability from spinal stenosis a condition that puts significant pressure on the spinal column and greatly restricts movement on top of that susan has diabetes and a host of other medical challenges no doubt made more difficult by the spinal stenosis she relies on 10 different medications the cost is astronomical she used a term today in our conversation i had not heard before drug hopping she said she does a number of things first is she'll take half a a pill instead of a full pill she'll also go through the ten different medications that she's on and she sort of prioritizes what she can take at any given moment she has a heart condition so she takes the heart drug every day she said because she wants to keep on living the other drugs she sort of parses out not according to the dosage given to her by her doctor but what she can afford

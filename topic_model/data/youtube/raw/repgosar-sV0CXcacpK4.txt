[Music] hi this is faith graham reporting the gosar minute here in washington dc i wanted to share my personal experience regarding conservatives being harassed on college campuses i am a freshman at american university known to be the most liberal school in the country i'm also a proud conservative republican this is my first semester at american and it has been anything but what a college experience should be like when i was 13 years old i had the privilege to speak at a trump rally i've also been blessed to meet many prominent republican leaders pictures of me with president trump and other republican leaders are on my instagram page triggered some woke students at american learned of my instagram account and sent it around the campus making me infamous i also have a trump sticker on my car a cardinal send to my fellow open-minded peers at au as a result students have vandalized my car four times wow the tolerant left i guess i live in their heads rent free my affiliation with being a ghost our minute anchor has also received attention not in a good way on campus i get people telling me that they are emailing the school about how i need to be expelled or have actions taken against me for my working for such a horrible man which is one of the furthest things from the truth this past week a mob of students at au decided to harass me at my own dorm they were banging on my door filming me shouting at me and making a mockery of me all because i'm conservative they left only to gather more students to join the mob and came back to further harass me these students were laughing and found it amusing to target me for my conservative views i would like to make a special note to thank all of the individuals that stood up and defended me despite our differences i reported this incident to the school and so far i have not been made aware of any disciplinary actions towards the students involved in the mob i will not be attending au any longer i really believe that au and other college campuses need to be aware as to what happens to conservatives on campus there are many students that tell me that they were afraid to join college republicans because they don't want that target on their back i'm a proud conservative a proud republican and a proud american at the end of the day we are all americans harassing an individual just for their beliefs is what tears this country down and divides us i plead with american university to make a statement to not tolerate this behavior and for those involved to receive disciplinary actions congressman gosar had this to say quote it is disturbing and wrong that an important member of my team is being harassed simply because of her conservative beliefs in christian faith american university has failed repeatedly to protect her safety and has done nothing about the sustained harassment she has faced no one should be subject of such intolerance i implore the administration and faculty of american university to immediately condemn this behavior and pledge to protect the students from assault harassment and bullying close quote i am tired of the double standard i'm tired of the constant defense i'm tired of the hatred the hypocrisy the lack of authority and i'm tired about feeling limited because i'm proud of who i am i am not the only one this has been faith graham a proud conservative with the gosar minute

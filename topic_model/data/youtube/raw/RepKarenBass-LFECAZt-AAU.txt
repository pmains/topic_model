African American History Month is always a very positive thing and it's important because it's an opportunity to lift up the contributions that black Americans have made to u.s. history I do long for the day when it's not really needed because African Americans would be completely incorporated into US history but we haven't achieved that day yet representative bass chairs the Congressional Black Caucus bass believes there is no American history without black history and she sees it as a living history with notables such as Stacey Abrams becoming the first African American woman to deliver the official response to the State of the Union address she also points to more personal she rose my role models oh so many people you know for example the woman that was in Congress before me congresswoman Diane Watson is absolutely a role model she is a person that recruited me to run for office the first time and also to run for her seat when she decided to retire and I call on her right away because I think she's a wonderful example of a woman reaching back to a younger woman and saying come on aboard one that I always look to is Harriet Tubman Harriet Tubman who was an enslaved woman who devoted her life to freeing other Africans who were enslaved and she was a soldier and I've always appreciated her leadership the role she played in history bass made history herself as a leader breaking barriers when I was in the legislature my last term I was elected Speaker and I remember that race and it was very exciting but one of the things that was the most exciting was when they did the research and found that there hadn't been an african-american woman speaker anywhere in the country and so my election to the speakership in California was the first time an african-american woman had been elected speaker of any legislative body

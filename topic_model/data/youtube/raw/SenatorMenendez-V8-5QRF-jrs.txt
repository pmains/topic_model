thank you mr chairman and the ranking member uh for presiding uh over this nomination hearing one of the most important things we do as members of the committee is overseeing nominations and we need the help of all of our colleagues in getting to the nominees i appreciate both you and the ranking member for doing and thank you for the courtesy of being able to go first i have i have some other issues congratulations to the nominees before us today we thank you and all of your families for your service to our country let me take a few minutes of personal privilege to speak about michael schiffer who has been my longtime senior advisor and counselor on the center foreign relations committee he's one of the leading foreign policy mines in washington having also served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for east asia he's a respected expert on asia with the network of relationships across the continent i never forgot when i first started visiting asia when i was on the committee in 2006 and started going with michael to visit asia and it would be very interesting to me when heads of state including when i was chairman of the committee previously would say hello mr schiffer before they'd say hello to me so it just goes to the the depth of relationships he has i've long relied on michael's counsel expertise and judgment in dealing with some of the most vexing issues facing the committee and no one is more qualified or more deserving of this nomination than he is he's dedicated and committed to a values-based foreign policy that champions freedom human rights and democracy and he'll be a strong advocate for those principles across the continent and will work to ensure that aids programming reflect our values and our interests and he is someone who doesn't hesitate to speak his mind stories about his willingness to speak truth to power abound but don't worry michael i won't share them here today but it's an important quality that will serve him well in the executive branch as he ensures that usaid has a seat at the table and the voice in the interagency process is precisely that kind of leadership that we need in the administration today someone that knows the right approach and assistance to asia and how to get it there so i appreciate all of those great assets and i will not continue with my remarks on you because then my time will be eaten up for questions so i'll include them for the record thank michael thank you for your excellent uh work with us uh mr fick uh to be uh the ambassador at large for cyberspace and digital diplomacy is the new frontier for us the state department unveiled the unveiled the bureau of cyberspace and digital diplomacy in april this year last week the committee introduced a state department authorization of 2022 which contains a version of the cyber diplomacy act that would authorize the cdb bureau in statute and thus support its long-term viability what would be your top priorities as ambassador at large for the bureau if it finds its footing in the department thank you senator uh for the question and also for having me here today uh i have three uh immediate top priorities and i think of them as concentric rings moving from innermost to outermost because the bureau is new the first and innermost priority is building the team and establishing a culture both in the bureau in and in the department where a fluency and expertise in digital technologies is seen as important to the careers and futures of career foreign service officers and members of the civil service i can imagine a future where any candidate to be a chief of mission uh is expected to have an understanding of these issues because they're a substrate that cut across every aspect of our foreign policy the second priority the second ring moving outward is to assert the state department's rightful place in the interagency process on topics of cyber security and digital policy uh and then third are all of the policy challenges out there in the world uh the wolf closest to the door so to speak in my view is uh the russian invasion of ukraine uh and the threats and opportunities it provides in the digital space for us and then i believe our strategic competition with china along digital lines is is probably the defining uh strategic question of of my generation well i'm glad to hear your say about making sure that the equities of the state department at the table in the interagency process are are honed because from my perspective sometimes the state department doesn't get its due as it relates to its critical role in the context of the interagency process so that'll be an important one and i hope that you will upon confirmation create a productive relationship with this committee this committee has members that are very interested in this domain and want to engage with you in the days ahead i commit to that sir and if i may mr chairman one other question uh uh [Music] miss cohonin kohonen is i pronounce it correctly okay the trans-sahel count to terrorism partnership program act of 2021 which is law which i sponsored not only calls for a strategy for the sahel it calls for a specific strategy for mali as part of the overall approach we had a hearing where representatives from state dod and usaid share the administration's approach and as i mentioned at that time we looked to have input into the strategy as a result of that hearing could you briefly outline for me the draft five-year strategy from mali how does that strategy differ from the approach of previous administrations with respect to balancing the so-called 3ds in mali

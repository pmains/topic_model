thank you mr chairman um this job creators detest uncertainty and let's make one thing clear this regulation this proposed regulation does not provide certainty now in the spirit of the super bowl upcoming let me explain with an analogy if a quarterback knew what defense was going to be put up against him he knew with certainty with defense he would logarithmically likely be able to move the ball down the field much more easily if he knew with certainty what he faces and this is what applies to this regulation it provides no certainty to the business community let me give you three examples and you've already heard from our two or two chairman talk about that but let me reinforce it again the rule results in potentially conflicting federal and state requirements federal judges in neighboring jurisdictions could make contradictory decisions regarding compliance but more damaging is on page 18 of the rule it says in quote this rule defers a final determination until additional information is available that's not acceptable how many times must we there be a final determination that coal ash is not hazardous and be handled in a different way in 112 113 congresses the house passed legislation codifying the conclusions that were rendered in the 93 and 2000 reports offered by the epa certain that we're trying to develop certainty certainly not just the business community but to the health of the people we're trying to protect in fact mr stanislaus and i thank you very much because we've had a good working relationship you said in 2013 that the legislation that we passed was something that you could work with that's what we want to keep working with we want to keep that relationship going to come up with certainty how that could go so the bottom line unfortunately is we have a regulation that doesn't provide certainty it would be wise for the committee to once again pass the legislation that we've done over the last two years and bring closure to this issue thank you and i yield back my time gentlemen

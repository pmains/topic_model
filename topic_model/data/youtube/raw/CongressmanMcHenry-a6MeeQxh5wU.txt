worries and as a result because i i okay i didn't find that your answer anyway satisfying but there here are the stories from my constituents michael from conover had waited for hours to first log on and then it took him hours to set up an account on the federal exchange and then unfortunately with the repairs over the weekend saw it deleted so we had to start over again this week mike from hickory saw his premiums rise from 388 dollars to 650 um phil from forest city saw an increase even though the policy was unchanged saw an increase of 42 percent phil from forest city and he's determined that the policy may actually be worse than it was previously erica and her three kids saw their premiums rise from 481 dollars to 847 matthew from asheville saw his premiums rise 285 percent curtis from shelby saw his premiums double from essentially double from 549 to seventy seven dollars so when people talk about obamacare and all the rhetoric here in washington and what we see out of the irs and the implementation here i'm more concerned about the families are impacted in my district we don't we want people to have access to affordable health insurance but these rates are simply not affordable and the fact that the irs is a huge implementing agency does not actually give my constituents any great deal of reassurance about the federal role here and so with that i yield back i thank the gentleman now go to the gentleman from illinois

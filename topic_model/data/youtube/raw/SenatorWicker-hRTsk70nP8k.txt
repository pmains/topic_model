as we've said neither of the senators who were speaking out against President Trump today are running for re-election but earlier this afternoon I spoke to a Republican senator who is still on the ballot next year and who is potentially facing a primary challenge of his own it's Republican senator Roger wicker of Mississippi well let me say this I get the sense that this divide is less about policy and more about style pugilism whatever you want to call it what a be because I'm old enough to remember when Jeff Flake was the conservative in any race that he would get involved in and when every conservative truly conservative groups that you know these groups well whether it's Club for Growth who you know Jeff Flake was a guy that if he got criticism from Washington it was because they thought he was being too stubborn on fiscal issues you know not not a team player enough but from the right so this is not about ideology it's about character does the president's character bother you well I'm for one thing I think Jeff Flake is has always been a strong conservative and still is you mentioned a divide and Chuck I would just have to say there's not much of a divide in in the Republican Conference in the United States Senate we have our eyes own own some pretty big achievements and as a matter of fact the president talked about them today and there there's a popular misconception that this nine months of the Trump administration hasn't accomplished much with this Republican majority and he went chapter and verse to sort of celebrate the things that we have been able to do and so I would challenge the premise of your question that there is a divide certainly there have been two or three people who have been outspoken in our conference but that luncheon today was comprised of a bunch of allies who are trying to move us in in a better direction for the United States and who appreciate the president's leadership so does the president's character because this is what is obviously the issue for senators flake and corker does this character bother you does it bother you the way the president conducts himself in office this is not about policy positions I think it's pretty clear this is about character well okay you you have you have characterized their statements as as dealing with the president's character I wouldn't do that again I'm in a disadvantage because I didn't I haven't read the book I've only read excerpts of it and I don't know what the speech today said but I think I think most of us in the conference are very comfortable with the direction that this chief executive of our nation and this head of our party wants to take us we needed we need to tackle tax reform and then we need to get back to repealing and replacing Obamacare and we need to put some more judges on the bench and and get the president's team in place ninety-five percent of us are united on that it's interesting the way you framed Senator Jeff Flake you said he should have known the backlash to his book do you feel like you have to tether you probably do I guess some way by question do you feel like you have to tiptoe around the president you have to be careful how you criticize them because you're afraid of what he might do on Twitter know the answer to that is no so what do you you seem to say that it was flake that provoked him well okay Jeff wrote a book he didn't even tell his staff he was doing it it was quite provocative based on the the excerpts and the news articles I've seen about it and he obviously knew that this was going to be a bombshell I mean you don't think the president has played a role in this you think it was necessary the president didn't take the high road with bob Corker today I don't know what exchanges took place today after the lunch on Bamba bob Corker I will say this I do not see how this chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee thinks this exchange is helpful to American foreign policy and I haven't asked Bob about that but right if he had asked me advice I would have counseled against getting into this sort of spitting contest is it gonna be hard for you to explain to constituents why bob Corker keeps his committee chairmanship why john mccain who's been critical keeps his do you think that should be a litmus test that if you get into at some point is should there be a litmus test when it comes to a committee chairmanship Chuck I don't think that's being discussed okay be a question being asked but by the press and not some of the blog's but we don't operate as a dictatorship in in the Republican Conference and that's I really have not heard that discussed among among members and when your name comes up for primary challenges one of the things that people remind I think some of your staff is Rahmani you voted with the president some I'm gonna say ninety four ninety five percent of time I don't have the exact figure in front of me I think it's a ninety five point nine Oh fair enough 95.9 to be exact but let me ask you this Chris McDaniel who may challenge you in a primary he would say you're fireball offense is sticking by Mitch McConnell how would you answer that question well I would say I'm going to run hard for re-election as I always have I'm gonna run on my accomplishments which are numerous and we're gonna take the race seriously but we're prepared to run and if we have a general election or a primary opponent I'm gonna I'm gonna make the cases I always have done and where are you on Mitch McConnell you think it stays leader and as a matter of fact the president today would chapter in verse about the the numbers of ways that that the leader had helped the president helped his team helped his agenda not the least of which is the way we were absolute stalwarts during 2016 on on the supreme court issue and actually made the presidential election the direction of the Supreme Court for for the next generation I think you can look at that leadership and I was glad to be part of it right and you could say that Neil Gorsuch is a member of the Supreme Court now because of the team that we put together and the fact that we we were steadfast in refusing to take up President Obama's nominee and I know the president called you among a couple other senators to reassure you that if Steve Bannon wants to run against you are you confident President Trump is going to support you no matter who runs against you I would sure hope so and of course that's been reported I I declined to comment to the press about any phone call but let me just say I do support the president's program and I have the votes to prove it and I would certainly welcome his support and suggestions and and good wishes as I run for re-election senator Roger wicker Republican from Mississippi I will leave it there sir thanks for coming on thank you she ate it

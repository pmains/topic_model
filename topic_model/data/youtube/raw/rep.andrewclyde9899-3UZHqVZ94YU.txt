Georgia Congressman Andrew Clyde is leading the charge of 16 House Republicans and calling for the resignation of Sam Britton who was recently put on leave following the charges of felony theft Britain who is non-binary holds the title of Deputy assistant Secretary of Energy he works for secretary Jennifer granholm he's admitted to stealing a suitcase worth well over two thousand dollars in a letter to secretary granholm Congressman Clyde wrote Britain's actions along with your Department's lack of transparency when dealing with this matter raise concerns as to the Biden administration's priorities when appointing high-ranking officials the department of energy is refusing to say if Britain is still being paid while out on leave Congressman Clyde joins us right now Congressman uh you have demanded full transparency and responses you put in your letter uh by no later than December 20th so first I want to ask you what happens if that deadline passes and you haven't gotten a response and second walk us through kind of what troubles you about this in other words you have an official they're charged with something um and and it seems like people are saying we should rush in this this person should be fired is that is that a fair assessment Sean that is exactly correct and thank you for uh having me on but here we have a senior government official uh in charge of a nuclear waste program that has exercised extremely poor judgment and as a result you know has stolen a suitcase uh and it has been charged with a felony has admitted that that that that they he whatever um took this suitcase and has been put on leave honestly this person should be fired they're in no way should a person with this kind of a lack of judgment should be making policy decisions for the Department of energy and the secretary should fire this individual immediately and I I fully expect an answer to our letter because this is inexcusable conduct it just shows another soft on crime uh you know the policies of the Democrat Administration they have no respect for the law Congressman your letter was co-signed by 15 other House Republicans as Sean said but outside of those 15 is their support within the party for Brenton's resignation oh I think so uh we we didn't put the letter out for very long we could have gotten a whole lot more folks on it I think but I believe there's a lot of support for uh you know for upholding the law and keeping our our uh departments within the executive branch accountable to the law that's what this is all about so what what is it I mean you you say December 20th do you expect any kind of response or do you think they're just gonna blow this off and say well he deserves or they deserve their day in court yeah they he whatever um uh I fully believe that we will get a response but if we do not remember well we will be in the in the majority on January the 3rd and then we will have subpoena power uh and um you know uh our majority is coming accountability is coming well Congressman speaking of majority in January I do want to shift to Kevin McCarthy's pursuit to become the next Speaker of the House a number of Republicans are not McCarthy's Corner they've been pretty vocal about it does he have your support and if so why why not well um I would tell you that right now Kevin McCarthy as we know publicly does not have the support of 218. you know what I think we should be doing is going back into conference and I think that we should be voting in conference uh until we get to someone who has 218 votes I think that's the right way to do it uh and I look forward to a continuing negotiations to see where we end up on January he doesn't have your support right now we'll know that on January 3rd okay so can I ask this though this is what is trying I'm trying to figure out is there something depending on who you talk to this is what I'm trying to figure out is there something that Kevin McCarthy could offer you and say uh that you would want in exchange for supporting him or is it a never Kevin situation that's what I'm trying to figure out are these people you and Gates and others are you never Kevin or is it hey if you agree to the following set of concessions that the freedom caucus wants we could support you is that where you where where are you on that Spectrum well this is not really a freedom caucus thing this is a conservative thing and you know we're demanding accountability uh one of the issues that we have is um the the issue of vacate the chair which is the way that the those who elect the speaker keep the speaker accountable and if the speaker is not accountable to those of us who elect them then they're the speaker is not accountable to those but to our constituents who elect us so you know it doesn't matter what additional rules you have if you don't have accountability from the speaker then you really have nothing and so you know so if if he gave you that I guess what I'm trying to figure out Congressman this is what is it if whatever concessions you want the the vacate the chair position in the rules package if he were to give you all of that would you then support him or are you particularly in a position where you're saying I I can't ever vote for him or are you willing to do it if he would actually asked some of those concerns you have well I have never said I will never vote for him okay um what I have said is that that you know there are things that that we as members demand of our speaker you know our speaker works for members members don't work for our speaker it's just like I work for my constituents my constituents don't work for me um and so there's an accountability thing there that that has to be uh fixed and we are not going to accept Nancy Pelosi's rules uh in in our Republican majority uh that's just not the way things work the way I look at it I want Congress to work well I want the the our leadership to be accountable to our to the people who who elect the leadership and I think that will make the Republican majority very unified and very strong because that's what we need we need unity and we will drive forward um Into The Binding Administration and expose the corruption there real quick before I let you go Andy Biggs has put his name in the Hat do you think that he could get the votes in January I I think we will see that on January the 3rd I'm I don't have a crystal ball but uh we'll see that all right keeping your cards close I can respect that Congressman thanks for being with us this evening appreciate your time as always thank you

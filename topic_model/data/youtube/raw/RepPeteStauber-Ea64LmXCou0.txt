hello everyone congressman pete sauber here i am grateful for this opportunity to update you all on what i have been doing during my first couple months in washington it has been just over 100 days since i was sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives in that time I have done a lot of learning listening and I am proud to share that great bipartisan work has already been accomplished on behalf of all of Minnesota I have teamed up with my colleague representative Angie Craig to fight for the passage of the idea Act which is full funding our special education because I believe that every student no matter the circumstance should be afforded the opportunity to succeed unfortunately the federal government is currently not meeting its funding obligation to students who have special education services and needs leaving many Minnesota students academically disadvantaged by fighting for this legislation together representative Craig and I will make sure the federal government lives up to the promises made to our students as one of the newest members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee I am committed to improving our state's network of roads roads bridges highways and airports I was actually the first freshman congressman from either party to pass a bill out of this committee in the hundred 16th Congress I am proud to say that my notice to Airmen zhh Act a bill to improve aviation safety is well on its way to becoming law I was also quick to build on the progress made by my predecessor congressman Rick Nolan by reintroducing a bill to reroute part of our nation's longest trail protecting conservation land and giving visitors more access to our region's scenic beauty and I am pleased to share the president Trump recently signed my North Country national scenic route Adjustment Act into law one of the biggest issues currently facing our nation is health care I believe Minnesotans need high quality affordable and accessible health care that is patient driven and physician guided unfortunately since Obamacare was enacted health care has steadily become less affordable I believe that we can and must do better than Obama however I recently voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting coverage for pre-existing conditions well I didn't particularly particularly like the tone of the resolution I don't believe you should strip Minnesotans of Obamacare's provision until a new and better health care law can be put in place before we repeal Obamacare both sides of the aisle must come together and work on a comprehensive plan that lowers costs increases access to quality health care and protects pre-existing conditions while I was on the campaign trail I made a promise to Minnesotans that I would protect coverage for those living with pre-existing conditions this is a promise I intend on keeping so I became a co-sponsor of House Resolution 692 the pre-existing conditions Protection Act regardless of what happens in the courts this legislation would ensure that coverage for pre-existing conditions is never eroded and to top it off the Trump administration officially signed that twin medals hard rock mineral leases moving twin medals a step closer to offering a mine plan of operation just this past week I was proud to be present as Department of Interior assistant secretary Joel polish signed these leases rightfully giving our miners the opportunity to meet and exceed all environmental standards in northern Minnesota mining is our past our present and our future which is which is why I remain committed to advocate for policies that allow for the responsible development of our natural resources after my first 100 days as your representative the message that I want you to hear is this I am just getting started I promise to continue to engage in respectful productive discussions and find common-sense solutions to the most pressing issues facing our state and our nation it is an honor to represent Minnesota's 8th congressional district if there's ever anything that you need from our office please do not hesitate to reach out to myself or a member of our staff our door is all we is open I am glad I had the opportunity to address you all have a good rest of your evening thank you

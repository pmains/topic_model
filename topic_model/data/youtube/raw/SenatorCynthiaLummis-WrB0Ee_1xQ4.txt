tell us senator cynthia lemus member environment and public works etc etc from the great state of wyoming center welcome to the show somebody said this is the first time on the show that's not possible is it you've been on radio yeah you and i have had several really nice visits larry it's wonderful to be back all right thank you man appreciate it very much um mitch mcconnell says republicans will block coveted unless it prohibits biden from repealing title 42. and senator i just want to ask you i was told today i didn't actually know this senator hagerty has an idea that would link fentanyl with title title 42 in other words change the rationale from kovid which should be essentially over if they're honest to a fentanyl problem what you think of that what can you tell us about this new idea i think it's a great idea uh the facts are that as these 200 000 plus migrants are coming across the border every month and more every single month they are bringing with them fentanyl enough to uh kill massive numbers of americans and certainly enough to sicken and addict a number of uh americans in states that are really hurting uh in terms of the growth in fentanyl use abuse and deaths so i think senator hagerty is on to something that's very serious legitimate and quantifiable uh and i hope he pursues it with vigor can you get a vote is he is he putting together a bill an amendment any legislative process you can help them with because i think it's a fabulous idea i really do yeah i agree and the fact that so many democrats have voiced concern about having title 42 repealed and creating a flood of additional immigrants coming across the border that we can't possibly catch that we can't possibly interdict increases the chance that more fentanyl will be coming across the border illegally and spread throughout the united states immediately as soon as title 42 is gone so i am delighted that senator hagerty has come up with this idea and i look forward to supporting it and i think you'll find some democrats that will support it as well what you think about my orcas saying in the testimony today that uh whatever 18 000 coming across the border illegally would pose a problem you think that's a nobel prize winning statement well it's certainly the truth it's an understatement i think now they've got about 8 000 coming across the border a day so that's obviously more than double uh and they can't deal with the numbers they're dealing with now let alone those massive increases in numbers and of course we telegraph this stuff to the criminal elements in mexico that are encouraging people to pay them to come across the border it encourages those who are trafficking humans trafficking drugs uh and uh trafficking uh problems including health problems to the united states so this is a very very serious issue sounding the alarm is something that republicans have to do because democrats unfortunately are underplaying it because the agenda of their party is an open border policy they simply don't believe in vetting these people yeah marcus is no genius uh what's wrong with just build the wall remain in mexico i mean this guy i don't know why he hadn't been fired you'd impeach him anyway last one for you ma'am um this uh so-called china compete bill now i i gotta tell you this whatever 250 billion dollars 50 billion dollars to bail out intel there's 200 billion dollars of private investment money already being put into the chip sector and there's so much nonsense and green new deal this is a boondoggle we should be cutting spending senator not raising spending and some republicans actually signed on to this kind of drive me crazy well it is more spending on climate than can possibly address climate in a meaningful or responsible way one of the problems we're encountering here in congress is that the response to climate change is to throw money at it in indiscriminate poorly vetted ways and then that it's sprinkled throughout the budgets it's in places you'd never know to look for it and it is being wasted larry completely wasted on things that will not move the needle on climate change so this is a program that needs a complete overhaul but it needs to be targeting on actual innovation that will move the needle and this will not well okay but i don't know why we have to have corporate welfare industrial policy picking winners and losers 250 billion actually the house version 350 billion i mean i think it's an outrage which we're just like this is big government socialism this is state control like china this is like we're trying to out china china and i just think it's a terrible idea yeah larry i wish you were back in the administration uh you'd be the voice of reason in a sea of unreasonableness well i appreciate that very much but i think this bill should be stopped it's going to come at a conference god knows what that's going to look like i mean i think it should be stopped it's gotten a free ride and it should be stopped yeah there will be motions they're called motions to instruct which is basically emotions on uh motions on ways to amend it i'm not sure this bill can be amended in a way that will make it worth oh well good then don't pass it heck yeah don't pass it republicans i don't have to tell you this i know you're against bill republicans should be against spending and against deficit spending and against money printing and against inflation you know cut taxes and deregulate and we'll whoop china we had them on the ropes i mean this other i'm sorry i don't mean i'm not picking on you i'm so happy you come on our show i'm just saying some of this stuff drives me a little bit crazy anyway senator cynthia lemus thank you man appreciate it very much i hope you come back soon thank you larry

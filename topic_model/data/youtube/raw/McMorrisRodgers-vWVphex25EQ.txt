congress has had very limited amount of time to act to ensure timber communities across the country are not negatively impacted by the oversight in the uh infrastructure investment and jobs act and while i expressed concerns about the package as a whole and the impact that this is having this um skype is this law is already having on skyrocketing inflation i'm glad that we have a three-year authorization of the secure rural schools program this is critical to ensure counties have more flexibility to determine the portion of srf srs funds that will go towards schools and roads resource advisory projects and forestry projects counties have not been able to shift their allocations in these three categories since 2012. additionally we were able to put a stop to annual srs funding decreases unfortunately current law set a deadline of august 1st for counties to select srs or timber payments as well as to make their allocations of srs funding to title 1 title 2 title 3 of the srs program roads and schools rack and forestry projects the infrastructure package wasn't signed into law until november 11 2021 well past the august first deadline and now counties are facing a situation where they will default to srs payments regardless of whether they have chosen timber receipts in the past and default to an eighty percent allocation for title one the roads and schools program for fy21 payments it's a losing situation for all counties we have a solution h.r 6435 this bill would preserve county's current elections for fy21 payments and open the process for new elections beginning in fy 2022 this isn't a perfect solution as i know many counties would prefer the opportunity to change their elections for fy21 now however i believe that we need to act as quickly as possible to pass a measure that protects all counties from facing default allocations in fy21 i greatly appreciate my colleagues support on this bill as well as the work that the forest service has done to raise this issue and protect timber communities and i hope that we can move this bill to the floor for a vote as soon as possible and thank you for the time today uh to everyone on the resources committee appreciate your attention to this issue i yield back gentlemen

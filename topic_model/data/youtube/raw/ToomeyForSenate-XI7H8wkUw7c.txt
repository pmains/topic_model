alright so who's lying here joining me now with reaction all this is says thanks opponent in the november senate election former GOP congressman pat toomey cars weren't good to see it thanks for being here i should i say senator well not yet the White House lawyers looked at it this is nothing to worry about here oh well I beg to differ on that and as I've suggested you know Joe Sestak and I fundamentally disagree on just about every policy issue of the day he's got a hundred percent voting record with Nancy Pelosi supports the whole big left would lurch agenda that's what we ought to be talking about but this has become a big distraction so I think he ought to come clean clear the air before coming alright I read your statement from yesterday it sounded benign to me and you said he should come clean we should talk about the issues that matter and I thought it would be if it was my opponent I think I'd be a little stronger I think I'd say one of the two is lying either he offered a job or did it wasn't offered a job now David Axelrod said that this would constitute a Axelrod's words a serious breach of law this is this politics or is this about law well you know if if Joe is going to be the man of principle then he says he's going to be in this campaign I think he would be more forthcoming and I've said so and I think you ought to do that right all right so buddy so he said he's admitted that they offered him a job he said it repeatedly doing okay so now the question is he won't tell the people of Pennsylvania or the country what job was offered so is that what he needs to come clean on I think he should relay this conversation who did he have a conversation with and what was he offered and and then let the chips fall where they fall if a crime was committed then we ought to know that we ought to pursue that and if it wasn't if it doesn't rise to that level because of the nature of the conversation okay then we can put this all behind us and focus on the important issues we ought to be  if in fact what Sestak is saying is true and they offered him a job a high-ranking job to get out of this primary you know what you've been reading all about it I'm sure you're following more closely than anybody do you see any legal issues yes it seems to me if it if it actually transpired that way there is there is a federal statute that forbids offering a job in return for political favors yeah all right now Eric Holder is actually saying no special counsel well you know it they're making it hard to get to the bottom of this aren't they well they're refusing to appoint a special counsel there darrell Issa is asking for one in this particular case ki think at some point they're going to have to come clean Otis Robert Gibbs get to do is dance for another you know five months you know I think it's looking increasingly like there's something that they're trying to hide and if they would come clean on this I think we'd all be better off and so hopefully that's what will happen but i'm not sure what it will take Shawn I we're going to get into the actual legal aspect of this do you think it would be possible and I guess this is speculation on your part that a high-ranking member of the Obama administration would be able to make an offer for a high-profile job to get Sestak out of the race without the president's approval is that possible you know it's a good question I don't know I don't know how they're operating within the White House I don't know what sort of chain of command they're following you know I don't know it's a legitimate question are we getting to the point what did the president know and when did he know it if he knew anything about it but but apparently somebody at the White House did they've acknowledged that a conversation occurred all right let's talk a little bit about some of the differences Pennsylvania always a hard state for a Republican statewide to win why do you think that you have a such a good shot this year the polls have shown that you've done so far you've been doing pretty well we're doing great Sean and the fact is most pennsylvanians understand that the federal government has gone off the tracks here way too much spending huge growth in government you know serial bailouts of failing companies nationalizing whole industries unprecedented deficits and debt cap and trade card check government-run health care and Joe Sestak supports that entire agenda and as only criticism of the individual items on that agenda has been when they don't go far enough that's not where Pennsylvania is we need to get our fiscal house in order we've got to get spending under control we've got to create job growth in the private sector as a guy who is a small business owner I know how to do that and i think pennsylvania voters want that kind of change when we go back to when you challenged arlen specter when he was a republican back in what six years ago right a lot of establishment Republicans didn't support you and you were the by far the more conservative candidates true that we saw what happened with Arlen Specter what he thoughts at all inspector today well I think our inspector stayed around a little too long he could have gone out as a you know a widely respected man for having since spent a lot of time and given a lot of service but he you know had to go for one more race and I think he overstayed his welcome all right Patti we're going to be watching this race very very closely appreciate it was there a violation of law here plenty more hannity coming up straight ahead

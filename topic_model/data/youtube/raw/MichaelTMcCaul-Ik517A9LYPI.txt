Aaron in following up with my good friend from Virginia mr. Connolly yeah chairman mulund himself stated that the hakan e network is operating with Pakistan support Secretary Clinton warned the president of Pakistan about this recently I was in Pakistan last November we talked to President Zardari about this but in his terms he said we don't pick and choose between terrorist organizations we go after the mall so I see a bit of a conflict and of course we get briefed on this I said well they have the terrorists that are in the good bin and those in the bed been and so where does the truth lie I guess mr. Feldman you're the man of the hour I in the man of the hour sir as chairman said and as I was attempting to try said before the he expressed the administration's view that continuing safe havens are extremely troubling and we have to see action taken against them but he also emphasized in the exact same testimony that we need to continue to stay engaged to be able to do that and he cautioned against signs of disengaging with with Pakistan well and then also the report came out that the county was behind the Afghan attacks against the US envoy just last well in april of this year yes now they're killing our soldiers and the idea that the Pakistanis could be complicit and working with them which I personally believe is true is very troubling to policymakers like ourselves and particularly when it comes to foreign aid could can you see could the Secretary certify today that the Pakistani government is in no way working with a County network well that that's that's one of the certification that we're working through right now and on a staff level and we don't have an answer for you at this point but we are taking that certification which I know you you've been quite involved with very very seriously and and trying to look at it as as as soberly as possible look we need to be in a position where in every engagement with the Pakistanis we can continue you to show the need for increased cooperation on extremists including among the high Network which are which pose a threat to to both of us and there's clearly more that could be done but the way that we continue to try to get this done is to increase engagement and as Secretary Clinton said when she was there last it's through issues like the financing networks on Intelligence Sharing on working with law enforcement personnel to deny safe haven and we raised this at every opportunity at every level in all of our engagement and I totally agree with the engagement issue I just think again when it comes to being able to certify whether or not Pakistan ISI or government at any level is working with the county it sounds like this is a work in progress within the administration in terms of whether or not they can certify that question it's needed work in progress but i can tell you very honestly it's still happening at the staff level where we're collecting all the data and looking at the range of criteria are you aware of any evidence that they are cooperating in working there's a there's a range of evidence and depending on the certification for the steps that they have taken countering extremism and terrorism including on taliban including on Quetta Shura and and less on the Hakone network but were but continued efforts to try to encourage jodan courage to continue that pressure I know the secretary is very good at that she's smart I know she's putting that pressure on when echo the chairs comments about trade we met President Zardari and I just want to pass this along he said I really what I want is more trade not aid and we had dinner with some Pakistani businessman who are working with the Indians and there are actually now some pretty closer business ties between Pakistan and India which I think long term it will resolve a lot of this tension between the two countries is caused so many problems for us here as well last question I want to ask them miss Seb visible in Herat there's been kind of an experiment going on with that five different things healthcare water food and jobs and training job training in education to kind of have a more holistic approach to our aid to that area in Afghanistan USAID there have been a lot of the problems with the way it sits I think functioned in Afghanistan this has been a sort of joint project with USAID and the NGOs and I would ask that you look at what's going on in Herat as a potential model for the rest of the country I don't know if you're familiar with what's going on there or not or if you can comment on that I would defer to my colleague Alex theer on mr. chair yeah hi thank you I'm not obviously certain which project you're referring to I have been to Herat recently and if you've been Herat is the place in Afghanistan when you visit you think if the rest of the country could look like this in a decade we'd be doing well so I endorsed the notion that there have been some very successful programs there and I want to link it to this broader issue which is that her odd is a trading City it has always been a trading City and its strength is drawn from the fact that that they have very successfully in the last 10 years rebuilt trade relations going in in every direction which i think is contributing to the prosperity of the city and one of the things that we're really trying to do in Afghanistan in that part as well as other parts is to really provide these tools of self-sufficiency so that more Afghans are building their own sustainable livelihoods rather than depending on I would ask that you look at that model and see what they're doing they're just working even the Taliban is some Taliban members have come back to the village saying we want to join you because we don't like or what they're doing it just for five bucks a day a lot of these guys and they don't want to be with the Taliban know the top leaders you know they are who they are but I think we can win back a lot of the Afghan people through that

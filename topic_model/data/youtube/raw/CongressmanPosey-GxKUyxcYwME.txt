thank you madam chair I've hesitated to weigh in on this issue too deeply over the years for a number of reasons it's one of those cases where it seems like everybody in the room knows how to make a baby stop crying but the person holding it you know this this flood insurance issue is not rocket science it's you know not not really difficult proposition to understand the national participation rate as we heard earlier is 31 percent you have 31 percent of the people paying for a hundred percent of the losses do the math if there's good actuarial you're going to do be taken into shorts every single year and that's what we've been doing with NFIP in Florida the participation rate is forty six point two percent and and just compare just for example in my County where I live the average premium for private flood insurance is $209 NFIP is $501 the median is 100 dollars a year the poor sapore that own a home could afford that for flood insurance is 388 and there's a number ways they make that affordable and i and i'd like madam chairman if we could have a hearing one at some time or a discussion I'd like to bring some experts up here and explain how they do it in Florida not that you should do everything like Florida does but you know there's there's a number of reasons that people don't participate in this system you know they they they don't know they're not covered by their homeowners insurance policy they don't think that they have a risk they don't understand the necessity of it there's a lot of good reasons for that mr. Heydrich your agency is located on a barrier island and so you know the importance of your customers understanding what the risk is in your experience how has increasing the availability of private flood options affected I would say most significantly and most literally stands out in my mind is immediately after Hurricane ARMA if you recall the weather predictions or the storm surge predictions for Southwest Florida were dire 15 foot storm surge as far as 10 miles inland I had a number of calls many many calls in the two months following Hurricane ARMA from clients who told me that they remember the conversation that we had about flood insurance and primarily access flood insurance most of these customers did have a primary flood insurance policy and many of them through the NFIP but they realized how much exposure they had and how real that felt and came to the conclusion that they may have overestimated their tolerance for risk at the time that we were initially discussing the coverage and then went on to buy either an excess policy or a private policy that would offer them the ability to fully insure the value of their home and a single coverage you know the the standard joke right here and if I pee before every time it means we cut the sales commission for the people that broker the good stuff who have to service it when times get bad how do you think that affects them working a reduction to compensation in any application is going to reduce availability and so a reduction in agent Commission's is probably going to drive some number of agents out of the program the NFIP is incredibly complex it's way more complex miss Lam you talk about the problems getting good Maps have you ever asked to use the Department of Defense Maps they've got every inch of this country map they know every crook and Nanni every area every swale every everything National geodetic service probably the same Homeland Security probably saying we have pulled some information from multiple resources those maps have been made available to us we've made some requests but the complexity of a flood insurance rate map and the modeling is a little different than what some of the others yeah but most of the people selling private flood insurance or a broker and private red insurance or insuring private insurance in Florida I don't use those bogus Maps anyway the NFIP arbitrarily puts people in puts them out they all had the same rate there's no waited for risk I mean it's ridiculous that's not how we're gonna solve the problem you know but the only risk to NFIP that going more to the private market would would give yes it would stop NFIP from going further in the hole and being a burden on the taxpayers the covers have really be more affordable for more people if we would do that and and I and I want to share with you while insurance companies are used for standard homeowners insurance policies and storms to use a 100 or 150 year term either forecast they have to use a 400 year catastrophe for flood insurance when they go to their reserves so it's you know it's not you know a bait-and-switch and and and mr. O'Mara you you indicate we should have all our rates based on the future effects of climate change and ocean riding stuff that's kind of like making me be rated as a driver 20 years ago from now and I'm 90 I mean that's ridiculous so thank you madam chair I yield back

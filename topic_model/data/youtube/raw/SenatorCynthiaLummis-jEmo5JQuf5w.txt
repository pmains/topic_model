chairman um Mr Speer welcome to the committee um I have concerns that creating a national low carbon fuel standard will only Galvanize efforts to enact another anti-consumer regulatory scheme such as phasing out liquid fuels through electrification mandates or Banning heavy duty diesel engines do you share this concern and are there examples of such efforts in the states that have already enacted their own low carbon fuel standards there are thank you Senator as I mentioned uh previously we we had litigated done in California and Oregon largely because of the impact that it would have on our industry particularly you know medium-sized companies with 20 trucks or fewer down to owner operators and those are folks that that pay at the retail at the pump they don't have fuel contracts so the impact that this has on inflating the cost of diesel in those States and in those areas is is quite measurable it's a second largest cost drain under labor and so this is a make or break issue in terms of keeping them out on the road moving Freight Those costs generally will be reflected in what consumers pay your constituents so it needs to be a gradual process that takes into account the fact that we are already facing 40-year highs in inflation so this is just an additive on top and reflected in the fuel prices seven dollars exceeding in California nearly 650 in Oregon those are the highest in the country so we definitely are going to defend our membership when that happens well President Biden recently noted in his State of the Union Address that the U.S would continue to need liquid fuels for at least the next 10 years is is that a statement that you agree with I think it's going to be a little longer than 10 Senator I really do I I believe we'll get there as I said in my opening remarks I I firmly believe that that we will transition in time but it has to be inclusive the timeline has to be realistic and the targets have to be achievable for that to happen I think this mad rush to zero is going to be very impactful not just in state economies but the national economy so something we're very mindful I think if we Pace ourselves and let the market work its will we will get to zero well I know people in Wyoming are concerned because electronic vehicles are tested at sea level which Wyoming is not uh tested on flat ground which Wyoming is not tested at you know 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit which Wyoming rarely is in fact today at zero degrees again uh in uh in in Casper Wyoming so those factors uh change the distance one can travel on a charge dramatically and I don't think that that is well understood so hopefully we can bring some of those factors to light in the coming months Mr Cooper thank you for being here as well as you know the EPA issued what's called their set rule which among other things set rvo limits for the next three years and propose to create a pathway for electric vehicles participation in the RFS I'm concerned with how the EPA is proposing that auto oems generate e-rings what's your level of concern with the Erin's proposal from EPA well thank you for the question Senator and and we share your concern with the way that EPA is proposing to allow electricity into the RFS program we're not opposed to the inclusion of electricity in the RFS but it's got to be done right and and we share your concern that in the case of these erends the generator of those credits would be the automaker like Tesla and that's completely different completely inconsistent with how rent credit generation is done across any other fuel that is regulated under the RFS and so that that gives us some concern we're also concerned with the way that EPA would allow those automakers to benefit from what's called book and claim accounting which is essentially you know the automaker is going to sign a contract with a renewable electricity producer could be thousands of miles away and when that electron enters the grid the automaker gets to claim that carbon reduction benefit from that electron you know whether it it ever is used to fuel an electric vehicle or not and so we have some concerns with inconsistent application of that accounting practice now I may have to spend a little more time with you Mr Cooper to better understand that but I appreciate it Happy to making me aware of that uh do you believe epa's proposal aligns with Congressional intent when it created the RFS nearly two decades ago that is another concern we have as we look at the statutory intent of the RFS program and our understanding of that intent it was all about stimulating the production and use of renewable fuels not necessarily about stimulating the production and use of certain vehicle Technologies we think if if you all in Congress had intended the program to drive certain vehicle Technologies you you would have been more explicit about that and is it appropriate for EPA to combine their e-rin's rulemaking with uh 2023 through 2025 rvos we have asked in in the comments we just submitted to EPA last week that they uh severed that portion of the proposal or that portion of the rulemaking from the the actual volume requirements we think EPA should move ahead with finalizing those volume requirements but it sounds like they need more time to really figure out this e-ren proposal and to make sure they're getting it right so we we would prefer to see EPA separate those two parts of the proposal from one another Mr chairman I want to thank all of our Witnesses for being here today thank you for helping educate and inform the committee I yield back you back on Mark on your comments well one of the things when uh during the State of the Union Address when uh President Biden mentioned this one decade goal um I I thought about how without permitting reform we don't stand a chance because one of the largest wind energy facilities in the country has been developed in Wyoming by Philip and shoots and it took him over 10 years just to acquire the transmission line right away and there's additional permitting that needs to be done there so even for people who desire to move to electric vehicles and that can power houses and out of the garage if there's no electricity available uh it is because of the permitting burdens that come with building transmission lines it's just an unachievable goal so I think that even for people who aspire to President Biden's goal that that should become a priority

president I rise today to talk about something that's really important and not I think to our nation and our planet but to me personally and to to my my family is a co-chair and co-founder along with Senator John Bozeman of Arkansas of the Senate recycling caucus I'm proud to stand side by side and with all the members of our caucus on the the matter of recycling and its importance today Sinha Bozeman and I have introduced a resolution to commemorate tomorrow November 15th as America Recycles day and I like to say that every day should be America Recycles day and for a lot of families that's that's what it is I don't have any idea how many millions or tens of millions of families recycle every day there's a lot of people and we need even even more but for more than two decades communities across our country have come together on November 15th and they do so to observe America Recycles day and to celebrate their commitment to recycling first I want to thank all those who worked hard to make America's recycles day a success for all these years I have been a huge advocate of recycling for the past 250 years first recycled I think when I was a lieutenant j.g in the Navy stationed in California Moffett Field California was close to Palo Alto and took my recyclables to a warehouse there in in Palo Alto and and never stopped I don't know the one in Palo Alto anymore but we recycle all over teller and frankly when I go around the country and recycle recycled on a train this morning somewhere around Baltimore coming down from from from Wilmington but I really welcome the opportunity to collaborate guys I want to say about a decade more than a decade ago with the senator Olympia Snowe of Maine and together we helped create the Senate recycling caucus in 2000 and sent and six and the sense of retirement of Senator Snowe six years ago I've been fortunate enough to have as my running mate my co-chair senator Bozeman of Arkansas and this a year alone our caucus has held four briefings to learn more about the current state of recycling and in this in this country and to discuss ways in which the federal government might play an even more important role in encouraging additional recycling in the years to come the state local governments are heavily involved in recycling and there's a huge role for them and ongoing I say this is former governor huge an important role for state and local governments to be involved in this but there's also opportunities for the federal government to play a constructive role and we're doing that and hopefully we'll be able to do that even better in the days to come my sister and I were born in a coal mining town in the West Virginia we grow up later on in Virginia where I was a boy scout in the Civil Air Patrol cadet in Scouting weird toy taught to Leave No Trace my dad used to say big hunter big fisherman he used to say when we're hunting or fishing he said that NOAA basically Leave No Trace behind so no one would actually know that we were there and I think that admission is one it's stuck with me throughout my life I believe we have a moral obligation to be devoted stewards of our environment and our planet and to leave our planet and even better shape than we found it lately I've been thinking about another quote this one I really like from Martin Luther King there's a lot of people have heard and it goes something like this anyone everyone can be great because anyone can serve and this call the service reminds me of recycling because almost anyone can help protect better protect your environment by reducing the waste that we produce and we can do that in part by recycling I've got a chart here that indicates just some of the things that that I recycle of late this is a that's not a green Ford Explorer at least least my wife a car well actually she bought it years and years ago probably 15 years ago we call it the Ford exploder it never exploded it was a great car but she used it for eight or eight years or so passed it down their son Christopher he's it for a couple years pass it down to Ben who used it for about three years and then finally just gave up the ghost and I took it one day to a place where they recycle cars and drove in put on this huge machine that actually waiters like think about you know you get on scales to weigh ourselves well this is like scales for vehicles including our Ford Explorer and they wrote out a check literally one night before I love to actually paid so I think $900 for recycling the the Explorer and people do that every day in Delaware and other places as well I we had we have del Assad Waste Authority in our state and one of the things they oversee is recycling and I they they hold about every month is from Springs through to the fall recycling events a lot of things were in schools parking lots bigs maybe high school parking lots and they're doing on Saturdays and this on Saturday I'd call the head and I said do you guys recycle dehumidifiers we had a dehumidifier about 20 years old had been in our basement forever they said yeah we do that which was great and we checked on Neal paints paint senators oil-based paints and stuff and they said you were doing hazardous hazardous you know materials recycling so I took several cans of paint thinners we had all these outdoor lights from from our house over the years that kind of died out on us and I didn't know what to do with them and sure enough they took cuttings household lights as well it took all kinds of cords and everything and paints and stuff and then we had every every Monday might in my neighborhood we have a big canisters outside and we can recycle all kinds of things and we always had water bottles in there and other kinds of cans and and so forth newspapers and you name it if you add it actually we compost too if you actually add up what we put in our big recycling bin every money for a pickup and you look at what do we put in our composter in our backyard and then you compare that to the actual mattress it has picked up at a house on Thursdays but many times more recyclables and compostables then is actually trashed and we like to do that and where I live and hopefully and well we've learned from other communities and states and hopefully they'll learn from from from us one of the reasons I love recycling so much flows from my belief that all of us can do our part to preserve limited resources and landfill input while at the same time helping our environment and creating jobs our mine is a little state I tell people even today I said with a forty ninth largest state and which that means only boat island is smaller than us but we're about a hundred miles long with 50 miles wide and recycling is particularly important we just don't have a lot of space for for landfills and we got about a million people and it's just a matter of having enough space but that space limitation is actually what prompted Alberta passed the universal recycling law in 2010 it requires that all waste haulers who provide residential trash collection also I have to provide for the collection of recyclables think about that and that was a law we passed about nine years ago I think under the leadership of either governor Markell or governor Minard and we start a little bit of recycling at start getting serious about it when I was governor they really ramped it up in the last decade which is wonderful but since the laws passes the first date that's Delaware if you didn't know has continued to recycle somewhere around forty percent of our waste most recently recycling a little bit more than 43 percent in 2017 and I have a friend you ask him how he's doing he sometimes replies compared to what and well compared to more than a decade ago in 2006 the first state diverted about half as much twenty three percent of our waste from landfills so we pretty much double that over the last ten years and hopefully will come close to doubling it again in the years to come but today mr. president recycling industry faces unprecedented challenges especially with respect to plastics the United States used to ship a lot of our recycles as you know to China but the beginning in 2017 China decided to ban twenty four types of what he called scrap imports and deployed strict contamination requirements for the scraps that they will accept they didn't you didn't want to have glass mixed up with you know metals messed up with plastic and paper and so they're looking to reduce contamination like that and they made there a whole lot stricter in that regard now because of the policies that China implemented in March of this year local governments or municipalities are facing uphill challenge to keep the roads like recycling programs alive according to the EPA the United States recycles less than 22 percent of our discarded materials which makes me feel better within Delhi because we're like twice the national average now but according to a peer-reviewed study published in 2017 more than 90 percent of plastic has never been recycled let me say it again according a peer-reviewed study published in 2017 two years ago more than 90 percent of plastic has never been recycled that means we've only recycle about 9 percent of our plastic around the world have the eight point three metric billion metric tons of plastic produced six point three billion tons that's about 3/4 of all it's produced becomes waste and the rest gets recycled but the line share of it does not most of it ends up in landfills and too much of it unfortunately it ends up in our oceans and the environment got a couple of our colleagues on the environment Public Works Committee mr. president you're one of them and we have Sara Bozeman and three of us all members of committee and they Dan Sullivan from Alaska Senator Sullivan Sheldon Whitehouse Republican and a Democrat have been working hard along with Tom you know who's on the Commerce Committee from from from New Mexico and that to try to address address some of this plastic contamination but if if we continue down this path to the World Economic Forum predicts that we're on track to have plastic pollution in our oceans outweigh the fish in our world's oceans by 2050 just like let that sink in for just a minute by 2050 if we continue on a track tear on we're going to end up having more plastic pollution by weight than fish and elros oceans not a good thing last time I checked del Oro is blessed with more five-star beaches than any other state in America if we don't begin to change our recycling habits the waves the grace our pristine beaches will be better known for washing up last waste in giving surfers those big waves to ride almost every year I participate in something called the dollars annual Coastal Cleanup along with thousands of people we start down at Fenwick Island right and the southernmost part of Delaware Beach great beach town and right north of Ocean City Maryland line and Sweeney has clean up our beaches from all the way friend in our waterfront from the Delaware Maryland line all the way almost up to Pennsylvania in the north and while we're still waiting for numbers for this year last year in 2018 my fellow volunteers thousands of us and I collected together a 2.7 tons of waste including plastic water bottles straws takeout containers you name it tires you name it this was from just one weekend of work along 70 miles of coastline and sadly those two point seven tons of trash collected last year in Delaware Kayla pale in comparison to what we're seeing around the world that are 2.7 tons of trash is like the tip of the iceberg compared to all the rest of so washing up and places around the world I think we might have one more here we go some of you also heard of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch which now covers a surface area on the earth 250 times larger than my little state of Delaware and contains a whopping 8 80 thousand tons of trash and here it is can you imagine look at all that trash and it's out in the Pacific Ocean and I like to say it's getting smaller I don't think it is but it is - and we need to be a part of that making some progress but as we celebrate America's recycles day tomorrow I just want to encourage join the senator Bozeman under joining our colleagues and their constituents to join us and looking for new ways to dramatically increase recycling in our country and around the world we need solutions that are win-win for our economy on the one hand and for our environment on the other hand and I believe recycling is one of those win-win solutions and by the way you may be surprised to to learn that recycling and manufacturing in the streets are beneficial for our economy accounting for more than 750,000 jobs and approximately 6.7 billion dollars in tax revenues that reminds me of one of my favorite sayings is it's possible to do good and do well at the same time it's possible clean up our planet maker planet safer and create jobs and economic opportunities not a Hobson's choice is not one of the other we can do both I believe that if we work hard and we work together and work to leverage points of consensus rather than points of disagreement we will continue to make progress and recycling is something that I think every American can do to make a difference I once read what we can do for them just for I read somewhere is how many aluminum cans we drink or we use to consume to bt could be soda could be milk in bright water but one of if people just would like recycle their aluminum cans and the it has a terrific effect on on believe it or not carbon dioxide has put up into the air and so that's good for climate change as well there's a lot of good effects but recycling is something that every American can do to make a difference so I let's just I get started today and if you've already gotten started let's figure out how to do it even better and on recyclable or recycle on America Recycles day our children and our grandchildren will be glad that we did in the years to come so again mr. president I'm grateful to be here today with my are dedicated co-chair my compadre senator Bozeman I thank him for his leadership and for providing with the staff great ideas and to make this particular America Recycles day even bigger and better thing than done before so thank you mr. president the senator from Arkansas I want to thank Senator Carper and his staff my staff for the tremendous job that they've done in recent years in really trying to educate through the caucus the rest of the staff and members as to the importance of recycling and as a result of their efforts it really is making a big difference we hear a lot about Republicans and Democrats not getting along and this and that not getting anything done and I think this is a great example of something that's very very important it's not glamorous but it's things like this that really can make a huge difference as Senator Carper alluded to so we appreciate him and appreciate his friendship well tomorrow November 15th is American Recycles day and so we are asking Americans to join us as we come together and reaffirm the importance and benefits of recycling on this occasion we all know that recycling is a common-sense way for us to be responsible stewards of our environment but recycling also strengthens our economy and creates hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs throughout our country this is something that I believe everyone can agree truly is a win-win situation most Americans are familiar with traditional recycling efforts at their city and county levels and that encourage citizens to recycle household goods or business goods such as paper soda cans bottles however recycling is much broader than these common practices recycling is a two hundred billion dollar industry in our country and it entails much much more than just traditional municipal recycling programs my state of Arkansas is home to many examples of companies that are contributing to a robust and growing mercial recycling industry now give you an example new court a leading steel producer located in Blytheville Arkansas has the capacity to recycle six million tons of steel per year six million tons and over 27 million tons nationwide making it North America's largest recycler Nucor has also taken its efforts a step further by teaming with local recycling facilities to help tackle some of the biggest challenges associated with the practice in rural communities Nucor donated a recycled cardboard baler for abilities unlimited a local nonprofit that runs nearby recycling facilities this investment is proven mutually beneficial Nucor into the community this facility now provides an outlet for the steel company and community members to recycle in a much more cost-effective manner in fact new core plants in Arkansas have the capability to recycle about 60 tons of cardboard annually thanks to this baler more than 195 tons of cardboard 21 tons of paper and 71 tons of mixed plastics have been recycled through this partnership another industry leader leading the way is Walmart as the world's largest retailer Walmart has put recycling front and center by raising its packaging standards it's unclear to include more recycled content and to eliminate specific non recyclable packaging materials by 2020 earlier this year Walmart announced its intention to achieve 100% recyclable reusable or industrial compostable packaging by by 2025 it's leadership in this arena will help create more demand for recycled content and open the door for other companies to follow suit lastly I want to highlight the recycling accomplishments of Bryce corporation a trailblazer in flexible packaging this is the packaging commonly used for chips juice pouches pet food lawn and garden materials cleaning supplies and many other products Bryce employs about 750 people at Searcy facility and has achieved an environmental footprint that the Central Arkansas community can be very proud of at this location alone Bryce has maintained a 98% landfill free status and supported the circular economy by recycling over 15 million pounds of plastic each year the material recycled from this facility is repurposed into other products ranging from past plastic pallets to automotive parts Bryce corporations innovative efforts are a sterling example of recycling done right and I'm grateful for the example is for the rest of the country our country certainly faced its fair share of recycling woes and setbacks but I've always maintained that an adversity lies opportunity I believe there is much to be learned from the meaningful work that these companies are doing in Arkansas and to commend them on leading on the issue the United States has the ability now to improve its waste management and recycling infrastructure and better leverage the economic and environmental benefits of recycling I look forward to continuing my work with my co-chair of the recycling caucus senator Carper and again thank you very much to you and your staff my staff also that's doing such a tremendous job and the other members of the caucus to develop meaningful long-term solutions that address the challenges facing the industry I encourage all Americans to use America Recycles day is an opportunity to reflect on the critical importance of recycling and to consider what we can do to support our environment through our own individual efforts that waits energy oh come on yes thank you for sharing with those those terrific ideas or what businesses in Arkansas and around the country are doing to to recycle they do it for a variety of reasons the the it's the right thing to do and a lot of them are committed to to being good environmental stewards and it can also be to their economic advantage and instead of having to pay for have stuff like carted away to a landfill the ability to we recycle materials is is I think desirable we used to have a big Chrysler plant in Delaware in new art closely the University of Delaware Maryland line and was a plan is about 60 years old in the middle of Great Recession the the Christ went into bankruptcy and that we lost that plant closed 3,000 jobs gone and we had a GM plant as well about 15 miles from there which is outside of Wilmington same thing 3 about 3,000 jobs gone and which was a just a really tough tough having said that your words University lies opportunity the folks at the University dollar called me after Christ have gone into bankruptcy and they announced they're closing the plant and they were looking to sell it and the folks from university develop then president Pat Harker called me and said do you think the Chrysler people might be interested in selling that plant to to the University or just south maybe half mile south of the University Delaware and in Newark and that's why I called people at Chrysler and said you may have an interested buyer here and they ended up coming to agreement on terms of the purchase and that old Chrysler plant has has been recycled the plant was largely taken down not entirely but largely taken to and the the money that that the University eller earn and generated from the sale of the recyclables construction you know the stuff that the plant was made out of more than paid for taking down leveling leveling the the plant and now the universe Dale has as a site several hundred acres and they're redeveloping that as a science and technology and a manufacturing facility with a lot of tenants and more to come so there really is opportunity in the university the other thing I would say we we got a when he's recycling sweating machines I had a touch of heroes about reading machine and we bought a new one not long ago and so we end up with all this reading but shredded paper and as it turns out the weekly recyclers when he come through our neighborhood and collect they're happy to take paper they don't want to take the shredded paper and what they said we ought to do is put it in our compost and the my wife came up with his idea of composting guys ten years ago and that somebody's nice enough to build a about four by six about three feet high been lined it with materials so and we put grass in it and then recyclables and then leaves and recyclables and we ended up with this great mulch and so we've I think taking what a lot of people have seen as a waste product and ended up actually turning into something that helps make our lawn and our trees and our rubs even healthier so that's this is this it's only good it's all good and I'm just thrilled to be on the floor with my friends to be able to thank those that are recycling and remind others if you're not you're missing out on the fund and come and join us and you'll you'll be glad you did I think you make a great point in the sense of we do things for the right reasons you know that's so important but also it is important too that not only can we do it for the right reasons and benefit our environment but it also can be cost effective to our businesses and a good example of that Walmart several years ago wanting to reduce their fuel cost and then also reduce the harm in the sense of the landfills and things like that so they looked and saw that that on their trucks the limiting factor was not weight it was bulk and and you know how you go to the store and you buy something you know it's got this it's this huge box or whatever and it's got the little bitty product and they said you know we don't need to be doing that and so they told their vendors you know that they'd like to go in that direction to the credit you know the vendors cooperated and so as a result they were able to put more products on the truck thus reducing fuel cost again benefiting the economy and then having less bulk for consumers to deal with eventually that was putting less pressure you know because some people don't do a good job of recycling so these things can be so good for again not only doing the right thing but also improving the bottom line and making it such that we we really are making such that we're putting less pressure on environmental problems which you know we all agree on and we appreciate your leadership you've been doing this for a long time and as governor and now senator helping to put these things together and so like I said we very much appreciate the gentleman would yield just for a moment I I said earlier in my remarks and you sort of sort of paraphrase but again it's possible to do good and do well at the same time it really is and it's I'm just happy that more and more people are doing that I well we're having this conversation I was just want to mention when I when we showed up with the recycling event at Glasgow High School in South in New York last Saturday afternoon and they took our a bunch of our stuff to recycle you know paper and you know sensitive papers and and you know bottles cans paint thinners are dehumidifier all kinds of stuff one thing they wouldn't take was our styrofoam and I we have one place in Delaware and we're not a big state 100 miles long and 50 miles wide there's one place in Delaware we can take styrofoam and we what I'd love to do maybe over the in the months to come in the new year first on our recycling caucus to sort of focus on that because it's not a problem it's just unique to Delaware there's a lot of places where it's hard to recite the styrofoam and try to figure out maybe somebody around the world as somebody in other states I figure this out and they're doing it but we need to be able to learn from from him find out what works and do more of that and sorry for missing one in my stay we still have a hard time dealing with well we look forward to having a robust bunch of programs and the other thing that's so important is is really educating people what is recyclable and that's you know that's that's not everyone knows in fact you have to and in different areas different things are recyclable versus in another area so there's a lot of Education that that makes things so much more efficient when people are putting the correct things in so we've got some obstacles tough to overcome but the good thing is the people working together we really are moving in the right direction and all right yeah mr. president I think they probably want to yield back our time thanks thanks so much thank you and with that I note the absence of a quorum

Alright team! It's Cori Bush, your
candidate for US Congress for Missouri's First District!
We're representing St. Louis and we're taking St. Louis all the way to Congress.
Who's showing up to the poll? You're showing up to the polls!
And when you show up you're going to make sure that three other people show
up to the polls as well! Who are those people? Friends, family, go
to fb, Twitter, Instagram, call your cousin,
somebody from your job, your church. Pull on your network, pull on the people
on your street. Friend to friend organizing is what we need!
We want you to let us know so that we can be prepared,
knowing how many people are going to show up for us. So dial that number: 314-370-2929 and we want you to text the word vote v-o-t-e
text the word vote to let us know that you are supporting Cori Bush for
congress. And tell the other people that are going
to support us too, that are going to show up, tell them to do the same! Thank you and let's win this! Let's take this all the
way to a victory!

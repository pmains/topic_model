Mr Speaker I rise today to acknowledge the many AG producers across Kansas who worked tirelessly to keep the very heart of our nation beating I represent the largest agriculture producing district in the country and over recess I spent a great deal of time traveling 2,000 miles and holding some 10 farm bill listing sessions to find out exactly how we in Congress can best serve the needs of our producers one of my fun farm bill listening tours I was reminded just how important the farm bill is to my district and countless others across the nation we must protect our farmers and ranchers especially in this depressed agriculture economy farming is on the riskiest high-tech most intricately complicated businesses out there as a member of the House AG committee I look forward to working with my colleagues to take the voice of American farmers and translate it into an appropriate and well-defined farm bill we must send the message to our farmers and small communities that we will continue to support them and sure that their livelihoods are protected to do this we must increase flexibility and make sure that crop insurance is available to all those who need it most crop insurance doesn't just protect the farmers it protects the loan at the local bank it protects downtown communities like yours and mines it predicts the coops and it protects Main Street America America is protected by crop insurance I firmly believe is our duty to make sure that those who put food on our tables aren't struggling to put food on theirs I yield back

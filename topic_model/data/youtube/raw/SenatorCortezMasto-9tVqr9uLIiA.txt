hi I'm Elizabeth Warren senator from Massachusetts and I'm Katherine Cortez Masto senator from Nevada and we wanted to talk to you today about a bill that's pending in the United States Senate but I thought maybe a good place to start is of how you and I met that's that's the stage I did it does wait I was Attorney General during the crisis that's right now it's very general from Nevada right and the financial crisis is starting to unfold right thanks they're really bad in Nevada and all over the country when we first meet I think I'm still a law professor that's right and then as we get deeper into it I'm setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that's right for President Obama and do you remember what we were on the phone about over and over and over oh my gosh it was the foreclosure crisis it was setting up the CFPB it was who was gonna be out there protecting and homeowners right and preventing this crisis ever happened and that's what it was really about it was it was the depth of the crisis it was terrible it was how badly these mortgage lenders had behaved how many human beings lives they had turned upside down and how committed both of us were right here again that's never again okay so I ended up I went to Nevada uh and did the first hearing uh when Congress had had set me up this before the agency before dodd-frank was put in uh Congress had asked me to be the chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel calm for the Troubled Asset Relief Program to try to bring a little accountability to how that bank bailout money was being used and so we decided we'd have hearings around the country and just try to learn from people who were there so I ended up at my very first hearing in Clark County right in Nevada and uh we have some witnesses that we've had and it turns out to be nothing like we expected all these people who are in the middle of losing their homes showed up at this hearing and one of them in other people who just will stick in your mind forever mr. Estrada and he comes up to the mind and he just wants to tell us his story and you know he's got a work shirt he's gonna miss his red baseball cap and he talks about his family as these two little girls and how he and his wife both work they saved every nickel to buy a home in the best school district that's what they wanted to try yes school district they could get for their little girls and he describes his own it's right across the street from the school he talks about how you'd stand in his garage watch his little girls love her in the playground at the at the school and if you just see the pride Anthony talks about how they're working they're making their mortgage payments and all of a sudden the mortgage payments and he and his wife understand what's under stand they thought they had a mortgage they thought they knew what it was they'd budget it for it they can't make the payments they fall behind so they start negotiating with the mortgage company what did they do everyone's talking about Troubled Asset Relief Program we're gonna have some relief from the mortgages he's in the middle of negotiations and they sell his house yep and he learns about it when somebody knocks on his door and tells him he's got two weeks 14 days to pack up everything he owns and his little girls and get out of that house and then he goes on to tell the story and here's this big solid man and you can watch him he's fighting back tears and he's talking about how one of his daughters brings a list home from school one day a piece of paper that she's written the names of every one of her friends and she shows it to her daddy and since these are the people who are gonna miss me when I have to leave my school and mr. Estrada I don't care if we have to live in a van you're not gonna miss school I'm gonna save this house and he's there at this here to say please help me right everybody looks back at this crisis like oh it's just numbers and it's profits and losses his son Wall Street no it's people like mr. s all right and and and it's the same thing I hear like oh we're it's recovered everybody's flush with money now if you came and you did and you saw it was going on in Clark County where Las Vegas is but we were ground zero for the foreclosure is the story that you just heard I'm told I was Attorney General during this time I have so many others that are just like that I mean I can't tell you how many times we had I'll never forget like you there's so many there was a woman who lived alone she had lost her husband like eight years prior the only thing that she had was her house and she was trying to keep her house and she tried to work with the banks to try to keep her house and you know how they kept asking her proved to us that your husband is dead oh my god and they asked her over and over she had to prove eight or nine ten times that her husband was dead because she was trying to you know save her home and take a look at how she could modify her mortgage and and then remember the dual tracking so off they would say we're gonna we're gonna modify your mortgage and then at the same time as a separate track that they put them on to foreclosure and they lost their homes yep so many people so we said Congress in before you and I were here we're never again never again so they passed dodd-frank they put some basic security in place and now it's been ten years since the front end of that crash and today we're here because they want to roll back some of those regulations they call it reform but it reform yep that's writing weakening really the the oversight right the against the banks that I sued I went after as a church because they such a big footprint and they were not working with homeowners and they were playing games with them so what's the part about the bill that drives you crazy so besides the fact that they're weakening the rules against the big banks yeah consumer protection they're weakening consumer protection so during the time of this crisis and you know this as well as Attorney General working with my colleagues we saw a lot of housing discrimination oh yeah right yeah I always happen and what I mean by that is many many people in our minority communities african-americans Latinos and even women were discriminated against to get a mortgage loan and let's just be blunt what discriminated against means is they simply charged more if you walked in the door and you were black you got one price and if you walked in the door and you are white you got a loan and remember the T's are race women we put they put them in a saree rific race that starts only or some crazy arm so they used to discriminate we put laws in place what we collect data that's right so we put laws in place under honda home right Mortgage Disclosure Act to say we want you banks you collect this data already but we want additional data points from you to ensure that there are no patterns of discrimination and we put those in place right and they're there yep and now what have we happened what's happening this week they're trying to take those data points out that's right because if you don't have the data that's right what happens then then you can't prove that there's any must not be any discrimination yeah my understanding is the deal is there have actually still since the crash been banks that have been caught discriminating absolutely and that's why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remember they they actually issued regulations to say listen this is a pattern we want to to follow we're gonna we're gonna hold you banks accountable but for those banks that have 25 loans or less you know what we're gonna we're gonna help ya little tiny banks will work with you but if you're making five hundred loans or less or any type of loan beyond that we want you to give us the debt and it's not that they don't already have the data they have the data it's just let's shine a light on it let's make a public right but that's the whole point isn't it that's right some folks don't wanna make that data and that's the challenge we had so this bill says let's just roll that little part out well no another part that drives me crazy so think about we decided after this crash we kind of made a mistake in banking regulation and let these giant banks get out there and run terrible risks and then say at the other end hey we are so giant we are too big to fail you got to bail us out give us some money and that's what the Troubled Asset Relief Program was all about right these billions and billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars taxpayer dollars taxpayer dollars okay so now in America there are about 40 big banks that are in effect on a watch list all the little banks and there's a whole lot more of them all the little banks are regulated one way kind of quietly because they can't break the economy right the 40 biggest more aggressively watched everybody keeps closer eye on them they have to have to have more examinations that seems fair to me that's right after all what this bill says is about 25 of the 40 largest we're just going to take them off the watch list and move them over and we're gonna treat them like there were tiny little banks that can't affect the economy now those 25 banks we've been around the block before with them that's right those 25 collectively got fifty billion dollars in bailout money and let me just be clear fifty billion dollars in bailout money and nobody went to jail they got bailed out after they said hey listen we are so important and so big that if you don't bail us out you're gonna crash the economy and now they want to be protecting off the watchlist and here's the deal about those 25 banks those are banks of a sighs remember countrywide how do i sue countrywide malicious nightmares yes they blow a big footprint in Nevada yeah countrywide was the bank that at its peak was issuing 1 in every 5 home mortgages in America and those home mortgages were they were the ones who really showed people to do it the home mortgages that cheated the most the home mortgages that did the teaser rates that had every scam every trick every trap in them countrywide at its peak was a hundred and ninety nine billion dollars so what this bill says is it would deregulate country like it would treat country like like one of those tiny little banks and what that really means is you know look the next bank I don't know how they'll cheat I it may not be over teaser rate mortgages it may be over some other deals they do but the whole point is this crash happened in 2008 because the regulators couldn't see it coming and thank you for saying that because the federal regulators were not there no so why do we want to give it back to the federal that's exactly right the federal regulators didn't want to hear it didn't want to see it exactly so the federal regulators let these banks pass through and what this bill is all about is it says for the next countrywide for the next hundred and ninety-nine billion dollar bank that is right at the center of the American economy and has figured out some way to cheat the American people right don't even take a close look at it just let them pass right on through and whatever they do to the economy so be it and why should you get that favorable treatment I don't understand and this is the deal Cameron you know what really just about this so these are the same things these these banks are making record profits so here they are we've regulated we've stabilized the banking system we forced them to bring in more capital and they were actually making record that's right profits and what do they do with those record profits they're hiring more lobbyists and having those lobbyists come to Congress and say to Congress you got to change the laws that's right I got to change the laws and at the end of the day we're my home owners still coming out of there right they're still struggling and still trying to improve their credit still trying to ensure that they can own a home in the in the future I mean homeowners in the state of Nevada why don't we give them a break why don't we give homeowners across the country a break and ensure that we're protecting them so this never happens again I know Catherine I do a lot of town halls in Massachusetts and more than once at a town hall I've had somebody come up to me shake hands we do selfies we do pictures afterwards and they'll just lean over and say during the crash I lost my house I don't think anybody ever gets over that no you don't I just don't think they do you don't so what are we gonna do about this the banks of God these lobbyists they're thundering through the halls of Congress they got every single Republican they got way too many Democrats they're out there what are we gonna do Catherine what we're doing now a call to action we want people to know right we wanted them to understand what's happening today yeah and people should be concerned and calling out and calling their representatives yeah and and telling them those representatives that we do not want to go back to the way it was before we do not want to ever see a crisis like we saw right that's a foreclosure crisis that we saw in this country and we don't have to know this is a time when we can actually say to Congress don't work for the big banks that's right work for the American people so I get it the big banks have got all the money mm-hmm they got all the lobbyists right but you know a lot more of us that's right then then then we've got our voices and we've got action that's right you bet so I'm not gonna lay down and die on this how about you never or ever will do it in the fight always with you absolutely you bet all the way Thanks

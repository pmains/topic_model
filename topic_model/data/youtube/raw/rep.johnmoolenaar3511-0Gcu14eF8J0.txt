Thank You mr. chairman and mr. speaker as the chairman mentioned today we're voting to repeal some of the burdensome taxes the Obama administration is placed on hardworking Americans with this health care law and today we have the opportunity to vote in a bipartisan way to end the individual mandate the employer mandate the medical device tax the Cadillac tax the slush fund and the auto enrolment mandate the Affordable Care Act has proven to be unaffordable for millions of Americans who lost the coverage they enjoyed and must now pay higher premiums already hard-working families in my district have been told about the rate hikes that will make the health care premiums that they pay more expensive this next year and today we're repealing mandates but unfortunately we're not in this legislation able to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board that determines which treatments Americans are allowed to have or the health insurance tax that eliminates consumer choice and access but today this is a positive step toward a system of patient-centered alternatives with lower premiums that allow individuals to choose the coverage they want I yield back

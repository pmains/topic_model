guys thanks very much i want to bring in congressman patrick mchenry's a republican from north carolina he's the chief deputy whip he's also scheduled by the way to meet with president trump less than two hours from now congressman thanks very much for joining us hey wolf thanks for having me on i know you're incredibly busy today good to have you uh there's been some serious opposition already expressed forget about the democrats by a bunch of your republican colleagues in the house and the senate utah senator mike lee for example he released a statement just a little while ago saying in part let me read it to you this is not the obamacare repeal bill we've been waiting for it is a missed opportunity and a step in the wrong direction he continued we promised the american people we would drain the swamp and end business as usual in washington this bill does not do that what do you say to that criticism well uh he shouldn't be criticizing uh the bill that the president the vice president secretary of health and human services uh support and have explicitly endorsed uh what we've been doing in the house is different what they've been doing in the senate among republicans certainly that's the case we've been at writing this proposal for the last year we brought in every republican in the house representatives we've had 150 republicans come through with briefings policy discussions substantive debate behind closed doors over the last two months and we've crafted a uh very good piece of legislation uh that that really works with the three corners of republicans right now the house the senate and uh the presidency and i think we've got a piece of legislation that could pass the house pass the senate and be signed by the president and repeal a an entitlement program for the first time in our nation you know congressman you've got a whole bunch of republicans conservative republicans including some members of the house freedom caucus expressing deep concerns this is just a new entitlement program you're the chief deputy whip how are you working to get those republicans on board because you're probably not going to have any democrats supporting this legislation in the house or the senate well look we have refundable tax credits to enable those that are on the margins to buy more affordable health insurance certainly that's dramatically different than what is obamacare and those that are benefiting from that the established corporate interests that are benefiting from obamacare as it now stands certainly are not quite as warm to our proposal because it doesn't uh benefit their corporate interests as much we certainly have republicans that say they don't like the the nature of the tax credits and almost every one of those republicans criticizing this plan have in the past or are currently co-sponsors of legislation that use tax credits uh to increase the affordability of health insurance so they need to look at their own policy portfolio before criticizing what is in the piece of this piece of legislation that we've been working on as you know congressman there are moderate republicans who aren't very happy with some of the proposed changes in the plan that would cut medicaid expansion for example that happened under obamacare if that program is cut as we just heard from christina alessia it could potentially leave millions of people relying on that medicaid coverage without any coverage what do you say to those fellow republicans including a bunch of republican governors right now who are especially concerned about that again look ronald reagan proposed this in the early 1970s with block grant medicaid to the states it was in our house republican budget in 1995 passed by the house and senate in 1995 this has been long held republican orthodoxy that we return medicaid back to the states and allow flexibility and that innovation that occurs state by state in order to better deliver for those that are indigent and on the margins certainly those that are benefiting from nearly double-digit yearly increases in medicaid spending don't want to change that system and reduce that increase but wolf there is no cut to medicaid medicaid will spend more next year in the following year for the next decade two decades what we're talking about is trying to control the increase and re give states full control over this population one of the complaints out of our our out of our plan is that we are generous to those that are disabled and the uh most sickly in the medicaid population uh i think uh there's just a natural discussion we have to have about our social safety net making sure we deliver for those that are truly in the most and our plan does that in the house a very quick question i know we're running out of time the whole discussion you have the votes presumably you have the votes in the house and the senate to repeal obamacare you need uh 218 in the house that's the majority you have that presumably unless a whole bunch of republicans both you're not going to get uh many if uh you're not going to get any uh democratic support i don't believe in the senate you need a simple majority to repeal you need 50 uh one votes you have a 52-48 majority in the senate but as you well know in the senate given their complicated rules filibuster rules to replace the existing law you need 60 votes 52 republicans you don't have the democrats is this whole conversation really going to end up moot no in this pat this is the reason why we've done repeal and replacing this package that was the need out of our house republican members that said we have to do as much replace as possible because we don't know you can't completely replace it you can't completely replace it you need subsequent uh legislation that will require 60 votes in the united states senate and i've take i take it you haven't worked with any democrats in crafting this legislation that might make it more appealing to them well no this one we can do on our own that next package will have to be a bipartisan majority for these fundamental insurance marketplace reforms that are going to make health insurance much more portable more competitive this is the opening discussion on repealing obamacare and if we recall how obamacare is put in place they had a 60 vote package when they had 60 votes in the democrat-controlled senate 60 democrats in the senate and then they used this reconciliation package to make changes to it likewise to fully undo the damage of obamacare we're going to need both packages this is an opening act wolf this is the first opening major opening in this republican congress with this republican president and more will be will have to be done and certainly it's going to be an interesting exciting year but as you've asked about the question of votes here in the house and the senate we have the votes for this package will pass this package almost uh as it has been introduced with some minor changes and i think we'll we'll have uh this on the president's desk in the next month or three four weeks and uh and i think that will show results for us but yeah we are republicans here so uh we're not going to do this in a simple fashion and it won't be without drama that's the nature of the republican party with uh various interests as they are arrayed and independent-minded people uh that we have to bring together uh for some level consensus consensus that's my job that's the work we do here on the hill and that's why it's gonna be exciting yeah it's gonna be very exciting our congressman patrick mchenry and as you know in the senate uh you got 52 republicans but a few of them are already saying they don't like the cuts to planned parenthood they may vote against it if three republicans bolt you could book potentially the repeal part could be in deep trouble as well so when you say it's going to be dramatic and exciting i agree with you it certainly will be congressman patrick henry north carolina thanks for joining us

the chair now recognizes mr. filarsky Thank You mr. chairman I appreciate our witnesses that are here today and I want to extend so much appreciation from my district in Indiana for the service of all of our witnesses here today you three guys face an impossible task China and the whu-oh lied about the extent of the crisis and it's well documented that China used that time to hoard PPE that was vital to this country to make matters worse the Obama administration depleted the n95 masks from the strategic national stockpile during the 2009 h1n1 influenza outbreak and never replenished it the odds were against you guys from the very beginning then you had a national media super eager to paint the worst possible picture so for instance the New York Times published an article on March 25th that said amid desperate need for ventilators calls grow for federal investigation which said that the u.s. needed as many as 1 million ventilators to adequately respond to the pandemic who only had 200,000 available Admiral Palo Jack did the u.s. really need 1 million ventilators maybe I'll answer that as an intensive care physician I was incredibly involved early on with the allocation of every single ventilator every single request no we did not need a million ventilators and we did not need 40,000 the New York Times article mischaracterized a study by the Society of critical care medicine which estimated that over the course of the pandemic as many as 1 million people could require ventilator treatment that's a huge difference from needing 1 million ventilators this was an honest mistake or not such an eye-popping number got a ton of attention the figure was used in a second New York Times article repeated by the other news outlets and rocketed around Twitter and Facebook a New York Times reporter tweeted the incorrect figure and said the Trump administration was dooming people to die it was retweeted for in 71 times he eventually tweeted a correction three days later the correction was retweeted just 15 times and he didn't even delete the original incorrect apocalyptic tweet this is malpractice in the service of an agenda in service of creating a narrative that whatever cost frankly this reminds me of the Russia collusion hoax that was a hoax we saw a play out over the last few years report breathlessly an alarming report and by the time the story falls apart and has been disproven everyone's moved to the next outrage let me just say that during that time we had the president of the Society for critical care medicine at FEMA working with us to understand specifically what the ventilator needs was my group put out guidance on how the Dooly ventilate people along with the American Society of anesthesiology who had been working on transition of anesthesia machines so we we were involved every single ventilator decision went to the ucg to weigh the needs and as far as we know not a single person in this country was denied ventilation and now because of the DPA use will have over 50,000 ventilators in the stockpile by next week thank you and just curious how many ventilators in New York end up receiving ma'am I I do not have the actual specific number but I know there was a first ask for tens of thousands which I think I think that number might have been 30 or 40 but we New York ended up getting maybe about 10,000 ventilators but I will I will need to provide the committee with actual specific numbers of like if I could but grass the initial thought was a lot but they check again you created a control a control tower to monitor medical supplies and demand what's the status of the control tower on the roll federal government and the strategic national stockpile and obtaining and distributing medical supplies to the states yes ma'am so uh we've got business system information from essentially ninety 90 plus percent of the health medical supply chain I could see it coming in from manufacturing whether it be us or overseas being there warehouses even distribute it down to first responders nursing homes hospitals we're also in the process of building that out of getting actual wired connections to the six thousand eight hundred plus hospitals in the United States to get on hand daily information along with anything state warehouses to this so you'll have a holistic approach an understanding of the supply chain from state's hospitals national stockpile and from the commercial side president Trump enacted the defense production act the state of Indiana got on board immediately even in my district and we are still producing domestically supplied PPE today thank you for your service gentlemen I yield back mr. Chairman I think is a little healing back the chair now recognizes

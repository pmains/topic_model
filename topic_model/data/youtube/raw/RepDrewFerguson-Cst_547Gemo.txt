Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent to speak out of order for the purpose of inquiring to the Democratic caucus chair the schedule for the week to come without objection thank you Mr Speaker I ask unanimous to consent to revise and extend my remarks without objection wow thank you Mr Speaker I yield to my friend Mr Jeffries from New York the Democratic caucus chair uh thank you Mr Speaker I also thank the my distinguished colleague for yielding schedule next week on Wednesday the house will meet at 12 p.m for morning Hour 2 p.m for legislative business with votes postponed until 6 30 pm on Thursday we'll meet at 10 A.M for morning hour and 12 p.m for legislative business on Friday the house will meet at 9 00 a.m for legislative business next week we'll be considering A continuing resolution very important to fund the government we know the fiscal year concludes on September 30th something that we have to get done it's also our expectation that we may consider legislation to reform the stock Act and then we'll also consider bills on the suspension of the rules the complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow and then of course additional legislative items are possible I thank my my colleague and we have seen a movement in the Senate understand that there's activity over there do you do you have an update on number one when we might see that legislation in the house but more importantly when we might see legislative text well the Senate uh has apparently moved for cloture on Tuesday so one it's our expectation that we're gonna have an opportunity to vote to make sure that we fund the government Beyond September 30th in terms of legislative text the negotiations are ongoing I think everyone is working in good faith we're thankful for the leadership on our side of chairwoman Rosa delauro we have a responsibility to make sure that we keep the government open and we intend to keep that responsibility Mr Speaker I'd like to ask my colleague if he is aware of any other additional authorizing texts that may be may be attached to the continuing resolution well the ongoing negotiations in good faith there have been several exigencies that have Arisen but I don't have visibility into the actual precise nature of the negotiations right now as I mentioned on our end certainly they're being handled by chairwoman Rosa de lauro but and all those negotiations are progressing we expect that an agreement is going to be reached hopefully in the next few days and then of course you'll have an opportunity as will all members to review the legislative text I thank the gentleman um one final thing uh later Hoyer made an announcement this Summer that we were going to try to close votes in a timely fashion and as we've just seen it is virtually impossible to do it with proxy voting because these four votes took almost two hours to complete and given that the that the business Community is getting back to normal uh we're seeing workers return to work uh we're seeing businesses uh return to normal operations and given that the president uh uh proclaimed that the pandemic is over do you also expect to to end proxy voting next week when the when the current covered period ends well you know that's a decision that ultimately uh will be made by the speaker in consultation with other members of leadership but being Guided by the public health professionals the Capital Physician has guided the decision up until this point in terms of the public health emergency that we've been under and what the appropriate Protocols are to make sure that um that we're being responsible and in terms if if the gentleman will yield uh Mr Speaker I I think you know America expects Congress to lead and we're seeing again Across the Nation people get back to their lives get back to normal uh certainly there are many safe precautions that that have been taken but clearly showing up to work is something that Americans expect Congress to do and and I just cannot think of a reason why why members of this body while we get on airplanes and fly back and forth to our districts every week and why I see I see so many of our members on both sides of the aisle attending events and speaking at various functions and certainly they are they are not campaigning remotely I can't think of a reason why we wouldn't do away with proxy voting and show up here in the people's house in person and I Mr Speaker I would love to see if my colleague from New York has any insight into that yeah well I think the gentleman raises a very important observation that the American people expect us to lead and I think during the 117th Congress that's absolutely what has been done we have led by passing the American Rescue plan save the economy from perhaps collapsing into a recession if not worse put shots in arms Money In Pockets kids back in school we've led by passing the infrastructure investment in jobs act creating millions of good paying jobs fixing our crumbling Bridges roads and gentlemen ask the question I'm just responding I know and if the gentleman will reclaim my time here for just a minute but we are we're failing miserably in in American Energy independence with the rise of of Home Heating costs and and Fuel and we see we see what's happened to our neighbors in the European Union we see the rising costs and certainly Americans are worried about that the rising cost of rent the out of control inflation the the excessive government spending I mean we have that but but more importantly we just have we have our communities that are less safe because of the crisis at the border the fentanyl crisis it's hitting every single in just a minute um so I don't know that we have been leading but I want to Mr Mr Speaker go back to the specifics of the question that we ask here in in terms of leading by showing up to work I just again I just want to see if there's any any kind of rational reason why we shouldn't show up in person to work now without a love to hear from my colleague from New York well I I think one we've been operating under public health emergency but in the constraints of that again following the guidance of the public health professionals that's how we've been operating and and certainly the gentleman well I think you've yielded the time to me so I can yield it back to you at the appropriate time but as you've indicated um but the president ended the pandemic declared that it was over so if that's the case then shouldn't we be going back to normal Mr Speaker again we're going to follow the public health guidance and uh out of courtesy we are having this colloquy but we can't have a colloquy uh if the gentleman is dissatisfied with my answers and such that you're consistently not permitting me to respond I'd be happy to respond uh to any questions if we're going to have a colloquy and I think what is clear if the point is are we leading correct we're leading as I mentioned we're leading on the American Rescue plan we're leading on infrastructure investment we're leading on standing up for our veterans leading on Public Safety leading on passing gun safety legislation I'll reclaim my time because it clearly you know uh we we are we we see we see some of these important issues differently just sticking to the to the the main question of proxy voting and why members of Congress should not show up to do their job American businesses are we can campaign in person certainly voting in person seems reasonable to me but with that I would like to thank my colleague um the the caucus chair for his time today and for setting the schedule and with that I yield

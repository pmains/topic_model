thank you chairwoman clark and ranking member garberino for holding this important hearing dedicated to improving the cybersecurity of our nation's industrial control systems over the past few years we've witnessed numerous cyber attacks both in the u.s and abroad every day we see new technology on the market and new devices connecting to the internet and unfortunately it seems that at times our technological advances have outpaced our ability to maintain secure i.t and ot systems cyber attacks can have devastating consequences both for the consumer and for the system operators however many private industrial control system operators may not even be aware of the inherent risks involved when connecting their system to the internet so mr goldstein it's good to have you back for another hearing sir and um i know in the past we've asked you about the resources cisa has provided to help small businesses establish and improve cyber security measure with respect to information technology could you explain what services cisa provides to small businesses to maintain the security of operations technology there's a lot of small businesses and a lot of them don't really have any idea what sisa does for ot yes sir absolutely thank you for that question and of course a pleasure to rejoin the group here uh i really can't overstate the importance of cisa's regional workforce here for many small and medium organizations even as we push out guidance on our website on social media via virtual meetings and webinars we know that's not going to reach many organizations in this country and so with the support of congress we are dramatically increasing our regional footprint across the country so that our regional cyber security experts can meet with local chambers of commerce can can knock on the door of the local water utility and have uh as you know sir a really focused conversation about risks facing operational technology and control systems this is really one important aspect of these cyber security performance goals because the goal of the performance goals and and and other frameworks like it is to provide a really succinct and simple place to start and so organizations that may not be resourced to develop a fully mature cyber security program may not have resources to deploy best-in-class cyber security technologies there's still steps that they can take that will dramatically improve their security today and so a combination of easy to use succinct guidance and our regional workforce that's able to get out there knock on doors sit down for a cup of coffee and have a conversation that's really our key to make sure that we're getting the word out in the right ways okay uh thank you um so if on a scale of say one to ten where do you think we are right now in getting that information out for uh for small businesses to understand what cis is really doing sir i think it's it's asymmetric across sectors i think that there are some sectors for example uh the energy sector where there are of course a lot of electric co-ops or municipal utilities that are smaller i think ciso's work in cooperation with energy department has really done an important job in driving an understanding of risks and an understanding of controls i think if we look across other sectors for example the thousands upon thousands of small water utilities in this country i think we have work to do to make sure that we're identifying all possible means of communication and collaboration to as my co-witness noted uh raise an understanding of the risk in the first instance so that organizations don't for example just plug a device in based on the internet without without understanding the risk thereof and we're driving adoption of the right controls and security measures that are done in a way that is considering the unique attributes of ot environment and the requirements for availability and operational risk they're in thank you thank you very much for that now mr uh mr gibson in your testimony you said from our decades-long work in building and testing more than 50 nuclear reactors in the high desert of idaho falls the idaho national lab has developed a deep understanding of ot and cyber security engineering processes needed to secure systems and provide critical and critical function assurance with um with proper safeguards in place and one of those being operational technology security nuclear reactor energy is you know one of the most clean and and reliable sources of electricity in the world and having that incredible amount of experience in you know building 50 over 50 nuclear reactors um would you agree that nuclear react your energy is perfectly safe with the proper safeguards in place so i'll caveat it with say i'm not a nuclear engineer or scientist but yes modern nuclear reactors are incredibly safe their design is nothing like the nuclear reactors of the past okay great um do you think we need more nuclear reactor capability in this country so once again away from my area of expert expertise yes having that baseline generation available in a clean and reliable source like nuclear um is um an incredible um opportunity to take advantage of and and really there is no um technical reason why we shouldn't move out rapidly well i'll tell you you know in georgia we have two nuclear plants coming online in plant vogel uh just literally months away um just early early next year the second plant just a few weeks away from the first plant and i'm really excited about that

thank you madam speaker every member of this chamber has had the privilege of meeting with hard-working small business owners in their districts who overcame incredible challenges to stay open during the pandemic the stories that stick with me the most are the ones from family owned establishments community staples like simply kamai in lowell tara luna in lawrence these businesses accessed relief through the restaurant revitalization fund and it helped them keep their doors open and their employees on staff but for every simply kamai in tara luna there are three or four other restaurants who applied but didn't get the relief they needed because the fund ran out of money and that's left many businesses hanging on by a thread pleading for help passing the relief for restaurants and other hard hit small businesses act we'll answer those calls for aid madam speaker we owe these restaurants and small businesses this legislation and there's simply no reason anyone in congress should oppose it i ask my colleagues to join us in passing this bill and i yield back the balance of my time

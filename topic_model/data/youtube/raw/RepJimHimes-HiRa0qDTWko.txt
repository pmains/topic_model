jim Himes he's a democrat from connecticut and a member of the House Intelligence Committee he joins us now good morning thanks for joining us good morning Michaela sir i want you to maybe outline for us why exactly it is that you oppose the arming and training of syrian rebels what exactly are your specific concerns well they're a bunch of them and and you know i should stay at upfront that like most of my colleagues i'm in favor of an aggressive approach against Isis I for example favor the air strikes they've been almost two hundred of them in the last couple of weeks that have seriously knocked them back on their heels but when you're talking about essentially creating a proxy army of so-called moderate Syrians that's a very different calculation and so what are the concerns number one these are young men I've met some of them as a part of my role on the Intelligence Committee who are seething with hatred for President Assad of Syria and we call them the opposition opposition of course to Assad so it's unclear to me and has been unclear to me how you take these people and say okay we know you really want to go after Assad but we actually want you to take on these people next to you here Isis because that's the threat to us that's a very very complicated mission then you've got issues about how much do we control them we're going to arm them we're going to train them we're going to send them into a place where we cannot go you know there's a possibility that weapons wind up in bad hands that you know human rights violations get a get committed so on balance and this is not an easy one but on balance I I did not think that plan was sufficiently detailed and was sufficiently likelihood of success to support it so congressman the question then becomes if you don't support these folks going in to fight Isis on the ground in Syria who does the fighting do you support the use of us ground troops no no and look let's take a big step back here while Isis and 10 other groups like Isis are a threat to the United States into the West the underlying conflict here the conflict between Sunni and Shia the conflict between extremists and moderates between Syrians and fadis between Saudi Zanda Ryan's these are not our fights and so we shouldn't think that the presumption is that we need to be out front on everything it is up to the players in the region to while we can lead and we can with airstrikes and we can organize international coalition's they have to solve the underlying problems if they don't solve the underlying problems will be talking 20 years from now talking about whether we should increase air strikes or increase the support we're giving to whatever group of rebels at that point happens to be aligned with our strategy you talk about the challenges of all of this but you well know as we do that air strikes are not always without their problems as well they're they're hard to do in Syria when you think about how the fact is this is not like we've talked to generals and Colonels hear about the fact this is not you know their barracks of Isis fighters there aren't frontlines of Isis there it within the population and so you talk about the potential for humanitarian crisis we could see civilians of the crosshairs here look and we need to be very clear with the American people about what it is that we mean when we say victory and look the facts are there to see airstrikes can knock a foe back on its heels you know Isis is a lot worse place than it was four weeks ago we can force them to disperse we can take out their armor because we can find it but airstrikes alone simply means that they go into caves and villages okay now you get to troops on the ground troops can enter caves and enter homes but look we had hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan for ten years what we do when we do that and when anybody does that is you simply put a lid on the underlying problems you take those ground troops away and those problems are still there which is of course what we're seeing in Iraq and Afghanistan takes me back to the need to address those underlying problems congressman how hard was it for you to split from the President on this vote in arming and training the Syrian rebels yesterday he's the leader of your party I mean what more do you want to see from the president in terms of leadership well you know he is a member of my party and I support him on most things but I'm profoundly aware of the fact that my role is one of Representative and my role is one if you read the constitution of acting as a check and balance on executive authority so first and foremost I am a representative a member of the United States Congress whose mission really is to make sure that cotton power is not concentrated in any one hand so it wasn't that hard obviously I want to support the president I think you know really brutal and unfair attacks but that doesn't mean that you just line up when you think that's something that he's proposing may not be a good idea that's a fair point we appreciate your candid candid comments thanks so much for joining us congressman we appreciate it thank you very much alright

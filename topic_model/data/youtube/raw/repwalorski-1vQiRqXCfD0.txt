  WALORSKI, WHO'S GOING TO SHARE  SOME THOUGHTS WITH US. MRS. WALORSKI: I THANK THE  GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE FACED  52 WEEKS OF BROKEN PROMISES. THE PRESIDENT, WHO PROMISED TO  UNITE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,  INSTEAD HAS PITTED CITIZENS  AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. THE PRESIDENT, WHO PROMISED  AMERICANS TO WORK WITH AMERICANS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM,  HAS PRIORITIZED A RADICAL AGENDA THAT CATERS ONLY TO THE EXTREME  WING OF HIS PARTY. THE PRESIDENT, WHO PROMISED TO  PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HAS LEFT US VULNERABLE AT THE  SOUTHERN BORDER AND ACROSS THE  WORLD. AND THE PRESIDENT, WHO PROMISED  TO BUILD BACK BETTER, HAS ONLY  HINDERED AMERICA'S ECONOMIC  RECOVERY. FOR A YEAR, WE'VE WITNESSED  FAILURE AFTER FAILURE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE PAID  THE PRICE. DAY AFTER DAY, HOOSIERS AND  AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  EXPERIENCE THE REAL  RAMIFICATIONS OF THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY AGENDA. WITH INFLATION AT A 40-YEAR  HIGH, WE'RE PAYING THE PRICE OF  THE PRESIDENT'S RECKLESS  SPENDING DURING EVERY TRIP TO  THE GROCERY STORE AND THE GAS  STATION. DESPITE SPENDING TRILLIONS OF  DOLLARS ON THE PRESIDENT'S  SO-CALLED RESCUE PLAN, WE'RE  FACING ESCALATING SUPPLY CHAIN  BOTTLE NECKS AND WORKFORCE  SHORTAGES WITH NOTHING IN SIGHT. THANKS TO THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION'S OPEN BORDERS  POLICY, EVERY TOWN ACROSS  AMERICA IS A BORDER TOWN. AS ILLICIT DRUGS POUR ACROSS THE OPEN SOUTHERN BORDER, INCLUDING  1,000 INCREASE OF FENTANYL LAST  YEAR, EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IS AT  RISK. WHILE DEMOCRATS WORK TO DEFUND  THE POLICE, AMERICANS ARE FACING DANGEROUS CRIME SURGES IN CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN THE END, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO CONTROL. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THE  VACCINE, YOU'RE FIRED. IF YOU DARE TO ASK WHAT YOUR  CHILDREN IS LEARNING IN SCHOOL,  YOU'RE LABELED A DOMESTIC  TERRORIST. THIS IS AMERICA UNDER 52 WEEKS

look you're used to hearing that the world is going to end that your kids aren't going to make it their grandkids definitely aren't going to make it because of climate change they want to scare you to death joe biden says it's an existential threat to humanity aoc once said the world is going to end in 12 years bernie sanders said we're going to be swallowed up by rising sea levels but does this rhetoric match up with the science throughout this video i am going to go through science like the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change the science that we all agree on we're going to compare the data and the science with the left's rhetoric now look i'm not arguing that climate change isn't real or even that it's not caused by man-made emissions what i'm saying is we don't need to be scaring our children to death so let's go through some of these claims that they make claim number one climate change is an existential threat to humanity but what does the science say in 2018 the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change report stated that in order for us to limit warming by 1.5 degrees we would need a subsequent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. they did not say that if we failed to meet that that the world would end or that there'd be any kind of existential threat to humanity nobody who is serious has actually said that and guess what else this panel found by 2100 they estimate the world economy will be three to six times bigger than it is now meaning we'll be a lot richer and that the cost of adapting to a four degree celsius increase which is an enormous estimate by the way nobody really thinks we're gonna have a four degree increase but the cost of adapting even to that would cost world gdp 4.5 percent this gives you an idea of the actual cost of climate change that the real scientists are saying is true and look nobody is saying that 4.5 decrease in global gdp is nothing but it is pretty close to nothing and it's certainly close to unnoticeable and it's definitely less than every other problem we face whether it's pandemics food shortages war financial crisis those things are things we might be investing in and get a better return for our money so it becomes a matter of what to invest in let's invest in the things that are actually harmful to us now again this doesn't mean we should do nothing i don't advocate for that but it does mean that we have to have an honest assessment of what the costs are going to be when we're advocating for certain solutions clade number two rising sea levels will swallow up america the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it okay here's what the scientists say at the u.n they say that even if we do reach that 1.5 degree celsius limit by 2100 sea levels will continue to rise they've been rising for a very long time here's what else they say by 2100 they estimate that sea levels might rise between two feet and 2.7 feet now the question is is that sustainable has anybody ever survived being below sea level well of course look at the netherlands adaptation can solve this problem other studies show that by the year 2100 our technology and our adaptation will be so dramatically better that we'll have far less flooding even with rising sea levels in the year 2000 we had over 3 million people flooded with the trends in adaptation that we have now by the year 2100 we estimate to have 15 000 people flooded and look this estimate isn't that crazy keep in mind that since the 1920s deaths from natural disasters have decreased by 90 percent we're just looking at the general trends in adaptation that human beings do claim number four extreme weather and climate change related disasters will lead to increased deaths okay well i just told you that since 1920 there's been a 90 decrease in climate related deaths in 1920 there was over 5 million in 2010 only 0.4 million and get this scientists at the unipcc also found that long-term trends and economic losses from disasters can't be attributed to climate change keep in mind oftentimes you hear astronomical estimates of the cost of climate change here's what they're doing with those numbers though they're assuming that you're going to have astronomical number of climate-related deaths but they screw up their analysis when they do that this has been long debunked they basically assume that if philadelphia ever becomes as hot as houston they'll have like 50 times more climate deaths of course that doesn't make sense they'll just use more air conditioning like we do in houston claim number five here's when you hear all the time hurricanes are becoming more frequent and more extreme again here's what the scientists say at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa they actually say that in the 21st century atlantic hurricanes might increase intensity by five percent and guess what they're actually going to decrease in frequency by 25 and before you go posting in the comments about how 2019 had an abnormal hurricane season remember that's not science you've got to look at trends to actually establish what's going on with respect to climate change and the scientists are looking at trends and that's what they're telling you and of course the last claim that the left makes is this if we just totally remake our economy and completely electrify our greater move completely to solar and win and renewables well then we'll win the battle against climate change here's the truth according to the science if all developed nations not just the us but all developed nations completely stopped emitting carbon right now by the end of the century we would actually reduce the temperature maybe by 0.8 degrees fahrenheit that's fahrenheit not even celsius 0.8 degrees fahrenheit look why am i telling you all of this because when we look at policy we have to look at trade-offs we have to look at the costs and the benefits and i just laid out for you was that the costs are not nearly as astronomical as the left would have you believe it doesn't mean there's no problem doesn't mean it's not worth investing in certain solutions but you have to invest in the right solutions you can't make those solutions make the problem even worse or just be worse than the problem itself there's some smart solutions out there carbon capture technology is very promising we have nuclear technology that gives you reliable energy and it's zero carbon if we work together and stop trying to scare our kids we can find some pretty good solutions that both help our economy and give us energy dominance and energy security and reduce global emissions that's the truth

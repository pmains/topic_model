everybody with everything going on Iran impeachment pretty much everything in Congress it seems very partisan and it is but every once in a while there is some rare moments of bipartisan agreement so on Monday we voted for the homeless Assistance Act which as you can guess tries to solve the problem of homelessness which is indeed a problem in this country and it solves that by simply allowing agencies to communicate with each other better why is this important well because in our great country homelessness is still a problem in a single night in 2019 over half a million people are sleeping on the streets and it's actually been increasing slightly since 2018 now why is that well almost entirely because homelessness increased so much in California by 21,000 people actually the good news is is throughout the rest of the country there's been a lot of declines in homelessness and when it comes to families with children and veterans those also continue to be on the decline but we should always still be looking for ways to improve so what has worked well in Houston my home town we've actually been able to decrease homelessness by 54 percent since 2011 practically illuminating veteran homelessness so why is that because by the way at the same time the population has increased drastically so what has worked well it's locally led solutions it's increasing communications between those different organizations it's a locally led solution that puts housing first gets people the resources they need and there's an amazing interaction between the private sector and the public sector and when we talk about that communication that works so well in Houston and then the removal of obstacles between agencies that's exactly what this legislation that we voted on Monday seeks to emulate

uh during the pandemic do you recall the shortage of plastic masks gloves shields and gowns under ppe yes yes and america was it was painful and life-threatening for our health care workers to not have access to ppe so if the current manufacturers were unable to meet the demand last year in the year before why would then would it make more sense to make more facilities have more facilities to produce more mass gallons shields and and gowns yes we should have a streamlined permit process to accommodate that type of dynamic market so i i i it's fundamental here now so you turn to section 902 of this bill it withholds permits new permits for facilities that would produce plastics or the raw materials to use to produce plastics could this section therefore prevent the opening of the new petrochemical complex north of pittsburgh in monaco pennsylvania or the one being plan in eastern ohio yes i believe that language would jeopardize future investment into those types of facilities so seriously we just experienced a shortage of ppe and this bill calls for more restrictions on the plastics industry mr sunday am i missing something yes sir and uh beyond ppe we use plastics in automotive devices weatherizing homes uh recreational products like canoes and backpacks we actually use some petrochemicals in not just storing and transporting the vaccine but the uh the components itself to capture the messenger rna so it can cross the bloodstream these are vital life-sustaining products and medical devices that we rely on as you mentioned

uh thank you chairman ryman chairman murray it's it's good to be with colleagues on this and there's a lot of things we want to do one of the things i want to do is confound all the cynics who have such low expectations of us there's been years of budgetary dysfunction and there has not been a budget conference in a divided congress since 1986. so we start with a low expectation bar and i think we should confound cynics the the budgetary dysfunction has hurt us dramatically in virginia the combination of shutdown and sequester hurting defense hurting other key priorities we feel it i know you all feel it in the spirit of compromise i wanted to focus on four areas where i think we are closer together than we might think as an encouragement to finding compromise first and maybe the most controversial thing i'll say is this we should acknowledge that our 2014 budget numbers really aren't that different now that sounds heretical the the senate sets discretionary 2014 spending at 1.058 trillion the house number is 967 billion and that's a difference of 91 billion dollars that's a lot of dollars but the federal budget is 3.6 trillion dollars the difference is about two and a half percent and i think you'd argue really it's smaller because the the republicans would argue the senate number might be artificially high because we assume that there would be no continuation of sequester and we assume that the house number is artificially low because you can't write appropriations bills to match the budget number so i think the real difference between these two budgets in 2014 is about one and a half percent i can't believe that we're going to miss an opportunity to do something right for the nation for our economy because we can't close a difference in 2014 of one and a half percent so we're closer than we might think in 2014. number two and this has been covered a lot we should all agree that growing the economy should be the the primary goal the major test of a successful budget is an ink on a page and it's not even gdp to debt ratio it's whether a government spending plan helps produce a growing economy where people in all regions and in all stages of life can have a path to economic success that is what we tried to do in the senate budget i look forward to more meetings with house conferees to talk about how the house budget accomplishes economic growth that should be the goal third we all recognize that sequester is a bad idea senator warner talked about this when it was passed those who voted for the bill said but don't worry we'll never get to sequester because we'll make a deal and those who voted against it largely said i'm voting against it because a sequester is a bad idea so everybody agreed at the time it was a bad idea and now in the senate senate armed services bipartisan has said we need to replace it house armed services bipartisan has said we need to replace it so if everybody thought it was a bad idea at the time and everybody still thinks it's a bad idea then there's no excuse for finding a better path forward i hear some people talking in an almost infinite way well we just can't do anything about it that's a cop-out we should be able to fix it fourth we all want to replace sequester with reductions in spending the senate's made a significant concession to the house on this we do not propose increasing any tax rates we don't we think you're right we need to make targeted cuts in spending in the discretionary side we put in targeted cuts in spending on the mandatory side but we believe strongly as others have said we have to be willing to look at the tax expenditures the recognition the tax expenditures have to be reined in as bipartisan president obama mr chairman ryan speaker boehner martin feldstein of the cea chair under president reagan mark zandy at moody's all have said we should do this why would we reform medicare affecting millions of seniors and not consider scaling back tax breaks to exxon mobil ellen greenspan said those tax breaks are tax entitlements every bit as much as medicare might be an entitlement if you put it in the tax code it's an entitlement we ought to be willing to look at all the tax expenditures and as senator kuhn said if we just reduce the tax expenditures in the budget by five or six percent it would create enough revenue coupled with an equivalent amount on the spending side that we could do significant work to replace sequester and draw our deficit down all of my comments have basically been about one thing i don't view finding compromises impossible to the contrary it's just doing our job when i was governor my houses i had divided houses for two years and two republican houses for two always passed very different budgets but we found compromise that kept it our government open and kept us with a triple-a bond rating and other states do exactly the same so my last question is this if bicameral state legislatures all over the united states can do this year in year out then why can't we we haven't done a budget conference in true regular budget order in many years isn't this an embarrassment that we here should resolve to put behind us are state legislators more talented or mob more public spirited than members of congress let's surprise the citizens who say we can't do this i know we can

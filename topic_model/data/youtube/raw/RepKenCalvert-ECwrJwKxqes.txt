it's I thank Syngenta Mr Speaker I rise today in opposition to the euros act with treat three trillion dollars in spending there are plenty of giveaways for liberal priorities such as handouts for illegal immigrants failed pension systems yet there's no funding for the defense industrial base today as we debate this measures adversaries around the world are testing our ability to defend ourselves that we battle this virus and the economic impact but instead of shoring up our defense industrial base which is comprised of businesses and every one of our districts the majority ignores the clear and present danger of those who wish to exploit this crisis China continues to secure its vision of regional dominance rather than spending billions of dollars to keep people to pend it on the government why not put them to work building more virginia-class submarines Joint Strike Fighters amphibious combat vehicles expeditionary sea bases mq-9 reaper satellites let's accelerate the generation of weapon systems including the Columbia class submarines the new frigate the b21 long-range stealth bomber the army's future vertical lift program the defense industrial base is comprised of hundreds of thousands of companies from primes to 10-person shops making nuts and bolts it's a small innovator that disrupts the system and provides leap ahead technology it's a critical industry that's completely ignored in this bill I'm opposed to the bill for many reasons it's a roadmap to even more authoritative federal government a first step toward a socialist system but today I stand for the men and women the United States Armed Forces and the defense community that supports them as the beacon of freedom and democracy in the world we must send a message that will allow for bad actors to take will not take advantage and we will continue to be the world's superpower through our ability to reject force to any corner of the world this bill is a retreat from our values and our place in the world Americans don't want unlimited handouts and dependence they went to work innovate and succeed I heard a no vote and with that I yield back the balance of my time

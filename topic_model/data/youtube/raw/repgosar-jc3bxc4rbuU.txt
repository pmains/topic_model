mr. commissioner I'm a dentist I'm not an attorney and so I I want to talk about leadership and how we do things efficiently so I I have a patient and when they come in I want to make a diagnosis so I I kind of want to know the storyline true I'm sorry you want to do what I want to do a diagnosis I got a problem I want to do a storyline I want to figure out what the story is right and your world it's tall discovery I yeah we actually would yeah what I want to do if you haven't you're you're interested in finding out what a problem is you would actually go find what makes it make sense that you would create this storyline from where it started and move it back don't you think mine's my colleague over here mister mr. Gowdy yes well I'm not quite sure if I were doing an investigation I would actually want to know what the facts were before I developed the storyline well you base the facts off of the inquiry about documents like all of this stuff that has all these redacted comments but is you want to start at the beginning of the storyline you don't want to start in the middle I mean most authors will start at the beginning of an instance and move forward right and it takes leadership to direct troops or direct people within the IRS to do so wouldn't you think certainly takes leadership to direct the employees and I guess that's my point is is that you know if I'm if I'm doing my job I want to create a storyline to facilitate this Oversight Committee true make it easy I'm not sure what you mean by a storyline well you want to make sure that you're presenting this to us in a you know in a rational manner that allows us to do our job yes I have made it clear to our employees a that a priority is to cooperate with know with the six investigations get the documents as quickly as we can to them and to the extent that they're voluminous try to figure out with them know what the priority isn't right and I'm gonna catch you right there because it's it's it's the comments I keep hearing here it's it's the storyline I can tell all my employees okay I need an x-ray of this this this this they can just go off on tangents and it's not efficient in giving us the documentation in which we want to learn true again our yeah if we give you heaps of documents but I'm not once again I'm going back to a storyline because it's not sure whether but the storyline starts at the beginning of the story right you want to go back mr. gowdy a said don't you think it's important that we started in January doesn't that make sense I mean you rationally put this together and you want to have oversight from this committee so you actually want to put this storyline together in a rational manner I mean you can do all you want I mean it throws stuff at us and it's going to take us a lot of time but it seems like more efficiently from director of your position that you would direct employees to say let's start at the beginning of what we think is the beginning we're going to start giving you this all these information starting in January of 2010 I know we didn't do that and we wouldn't do that we actually sat down with the committee's and their staffs and said what would you like what documents do you want how should we search them Oh what issues are you looking for and and we took the story line from you all and you took it from oversight that that when we said we want Lois Lerner's all of our emails there comment from you would have been then if I'm logistically thinking as as somebody that's choreographing this the story you want me to start in January where would you like me to start the Lois Lerner emails as I said with Lois the idea is if January is a plug good place to start that's fine ultimately as I said we've provided already and you'll get more than I know and you're running around and around around no I'm just I mean I'm from the private sector and this makes no sense of yours in the private so then you should know better but you should know better and for did producing a storyline that makes sense to say listen you're here to serve write because I'm here to serve how do I make this easier for you to have oversight so I want to stop there and let's go let's go to something here all right and since Lois Lerner didn't comply with our questions we need all those emails are you and I want to make sure you're willing to provide them like like we said all right okay and would you be interested in choreographing them start-finish kind of bulk yes we already have a search going on for examinations appeals and the regulatory process because that was determined to be the storyline that would be most helpful we've added now the next thing we're gonna do is January of 2010 in effect if we can do that first because if it were easy I'd be happy to comply with that request but the storyline is thus far of our emails which will take us weeks till the redact there your suggestion and request was when we try to deal with all yesterday ders the same way start with exams appeal and I got you I got one more question to ask it is it true the IRS has given the same documents to the White House into Congress that had different to redactions it is my understanding that may have occurred I have no understanding that we've redacted differently for anybody I there are those who have no reductions and those who get reductions get 6103 redactions and there redactions for 6103 apply to everybody I would want to make sure that that's followed up and and and that's right if you have other information again we'd be delighted to know it thank you

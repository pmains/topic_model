welcome back America Senator Tom Cotton is a member of the Senate intelligence committee so I assume he knows that Ohio state will dominate this weekend's game Senator cotton welcome are you a buckeye or a wolverine this weekend well every weekend I'm a Arkansas Razorback you I will say I have a soft spot uh in my heart for the game 16 years ago uh this past weekend the Saturday before Thanksgiving my men and I had just gotten out of Iraq and were sitting in a tent in Kuwait waiting for our plane back to the United States for three years and that was the so-called game of the century when both teams went in 11 nothing under Lloyd Carr and Jim Trussell and I'm sure you remember that was a narrow Ohio State Victory big game they've been talking a lot about it on Buckeye talk and this is the 11-0 and 11-0 uh meeting both of them could end up in the in the playoffs but you're gonna that was a diplomatic way of saying you're not going to say Michigan or Ohio Senator cotton I wish uh Buckeye nation and Wolverine Nation all the best I'll be rooting for the Arkansas Razorback this weekend that is the perfect lead-in that's how I approach the Republican race for president in 2024 and you have taken yourself out of that race so it's good to ask you the RJC Republican Jewish Coalition met in Las Vegas and we had our first Runway event and everybody shout uh president former president Trump showed up by video everyone else in person so it's off the starter guy has started what do you expect in terms of the number of people who will run and what is your advice to talk show hosts who are being told by national view this morning that we are quote power Brokers which is the first and I think the last time I'll ever be referred to as such um well I was not uh in attendance in Las Vegas at the Republican Jewish Coalition but that's a great organization Matt Brooks has turned it into a real powerhouse if you will in Republican politics and they commend them for having such a uh impressive lineup um since I'm not a candidate you I don't intend to be a pundit or a strategist in a cycle like all Republicans I'll be watching the candidates and wishing them all very well but I do think there's a common set of ideas or themes that any Republican running for president um is probably going to need to advance and that our voters expect to hear a lot of these are what I write about and Only the Strong to how to restore the sinews of American power after four years of Joe Biden's tenure really the third uh four-year term of Barack Obama's presidency so obviously we need to significantly rebuild our military we increase defense spending substantially we also need to refocus our military and get them back through these blocking and tackling of War fighting being ready to fight tonight not worrying about which pronouns our drill sergeants are using American energy production uh needs urgent Focus we're gonna try to do some of that in the new Congress it might be hard with Chuck Schumer still running the floor of the United States Senate um but America is the world's fossil fuel superpower we should be producing more of our oil and gas and coal not just for ourselves but for the rest of the world we also have to take control of our Southern border the crisis at our border didn't just happen it's the result of Joe Biden's bad policy choices so the next Republican president can do a lot to reverse those choices as as president Trump did in the final year of his presidency um we also need to make sure that we are restoring trust and faith in America's credibility and strength abroad especially as it relates to communist China um so again I wish all the all the potential can as well but I do think that our voters expect to hear their views on all those issues and many more of course too I I hope they're all carrying around this book only this strong because I do keep it handy because it's got the stats on rebuilding America's defense let me ask you this Senator I have I have urged the RNC and I think they were re-elect Rhonda McDaniel as their chairperson their 168 people I want them to get started early if not with you know debates with everyone on a Podium then forums where four or five of them sit around and talk about how big should the Navy be how many planes do we need what kind of Defense budget do we need do you think the RNC ought to be early out of the gate because those will generate audiences and they would generate small dollar donors and they would Elevate the arguments that Republicans want to make among themselves of course but also more more broadly what differentiates Republicans from Democrats do you want the RNC to get this thing going sooner or later so um I won't recommend certain dates to them or the number of debates I I will say in presidential politics debates are obviously very different than there are any other race you know typically in a gubernatorial or a senate campaign you might have one or two debates and it's a relatively sleepy Affair often on public television but as we saw in 2016 in our primary as we saw in 2020 the Democratic primaries the president from the base matter a lot this is where we test candidates on their knowledge of where they want to take their country and their ability to respond under scrutiny and pressure so I think it's a good thing that debate started relatively early in 2016. I think it they started around July or August perhaps that's correct one in July I know that and I know that that Ronald McDaniel has been working this over the last few years I think in our primary debates we no longer should be giving microphones to Democrats and reporters closing I think most of your listeners will remember in 2012 when George Stephanopoulos a former campaign operative Clinton was obsessing endlessly about things like birth controls in a Republican primary debate issue about which no Republican had spoken or had any plans to change the status quo so I'd suggest that we need good strong journalists not conservative partisans necessary although you've done well in debates too but people who have a reputation for fairness and will ask the kind of questions that Republican primary voters want to hear not the kind of questions that Democratic operatives in Washington want to hear you know so someone likes a Brett Thayer or Martha McCallum in that mode not former Byron York Henry Olson Mary Catherine Hamm Guy Benson there is a long list of people who are neutral as to which Republican but could ask good questions you know and that's so and those are all good examples of center right opinion journalists um there are plenty of good uh you know straight news reporters and news anchors though who could hold down the moderator chair you could also maybe have debates that have a specific angle to them like have someone such as Jennifer Griffin or Lucas Tomlinson if you wanted to debate to focus more on defense policy and the world so there's a lot of great reporters and center right opinion journalists out there who would be good moderators and questioners in our debates we don't need Democratic partisans that are wearing reporters clothes in those debates now speaking of democratic partisans wearing reporter clothes Sam bankman freed uh first of all did you accept money from him I did not at least not to my knowledge if he did it didn't go very far and I do not want people to refund it because they actually they some candidates who took SBF money are giving that to charity doubt the bankruptcy Court's going to come claw that back from you this morning Reuters is reporting that Sam bankman freed FTX his parents and Senior Executives of the failed cryptocurrency exchange bought at least 19 properties worth 121 million in the Bahamas over the past two years official property records show all right another this is just a this is a massive scandal run by democrats four Democrats with an occasional contribution Tom Amherst took 25 Grand I think or 45 Grand he'll give that to the bankruptcy court whatever what do you think why did this happen where were the Regulators Senator cotton um well I think one of the main reasons it didn't happen is that Sam McMan freed was giving 40 million dollars to democratic causes yeah I mean he may have given five or ten thousand dollars here to this or that Republican or the nrcc but the vast amount of his money went to Democrats often in six or even seven figure contributions so the Democrats had a vested interest in holding him up um as some kind of great Millennial business leader a second reason is as we now know from his text messages and his direct messages sometimes just as open placement um that he was a patron saint of the so-called ESG movement which is really just liberal politics dressed up as corporate governance um I've been cautioning investment firms and law firms and businesses not to go in for this ESG uh fraud especially as it relates to oil and gas investing because it could very well be a violation of antitrust laws criminal antitrust laws to say nothing uh Sherry duties that one has the shareholders so Sam bingman free as by his own admission you know kind of moused all the right platitudes all the left-wing catechism uh at the time he was building what increasingly seems like a Ponte scheme now there's a lot we don't know yet there's still uh breaking fast and unfortunately it looks like it may get worse for the investing public and his customers as we learn more but I think I've heard you called him to use a millennial Madoff and I think it's a well put term now well he is and there are a million people that he owes money to that aren't going to get paid back and I want this to be dived in deeply I know there will be a criminal prosecution here I suspect there will be a criminal prosecution so you won't want to get in the way of that but as to the your perch on Judiciary and Intel uh do you expect SPF to be sitting in front of you and answering questions that at some point you I'm sure he's gonna be in front of Congress remember he's been in front of Congress already the Democrats invited him in a in a friendly cordial setting even came to his defense uh against any criticism let's just say I suspect it will be somewhat less friendly you know if you in the end it might be in the House of Representatives with the Republican chairman if the Democrats don't want to dig too deeply on what increasingly looks like a Ponzi scheme that in part to help feed the Democratic Party in the 2022 elections a quick question about effective altruism the movement in which he wrapped himself I think it's all kind of seminars and and blue check Elite why not give money to Salvation Army and prison fellowship and the people who do the good work why do we have to invent a new way of helping the poor Senator cotton we know who helps the poor just give them money yeah Hugh I've had a couple of The Advocates of so-called effective altruism describe it to me again it sounds like people trying to reinvent the will when there are plenty of good Charities and churches out there doing great work for the poor here in America or for the uh unfortunate all around the world um I think in some cases that people just worked with him want to get their picture on the cover of Forbes magazine or be invited to the to the right left-wing non-profit Galas or Democratic parties uh so Senator closing this down in terms of the Herschel Walker campaign that's 50 50 matter on Senate armed services as opposed to 49 51 I'm telling people in Georgia they got to vote for Herschel because we need 50 50 on the Senate armed services committee am I right yeah there's no doubt that it matters a lot to you at a 50 50 majority or a 50 50 split on every committee um the Democrats can't unilaterally send uh the most left-wing nominees to the senate floor it takes them much longer and sometimes that has led to uh us defeating the worst nominees of course when you get to the senate floor it only takes one Democrat to defect because they realize um how terrible a nominee would be once in office also Democratic chairman with a 5149 majority can unilaterally issue subpoena for the last two years they've had to have the cooperation of the Republican chairs and of course we're just one vote away you know if it's 5149 there could be a one or two vote Democratic majority in the armed service committee let me just give you one example I offered Amendment last year during or the earlier this year drafting our annual eventual installation that would have prohibited payment of any one of these diversity consultant charlatans in the Department of Defense any more than an E5 Sergeant makes an infantry team leader out on the tip of the spear I don't think we show Arlington should be making more than that fire team leader it failed by an evenly divided vote but but if Democrats have a majority it'll be that much harder to persuade when Democrats to come along with this on very sensible policies I think you're going to have more reasonable Democrats as the 2024 map approaches Senator Tom Cotton Happy Thanksgiving and thank you for joining me

and welcome uh mclean dr mclean to the to the committee uh could you tell us how much money is being spent annually on water systems and uh repairing leaks and breaks all across this country annually thank you for the question i don't have a specific number for you on that but as you as you recognized in your statement it is a significant issue and systems do spend considerable amounts dr mclean if you can get back to me i'd appreciate that uh if you could get back with some numbers on it uh so my my question then it also close it if the american water works association has projected that it could be as much as 1.7 trillion dollars um to fix our aging infrastructure on water lines just waterline no real progress sewer and sewage systems but just on water line how long how long do you think it would be a pro what what what time frame would be appropriate to make the repairs something hopefully less than a hundred years are we talking about 20 years 30 years what would be that what would be the level of improvements we have to make it to retired in 20 or 30 years well thank you for that question the needs are great and they are they exist both in our drinking water in a year did what what would be an appropriate time frame uh to fix all our water lines uh uh that are maybe 50 years old or so some give me some conditions by which we could say we're going to fix all our water lines uh and leaks and breaks over a 30-year period is is that a fair is something like that or do you want to go 100 years decisions about construction projects really happen at a very local level and the yeah but they they're they're driven locally based on the ability to pay uh and we know most of it most of these scr they're they're not they're not grants these are uh low interest loans and maybe they can be zero but they're they've got to find the resources to be able to do that uh i've designed numbers of water systems in this country i understand a lot of how the financing goes i'm just trying to figure out what the time frame is to address that because for communities and public service districts if they're aging or unemployed they're going to be they're hard to prep to be able to implement higher rate so my question then would since you don't have you're not giving me a year on this thing i'd like to get some if you maybe you need to think about that dr mclean come back and say we we ought to fund something it could be done over 50 years or 30 years i'd like to hear that but but secondly did you go back when my opening statement was having to do with could we use the funds that we have from covid for state and local government since it's used for health care on this is with that would you agree that that's a way that we might want to approach this using the unappropriated money that the state local reports have that they could spend did you understand what i was trying to get to thank you for the question and and i will commit to getting back to you on the on your question of um of of projects and the and the years um i do could you could we use do you would you support using some of the unappropriated covet funds that are used by some states for for roads uh and bridges they've made some uh proof could we use that for water lines because right now it's my understanding we're prohibited from using that for for augmenting the state revolving fund would you would you support that concept well as director of the office of groundwater and drinking water my job is to ensure that we are as efficiently as possible using the funds that are appropriated by congress and we will continue to do that and we'll be doing that in close partnership with the states and the local communities who have these infrastructure needs okay i'm not i'm sorry i'm not going to get an answer so if i could just section 205 of hr 3291 strikes the small system variances provisions in the safe drinking water egg these variances permit systems serving our nation's smallest drinking water systems that cannot meet the national primary drinking water regulations is it correct this variance by is not permanent and that the quality of drinking water is required to ensure adequate protection of public health [Music] so as as the director of the drinking water program i am in i am implementing the safe drinking water act as as it is written um in the development of standards currently the safe drinking water act has provisions for states to give variances epa has found that water treatment is is not affordable dr mcclain i've gone over my time but uh you you filibuster very well i i hope you get back to me with the answers on the other questions but thank you very much water is it critical thank you thank you the

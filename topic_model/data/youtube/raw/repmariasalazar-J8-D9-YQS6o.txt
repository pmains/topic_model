so here I am this is the Border this is the actual border because we are very close to Rio Grande um more than 500 people have crossed through here and you can see how they're leaving all this garbage look at that garbage tank right there and on the floor the Rancher who owns this property has allowed us as a member members of Congress to come and actually watch what's really happening here I'm going to take you down now to close to the river according to the Rancher I repeat who allowed us is over there this is a pathway that thousands of people have used to come in illegally to the United States they come through here or they come up from this River here is a career brand here they come through here you can see they're underwater right here they come through here they go up they go up illegally sometimes they encounter the border patrol other times they don't at coyotes are waiting for them right at the top of the hill and then they disappear we are definitely definitely we're facing the most uh the greatest National Security crisis in the modern in modern history and and no doubt about it that it's been hitting hard probably I repeat the greatest the the biggest the most serious National Security crisis in modern times for the United States and here we are as number of members of Congress that we have to do something that's why I'm introducing the dignity law to seal the Border not only the physical border but the water border and where the levees were it doesn't matter what type of what type of terrain you find we need to stop What's Happening Here and and when you see it on the floor you here's the proof that that we are just not controlling as a country controlling what's happening and on top of that what's embarrassing is to discover that the border patrol they have less resources Technical Resources less infrastructure and less Manpower than the coyotes now the coyotes have drones and they penetrate those drones into our territory to know and locate where the border security is going to be at so that they can evade them and they can play the game so could you imagine that the coyotes and the organized crime and the cartels they have better equipment than the than the Border Patrol and where's Washington I uh I'm pretty bipartisan but there's no doubt that we have to criticize the Biden Administration for abandoning the state of Texas and all those border states to their to their Destiny to uh to their luck and here we're talking to the local local officials border patrol the sheriffs the um the hospitals um uh the the school boards and they're all telling us that they cannot anymore because they're using those State resources that are supposed to be serving the local residents the American citizens or their residents they're using those resources to pay for what the federal government is supposed is supposed to be taking care of and it's not so no doubt that we're denouncing the Biden Administration why have you abandoned the border patrol and all the other agencies that are taking care of the Southern border right now for what they're telling me the tide is high and no one is crossing but very shortly in the month of May you're going to have you're going to see 500 people coming in at night 500 people coming in in the morning I'm trying to do my best that's why I introduced the dignity law complete complete immigration reform that will seal the Border will give the infrastructure the technology and the manpower to border patrol and will give dignity to those who have been here for more than five years and help the economy because that is the other big piece the economy the business sector needs hands and we we have a shortage of Labor and those people are here now they don't have um papers they don't have a work permits so how are they going to live big problem big Scandal yeah send me your comments

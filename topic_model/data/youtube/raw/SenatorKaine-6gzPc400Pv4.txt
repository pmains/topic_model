just a couple of thoughts I was a civil rights lawyer for 17 years and then my wife was a judge and I was a mayor and governor and often had statutes or ordinances tested by the courts and so I know the the chaos that can be created with a situation like we have but I came in here and Senator Stabenow was just saying Senate should do its job why would the Senate not do its job under this circumstance why would we cut against all past precedent and say that you know we're not going to even entertain a nominee there's two reasons basically the first is it's about this particular president this particular president being treated differently than any other president has been treated fundamentally respect for this individual it's not about judge garland because they announced their position before his name was on the dock and so that issue that it is a disrespect to this particular president President Obama is not lost on my constituents Democratic Republican or independent that's what this is about and the American people understand that and I think it is it is just outrageous the second thing it's about is and we've seen this in other instances as well in the Senate it's it's kind of an anti accountability strategy wait a minute we Republicans if we voted no so if if the chair Grassley wants to be a check against the president great you can vote no and if they vote no that is consistent with the advise and consent clause in article 2 but what they want to be able to do is not vote yes or no and then think they can evade the accountability to the American public for their vote the last thing I'll say that I think is very powerful is the precedent that's being created in this the Republicans say the precedent is well we're doing this because it's the last year of an administration but there's nothing in the Constitution that conditions anybody's powers Congress are present on the last year of an administration the precedent that they're creating is if you do not like the president you never have to take a position or even take up a president's nominees that will be deeply destructive of all three institutions judiciary President Congress they will live to regret that and they should pull back from it

pleased to yield three minutes to the gentleman from Maryland the Democratic whip mr. Hoyer the gentleman from Maryland is recognized for three minutes Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker there's a lot of disorder in Washington DC there is chaos and conflict and confrontation in the White House there is conflict within the majority party in the House of Representatives there was a representation that we were going to follow regular order we have not there was no budget which was supposed to be adopted some three months ago a budget would have told all the members of the Congress and the country how much discretionary spending we were going to have the majority party has been unable to bring a budget to this floor and to pass it because of the disarray and disorder that we find in this house this rule represents a litany of broken promises and exposes frankly the hypocrisy of this Republican majority this rule would add an amendment to the underlying bill that directs 1.6 billion dollars of American taxpayer dollars toward the construction of president Trump's proposed border wall this was not in the original bill and the irony is in the Rules Committee an amendment that was in the original bill has been struck not by a vote of the defense committee or by the Appropriations Committee but by the Rules Committee they just struck out an amendment let me remind my colleagues mr. speaker of the words of our speaker Paul Ryan he said this quote we will advance major legislation one issue at a time the speaker as you probably know I've been here for some years 36 to be exact I have never seen in 36 years an omnibus or minibus brought to the floor before September why because the regular order is to consider the bills one at a time or as the speaker said we will advance major legislation one issue at a time but what the Republicans have done mr. speaker is to bring a bill and put so much in it they dare people to vote against it because of the national security we have two additional minutes to dance on me I thank the gentlelady this rule ought to be rejected it is not the regular order it is not good policy and it's not good for the institution of the house represents the country the border wall is controversial and many people in the Crump administration do not believe the border wall will be effective and they believe it's a waste of money and of course the president told us all the Mexicans were going to pay for the wall well this is one point six billion dollars of about 20 billion dollars that would have to come not to be paid for by the Mexicans but be paid for by the US taxpayer for an ineffective effort to make this country more secure everybody on this floor believes we ought to know who comes into this country and that people ought not to come into this country unless they are authorized to do so we all agree on that I asked the majority leader bring this border wall to the floor let us debate it put it open for amendment that is the regular order the speaker went on to say we will not duck the tough issues we will take him head-on that speaker Paul Paul Ryan October 29 2015 they had an amendment offered on the authorization bill by Miss Hartzler Missouri it was controversial and the majority party lost so what did they do they didn't add to the bill as Miss Hartzler wanted to do have an amendment on this floor so we get debated again it's demerits or merits depending upon your perspective but they went around not by regular order not by taking issues head-on but by having the president issue some tweet that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he never was talked to about got one additional minute no 30 seconds 30 seconds I've been Gilman's recognize my colleagues let us stand up for this institution let us stand up for regular order let us stand up for not ducking the tough issues let's reject this rule and then let's go back to regular order and hopefully do so on a bipartisan way and do what the American public expects us to do make tough decisions for them for our country for our security and for our children and I yield back the balance of my time and urge my colleagues to vote against this rule the gentleman yields back the gentlewoman reserves

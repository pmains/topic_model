thank you very much sheila no one anyone who listened to my good friend co-chair congressman in reichert state if they have any doubt as to the significance not only of this piece of legislation uh and the other three pieces of legislation that we will pursue after this i don't know what it's going to take because he was on the front lines nothing at the conjecture and so i personally thank chairman goodlate i personally thank ranking member conyers and of course our brothers in the senate senator cardin senator lindsey graham we had a press conference in april and introduced this legislation and at that press conference was gina miller and gina miller was the fiancee of a washington state trooper tony radelusku who was shot at a traffic stop in washington state and killed he went to high school in new jersey he was a vet from the gulf war as many of our police officers are and i promised gina i would not take off the wristband she gave me until we passed this legislation and it is fitting in this month when we honor all law enforcement it is fitting that we move this through the house of representatives so i'm honored to stand with dick reichert as we present this and i'm honored and thank you all for coming on this piece of legislation so you've heard the numbers about how many police officers were killed in the line of duty 2013 and 2014. it is a grave reminder that these attacks are too common in our communities last year we mourned the loss of jersey city officer melvin santiago who was killed in the line of duty responding to a gang-related robbery officer santiago's death set off a series of targeted threats against new jersey police officers from the assailant's fellow gang members the grave risk that our law enforcement officers face was tragically confirmed this past christmas when an on-duty new york police department officers ramos and lou were murdered while simply sitting in their squad car when threats like this occur the rapid dissemination of critical time sensitive information is essential an international blue alert system would provide that in new jersey and across our nation so regardless of what aspect you talk of about police work law enforcement talk must be followed by action so cops the police officers just don't need a pat on the back from us or we place our grandchildren in the back of the car to see what it's like to sit in a police car they need our actions here in washington to help communities throughout america and so mr chairman thank you for putting this before us tonight and the other bills will follow the time of the gentleman has expired and i yield back and i thank you the gentleman from new jersey yields back

by the way another hearing opens today in the house represented simply what the news media is calling it now because it seems like that's simply what it is the key witness Lois Lerner is expected to refuse to answer questions by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights on the other end of our line from Washington DC the United States congressman bill Huizenga from West Michigan welcome back to the program hey thanks MPs good to be with you is that the talk of the town it must be can Washington DC oh it is absolutely all these things when Ghazi the IRS the AP the raid that the Justice Department had on their phone records it's all the talk of the town and I got a point I just think it's ironic that this missile erener is using the Fifth Amendment while she and apparently her organization trampled on everybody's First Amendment so there there you go it's the irony it drips away these are all independent incidents of course but the is there something in kind of it that is it a culture that's cultivated is it yeah i mean i think it's the pattern of behavior and there's a lot of us that had these concerns and tried to try to talk about it this past election but you know that that i think is the frustration that so many of us have is it is just a pattern of not quite coming out with the truth not not just sort of shading detail pulls all these things and whether it's fast and furious whether it's Benghazi certainly as we're seeing with the IRS scandal here there this administration never wants to fess up and you think that cue comes from the top oh absolutely i mean it's a culture I set the culture in my own little office I can tell you that if my chief of staff and my legislative director in my district director knew some major details like this and I had to find out about it in the news like everybody else I would be looking for a new chief of staff a new district director you know and and how in the world that they think this hate nobody did that what they're calling it out here in DC is don't tell add the Washington Post labeled that you know that's just don't tell Dad mentality that they all have either they're all incompetent or this is this is definitely questioning everybody's character well isn't their mentality then that dad would really like this good good question you know it's I cannot figure it out I can't figure out the the administration's motivations and I've been talking to some of my Democrat friends here as well just really trying to figure this out and one of them said to me and I was asking a meal what's your relationship like with the administration and he says they don't need us until they need us and then all of a sudden it's like they're he's he's everybody's best friend right you know and and and that's the problem is there's a lack of trust and I've said this for for you know for the two and a half years that I've been out here and before there's just not a trust level that exists between the legislature and the executive branch and you know it's it's it's damaging the system a little bit closer to home sort of the race for United States Senate at least the Republican race for the nomination a lot of people they're pulling data that shows Mike Rogers would be way out in front in the primary but we don't really think that congressman Rogers is going to run so that leaves the next two contenders and they are Terri Lynn land and Justin Amash in terms of polling data both of them from West Michigan well we got to throw a third one in there Murray communications had a tap oh lawd i think it was yesterday my mayor Kurt Dykstra in Holland was polling at nine percent Justin Amash was at ten percent in Terry land i think was at 28 or 29 yeah of course none of these people have officially declared that they're running and the mayor's the latest to the party of course i would good i was going to ask you if you had to pick one of those three which would it be I think maybe you just gave a tell if I mean it's the mayor runs Kurt's a good friend and he he i just think it's interesting that as a heater out and a joke and his in his monologue and if you know Kurt he is very very funny a very very smart guy I despite him being tourney i really like he's a great guy but Justin Justin obviously is a new in a different very different kind of Republican libertarian Terry land you got a statewide profile she's run statewide twice already Terry would make a great candidate as well so I I think we got some good options and I'm not I'm not narrowed down to any one of them at this point and you know I still think Mike would be our strongest candidate we are heard on the lake shores ninety-two seven the van and Holland there and I hear I hear about it when I go back home all the time so I'm really glad we're on the van well thank you and and so if the you know there's been a number of people now who said yeah I think I'm running for Senate and then you know like Pavlov's dogs the media including myself we all come running and saying you know Oh Mike Flanagan the state superintendent he wants to be a senator and then Jim Murray this week from AT&T said he was thinking of running in a few days later said he's not running is is the mayor's bid to run just sort of like you said a sort of for the fun of it kind of thing or do you think he really is thinking of getting in well yeah I think I think it was a I think it was a passing element a few if his monologues above at the governor's luncheon are always very funny very witty I but it's gotten some people's attention outside of curtain outside of Holland that you know as a regional candidate that when you're when you're testing that name ID statewide that he would he would register that high but he would make a great candidate but he and I haven't had that conversation where it's like okay Kurt are you serious because here's what it's going to take so we'll see if in the next next few weeks he wants to do that or not but you know at the end of the day this is very early yet and I've been talking to some folks over on the Senate side as well and nobody's nobody's concerned that we haven't Cole lasts specifically behind a candidate like the Democrats dude they do a very good job of it they sit in the room and they go sorry you're not going to get it sorry you're not going to get your our guy this time and we'll make it up to the rest of you later the Republicans just don't work that way we we have maybe a slightly messy a process but it really truly is democratic letter will let our primary voters decide Kenny West Michigan Republican need a Detroit Democrat yeah absolutely that it takes it takes some real strategy and making sure that you're in southeast Michigan and and that you're known there which is one of the reasons what I think Terry would be a great candidate as well I mean she has been making that circuit both officially and politically for four decades and so that yeah absolutely we can have a candidate from West Michigan you can way well I'm glad you took our call and I hope you don't get a call from the IRS congressman bill Huizenga we'll see you soon maybe even on Mackinac Island next week bill Huizenga from West Michigan night States Congress

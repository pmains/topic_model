joining me now on the shocking and pervasive dysfunction on Capitol Hill and what is going on with those radical Dems Congressman Matt Gaetz a member of the House Judiciary and Armed Services Committee and Congressman as always it is awfully good to see you let's turn to the House Dems unable to condemn anti-semitism something is going on right now in the Democratic Party you've got these new pipe swing and progressives that are not like the Democrats of Al Gore and Bill Clinton back in the early 90s and they are driving the message and the agenda and the energy within the Democratic Party right now and when one of their own Ilhan Omar was concerned that some of the older more established Democrats were signaling her out she was able to rally progressives to her cause but and I think that it says a lot about the direction of the Democratic Party this is a group of people who is there going to lead with the farthest left ideas that they can because that's where the energy is in their party so what is the Republican Party going to do in as a countervailing party that there will be seeking votes as we approach 2020 I don't hear the Republicans standing up loud proud tall and strong well you see the president doing that tweeting about the dangers of a mr. president you tweeted but my level than that congressman well the highest level this president rose to in support of Israel and showing the world that we are standing against anti-semitism and women I quite understand the embassy tweet so I mean I think there's a that moving the embassy is the most significant tangible thing we've done and talking about a reaction to specifically if I were not clear and I know that you interpreted me correctly this specific moment of anti-semitism they awful awful remarks of this congresswoman and the absolute failure of the Democratic Party that should be we should be hearing from every Republican in my opinion Wow I got it I got look Republicans have stood strongly with representative Lee Zeldin who has led the effort on the Republican side to condemn anti-semitism and to restate our unwavering is terrific I taking action and we're standing with him here's the problem Lou what we don't want to do is unite the Democrats by making this like a Republican versus Democrat issue the Republican Party what the Democrats take care of themselves that's what you want to do III hear that but right now you have an internal fight in the Democratic Party that it's tearing them to pieces this is merely one manifestation of that my view for Republicans let's go tell people what we believe let's back up those beliefs with strong action like the President did moving our embassy to Jerusalem and then let's go out and make our case to voters that we are a party that is actually moving forward with tangible things that show our commitment to our values and that it's making the world a safer place but neelix you have the opposite with mats congressman let's turn to the disarray within the Republican Party who got as many according to congressman Rand Paul as congressman Senator Rand Paul as many as ten Republicans who are going to vote against the president vote for the resolution condemning the national emergency declaration use and you're talking to me about division within the Democratic Party congressman oh that's one were the Republicans the Coyotes and traffickers and terrorists who are taking advantage of our southern borders well and you can persuade me there's a national emergency we have been talking about the national emergency on this broadcast for twenty damn years well the problem is that we do have a challenge in the Republican Party where people don't see this this is the emergency that it is when you have enough fentanyl coming in the country to kill a third of the country when you start to see ms-13 gang members popping up even understand that there is a crisis and out of it is a crisis within the Republican Party in which ten senators would line up against the President of the United States who is trying to secure the border and to protect our national sovereignty of course it is that is a terrible betrayal of the American people who voted for this president and who expect this wall to get built an illegal immigration to stop and by the way it's not just the wall it's Iver fi its cracking down on sanctuary cities it's ending chain migration and I think it's looking at the issue of birthright citizenship when you have people that purpose sanctuary seek advantage of it merit-based immigration as the president has suggested I have to tell you I I watch something today that I found sickening and that was this president sitting next to Tim Cook at a CEO conference in the White House on the workplace to be led by the advisory board led by Ivanka Trump and and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and if what I heard was more labor arbitrage more I more immigration and more competition against the American worker at at just the time the president's policies are paying off with higher wages for our working men and women and a strong economy I found that dispiriting and I found it an absolute reversal that was enix to me is inexplicable well and I find it similarly disconcerting that a lot of those big technology companies are the very people who line up against the president's policies for reciprocal trade I'm one of the sponsors of the reciprocal trade Act and so we can't invite people in to help us solve our workforce challenges who then are lined up against us on the critical issue of making sure that we put American workers first and then we don't hollow out our middle class by sending jobs overseas because we're too full foolish to make good trade deals and so I think that having reciprocal trade and having people buy into that is really important to dealing with the long-term work force challenges we have in the country you and I get to agree one more time I thank you so much thank you congressman Matt gates one of the great Americans representing faithfully his his constituents and the nation

some governors are reopening their states before we have adequate testing let's talk about why that's really reckless well we have more people moving around we're probably going to see our cases continue to go up but we're a lot better prepared for that now than we were over a month ago we have the hospital bed capacity it's the governor really saying we've got more hospital beds so let's put them to use social distancing and shutting down states bought us time together we slow this thing down and reopening too soon runs the risk that we'll lose everything we gained sad irony here is that the protest was that they don't like being in this stay home order and they may have just created a need to lengthen it experts have repeatedly warned reopening too soon could lead to a spike in cases I can't supersede the governor's order but I certainly cannot in good conscience say that I agree with his order and I will continue to use my voice as mayor of Atlanta to ask people to continue to stay home no one should be forced to have to choose between going back to work and being safe and healthy here's a better choice a proactive nationwide plan to stop this virus in its tracks that means ramping up testing so that we can reopen states safely so that a small outbreak can really get a quick response before it becomes something big and we must establish a nationwide contact tracing program it takes a federal government leading a huge response operation and that's the problem we don't have a president with a plan supposing we hid the body whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and then I see the disinfectant that's about almost the cleanings so you know not everybody wants to do such significant testing ultimately we're doing more testing I think than probably any of the governor's even want that's just delusional to be making statements like that the president doesn't want to help on testing he said 11 times I don't want to get involved in testing it's too complicated it's too hard every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests no matter what you do you'll never satisfy you could find the cure tomorrow and and they wouldn't be satisfied they'd find a reason to complain twice guys reopening states too soon will force everyone to make hard choices but it will be especially tough on people who are struggling just to get by we also know that this virus is disproportionately hitting communities of color so reopening too soon puts those communities at much greater risk this is a crisis within a crisis and we need to call it out as a nation we should stand up manufacturing infrastructure and contact tracing so that we can put people back to work producing what we need and tracking down cases of this virus and I have a plan to do just that and push that plan into the next stimulus package gut Elizabeth Warren comm join us [Music]

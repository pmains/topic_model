the gentleman yields back for what purpose does the gentlewoman from California seek recognition without objection good morning and listen America one of Affordable Care Act's biggest successes was increasing mental health services for all the people through mental health parity protections and medical expansion the GOP pay more for less bill cuts taxes on the wealthy at the expense of those who can least afford to pay for their health coverage like low-income families one in five of Medicaid 17 million beneficiaries have a mental health or a substance abuse order and the reports show services are needed especially for children the bill would hurt those people by eliminating Medicaid expansion and gutting mental health services for this group and including the nearly 60,000 now covered in my district I strongly oppose this repeal effort and urge our Republican colleagues to work with us to strengthen the Affordable Care Act so more Americans can have access to life-saving care please please do that for us I yield back the gentlewoman yields back for what purpose is a gentleman from Georgia seek recognition

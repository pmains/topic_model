[Music] first I wanted to tell you that they thought was 3 years ago the dictaphone we had a hundred thirty-eight ticket sold in a couple of weeks ago this year we're gonna have 10,000 [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my favorite lunch is a great one from 1962 the top is from California to top of the tough part the button is a color brown the bottom part of the button is a cover pink and then the middle that says I asked so if you look at this in where's this meaning it's a rigid pixiv button against Pat Brown and Brattain is pink rubber 62 [Music] [Music] [Applause] in 1996 [Music] [Music] [Applause] now the third president but just one of the business [Applause] he gained experience goes back to the Nixon campaign they were from Ronald Reagan campaign and that inspector which I I Roger stone of course is out as a charity of longtime confidant of the president dr. long time longtime support long time supporter of Jim white banks [Applause] [Music] she's uh she's the former assistant prosecutor something called Watergate that was Bobby Abreu bring up some memories but you were there during the [Music] [Applause] James Garber of course is heavily responsible for the election that Bill Clinton in 1992 successes career but almost impressive of course is the Harris Wofford win in 91 in Pennsylvania but that's because Carville knows his stuff and been around and a lot of Democrats listen to his words so so with that without the reason obviously there's an elephant in the room and of course it is we're sitting down in the White House there is special committee initial deputies going on investigating the president there is a discussion about obstruction of justice nothing is proven but there are things out there that remind us we might some people of Watergate and perhaps even include that Beach and of course we know that anybody on the panel notice a name the last president who was impeached and removed from office by the Senate never right so so this is what what the opposition up against but this mobile talked about for them looking to the store with you Jill because you were the special assistant prosecutor deputized computer under Leon Jaworski is a terrific article concept so do you see parallels I mean of course again you know the president remember the break-in the boarding gate was June of 72 the earth and hearings was the spring of 73 the Senate thank pastor was October of 73 resigned to August 7 for two years which took about six months and his presidency but do you see a parallel I see so many parallels that we could spend the rest of his panel talking about the parallels and some of them are the obvious things like both about the break-in at the DNC one was a physical break in one was electronic they both evolve a very colorful cast of characters that honestly I thought you'd never be able to make up another cast as funny as the Watergate cast and now going on and it's the same kind of cast of characters they both involved obstruction of justice it is irrelevant whether there is collusion in Trump gate it's irrelevant what the underlying crime is although here it's potentially much more dangerous because it about a foreign government interfering with democracy in our election that is much worse than just breaking into the DNC but that's irrelevant acts of obstruction are what we ought to focus on that's what's dangerous we can't have a president is trying to fire collar a president by on combing a president who's interfering in every way with the Department of Justice I never thought I'd be supporting sessions but I hope he stays and doesn't give an opportunity to replace Mahler so there are there are just numerous numerous once there's an eighteenth and they happen a gap which is alluded to which was rosemary stretched explanation and then we have an eighteen for firing clinic after we knew that he had been compromised by the Russians so there's there's millions of things and then there's the personalities of the two presidents both of them were insecure both of them they have grandiose ideas of himself and both of them are amoral and I think those are the things that have led to [Applause] because yoga teacher Omar [Music] James Carville James Carpentier involved obviously at the top strategist of Bill Clinton he was also impeached by the house you see comparisons between Clinton and Trump and you think there was a democratic argument to be made six months into the presidency very much of a power if I recall they wouldn't think was about context and some people had draw an analogy between star star with special counsel back yeah wouldn't say we know who's not was in actually I'll never get over buckets I just don't like the town the other way and I thought he was wrong choice out they get it right Roger you work for both Richard Nixon and Donald Trump and have been feelings about both you important not that walk on when we said that working and trumping would if were to call it as apples and oranges you feel that way well I can see some parallels between Watergate and today I speak specifically of the document released by the FISA Court in November that without any question said they were both all-knowing illegal unconstitutional surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans for political purposes posted those who are outraged by the Watergate are regarding to these crimes they're certainly cried Farmer Murphy's than what we saw in Watergate in the question of Russian collusion or Russian involvement where is the underlying crime what is the crime that mr. Mueller is investigating we don't have evidence of a crime we have allegations but yet before the two congressional committees or in the activities of the media we still don't have evidence of a crime started with a prime the memory bank into the Watergate combat implored Democratic National Committee and when as you may remember downhill from there so I do see the parallels but I think the parallels are between the abuses of the Nixon administration and the abuses of the Obama administration if you get a memo that says it is subject a substructure my person associated with the Kremlin has dirt dirt on Hillary Clinton does that sound like head and Donald Trump jr. the son of a parrot prisoner and pull metaphor mole go to this meeting and they see this in the subject line does that seem a little bit like first of all such a lady would not be a crime I must say to the crime secondarily in a presidential campaign if someone came to you and said I have documented evidence of wrongdoing by our opponent you'd be guilty of malpractice not to determine whether what they came here with was accurate the fact that the Russian women lawyer got into the country without a visa was allowed into the country by the FBI find that troubling finding the pictures have heard of the very Clinton demonstrations I find that troubling the pictures of her in senator McCain's office I find that company yeah I smell what's called the setup [Applause] [Music] [Music] in the house to explain what has to be done first what we saw in Watergate was it's not the initial crime it's the cover-up Nixon was never impeached nor were there articles of impeachment that said he planned or colluded with the initial burglars he was impeached for obstruction justice so the question before us is whether there's obstruction of justice that's been shown by clear and convincing evidence obstruction of justice applies when you use threats to stop an ongoing FBI criminal investigation this seems to have happened on at least two perhaps three occasions first Comey was threatened if he didn't lay off the criminal investigation of Flynn second Comey was fired and the president tells us on the record cholesterol that that that that was intended to interfere with delay live in a wave of the investigation of the Russian collusion and then third we have got statements made by the president kind of warning Muller not to look at his personal finances now for something to be obstruction of justice you could be convicted of obstruction of justice even if your intent is unsuccessful or inept or if you obstruct justice two or three times unsuccessfully in an amateur I don't think these people who are threatened or deterred but it's the if you take a look at section 1512 B 3 of the Criminal Code you'll see something that you thought you'll see the code defining as a felony obstruction of justice and it applies to what Trump has done and with cope with the first instance we have the sworn testimony of a percipient witness who's highly regarded in law enforcement circles and you know it's not like Comey is like a big fan this guy wanted to serve in did serve in the Trump administration and yet he has testified that he was threatened in order to get him to drop the investigation of Flynn and fired crying you know with water gated we'll never know what the burglars were looking for we certainly don't know that Richard Nixon was personally involved in that burglary it's the obstruction of justice and likewise we may never know whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian hackers who's clear was behind the Russians have been a crime they cyber burglaries as much crimes Bertha the Russians committed crime we'll never know whether they colluded or Romania maneuver they colluded with the Trump campaign but we didn't stop the investigation into the Russian hacking and the Russian coat attempted collusion or alleged collusion didn't stop some of them so how is that obstruction of justice if the investigation wasn't deterred on obstruction of justice applies even when you attempt it it doesn't work if you give if if but you know that the police's effect is coming over and you hide the murder weapon in a place where they find it it's still obstruction of justice you and you threatened a witness and the witnesses through you and they go testify anyway it's still obstruction of justice obstruction of justice when you attempt to impeach justice dozen men 20% successful Enterprise rocker went when he involved [Music] [Music] please forgive us admitted that my arguments are highly persuasive because your only response is not that Trump hasn't committed high crimes and misdemeanors but that there's some other problems your motivation is entirely inviting people 17 every intelligence agency set the rush attack yesterday [Applause] impeaching Donald Trump is to say Obama's bad and grants bad and Hillary's probably bad - that may or may not be true here a difference the evidence I clipboard came from a declaration by the by support you've got a series of allegations in retirement the House Intelligence Committee selected initially by Donald Trump to head the FBI then you've got the statements made by Donald Trump on video David eleska Hall I don't if one went through was Trump line and then you've got the statements made warning Muller from the mouth of Donald Trump so you've got sworn testimony plus videotape plus audiotape [Applause] mr. fireman for a conflict of interest he threatened her to try to prevent him from continuing the investigation if it dealt with Trump's finances by Matt's obstruction of justice [Music] is different it requires whatever Congress is a threat to democracy okay now chairman and follow-up question obviously is that Richard Nixon was impeached with a Democratic Congress Bill Clinton was impeached with the Republican Congress you have a Republican Congress and a rich certainly Republican to the chariot division where your bill would go given what we've seen from the house of Senate so far regarding downtrod a little better six months into this presidency what are the odds of a Republican Congress impeaching this president I agree it's political but I will say that what we need is an investigation Roger any investigations with circumstantial evidence with suspicions that's one of the best for the facts you don't start out when I started to Watergate we didn't know that it was going to lead to the president that was never anything that we had any reason to believe and we started questioning witnesses and we found out there were tapes and as we got the tapes and heard the crimes being committed in the Oval Office that's when we knew we hadn't run but you have to take this one step at a time if you've stopped the investigation and remember The Smoking Gun Watergate was a week less than a week after the break-in you hear Richard Nixon and Haldeman his chief of staff who was replaced by a general much like what just happened in the White House now saying let's use the CIA to stop the FBI half the CIA director tell the FBI to stop the investigation into the money because it will threaten national security what it would have directed is showing that the money that paid those burglars came from the committee to re-elect the president that's where it came from then the cover-up money came from creep Anna came to the White House that's what we discovered by an investigate and that's what we need to do versus make we're assuming that Chuck has not had these white house palaces of thing because basically if richard nixon's didn't have these capes it would be not the case against him my question is Richard did break it with gsfe to find once later Richard Nixon was re-elected with 49 states out of 50 states as a prosecutor when did you think that oh my goodness is something bigger than what we have is something bigger than what we expected well I read the Washington Post right after the break-in and as a prosecutor in the organized crime section I had the instinct that there was not just a second rate burglary as the white house described that it was something more but it wasn't until really March when James McCord one of the burglars and tried to get himself a better deal on sentencing after you'd been convicted of the burglary wrote to Judge Sirica and said you're right Judge Sirica there's much more involved here people lied on the stand they said there was no one involved when there was much money has been paid to keep us quiet that was the first clue then John Dean started to cooperate now would John Dean we'll leave against the president I'd say I give the benefit of the doubt to the president but then in July John Dean started cooperating and about April maybe even earlier July just a few months later we find out some Alexander Butterfield there's taste we have to then decide what takes do we ask for there's gonna be claims of executive privilege we won't get them we have to be able to prove that they were in furtherance of a crime for the parts of give him to us we picked nine tastes mostly based on John Dean's testimony and White House logs of when there were meetings and phone calls and then he stonewalled the president stonewalled and it wasn't until after the Saturday night Massacre when he said okay because there was a public outcry and people were disgusted and fed up he realized he wouldn't keep you stonewalling he said he turned them over then he said well all except three that are missing that a month later and really bad trial tactics he said oh and there's another one with an eighteen and a half minute gap and then we finally was forced by the courts to turn over and we didn't get the smoking gun until much later when we issued a trial subpoena after the indictments so that's how it developed it just takes time to get it right I agree with you that I don't think this proof yet there's no tapes yet we're also talking about it to be your investigation into Nixon and this was just six months but I don't like to talk about hypotheticals but it seems clear in my eyes and there's no question that the president is trying to get rid of Jeff Sessions and the thought is that he would get a prompt reply of all the turkey dinner somebody who's not recused himself somebody could fire Robert on the sink it's gonna happen but it could happen if the president picked the new Attorney General who would fire a bomb mother or Rosenstein or whoever's investigated that stuff proof of wrongdoing but did you see the argument of Justice I think the president his pleasure with Jeff Sessions has to do with the fact that he has to not pursue the crimes of the previous administration pretending surveillance is spying on American citizens I was one of the I'm anxious to testify before the House or Senate Intelligence Committee I've asked for no immunity but I would like to testify in public don't require voluntarily but if what if he are peddling it ought to be public because they failed me in public I was demeaned in public I was defended I should have exchanged the respondent over what we saw on the 24th when I was supposed to testify is that Michael Caputo who is a young man who is a close friend of my celebrity years did testify it was not allowed to have a copy of the transcript he was not allowed to see Duncan transcript and then said the day after that a member of the House your party the clunkiness no James Kennedy of perjury without access to the transcript is one people to defend himself that's why these earrings [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sessions I think the president if it is and it is now clear that the Senate will not go on recess so he can't make a recess appointment we smell the fact that he wanted to get rid of sessions and then put in somebody else on a recess appointment if he fires sessions now they won't even have a hearing this odd confirmation perhaps till next year in the first second and fiftieth question would be do you promise not to fire Muller so then any idea that by firing sessions you're going to be in a position to fire Muller the stronger argument for the president would be to say that the regulations that provide that a president cannot fire a special counsel or somehow unconstitutional under the theory of a single executive but as long as he's relying on the Attorney General to do it that isn't gonna happen but I want to get back to the idea of what's going to happen doctors the parallels to Watergate about a year after we discovered the water articles of impeachment were filed and a year after that they were voted on just in the Judiciary Committee and only 1/3 of the Republicans voted for them even though they ended it about a year after the we discovered the cyber burglary of the Democratic National Committee articles of impeachment were filed and perhaps a year from now and as you point out we have a Republican Congress there will be a vote in the Judiciary Committee for that to happen you would need a bigger wave of public concern than we had in 1974 because the rule which is the the second thing that hasn't is famous for that has been true is that you don't go forward with something unless you have a majority of Republicans with you so to try to get you laughs to hold hearings in the Judiciary Committee is going to take a larger public outcry than what we had in 1974 James whenever Nancy Pelosi is asked about impeachment you said that's premature they only want to talk about during the Iraq war when some of the leveling we talked about impeachment of Bush and Cheney she said get this off the table of me hit me she's saying the same thing about chemistry Chairman's resolution I think what we need to do is Buick is gonna get to the bottom of this dangers maybe a lot some people think let's see what Hitler put what he said but actually that's a hundred I definitely need but I wanted to come here and talk about and they wouldn't happy [Applause] people who were blood conferences like this would prefer to talk about beach see more particle impeachment just to be on this panel the fact that I can even speak with ten decibels is because because when I see live what I want to yell about monetary policy I can't even get up to one decibel the the other thing I'll point out is that one of the effects of talking about it is the Republicans are warning the president change your behavior and the best example of enemy it's happening privately a lot but Lindsey Graham saying don't fire sessions or they'll be Yellin vague what does he mean by hell to pay he means it beats me so the immediate benefit effect of talking about impeachment my resolution since part back is to try to get through to the White House that the recklessness has gotta stop the flirting out on Intel to a foreign minister of Russia has got to stop and if the president his future you ask me where were the futures Trump's futures ISM is in his own hands if the recklessness incompetency stops I'm not going to have any Republican support matters and if that happens if we can stop the reckless and confident that's not so good Roger do you I mean I understand why you don't see a Russian angle behind this I really don't given the fact that the president is more willing to criticize versus more onerous headlines and not criticize the fact that all the Democrats they the Podesta females were leaved and and the DNC ethos but not the Republicans I mean and and the fact that you talked about your relationship with WikiLeaks and of some point in anything that they were to come and you said or you just boasting put it happened like a day or two before all these emails like just contained in the WikiLeaks tweets of July right so this is not hardly a state see do not always say the secret but the fact is is that you see all these these connections with Russia with the fact that don't mean that trumped-up I'm sorry at the truth jr. and Matt afford and Custer will be something sent associate of Kremlin meeting with dirt on Hillary out war apparently was offered some kind of dirt on Bush in 2001 to the FBI would that have been forward power is offering a foreign government perhaps an adversary government is offering something to the Trump campaign about his opponent that doesn't concern you at all first of all there is a partial partial shot in the back female is anybody there was the Russian we'll country Jones campaign and we actually had it would do but Russia and then and criticized human rights abuses the United States in that Russia just a low flat [Applause] [Music] yes and then convinced the president to join the European Union completely contrary to this the president fled to Russia the president who was illegally deposed and thrown out of town not my treatment not by an election but run out of town by Mao yeah that president that you and my design from what I can see the devil Flynn is guilty gross stupidity I still don't see the crime I discovered a few endeavor that consult and you will watch all these things happen you I mean it just seems like you're violent I have known doctor for a long time and you obviously have some feelings but you don't see anything suspicious worrisome at all here's what I do know Donald Trump does not favor more over Syria he does not favor the expansion of the proxy war he did not favor a no-fly zone no I think his position when it comes to Russia is one of they talk if no illusions about the Russian system he knows it's a rotten system he knows that they oppress gays and Christians and Jews he knows that is a killer but thermonuclear war over Syria bad idea [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] don't start by kicking the ball [Applause] [Applause] [Music] it says so I think the differences we saw between Clinton and X is that as you point out when I think that at least some of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee the Hamilton fishin's of the more moderates supported impeachment know Democrats supporting to feature it with Clinton so I was wondering how strong about an issue is popular opinion when it comes to this well also keep in mind that it was three Republican leaders went to Richard Nixon and said you do not resign you will be impeached and convicted it was Senator Barry Goldwater who let that work and that's what led to his resignation it was when they finally saw the truth they heard the June 23rd tape which said use the CIA to stop the FBI the president have been saying all along I didn't know anything about this cover-up I didn't write about the burglary and clearly within days of the burglary he was leading the cover-up and I believed that Congress and the American people will get to the same point when they see real facts they will stop being partisans and they will start being Americans and they will support whatever is the right [Music] we work today in 1974 you had a monolithic mainstream media ABC NBC CBS New York Times and watch the ones to actually think is really in a way different times and then later the bump today thanks to the internet the fact that wouldn't fifty percent of the people are getting different moves through their handheld device and therefore the internet you have a vibrant and robust alternatively there is no one error yeah okay year on the mainstream media active in here and I have to reach critical mass with removal of Richard Nixon you are not going to have a monolithic mainstream media you're not going to have a monopoly of the dissemination of political information by three networks which is why an attempt to impeach Trump will [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's very clear that Donald Trump is afraid of this he wouldn't be talking about sessions he hasn't evaluated any of his performance at the Department of Justice except the not whether it makes America safe but whether he makes Trump sing a supposed to make America see it he's talking about he's talking about little else he is afraid of this but in the future of trumpets and drums hands if we see competence and care if we see him most control he's not good with rushing in your life how do you have never pet bribed somebody to not talk about them to not admit to commit a burglary I mean you've never had sex understood the questions but let me ask you all starting with you James doesn't trust Urbana saying that did you survive this term is he sir finish his term to get about reelection but these divisions term in office [Applause] if we don't agree that then is a rectangular table as a fact that we can't debate what the facts need and I think that the multiplication of and gerrymandering which has led to congressmen being elected who do not have to compromise and that compromise because they'll lose their seat if we don't agree on the facts we can't debate the facts and he may be right that what's happened now we will never have a unanimous agreement but having said that I think if we follow the money do you think the American public deserves to see Donald Trump's tax return go back down to over the last year I vow to return to release his tax returns yes I think [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a lot of people view the media of being liberal I just want to show you something that I'm not showing everybody this before [Applause] got about three years like the ten just upset is I'm the only guy you know with a dip at the back and the front [Applause] plenty of room for a jet to about drop a little bit lower it's really not for me it's a daily reminder that in life when you get knocked down when you are defeated when you make mistakes when things don't go the way you want them to it's about resilience it's about persistence [Music] [Applause] I have the option of adding the water Buckley and Reagan for a mouth Russian congressman here your bill for impeachment you have one co-sponsor so far out dream to sing everything the president's fate is in his own hands if he starts to govern as a competent Republican populist well I I think that the people around him were trying to convince him that he has to change look he's cutting impulses that he does control he loved the fire monitor and sessions and he noticed he's been warned not to do that and so I I you know he's got a new chief of staff and look having competent Republican leadership working effectively for terrible values is not my first choice it doesn't necessarily political party to throw out a guy that is off the rails and put in somebody that might be more effective advocate for Republican value so I I think that whether Trump finishes his term is entirely drugs and before we further questions such as what is the audience how many people would support impeachment of the president today that's how happy would not another common okay with listing my question is for Roger on what planet did it ever become okay to parse the difference between ethical and legal consider that a valid argument in favor of your president a second part of that question [Applause] so I grew up in the rural Midwest now I live in New York City and I feel like every day we're seeing more and more studies coming out that show that the rural areas are getting redder and redder and cities are just getting bluer and or but I'm worried about the future of bipartisanship and do you think that this is something that we overcome when it seems like Democrats and Republicans are just literally interacting less and less each other every day well I would hit one of the reasons is is is probably redistricting the fact is most of our time distance work for like 55 45 Republic would have difficulty but democratic and you had to move over the opposite party to to get reelected now everything is 8020 so there's no reason to do compromise but what you to give me not only do we have gerrymandering and not in California where we have not a lot of things we have citizens Jerry memory where people choose to live where they agree with the folks you've got full foods neighborhoods and Sam's both neighborhoods you've got the center of the city and out of it you've got exurban and that is one of them one of the problems and when you look at why we lost the last election I think a chunk of it is on whether what people think of funny I don't like them not a better but if people in who hunted Wisconsin or western Pennsylvania think that they're being looked down on for BAM decide they're not going to listen to your music quantitative easing if they think you're looking down genuine solution for you're talking about the people who live in counts one your atom science question glasses how many people here from California I'm a feeling lightening up the Democratic Party good [Music] remember talk about to death when during the Bush presidency we talk about Texas seceding which would end Republican presidents forever if California [Music] 58 oh we've come in those 64 years where were you have you know Nabokov floppier $10,000 bracelet 60 minutes can you have all of us understand I grew up in Prague which is a very big concern [Music] [Music] it just seems to me we've come so far I think that the thing is just so you know teacher does not quit you people are going to start I think he's going to be gone [Music] [Applause] okay I heard you today somebody's approval rating Trump's approval rating is 37 percent or something like that 34 okay he was elected with a 37 percent approval rating in many many polls so could it be that popularity is not necessarily what people are thinking about that may be other factors come into play confidence or a high approval rating but maybe that won't make a difference well then that's a very good point but also natalie was was Donald Trump very unpopular in 2016 his Democratic opponent has very similar local markings in the world I mean Jade says that James is unfair that not particularly popular if you look at 5:38 or you go RealClearPolitics you can track over a period of time it's a proven a discipline and it's just not true that it stays the same the whole time 5:37 at the time 1415 point chain on his net overall approval disapprove it remains in the high level but you know so it's not they actually have the kind of chart you can see what difference it doesn't doesn't be popular the 30 60 percent approval rating a president of does that matter well first of all dangers essentially right but at no time is 15 it is not that great I'm not sure I think the question has a point which is I'm not sure that it's a factor here in other words if you pointed out both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are extremely polarized as he was airing enormous normally between debilitated menus and in the election and therefore I'm not sure we include rating he tells us where this is going to go I don't think we know over 80 pretty have one thing in common they don't have to face the the boat so all the predicts the college the distant act anybody have got above the primary is very important number is not true is that the number of Republican identifiers are down the nobility so if you're getting 85% of 40 learning in 83 percent of 37 it makes a difference because rather than right now this big it gets taken gracious you said he remained high approval ratings among Republicans so if I'm a Republican congressman I thought he gets you right stone and come in at the right lot of money but that goes back to guilts point that it wasn't Peter Rodino and Elizabeth Holtzman the wind that Richard Nixon it was Barry Goldwater Hugh Scott drone Reynolds and people like that after me after hear being beat not but the only three networks we have yes six months into his second term only twenty four percent of Americans thought Richard Nixon should be impeached right now it's forty seven percent of Americans think Tron should be impeached now but as James points out you got a window in Republican areas so I you know it's forty seven percent of the country it's probably forty seven percent this room but and we'll take another year of catastrophic incompetence before articles of impeachment are passed and I hope you don't see I hope I hope Trump it does a good job if you know possibly be elected meaning big sum over so now whether that has to do with incorrect modeling and novice did whether has to do with that why didn't she win by 20 points oh yes Alan Dershowitz one of the most well respected attorneys in this country so my question to you [Music] to hurt our country [Applause] [Music] that comment at a time when I was not in favor of articles of impeachment I filed only I even went on record that I would begin preparing articles only after the sworn testimony of James Comey that was after what you vote there there she would say I agreed with Dershowitz when he said it it wasn't enough for me to see leach to the New York Times I needed to see evidence sworn by a precipitant witness under penalty of perjury but when I saw that and then we added again an after death which is comments the comments to Lester Holt and then after that we see the threats to Muller I think they're true words might reach it up another conclusion that I know Larry drive already has [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's what I got my Rockets stone tattoo i mega know what was going on back then anyway my name is Henry I have Katie Ellis political junkies my podcast thank you for coming [Applause]

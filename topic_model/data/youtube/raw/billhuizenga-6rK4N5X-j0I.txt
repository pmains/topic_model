hi this is congressman bill heisenga and as we mark the 39th year since the supreme court's roe vs wade decision i wanted to take this opportunity to update you on what i'm doing in congress to continue to fight for the rights of the unborn and to ensure that those at the end of their life may end it with dignity in a natural manner as it should be one of my first votes in congress was to vote to make the hyde amendment law many of you may know henry hyde from illinois was a champion of this cause for decades but instead of leaving it to congress every year we need to make sure that this was written into law it will ensure your tax dollars will not go to pay for abortions that was in response to the president's health care law and there's a lot of work left to do on that to ensure that this law doesn't include the loopholes that will hurt our efforts to protect life on all levels i also voted for the protect life act which will prevent those in healthcare industry from feeling pressure to learn or be involved in an abortion procedure it's also known as the conscientious objector clause we've worked on a number of other issues this year including listening to you hard-working taxpayers who said they don't want their money to pay for abortions so my colleagues and i in the house of representatives are working very hard to try to end that in all cases we've also taken a hard look at planned parenthood a significant portion of its services include abortions yet almost half of its revenue is tax payer dollars i believe that's unacceptable and i voted to stop them from getting any federal funding we must also look to work to continue as a community to show those with unplanned pregnancies that we love them that that baby is loved also and that there are alternatives and that we're going to support them so i ask you to join me in that that very important step i hold this issue very near and dear and i spent almost 10 years as the right to life representative for my church in zealand my wife natalie is on the board of our local crisis pregnancy center i promise i'll continue to fight for the sanctity and dignity of life as your congressman as well thank you and god bless

lawsuits over a controversial census question a possible trade war with China and a move to give lawmakers more power and nuclear weapons talks all are among the issues facing representative Brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks when Congress is back in session next week congressman Sherman is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia and former chairman of the Subcommittee on international terrorism non-proliferation and trade good morning to you good to see you sir China you know we've known for some time there's some unfair trade practices you know between the two countries why are we now facing a possible tariff war and who stands to take the biggest hit here well I think our trade policy's up until now have been a big problem I opposed NAFTA CAFTA shafte and especially most favored nation status for china for all too long we've ignored this and that has created some big profits on Wall Street but we've lost millions of jobs now Trump is trying to do something about this and you know I tend to support Trump on almost nothing but I'm not sure he's doing it the right way he started by going after our allies Canada and Europe on aluminum and steel what he should have done is go first and foremost after China where they're stealing of our intellectual property they're unfair subsidies and and and and hidden tariffs have really created it the most distorted trade relationship two countries have ever had you recently introduced legislation called the nuclear cooperation Reform Act of 2018 it's basically moved to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 what what is it and why why is it necessary well a lot of countries want to cooperate with us in building nuclear power plants and one of those is Saudi Arabia but we've got to be concerned that they not try to develop nuclear weapons and our position is that if they'll agree to what we call the gold standard agreement which they're for the United Arab Emirates agreed to fine we'll let that go but if this this is an agreement that allows them to move toward a nuclear then we need Congress to get involved and go forward only if if we vote for it because I Saudi Arabia is against Iran but that doesn't mean that they're a Jeffersonian democracy and it doesn't mean that Saudi Arabia having nuclear weapons makes the Middle East safer right this act also looks to amend wording about Nationals of third countries and their access to reactors and sensitive material explain that for us when we have a nuclear cooperation agreement then we supply fuel we license the technology to build the reactor and we provide training on to how to use the reactor and that of course involves their Nationals coming here for training and all of that is subject to a nuclear cooperation agreement we should have one with Saudi Arabia as long as the Saudis agree not to enrich uranium themselves not to reprocess not to do the things that make you worry that they could be moving toward a nuclear weapon let's talk about the census controversy a coalition of 17 states as you know six cities are soon to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census the the White House says it helps to enforce the section of the Voting Rights Act what is wrong with asking people in the census are you a citizen of the United States well you know California has sued the Trump administration 29 times we haven't lost once because they keep doing things that are illegal the clear purpose of this question is to get some families to throw the questionnaire away because you've got families that have come from dangerous countries then you hear Trump's rhetoric about immigrants and now you're being asked to provide a list of the people who live in your family and what their immigration status you might want to throw away the questionnaire if you do then California loses we lose federal money because we're undercounted we lose congressional seats and we lose electoral college seats and that's the purpose of this to use the fear to undercount legal immigrants undocumented immigrants and even families that were born here that have a cousin they're worried about apparently we already have pretty good data on this and reliable as to where people live and who they are our state in the n-double-a-cp have announced separate lawsuits so how does a citizenship question boil down to a racial issue that could impact elections well California gets a certain number of C us votes in the electoral college a certain number of votes in the House of Representatives based on our population of all persons the Constitution is clear you might be a felon and you can't vote your child and you can't vote you still count now demographers don't particularly I mean they use this but they've got plenty of other sources but there's only one source for allocating power and the Trump administration is saying that they want this question which every Latino group in the country as opposed to every Asian group Beijing American group as opposed to as part of their effort to empower Latinos if the people who believe that are the ones who believe that Trump has been faithful to all three of his wives all right once again congressman brad sherman a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia it's good to see you things

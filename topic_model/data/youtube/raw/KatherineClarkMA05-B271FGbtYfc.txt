uh she's always she always goes above and beyond and that's just that's just her nature and the type of person that she is always willing to help was in the air force in 17 years old i enlisted in 2008. i went to germany luxembourg norway kyrgyzstan afghanistan turkey and qatar she's always had a passion for it her mom was a nurse i'm sure that sort of helped her away becoming a nurse so when i left in 2016 i applied for disability and then they just approved me four years later [Music] when i'm in the program of the nurse practitioner that's when they told me that no you're employable as a bachelor's of nursing in the military i broke my wrist and my my coccyx and my right shoulder so it when i'm in nursing you kind of like lift a lot and do a lot actually you stand a lot and it's just terrible for me to like stay on that track so it's like you're approved and then next you know it disapproves it's like uh so the moment she got that call from her her book rehab representative they said she wasn't really able to go forward with the nurse practitioner program i could see a decline in her happiness obviously she was anxious depressed it was it was upsetting that was that was her goal the whole time to be a nurse practitioner and i remember that day she called me said hey i'm going to reach out to katherine clark's office and see what they can do i've always thought hey congresswoman's not gonna be able to help you they're too busy with other things in dc and i wrote a letter and then right away lewis from her office contacted me and i got the help yeah sorry so what was the result what happened um he called and one week later i got a notification that i got approved you have to turn to congresswoman clark's office and the trust that they gave me like i i just trust them because they know what they're talking about the first interaction with me and louis he he reminded me that hey this i i'm here to help like he reassured me that we're here we're actually here and people don't know that we exist and people should know that they do exist and help is there

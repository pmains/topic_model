well good morning everyone and i want to give a big thanks to our witnesses from saint paul north st paul maplewood oakdale roseville and stillwater schools for helping us today by providing testimony about how the american rescue plan is being implemented in our school districts i want to thank you for your service to our community especially during the ongoing pandemic students families staff teachers administrators you've all done the very best you can to get through this most challenging time in a generation it's important i believe to look back at what we faced in 2020 our communities across the country every nation around the world what we were facing an unprecedented pandemic it stressed our health care system almost to a breaking point closed our schools crippled our economy and exposed all of the social economic and religious and radical divides that undermine our civil society and the well-being of tens of millions of americans we were in a crisis at the same time our country then was run by a president who propagated his own chaos rejected science and failed to respond to this pandemic in a timely fashion i want to be clear i fully realize that this crisis is not over with yet despite the progress family schools and our democracy they're still struggling my democratic house colleagues and i stepped up to work with president biden and local communities hand in hand to provide federal funding and the tools to build back better for families we together working with the communities we saved lives jobs businesses and prevented many families from falling into poverty or falling deeper into poverty we've made progress from a year ago but the omicron variant has forced us all to recalibrate especially in our schools i want to commend governor walls for his encouraging vaccines and testing at schools and i hope for those of you who work this into your plans it is going well for you or let me know what we can do better especially with testing over the coming months our students have endured much during this crisis and many of you know that not only from a professional standpoint but a personal standpoint as well i know you're doing all you can to help your students with their social emotional and any other needs that they're facing right now keeping children in school is a priority but we all know it has to be done safely we're asking a lot of our schools and as members of congress it's our job to make sure you have the resources you need my house colleagues and i acted to build back better from the darkest days of the pandemic last march we passed the american rescue plan delivering 8.5 billion dollars to minnesota to speed up vaccine distribution testing and boost small businesses to give them the relief that they needed to weather this pandemic we work to keep food on the table for many of our families and we work to help them stay sheltered or in their homes we kept kids and educators safe the best we could in schools and we allowed local governments to be able to continue their essential services the law made a down payment and it cut child poverty in half by expanding the child tax credit and making it fully refundable sadly this has expired because the extension was blocked by republicans in the senate and there was a fabulous story if you haven't heard it yet on minnesota public radio about what a difference that the child tax credit made to families all across our country and there's one family from minnesota included in the story we also work to provide funding for affordable child care and increase resources for head start and so much more the second thing we did is we acted to invest in rebuilding america's crumbling infrastructure including seven billion dollars for the state of minnesota we are delivering on that bipartisan infrastructure bill and it's going to create millions of good paying jobs and union jobs rebuilding america's infrastructure third we're acting to build back better for the future to lower costs to fight inflation and to strengthen working working families together the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the buildback better bill would create an average of two million jobs each year over the next decade good paying jobs i might add i'm proud that house democrats are working to address these challenges in the build back better act once again we face obstruction from republicans in the house and the senate uh to in order to be able to fully meet the needs of our communities so that obstruction has consequences which was clearly um evident in the loss of the child tax credit lifeline for millions of families across this country but today i want to reaffirm our work together i look forward to hearing from each of you about how the historic federal investments from the american rescue plan is meaning significant challenges right here in our community the law is delivering here in the fourth district a total of 224 million dollars for our cities 107 million dollars for ramsey county and 50 million dollars for my parts of in washington county and 284 million dollars in aids for school districts in the fourth district to help our schools prioritize safety for students teachers and faculty and deliver the best education possible saint paul's schools receive 207 million dollars still water 2 million dollars north st paul maplewood oakdale 15 million dollars in roseville 13 million this law is delivering 130 billion dollars to state education departments to help schools stay open safely and make up for the valuable learning time that our children have lost in this pandemic as you know the american rescue plan consists of three categories of funding k-12 schools 1.23 billion dollars for the elementary and secondary education relief fund three billion dollars for the emergency assistance to non-public schools we want all of our children to succeed and three billion dollars for individuals with disabilities education act idea together the american rescue plan provided 1.4 billion dollars from minnesota k-12 schools and provides the essential resources necessary for minnesota department of education and our school districts to keep schools open and safely and yes focus on how we can make up for the disruptive learning i want you to know that i am proud of the historic achievement and being able to deliver this with our democratic delegation in congress to minnesota students i'm going to turn over to each one of you but before i do that many of you probably are fully aware of this but with all the complexity of returning to school and the recovery that many schools were worried that they would be unable to get adequate head counts for eligible students and would receive less funding than they needed from the impact aid program so last week congress passed and president biden signed into law a simple supplemental impact aid flexibility which will allow school districts to use the student head count from 2021 2022 school year which has already been calculated for their impact aid implications for the 2022 and 2023 school year which are due on january 31st 2020. there's a lot of 20s and 22s in there bottom line is that you will be held harmless for the disruption that you are facing so that you can continue to provide the very best you can for our schools uh congresswoman thank you so much for this invitation today you know i knew that back at the start of the pandemic that you were going to continue to be a voice for district 4 for saint paul public schools specifically you have shown time after time that you are aware of the key issues in our school district and you have advocated uh for us in great ways so appreciate your ongoing support we in saint paul public schools created an office to oversee this with 207 million dollars i thought that it would be much too challenging to have those leaders and staff who are focused on the recovery from the pandemic to also be making decisions organizing working with us to communicate our plan so very much wanted to look at different areas of expertise from our district to have them manage our arp efforts in the district and it's been a really good decision we have been able to rely on people to to obviously make sure that we're following the law that we're able to communicate with our community and most importantly that the funds are going uh towards the efforts that they're intended to which is something that's that's obviously important to us the last one that i will mention though goal number four we thought it was really important to call out social emotional learning mental health supports to support our students not only our students in our district um impacted by the pandemic but we have to think about the racial uh unrest that has been uh taking place in our community we have to think about congresswoman your office being under attack uh a little bit more than a year ago and we need to think about the impact that that's had on our communities both far and near as well so something very important to us is that we called that out to ensure that our community knew that we've got to think about the hearts and minds of our students together in terms of how we're going to build back from uh this moment in time so i wanted to share with you the unique strategies the 51 unique strategies um not all 51 of course but we have 51 unique strategies that we're using you know in our district and again spreading uh those dollars out and making sure that we are trying to address um as many of the things that we heard and gathered and themes from our needs assessment uh continues to be the main driver for us it's allowed for us to add to the uh well-being the safety of our buildings with indoor air quality uh adding staff making sure that uh that we're addressing that as you know congresswoman some of our buildings are 150 years old and they've gone through many updates but as a whole our portfolio of schools are very old um and i'm really proud of the investments we've been able to make and with this investment from the arp plan it's helping us to you know to really bolster uh what we've already committed to doing in our in our buildings um you can see that community partnerships are a big part of this that i want to point out i said very early to our team that this was an opportunity for us to partner with our community in a new way many times we're able to partner with those organizations that are ready to provide supports but there might be a limit to what they're able to do so this investment allows us to support our community partners to build their wealth as well to hire additional people to undergo additional training so that they can be ready and willing partners with school districts i very much saw it as a way for us to help our community help us as i've said many times to our staff um so that will be an ongoing effort that we make as well in terms of how we uh look to our community to be there in times in this time that we really need them um equity is is is something that i think you'll find in every school district plan in the state i would hope uh but for us we definitely wanted to make that be more of a systems approach so that we could address everything from learning to the social emotional well-being so that we could ensure that each of our buildings each of our students each of our families felt that they could be supported in the ways that they need of course our nutrition services staff you know we went through serving 17 million meals while we were shut down to making sure that we can provide access to students and families who need it and times that we're on break in times that we can you know look for those extra investments to ensure that our schools are are that our students and families have the food that they need additional school counselors and additional health service again have been two areas that we've expanded on as well to meet uh you know these increasing needs uh very quickly we'll go through the the strategy highlights uh and i mentioned some of these but these are kind of the you know buckets of areas that we really look to invest because you know we we wanted to make sure that we could have several efforts tied together so that we could uh truly make some some movement and one that i'll highlight is the one right in the middle ka reading and math specialists and what we're calling win teachers what i need now didn't really want to focus on what our students have lost we want to focus on what our students need right now and build with them in their math and reading comprehension by adding staff who can go in and partner with teachers who can be in the classroom and be ready as we talk about this incredible covert relief funding that we've received i want to think about the bigger picture as well i feel like right now more than ever there's a real fragility to our democracy and to public education and i think some of the things we're seeing is how critically important the education of our young people is and yet um when we have political and economic um disruptions in our country uh really it it's a little worrisome to me that our public education systems can be so fragilely impacted by some of those waves that we're feeling um and i think you know i'll just say when um when the the polarization we're feeling in our country right now and when you think about the elected officials who are so amazingly giving of their time and energy not only from uh the congress level but all the way down to our school board level you know it's a really difficult time to be a school board member uh it's not it's a pretty thankless job and in the way of our times right now it's it's kind of a risky job sometimes as well and so i just want to speak to first and foremost what i feel is the most urgent issue of our times is protecting public education truly protecting it um we've talked in the past about the dependency on political leadership to fund schools on a regular basis and i feel like we kind of go with the wave of of the tenor of what's happening at our our state and federal uh leadership levels but i i have concerns about that and i would love to advocate for us to continue to find ways to stabilize school funding and allow schools to really innovate and move in the way that we need to so as we talk about our covert relief funding that we've received you know we took a lot of learning from that first year of the pandemic you know we did a lot of research and studying of lessons learned during that time we all knew that coming back to school for this current school year 21 22 that we would face academic needs of students right we knew that for sure we knew there would be mental health needs we've been seeing that throughout i think what none of us saw coming to the extent that we're facing right now is incredible disruption to the labor market to the supply chain um distribution i think there's so many things that you know people think of those sometimes in the corporate world in the business world right but it really affects schools we are multi hundreds of million dollars organizations and when there's a disruption in supply chain everything's affected so i want to give you a few examples about that and and and why this covered relief funding has been so critically important to us so it has buffered us so well in these current couple of years we're facing uh i don't know what we would have done without this funding so some examples we all know there's this labor shortage out there and i know people think about it in all kinds of industries but i want to speak about in the school system i'm a school district with about 2 000 employees and of those about 850 or 900 are teachers the rest are not teachers there's so many people that go into the organization right we all know there's transportation there's nutrition service workers there's grounds crews there's there's custodial crews when we have a labor shortage all the operations of our school districts really um get interrupted and many of you know when we've had to do some school closures this winter they've largely of course been due to covet but it's really the staffing shortages the inability to run your bus routes the inability to cover your classrooms so we've had to really um raise our rates of pay as we should as we should i got to say this when you have um members of your community and organization you want to have a little livable wages and when you're facing inflation rates as we are right now livable wages the how the the bare minimum you can live on has really changed so we've had to really adjust and increase our rates of pay uh for our hourly employees and for our substitute teachers and for so many layers of the support staff and we're still short staffed one of the concerns i have is that we're doing these in many cases on a temporary basis we have mousse for one year or two years for these pay increases i can't see a future where you can bring those rates of pay back down again right once you have rates of pay happening they're really hard to go back on that as as we shouldn't and so um the worry is how do we sustainably fund um the labor costs that go into education in roseville we wanted to outline how we've used the costs looking back and how we intend to use the cost moving forward because the need does not end regardless of the pandemic during this time we've used the american rescue funds we've provided no cost child care between periods of distance learning for families of essential workers child care for essential workers has been crucial in keeping our hospitals and emergency services running throughout the pandemic we've provided full full-time substitute teachers and paraprofessionals to help cover the many absences caused by illness and related quarantine and isolation during a time when there has been significant shortage of substitutes we've also provided one-to-one technology devices for students during distance learning including hot spots that have provided internet access to families who could not afford it additional social and emotional learning supports have been provided to all students and including additional social workers in all of our schools we've added interventions to boost learning for students who have been negatively impacted by learning loss an additional chemical health counselor at the secondary level and we've covered the added cost of increased nursing staff in relationship to covid19 we've made improvements to technology infrastructure equipment resulting from the significantly increased demands on our existing networks and finally in addition to funds provided by the american rescue plan the usda providing fully subsidized meals have been a benefit to all of our families this allows our nutrition services staff to focus on securing food resources at a time when there are disruptions to the supply chain and meal distribution rather than focusing on student meal debt so again we're very very grateful and like others have shared the need will certainly continue we've had a pandemic enrollment loss of about 300 students or 4 percent of our student population and that's a huge loss to our system so students every time students come through the door it's carrying a little backpack of funding of about ten thousand dollars so you can imagine that what uh what that does to our resources and supports uh for our systems and uh we are hoping that these students will choose to turn to us and um once the pandemic is hopefully come to a close we have received support for academic and student mental health which has provided extra staffing in the means of teachers school psychologists interventionists there's been funding for summer and community programs intervention supports extended day and summer support and local pandemic response needs support we have been able to hire temporary staffing such as online teachers permanent substitute teachers permanent substitute paraprofessionals and building assets reducing risks or bar coordinators which has been a huge support we've provided a robust summer enrichment program that i will expand on in just a minute extra clash of materials online programs and resources such as devices for students hot spots for families that do not have access to the internet and we've been able to provide the before and after school child care one of the discussions that i had with ramsey county in the city of saint paul with some of their dollars is with park and rec and wraparound social services working with the school district for how you put together a summer program and all of you have put together you know summer programs that with with the resources that you had and with the leadership from your um elected community leaders put together something that that fit well for you um and that that's the beauty i think of local government uh having served on on the city council working with with uh school boards um that we reflect uh that at our best when we're listening to the communities we serve and so i i compliment all of you for you have a core set of funding programs that you all did but then you met the needs of your community by working with families non-profits in your communities and your elected school board school board leaders so to all the school board chairs and those that youth who serve i have a fair amount of idea having been on a small city council in north st paul how much you are the reward you receive is the smile on the students faces and somebody's saying thank you it's not the monetary award and i know how many hours you're putting in doing this so i i thank the superintendents but uh please to the school board members who are on here uh and school board chairs thank you thank you thank your fellow uh board members when you go back for me because it is it is a very very important calling that that you have all answered and has been pointed out when um when this pandemic became politicized school boards and many times became ground zero for the politicalization which is not what anybody signed up for it's an honor and a privilege to work for the families in the fourth district and to serve alongside with you we each have our own lane of responsibility but these traffic lanes of responsibility have to work together in unison and sometimes we merge into each other's lanes and sometimes we have to put a blinker on saying listen to me you don't there's not this isn't where you belong right now so i thank all of you uh for for doing that because that's the way we're going to move our communities and our states forward and that's the way we're going to have our students feel that there's a there's a whole world out there of opportunity um so as we navigate these challenges ahead please now myself on my office uh stand ready to work with you um i know the work that you you've done and and thank you for for highlighting especially food and nutrition and meal services i've been at school sites uh i've had you know in st paul and in in the suburban area and it used to be that we had quote unquote summer feeding programs but they didn't go the whole summer right now we have food and nutrition programs that i believe we have a responsibility after we get through this this uh covet crisis to work with you to make sure that our our our young our young students our young adults never feel food insecure so i look forward to working with you on that and making sure that you have the resources working with non-profit agencies to do that thank you for providing all the essential services and and all the different ways your community wanted to during the pandemic so i just can't say enough for for how much i know that that you've done you are the heart and the soul quite often of our communities the interlocutors and the community ed programs that you that you provide and the things that you also provide for the vulnerable seniors in our community community and people who want to energize as adults into the workforce and become prepared we didn't even talk about any of that that's been some of the lost opportunity that we need to get back and i look forward to working with you so with that i know how busy you all are thank you for an hour of your precious time i look forward to continue to working with you and to making sure that together we serve hope and opportunity for the future leaders of our community who are your students thank you very much

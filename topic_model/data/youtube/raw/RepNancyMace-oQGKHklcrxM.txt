this issue of re-examining building code safety codes for structures particularly those on the water uh what do you make of that well certainly and congressman clyburn and i we both have coastal areas and our districts are neighboring one another when we have hurricanes and tropical storms particularly in charleston south carolina and surrounding areas flooding is an issue whether there's a storm or not a storm so seeing the footage at surf side and some of the the water issues that you saw previous to its collapse are very concerning and all the other environmental factors that we have and i'm particularly concerned with newer developments that haven't withstood the test of time or storms those are very concerning i do believe it's something we have to look at which is why it's all the more important that we really focus on traditional infrastructure we have enormous needs in this country right now you know a lot has been said about this this rush to build on you know coastal areas themselves sometimes within your feet of the ocean i know it's an issue that's come up in your state and there are other locales where they keep buildings residents with single family or high rises a ways from the ocean itself that we don't know congress on whether that was at all an issue here and i don't want to jump the gun on that but but a lot of people are talking like that and we have to reassess that do you think we do well i do think you're right that we need to take our time and see this site fully investigated so that we know what what is actually happening and what is actually going on and in fact just before i came on your program i just flew in from dc today i read a headline online that there was a another structure in dc that collapsed today and so these are issues that will be top of mind and once we see an investigation at surfside we'll be able to know if it was environmental if it was construction and engineering issues rather got it you know carson i'd be remiss i mean i was speaking to your colleague you know house majority with clyburn and one of the issues i wanted to bring up was a comment he made in the new york times uh where he fears this defund the police movement that sort of taken hold of some in the party is akin to cutting the throats of the democratic parties worried about it it echoed concerns that i heard from michael dukakis the former democratic presidential candidate who fears the same thing that it's not not a good strategy in fact a harmful one what do you think of that well the polling behind that americans do not support defunding the police in fact we should be defending the police and defunding the police really hurts the communities that need the most protection and to hear you know jinsaki earlier this week say that republicans want to defund the police well this is sort of brazen lighting i think it's because they're trying to deflect from the increase in statistics we've seen of increased crime around the country and then you have these far left progressives that are running campaigns based on defunding the police it's a very dangerous message particularly when crime is up portland oregon it's up over 800 percent in dc we know it's over up over 35 percent but all across the country cities charleston where i am right now we've seen an increase which which is the same as everywhere across the country right now you know congressman the white house is essentially that is tensaki the spokesman doubling down on her comments that republicans are really to blame um for for this uh pointing to the the the earlier spending package and the 1.9 trillion dollars you know the spending package and i'm wondering i don't see police reference there or when you were voting on that uh did you did you see anything about that in there not until afterwards and you know sometimes there are all of these amendments we're talking about thousands of pages 547 billion dollars in a surface transportation bill this week there's all sorts of goodies in there and what i have learned in my first six months in congress is that is that you try to get people on gotcha votes and messaging legislation legislation for pr purposes and i'm sure that's where this is buried somewhere in there but the truth of the matter is we you know the infrastructure package itself is being held hostage by democrats and this i believe is just a deflection from bad legislation we saw what the continued uh kobit 19 package did people were not going back to work because we're we're funding we're paying them to stay home through unemployment uh the surface transportation bill is a lot of money the larger overall infrastructure package the over a trillion dollars possibly two trillion dollars that wasn't going anywhere they've got a lot of problems right now and i get why they're pushing back but this one isn't going to stick all right so when it comes to future spending initiatives besides the infrastructure one that might or might not look look good is it fair to say that any follow-up spending to that you would have serious serious doubts about passing and approving absolutely and one of the reasons that i don't support the infrastructure package right now what's going on is that senate republicans and democrats worked very hard for a very long time to put a bipartisan package together but today and over the last few days nancy pelosi has been trying to hold hostage that package to get five trillion dollars more in spending on green new deal or art and sculptures and infrastructure human infrastructure and other wasteful spending and right now especially coming out of the pandemic where we have 28 trillion dollars in debt our deficit is approaching three trillion dollars we're talking about potentially 65 trillion dollars in spending over the next 10 years um we can't continue to do this we can't continue to kick the can down the road and in fact a year and a half ago the the government federal state and local literally shut businesses down and didn't do anything they held businesses to a totally different standard and i just wish the government would live by the same standards it imposes on other businesses and right now is not the time to raising taxes or spending more we should all be looking at our checkbooks

I'm dina Titus your representative from the first congressional district today's workers Memorial Day and I want to take a moment to honor the workers who lost their lives building our communities all workers deserve the right to a safe workplace unfortunately some who lead their families in the morning don't make it home at night every day some 150 workers lose their lives as a result of hazardous conditions for some workers the odds are even higher the job fatality rate for Latino workers is nine percent higher than the average and that rate for workers over the age of 65 is three times higher in 2014 women were the victims in two out of three workplace violence incidents and suffered thirty-eight percent of lost time injuries to address this problem we must send a message that employers will be held accountable if they neglect to care for their workers we must pass the protecting America's workers act so we can crack down on those employers who fail to recognize that a workplace free of fatalities and injuries is the only workplace for Americans I'm co-sponsoring the law because it would recognize that we need more officials to monitor working conditions and to create an atmosphere that encourages reporting accidents and violence on the jobsite the cost of on-the-job injuries is at least 250 billion a year and more than 700 million accidents go underreported that's just unacceptable no one deserves to have their lives at risk when they are providing for their families that's why we must mourn for the dead and fight for the living thank you

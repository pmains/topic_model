to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable well sarah marie at the White House thanks very much of joining us now the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee congressman Adam Smith of washington state congressman thanks very much for joining us thanks for i want to quickly get your reaction to the Sean Spicer comments on Hitler and the use of poison gas we know that Hitler used the poison gas to kill millions of people including millions of Jews Nancy Pelosi the Democratic leader and how she just called on the White House to fire him what's your reaction well I mean it's obvious that Sean Spicer needs to know a lot more about history when he's making his comments and those comments were insensitive and ignorant without question not the first time so and also you know Assad does not have to be worse than Hitler in order to be a real problem in order to be somebody worthy of our condemnation I could tell that mr. Spicer was freelancing there and obviously he was out of his depth you know I don't know if he needs to be fired or not but he certainly does need to get better at his job do you agree with white House officials who believe Russia is trying to cover up the Bashar al Assad regime's culpability in that chemical attack that killed so many civilians including children yes I don't even question about it they're deflecting the blame from Assad and look and be given the presence of Russians on the base where the attack was launched from it is very hard to imagine they weren't aware of it but at the end of the day Putin doesn't care he simply wants Assad in power and he will kill whoever he has to kill to help make that happen in the international community has to recognize Russia for the rogue after that they are they are encouraging this type of despotic regimes wherever they can and that is really the threat of Russia I mean when Putin started yo messing around Ukraine and other places you know that is but a small piece of what he's trying to he is trying to undermine liberal democracy every place he can and basically he's trying to make the world safe for autocratic dictatorships and we in the United States as the leaders of freedom should stand up against that and stand up strongly and try to rally the international community to recognize not just a sobs role in this attack but Putin's role in this and in many many other actions that are undermining freedom in this world well let's be specific do you believe the Russians actually worked with the Syrian regime to conduct these chemical attacks I don't know like i said it's hard to believe given their relationship that they weren't aware of it on the other hand it's hard to believe that they would be so stupid as to allow this to happen I mean Assad that was basically winning Russia had come in and propped him up you know why they would do this with the international condemnation that was sure to follow i'm not sure but again given the close relationship it's hard to believe they didn't know but i don't know for sure I do not obviously have intelligence that has a smoking gun that clearly said that Russia new a chemical attack was coming it's just hard to imagine that they didn't congressman you've said in the past that the Syrian leader Bashar al-assad should go so how do you think that should be done and try to be as specific as you can what needs to be done to get rid of them well two things I mean we need to separate the question of whether or not Assad is the legitimate leader of Syria with the question of what do we do to take him out and I think there was some bad early steps by the Trump administration that essentially seemed to say that it was okay for Assad to stay in power we were going to focus on Isis so I say independent of the question of how you would go about removing him just stating clearly that given the brutality that Assad has rained down in his own people he is not a legitimate leader and also Isis will not be defeated as long as Assad is there he is a rallying cry given the way he brutalized as his own people for many in the Arab Muslim world now next question is how do you remove it well i am not a fan of regime change I think we've learned a lot from Libya and Iraq and Afghanistan there's us as an outside power being able to step in and remove Assad number one extraordinarily difficult to do and number two you got no what comes next and right now we don't so it is an impossible situation I don't suggest that there's any easy answer here but at a minimum we should call Assad out for what he is and not imagine that he can be some kind of ally in the fight against extremism he cannot be he is not in fact he fuels extremism because of the brutality of his rule but do you think it's realistic to think he could be removed as long as yes the very strong support of the Russians the Iranians the iranian-backed shiite groups like Hezbollah all of which all of them are supporting his regime honestly you know I I don't I mean I think that's a problem with all those groups that you just mentioned supporting him he is able to stand in power and that presents an enormous challenge to the international community I want to make sure that we don't overreact in the US and think that there is some military solution and think that we can go in there and go to war not just with Syria but with Russia and Iran and not cause even more damage than is currently being caused look at the images are horrific what Assad has done is horrific but we also have to be mindful of our limitations that I think in the past certainly in the case of Iraq you know we older thought what we could do Saddam Hussein was awful we loogan things will get better well it's not that simple the United States doesn't have the power to simply step in and fix other countries that doesn't mean that we don't take whatever steps we can to try and move it in a positive direction but I think you outlined perfectly the very realistic challenges of making any sort of significant change in the short term you make a fair point that Muammar Qaddafi was a very very bad then but the US and others help get rid of them but take a look at that Libyan state today a failed state with Isis having a significant photo in Libya right now in North Africa congressman we have more to discuss we've just heard by the way from president Trump he's now weighing in on all of this will tell you what he's saying right after this

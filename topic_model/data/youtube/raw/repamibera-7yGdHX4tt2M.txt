it is my pleasure to introduce to you congressman dr. Ami Bera thank you so much why hop here's a doctor today right and I tend to look at the world through those eyes as a physician and just thinking about the patients that I've served and had the pleasure of caring for yeah I noticed said it has to be unheard for half an hour I don't hope that I'm gonna fill half an hour but what I didn't think I could do is just kind of frame how I came to us is she addressing addiction and substance abuse prescription drug abuse and then in my role as a member of Congress how I think we can address this not just at the community level but also at the federal level because it is not just an issue that impacts our community here in the Sacramento region that certainly is impacting communities and families all across this nation so I'm going to tell ya kind of share my perspective through the stories of patients and families that I've had a chance to interact with throughout my over 20-year career let's start with as a medical student when I was going through my training back in the late 80s early 90s we received very little training in addiction in substance abuse and then recovered you know in residency you got a little bit of exposure that fast forward to 1995 when we first moved up here and I started practicing here in the Sacramento region fairly quickly I started to notice that I would have patients many patients who very legitimately made an accident you know injured themselves something happened in their lives and they were prescribed tylenol with codeine vicodin etc and you know you would see patients that legitimately had pain that over time you became dependent on some of those medications some had an addictive personality and when they took that first pill vicodin which they nickname and they never had taken before became addicted just because of their their physiology others that through repeated prescriptions you know they may have started out on thirty vicodin and 60 bucks and the next thing they knew they were dependent on this medication because when they tried to taper off when they tried to get themselves off of those medications they would start to go through someone thralls around that same time there was a push within organized medicine saying doctors are not treating pain appropriately you really got to take pain more seriously and you know that became part of our continuing medical education to get better educated on the management of pain and he saw this rapid increase in prescribing I also saw the joy in some of my patients when he had those patients that really wanted to get off the medications but again they were some of the dependent on none of the medications and you've worked with them over time to get them off of those medications many of them felt like they got their lives back they felt this destroyed and it's not easy and unfortunately far too often you know those of us in primary care medicine haven't received the training or don't have access to the tools to help our patients recovering and dependency so fast forward a few years later after I left the private sector and now as medical director of the primary health services division at Sacramento County we saw a lot of these patients patients coming in with addictions patients coming in with dependency but we also saw this challenge that those patients that we knew that were addicted when we were trying to find services within the community where we could help them go through recovery those services particularly for major lower-income patients who didn't have good health insurance we're just really non-existent and you would struggle in a fragmented system of healthcare delivery on on how you could actually start caring for these but you know I did you know this was back in the 90s and I had our pharmacist learn analysis the number one drug that was being prescribed in the county was vicodin right and you know that was a real eye-opener so we started the conversation with our local emergency rooms and others because talk to any emergency room nurse talk to any emergency room physician they see a lot of these patients showing up you know again these are folks that come from every walk of life in the community you know from the destitute to the CEO you would never guess who's dependent or who's addicted but they span that entire spectrum and they would come in oftentimes very desperate yeah I know you've seen that emergency room and they legitimately were going through a physical withdrawal and they were desperate again for those on the loss of them runs on the ladder it was very difficult to find the resources to help take them through recovery again I would share when you can get something to summon through recovery there's this how patients have described it to me is it's almost like this cloudless and this fog lifts and they feel like they're getting their lives back

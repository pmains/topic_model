mr. speaker as an ob/gyn and now a u.s. congressman I want to continue to highlight October as breast cancer awareness month one out of eight women will develop breast cancer let me say that again mr. speaker one out of eight women will develop breast cancer if you're a woman over the age of 35 you should ask your physician if you need a mammogram and certainly if you're over the age of 50 every woman needs a mammogram every year a mammogram is quick it's easy and the great thing about mammograms is how easy it can be to catch breast cancer and it's very early stages and give us a great chance to treat the problem over my career as a physician we've helped hundreds of women who have successfully fought this dreaded disease there's great treatments out there and ways we can save lives so I encourage every woman over the age of 35 to talk to their physician about a mammogram it's one thing to be aware of breast cancer but it's another thing to do something about it

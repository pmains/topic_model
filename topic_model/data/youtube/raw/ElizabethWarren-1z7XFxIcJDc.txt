everybody put your hands up like this and we can hold hands Oh your hands up on the ends and they're all holding hands I miss y'all perfect hi I'm Elizabeth Warren and I'm so glad to be here with three of my best friends in the world and four of us got together today because we're launching a day of action here's the problem we've got right now in this country we got a lot of people we really rely on every single day but often they're doing it without proper protective equipment and without any protections in their jobs and so congressman Khanna and I decided we were going to get together and write an essential workers Bill of Rights it's really simple it says every worker should have basic safety at the workplace that they should get the pay that they deserve that they should be able to take time off if they're sick or if they need to look after their kids we now know as a society who the essential workers are they're the people who make sure that we get our groceries that we get our medicines that the Internet is running an electricity is flowing then our places are clean these are the people who do hard work and frankly for so long they've been invisible congresswoman Presley can you tell us about what a bill of rights for essential workers would mean for the people you represent in Massachusetts it peace of mind let's just start there peace of mind and good health you know there are so many essential workers who are feeling vulnerable and so I've had conversations recently with SEIU 1199 and 5:09 one was a mother who called me at 11 o'clock at night saying schools are closed and you know I don't have child care I'm sick I've been deemed an essential worker there's a note PPE and I don't know what to do that's listen if you're sick you should stay home and there's no one else to watch your child and she said represent her Presley can you promise me if I stay that I won't lose my job and I couldn't promise her that and that was heartbreaking I am so concerned about the frontline health care workers my mother relies on them every single day so I want to make sure that they are safe so that she can be safe as well gig workers are essential right now I know I know there are gig workers who are who have to have these jobs so that they can put food on the table for their family so so looked super pointed absolutely it's a matter of keeping our communities safe we if we're not keeping everyone safe then nobody is safe that's right that's what public health means that's right that's literal definition what we need to do is make sure that there is equity in our society so that every worker can be protected when they go to work regardless of whether there is Cobin 19 pandemic or not as you mentioned ayianna people go to work when they're sick every single day because they can't afford to take off they have to pay that rent and so I think this is an excellent start and long-term I'd love to see us protect every single worker in this country to make sure that they have the time they need when they're sick and when their kids are sick yep and it's a matter of dignity for them it's a matter of safety for them and it is public health for all of us the society wouldn't function with millions of folks as we all know essential workers are disproportionately women and disproportionately people of color and we're seeing to understand that this covered 19 crisis hits harder in communities of color most of the essential workers are low wage workers they're overwhelmingly women of color I saw a statistic recently I think it was only one in five african-americans Latin X can afford to work from home one in five so and they're underpaid and we've been fighting for them to have worker protections and a living wage of predictable work schedules and child care and health care access and it's unconscionable that we have to fight for those things because again it is what everyone is it has earned and is owned in a society that is just and that is equitable there are Native communities across the country who need protection who need this workers essential workers Bill of Rights Native Americans are 11% of the population in New Mexico and a cap for over 40 percent of the positive cases a Jana was saying it's communities who have taken the brunt of the inequity for such a long time the way I see this is that our essential workers Bill of Rights is one way to just build a little more equity into this system its equity that we need all the time but as Ryan can see how much we need it now during a time of crisis we need to have their back we need to pay them and scream but the dignity that they deserve it's time to stand with essential workers they've had our back will you stand with us on this day affection so I want to thank everybody who tuned in with us today and ask you this if you are an essential worker please tell us your story do a video show a little about what your job is lying and if you're one of the people who is lucky enough to be able to shelter in place and you're relying on essential workers tell your story and get in the fight on their behalf make sure that people know that you support the essential workers Bill of Rights and if you want more information about this go to Elizabeth Warren comm we got plenty of ways to get you in the fight the essential workers Bill of Rights this is one very tangible way that wickedness playing field just a little it's a matter of basic fairness it's a matter of basic health it's what we got to do thank you all for being here it's pretty all right essential it is action [Music]

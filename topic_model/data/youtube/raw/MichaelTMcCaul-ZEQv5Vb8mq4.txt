we're glad that your weapons the man Patrick show it was display of lawlessness Franklin that I've never seen in my lifetime and I'm actually just a little bit older that our next guest who are you love it I am a little bit ultimate yeah well texas congressman mike mccall is joining us here this afternoon and congressmen we appreciated chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security well well well that was an interesting speech last night dgn low popcorn gin joy the hell yeah that was I gotta tell you this is I mean I like to said I've never seen anything like this and you know it was interesting now he says that well numbers of Congress said I don't have this Authority well the president over 20 times during his presence and said he didn't have authority to do this and that that's not how democracy works so I mean what is it I mean now you guys have the authority he says and I think it's a real threat to our democracy and he is completely bypassing the Congress and the world the American people and with his pen I guess he takes the executive branch start writing laws now instead of the Congress like it and he's a constitutional scholar right yeah where you prevent last night let me let me play some for you and then I'll let you respond to it this is right something that he said about Republicans last night for a year and a half now Republican leaders in the house have refused to allow that simple vote now I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common-sense law but until that happens there are actions I have the legal authority to take as president the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just tonight I'm announcing those actions alright so it's your fault congressman will call yeah we forced him do this because we wouldn't play ball with them you know I've been trying to get the Department of Homeland Security just true that border ever since I became chairman frankly for the past decade and I think now with the friendlier Senate that we're going to be able to get that border security build pass here's a problem as you start tinkering around with immigration reform and amnesty and you send a message that would be the same thing we saw last summer with these 60,000 children trying to cross because of dhaka and the executive actually take that we saw this in 1986 when they granted amnesty every time we do this we get a wave of illegals and you know what it's going to happen again and you got to get the security peace yeah your night talk about the blueprint I have and I'm have a bill coming out that one of the first things you have in new Congress to get past to get the security peace gun you can't start talking yeah fixing immigration laws until you get that piece all right so on and that's what I plan to do texas congressman michael call joining us and we appreciate your time and i know you're a busy guy and by the way and i don't i'm sure that your folks up mentioned this to you but we are now heard in dallas fort worth on talk radio 1190 so I mean we've expanded at least on this show we get me and I know you're on TV all the time on fox but I tell you what I miss Donna you getting yeah yeah I grew up in Dallas lips that's great news uh the the Republicans got to get together and come up with something other than just rhetoric and I think that's what the American people are afraid of a you and I have talked about this many times on and off the air the American people here Republicans say you know that he's a bad guy look we're going to do this we try to do this we can get it done but what we haven't seen an in particular leadership congressman haven't seen leadership actually lead as a matter of fact this is coming from me about you I think leadership has looked a little spineless I hope that changes do you expect leadership now to actually lead in the house well I think first and foremost we had to shut down president in this action and Bob Goodlatte chair in judiciary i'm sharing the homeland where the two primary chairman in this fight and we helped send a letter to the president of the 14 ounces saying please don't do this work with Congress but if you do this we're going to we're by any means necessary staff to you and all the tools afford under the Constitution stop him we're looking at various options right now as to how we can we can stop it including the power of the purse which i think is probably the most probably the most likely course but we're going to take that i think republicans we have house and senate moving into january we have a responsibility to lead to govern and i think USC our agenda being passed in the Congress and the presidents got to deal with it when it gets to us in a wizard's you stone pipeline or where this one more sturdy bill you know he's gonna have no one is protecting him anymore because harry reid's can be gone do you think he's leading you into this do you think and last night was was political you know what I know about him mostly American you know that was just it was a political stuff stunt he didn't give a damn about about immigration so do you believe that he is luring the Republicans into trying to do something like shutting down the government trying to trying to do something that will come back and bite him so that you know that he can somehow raise the stature of the Democrats going into next year after the butt whoopin he took on the fourth yeah he's betting that we're gonna you know implode and we're going to be our own worst enemy any look at the time he was to write thanksgiving and christmas he wants us to be yeah the grinch stole christmas he wants us to be the people that are setting the government down which i always say you know we're going to we're going to keep the government open but we're going to shut down this president I think that's the right the right tone here is that we got to stop this action person foremost because you're right my constituents like okay I hear you you're you know speaking out against us but what do you need to stop it so that's why we're look at specific provisions things we can do to stop this and of course when we have a friendlier Senate starting in the new year yeah we have a lot more tools being capability to do that as well so you know then they do they harken back to Reagan and Bush never difference map between the Reagan and Bush 41 did and what this guy in thunders that Reagan verse were actually working with the Congress they're actually responding to legislation that the Congress uh was passing very different scenario here I mean he has not worked with the Congress at all and so unilaterally he's bypassing or circumvent the will of people right after these elections to you mentioned it's political absolutely that's why he waited so after the elections kirky do if he do this before the elections it would hurt them may course didn't we fortunately prevailed in most of the elections but he is calculated this and and we're not going to take the bait and I think he wants us to have self employed wounds and we're just not going to do that and you know I hope not because it's happened before I mean we don't we've seen its business before we've seen Republicans get real squishy because they're afraid that you know the American people aren't going to like them and they're worried about you know how they're going to be perceived and I think the President believes that is still the case and so it will be important that rip I've already heard Republicans arguing with other Republicans today one sense we're gonna you know it's the power of the purse the other one says no we can't do that we're gonna so I mean I was talking about this on a different show this afternoon in dallas-fort worth I said look it it's up to you guys now you got to make the next move and it's got to be the right one and it has to be something that's significant to the American people well that's all my colleagues you know the American people given us a second chance and we have to lead and govern and get our agenda passed and we need to stick together and this infighting has to end but you know I I personally think there are options to through the power of the purse to stop this and so I'm going to cating very strongly for that and other stuff that power of appointments Nate we can block some appointments there are a lot of tools in the toolbox from looking at but you know they American people have entrusted us with the Congress now again and and we have to you know we have to lead and we have to govern and the more bills we pass and we will and put on his desk we put him in a very difficult position as to whether he's going to pass or veto he can't he can't harry reid's I can protect them anymore from this and so I'm yeah frankly I'm i think all conservatives should be excited about those not excited that what happened last night right and we are going to stop that but but excited about the new conservative agenda can have Congress congressman I i want to thank you for your time we appreciate it and I always appreciate when i get a call from from your guys and they say hey you want to chat a little bit i do and well appreciate

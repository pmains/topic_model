i rise to salute the early educators and child care workers who have sacrificed so much for our children and their parents across the nation throughout this pandemic as a working mom i know how critical they are to our families and to our economy the fact is had our child care workers not done their part many other essential workers like our nurses firefighters police officers postal workers food service and sanitation employees and grocery workers could not have done theirs the covet 19 pandemic has demonstrated what we've known to be true all along that our child care workforce is essential that's why i was proud to cast my vote yesterday for the child carers essential act the house advanced bold legislation to ensure that our child care workforce has the support it needs to operate child care centers safely i'd like to commend my colleagues representatives rosa deloro bobby scott and catherine clark for their leadership on this critical issue the fact is even before the pandemic enrolling an infant or a toddler in a quality child care program could be enormously expensive and frankly there was inadequate support to make such programs fit in the household budgets for many families the gao found that on average just one out of every 10 children who were eligible for federal child care subsidies actually received them moreover one in 10 parents have reported being demoted transferred or fired due to child care problems overall inadequate child care acts child care costs our economy nearly 60 billion dollars annually meanwhile we are leaving money on the table for every dollar invested in quality early childhood programs we get a seven dollar return on our investment as challenging as it has been over the years for parents to find affordable child care covid has massively compounded the problem it has demanded even more of our child care workforce while stretching budgets to the absolute limit in the commonwealth of massachusetts some child care centers have had to turn parents away in order to make the necessary public health accommodations such as reducing class size a child care center in the city of lawrence went from serving 715 children pre-covered to 360. a nearly 50 percent reduction what's more 97 percent of the households with children in that program were eligible for subsidies what is a parent to do when they can't afford to miss work but also has no child care support it is long past time for america to assist them by investing in reliable affordable high quality child care each day we hear praise for our essential workers and they deserve every word of it they have been keeping us safe for months while risking their own lives it's obvious that thank yous will no longer cut it the least we can do is guarantee that they aren't left penniless due to the cost of child care if we're going to show our commitment to workers and to families the child care is essential act should advance through the upper chamber without delay thank you and i yield back

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our
nation's dedicated diplomats, the hard-working men and women at the State Department and
USAID who are heroically serving our country here and around the world. In his very first budget, President Trump
has proposed draconian cuts to these agencies. These reductions threaten not only our leadership
in the world, they put our nation's people and interests at unnecessary risk. Our global leadership depends on balanced
investment in three areas: defense, diplomacy, and development. Undermining any one of these pillars weakens
all of them. The State Department and USAID's effectiveness
and success is not a function of equipment or technology, but rather the experience,
capabilities, and strategic deployment of our people. In a world where our challenges are everyday
more numerous and more complex, we are constantly sending our diplomats places farther afield. They are deserving of our full support and
our utmost respect for their bravery, dedication, and service in defense of the United States
and our values. I call on my colleagues to join me in protecting
our strategically important investments in diplomats, diplomacy, and development, as
well as defense.

I'm very pleased to introduce dr. betsy web to this committee dr. Webb is superintendent of schools in Bangor Maine a position that she has held since 2008 under her guidance the Bangor school department has earned a national reputation for academic excellence in 2013 dr. Webb was named main superintendent of the year a fitting tribute to her total dedication to her students community involvement professionalism and fiscal management in addition to being a well-respected authority on education policy dr. Webb also was the leader who brought to my attention the real-life problems that the 30-hour definition would cause in school systems there's been a lot of focus on the for-profit world she opened my eyes to what the impact would be on school systems across the United States first-class education is the team effort in Betsy is the top-notch team leader as a citizen of Bangor I'm very grateful for Betsy's contributions to our community and delighted that she's testifying before us today I would also know mr. chairman that she got up at 3am in order to catch the 530 plane to be here today oh thank you thank Senator Collins thank you very much mr. chairman dr. Webb you did a terrific job of outlining what the impact would be on substitute teachers on the attacks on people who are working two different jobs within the system could you talk to us about what the impact of the laws definition of full-time work would be on the students absolutely I first became aware of this one I was researching purchasing a software package to manage substitute teachers and the salesperson talked to me about how the software would limit substitute teachers below the 30-hour in order to avoid having to provide health coverage and I started thinking about the impact on learning and when you consider I think every one of us can remember having a substitute teacher in our classroom the environment was different the pace of learning was not the same and there was a real give-and-take of getting to know that new person that was going to guide our learning and so if you can think of I would have maybe a teacher on maternity leave and have one substitute teacher from Monday to Thursday but to avoid having that person go over the 30 hours a different substitute teacher on Friday what a huge concern that is and I believe it's the full range of learners whether it's the advanced placement class where students are following a rigorous curriculum with a high-stakes test in May that determines whether they are going to obtain college credit Bangor high school had 544 AP tests last year eighty percent of them earning college credit I worry about changing substitutes in that room but I also worry about the fifty four percent of our students that are on free and reduced lunch status and we know they have at risk factors and we know from research that the consistency of the person in the room and the relationship they have with that person has a great impact on learning so to me when I heard about the software tracking to avoid incurring additional expenditures it didn't make common sense when considering the impact on learning thank you dr. Webb I was particularly struck when you described the 110 ad texts in your system who work between 30 and 34 hours a week and do in fact to receive health insurance now and the district pays seventy-seven percent of the cost of of the premium and yet because of the way the Affordable Care Act works and the the definition of full-time work you will have to pay a third of up to a three thousand dollars no it would be a three-thousand-dollar penalty for each of those employees that's your outside risk because the insurance veg heading would not be considered affordable well if my quick map that is 330 thousand dollars in nuke us to the system now just yesterday the National Education Association sent me a letter in which had said that many school districts mistakenly believe that the only way to avoid the penalties is to cut employers hours and I would know the irony because the NEA a year ago sent me a letter sent all senators letter urging a yes vote on a proposal that I made to the budget calling for a more reasonable definition of full-time work and in this letter just a year ago said that it was a critical issue to their members that educators face great uncertainty about their eligibility eligibility for coverage etc so there seems to be a flip but I guess I would ask you to respond to the NEA saying that you mistakenly not you personally the superintendent's mistakenly think that cutting hours is the own only option is asking for a huge budget increase a viable option for you and superintendence no that is not an option and I mean ninety-five percent of our employees are offered insurance and the school department pays a large portion of anywheres from 77 to eighty percent of the cost and there is no intention to cut hours of the people that are consistently employed whether teachers or read texts or custodians secretaries administrators but where it becomes problematic is the affordability piece for the EDX and then those substitutes where we'd rather hire the core substitutes that really know the bangor way I we have looked we've researched the look-back method and you know predicting the stability 90 day period ahead my concern is the resources that would be required to administer that kind of a program we hire substitutes weekly the I would say it's almost every single day someone is coming to our office with an application and they although we have a core group of substitutes this past month we've been hit very hard with the flu and so we've gone well beyond and so you can imagine the administration kind of operation you would need to continually do a 6-month look-back and to determine the 90-day ahead and when we look at this calendar year for the school which would begin july 12 jun 30th and we have five months that someone could hit that threshold as a substitute of the hundred and thirty hours so if we had someone on maternity leave at the beginning of the school year and the substitute that we hired worked during sep tember in october we would hit the 130 day threshold in both of those months and so when i think of our system administration only being two-point-four percent of our budget my fear is that I mean its resources have to be utilized one place or the other and when you consider that eighty percent of our budget is personnel we only have seven percent of our budget that's truly discretionary and so there lies my concern where do those resources come from Thank you Thank You senator Collins that you want to introduce to the record i do mr. Chairman I have letters from the national association of home care and hospice which strongly supports this bill as well as from the National Restaurant Association that I would ask permission be included in the record will be I would also ask permission that a written question to dr. holtz-eakin be submitted that gets into an issue of the impact of the ACA on income inequality and it picks up on a statement I didn't get to bed and my questions and I would love to have a written answer to that as well with your permission Thank You senator Murray

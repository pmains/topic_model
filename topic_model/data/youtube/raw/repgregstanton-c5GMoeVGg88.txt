all right good afternoon everyone this is congressman Greg Stanton and I want to welcome everyone joining us today for our small business solutions webinar as we are dealing with this extraordinary and unprecedented moment in our nation's history in the midst of this public health and economic crisis you deserve to know what your government is working hard at what we're doing to support you and to deliver meaningful solutions for your business your employees and your family I know that so many of the people joining us here today and so many more in our community are facing unprecedented challenges that you never imagined possible my team and I have spoken to countless small business owners in the past few weeks and I have heard firsthand your stories your questions your concerns as you try to stay afloat during these uncertain times as your representative in Congress and during my time previously at Phoenix Mayor even back when I was a city councilman I have always believed that small businesses they're the backbone of our economy and they're what make our community special and I will continue to fight for you to make sure you have the support needed to succeed in the days weeks and months ahead we need you to be successful throughout this crisis and beyond so today we're going to cover the resources available I'm joined by three experts with the United States Small Business Administration they know their stuff and they're gonna talk and walk us through how to take advantage of these important resources before I turn it over to Craig Kelly and Yolanda from the SBA I want to give a brief overview of the work that we've been doing in Congress during this crisis last Friday I flew back to Washington to vote on Phase three stimulus package also known as the carrot act it created a series of loan and grant programs for our small businesses that we'll be discussing in more detail today the cares Act had a two trillion dollar price tag the largest spending package in United States House of Representatives history that gives you a sense of how serious this moment is for our economy that was one of two other critical stimulus efforts the family's first act and our initial eight point three billion dollar funding bill to help supply important PPE and other health care necessities through our country through those actions we've ensured coronavirus testing would be free to anyone in need regardless of whether or not they are insured emergency paid sick leave enhanced emergency unemployment insurance more than 1 billion dollars to expand food assistance programs emergency measures to protect frontline health care workers and much more but I know these measures to financially support hard-working families and the small businesses in our community are useless unless we can get you connected to the access to these critical resources needed to navigate this public health crisis that's why we're here today that's why we're doing this webinar so I thought call that experts on the Small Business Administration with their expertise and institutional knowledge they will help guide you through the process and answer any questions you might have I'm gonna keep working and fighting to make sure we come out of this fund as financially secure and as stable as possible now I want to introduce you to our three experts from the Small Business Administration first Craig Jordan he's a supervisory specialist in lender relations with the Arizona district office of the SBA second we have Delia gomes an economic development specialist also with the arizona district office of the Small Business Administration and Yolanda Yolanda Stokes is the public information officer with the office of disaster assistance for the SBA field operations Craig would you be kind enough to start us off well Thank You congressman Stanton we really appreciate being invited and I want to say this on behalf of my colleagues we really appreciate you being in the forefront of providing this very important information to your constituents because what we're going to cover today is some of the basic features and functionality of the cares Act that congressman Stanton was just talking about and one of the big things that a lot of the small business community borrowers have questions about is the paycheck protection program and that's what we're going to focus on today but basically I wanted to kind of give you a framework because a lot of you have questions you have questions about where do I go to find the right lender any 7a lender that is currently involved in SBA lending can provide the Paycheck protection program we are channeling other lending communities and other lending channels outside of those that are already signed up with SBA to be able to allow them to provide this loan as well that will be a work in progress we're expecting to get a lot of guidance and information from our agency later tomorrow so that the lending community can begin accepting applications for the paycheck protection program so although there were folks and although the money has been allocated the actual part that we are awaiting or ready for it actually literally just steps away and or within the next few days we should be able to send you the lenders so you can apply for it what I would tell you is because right now today as it stands the program is not rolling we expect it in the next couple days what you're going to want to do is pay very close attention to your resource partners to your congressman's office to your government agencies to provide the information when this thing goes green um but today I'm going to walk you through what it is how it works give you some of the fundamental aspects of it so that you'll know how to deal with it going forward and you'll know where to go to get help so the first thing is just a quick overview of the programs we have existing 7a loans and this is something for you to keep for your information we will be providing I believe a recording in a copy of the slides after the presentation for those that provided their information but there's really three main parts to the chairs Act there is the Paycheck protection program there is the bridge loan program and there are the economic injury disaster loans that my colleague will be speaking out and then there is another aspect of it which is called the debt relief program that we will touch upon quickly which is a specialized area of forgiveness but let's talk quickly really about paycheck protection what most of the businesses are looking for and this is an element of forgiveness of up to eight weeks of payroll that is based upon employee retention and salary levels there are no SBA fees and it also has at least six months of deferral with maximum referrals or up to a year the kind of eligible entities are most small are going to be eligible and if they were harmed by Tobin 19 between February 15th 2020 and June 30th 2020 did would be eligible the program would be retroactive to February 15th in order to help bring workers who may have been laid off back onto payrolls and the loans as it currently stands are available to be applied for through June 30th so the 349 billion that was offered in forgivable loans are all going to have the same loan terms and those loans are going to be forgiven as long as the loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs most mortgage interest rent utility costs over the eight-week period after the loan is made and a certain amount of employee in compensation levels are maintained some of the payroll costs are capped for higher earners or higher-level employees at a hundred thousand annual i's basis for each employee and it's anticipated that not more than 25% of any forgiven amount can be for non payroll costs so what this program essentially is designed to do is cover eight weeks of payroll cost to make it very very simple the business does have to be in operation on February 15 2020 so small business concerns normal small businesses as well as some nonprofit organizations veteran organizations or even tribal business concerns it has fewer than 500 employees or meets the applicable size standards for the North American industry or makes system is eligible individuals who operate a sole proprietorship or independent contractor are eligible as well as self-employed individuals any business concerned that employees not more than 500 employees per physical patient and that is assigned an X code beginning with 72 affiliation rules are waived and and what affiliation has to do with is when a business is being large for those of you that are not really familiar with SBA SBA is the Small Business Administration and we're trying to provide avenues for small business owners so this is talking about affiliation rules they can be waived for business concern operating as a franchise that is assigned a franchise identifier code and that company received score that company receives funding through a small business investment company we talked about nonprofits nonprofits can also be eligible religious organizations are also being considered there will be more guidance coming receive final guidance I believe they will have how they're going to structure religious organizations in terms of this eligibility and there are other business models as well they're still being considered so how much the maximum loan size is ten million how would it tell you it calculated for your loan availability is really in three ways if you're in business on February 15 through June 30th your maximum loan is two hundred and fifty percent of your average monthly payroll cost during that time period if you have seasonal workers you can opt to choose March 1 as your as your time period start date if you were not in business between February 1519 and June 30th 2019 it's 250 percent of your average monthly payroll cost between January 1 and February 29th if you took out an economic injury disaster loan between February 15th and June 30th and you want to refinance that loan into a PPP loan you would add the outstanding loan amount to the payroll sum and that is a question that many small business owners have with these different types of funds can they be utilized separately or in combination and technically they could be done both ways what do I need to apply you will need to complete an application with a lender that is authorized to provide it and provide required documentation by that June 30th you'll need to provide lender with your lender with payroll documentation and financial records that would cover your outflow of payroll through those periods that I mentioned earlier with the three different loan amount scenarios do I need to first look for other funds before applying to this program not necessarily but you certainly can we're waiving the usual SPO requirement that you need to obtain credit elsewhere that is not a part of the eligibility requirements for the for the PPP loan again program is through June 30th how many loans can I take out under this program there is only one PPP loan per applicant and what can you use the money for well their payroll costs including benefits so that's how dental all that stuff interest on mortgage obligations rent under lease agreements that were enforced prior to February 15th utilities for which service began so its expenses and payroll costs what does count as payroll costs again salaries wages Commission's tips capped at the hundred thousand four high earners employee benefits which are vacation parental family medical sick leave state and local taxes for sole proprietor and independent contractor that wages Commission's income or net earnings from self-employment again capped at the higher earning levels at a hundred thousand on an annualized basis for each employee you do have to make some certification that the information is true to the best of your knowledge you do have to certify that the economic uncertainty makes the look very you have to use the funds to retain workers and maintain payroll you will not receive another loan under this program when I program I mean this particular PPP program you will provide the lender documentation that verifies the number of full-time equivalent employees on payroll and the dollar amounts of payroll costs covered mortgage interest payments cover grant payments and coverage utilities for the eighth with of your expenses that are eligible loan forgiveness is provided for the some of the documented payroll costs covered mortgage interest payments covered rent payments and utilities and this is again not more than 25% of the forgiven about can be for non payroll costs all the information you provide the application supporting documents are true to the best of your knowledge and you acknowledge the lender will calculate the eligible loan amount using documents that you submit you will firm that those are correct to the true to the best of your knowledge so we talked a little bit about this your loans can be forgiven you will owe them if you will owe money when your pit when your loan is due if you use the loan amount for any other than the eligible payroll costs a mortgage rent utilities and payments over the eight weeks after getting the loan you also owe money if you don't maintain your staff and payroll there is a provision in the in the program for you to rehire your employees your loan forgiveness can be reduced if you decrease your full-time employee headcount your loan forgiveness can be reduced if you decrease salaries and wages by more than twenty percent for any employee that made less than a hundred thousand and you have until June 30 it's 2020 to restore your full-time employment and salary levels for any changes made between February 15th and April 26th of this year so the question is how do you receive it you're going to submit a request to the lender that's servicing the loan it's going to include documents to verify the number of full-time equivalent employees a pay rate as well as payments on all of the expenses that we mentioned earlier you do have to certify that the documents are true and that you use to forgiveness amount to keep employees and make eligible payments and expenses the interest rate currently that is potentially influx half a percent is a fixed rate do I need to start paying interest on my loan they're not due for six months but interest will accrue over this period there's no prepayment penalty the loan is due in two years can you pay it early yes there's no program penalty do you need to pledge collateral you do not need a pledge collateral or there is no personal guarantee requirements on these loans but if you use the proceeds for fraudulent purposes the US government can pursue criminal charges against you so that is just a quick outline of the PPP program and I realize I went through that fast and for many of the borrowers that haven't dealt with applying for a loan in a long time or dealt with you know gathering up financial documents any of those things your lender will understand the program once the guidance is put out and they will be able to provide you with advice and assistance in that arena the small business debt relief now this is a specialized part of the cares Act that it has to do with existing seven eight a borrower's or 504 loan borrowers so if you have an existing 7a loan or a 504 loan in regular servicing starting with a neck payment do there are three scenarios outlined that cover all possibilities with clear guidance of the debt relief program SBA is going to make the principle and interest payment on all of those loans if you're an existing borrower not on the permit you're going to get six months of payments of principal and interest any associated fees beginning with the next payment do if you're an existing borrower that has already negotiated a deferment you're going to get six months of payments on the principal and interest and any associated fees beginning with the next payment due on the loan after the deferment period and if you're a new borrower you're taking out a new SBA 7a or 504 loan you're going to get six months of the payment the principal interest and any associated loan due up for the first payment for any new loans within the first six months starting from the date of enactment which is 327 so that's existing loans and new loans are going to get relief under the small business debt relief program now with that I like to take a moment and thank you for the invitation to be able to provide that information you will be able to apply for the PPP loan as soon as FDA provides guidance and we will be disseminating that information as soon as it's available we will be passing that out to our community partners including congressman Stanton's office so stay tuned to their distribution lists we expect it to be in the next couple days there is a sample application on our website now that you can take a look at it is not final yet until the finalized guidance comes out which we expect sometime late tomorrow but that way you can prepare for what kinds of questions they're going to be asking and kind of prepare for you know finding the right lender so with that I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to you a lot of stuffs with the disaster area lumber Thank You Craig and Thank You congressman Stanton and your staff and our partners at the district office for pulling together this webinar very valuable resources to share with our business community in these unprecedented times I'm going to be sharing with you the ins and outs and how to apply and access SBA's economic injury disaster loan program as well as the advanced program next slide please so who's eligible any business that has been impacted by the covet 19a coronavirus that has 500 or less employees and you have to have been in operation before January 21st of this year businesses with more than 500 employees of course are considered under our standards SBA small business size standards they are also eligible any small business cooperatives independent contractors sole proprietors are all eligible nonprofits of any size are eligible for our disaster assistance loans as well as this is new for us with faith-based organizations being eligible to also apply now the caveat on the faith-based organization is that they must provide social services what they're deeming to be a second secular nature by that what we mean is simply they provide child care services perhaps or some type of housing and shelter services or they may have a food kitchen or food distribution services next slide please so some of the parameters the disaster loan program or the economic injury to the loan program is that we have a maximum threshold at two million up to two million dollars so that if any business owner private nonprofit can borrow up to two million dollars depending on what your needs are for working capital needs that's working when we say working capital needs there's no specification that it has to be payroll certainly you can use the services or the dollars for sick leave rent mortgages payments any installment payments that you may have any pre-existing debt as well as of course its payroll the interest rates for businesses is that 3.75 percent and for nonprofits the interest rate is 2.75 percent with a term of up to 30 years so these are some of the tools that make these loans affordable of course we have that interest rate that is substantially below market we also have the extended term and there's also a built-in 12-month deferment for any of the covet idle loans and you'll hear me use that acronym for you as well as the economic injury disaster loan there's no personal guarantees required unless the loan is over two hundred thousand dollars and we're basing your eligibility and approval on the information that's contained in the streamlined loan application and of course your credit score for the economic injury disaster loans for covet 19 there are no real estate requirements as collateral for any loan that's over twenty five thousand dollars we'll just take a blank at UCC filing and there may be some minimal fees involved in that and of course those fees would be rolls right into your love next slide please so the emergency economic injury disaster loan advance or you may have heard folks refer to it as the grant is actually an advance of your economic injury disaster loan so let's say that you are approved for a $100,000 disaster loan then and you're approved also for the maximum advance of $10,000 that first $10,000 would you would not be obligated to repay that so it's basically in advance on your loan proceeds that does not have to be paid and that is for any business owner that may be declined for the economic injury just a solo piece you still have access to that economic injury advance and you just still don't have to pay that back so how do you access this economic injury advance or the loan we have very very simplified application as a result of all of the overflow of applicants from last week SBA significantly streamlined the disaster loan application process and there's basically one application very simplified application I've heard folks say that they can complete it in 10 to 15 minutes so you go to sba.gov you click on the yellow banner at the top of that says coronavirus or covet 19 and you would access the simplified streamlined application that one application will take care of you applying for the economic injury disaster loan as well as the advanced and I believe it's on the fourth page of the application you can't miss it so I don't want anyone to feel like they're going to miss it you can't miss it there's a question that says do you want to apply for the advance you want to click yet and you're going to submit your routing number and your account number so that those advance funds can be directly deposited and there's no additional documentation required for the economic injury loan it's just that simple so you're applying for both these economic injury disaster loans as well as the advanced in that one step in the streamlined application and now I'll turn it over to Craig to talk about some of our additional resources thank you I appreciate that one of the things that we touched on and one of the real important parts of the elements of the cares act is many borrowers who haven't dealt with putting together financial records recently or the lending process or what the path forward is supposed to look like or maybe even because there are choices within the Eid le idea advanced and within the payroll protection programs which ones might they want to apply for and which ones they might not want to apply for depending upon what their circumstances are with their you know with their business model with her you know with their expenses and with their with their payroll we have free resources not starting with your own congressman Stanton's website would also have score we have small business development centers in women's business centers that can help you with counseling with guidance with loan applications with business planning with marketing strategy with everything that you can think of that a small business would have to deal with a one important note to make is that specifically the Women's Business Center has spanish-speaking counselors that can help you navigate the English translation of this particular application process we also have the be Bach which is a veteran's business outreach center we have micro lenders participating lenders that you can lean on as well and my advice to you would be just make sure that you are staying abreast of everything that's happening by being on distribution channels directly from the government because that's where you're going to get the most correct information and in addition to that look at your state organizations look at your county and your city organizations as well and I'm sure that congressman Stanton can attest to this you know between the City of Phoenix and whatever city you live in and the state the commerce authority they can have supportive programs that follow and align themselves with what we're presenting to you here but they are completely separate that you may be eligible for so you're definitely going to want to make sure that you stay in contact with your community so that if there are other programs other sources of assistance that you make yourself available to it and the only way that you will is by reaching out and making sure that you are on the distribution list for any of those organizations or entities that you're familiar with or that apply to you thank you very much Craig and Yolanda that was an outstanding presentation I know we have more information coming as well but we didn't have a chance maybe have a little question and answer a period I did want to note that my team for my website at the Carmen Stanton's website has put together a resource guide in both English and Spanish the spanish-speaking community here locally is an incredibly entrepreneurial community and we want to make sure that all people have a chance to access these important programs during these very very challenging times okay I have a few questions here for you and and hopefully you can answer them as expeditiously as possible both of these programs that you described in detail as part as webinar the PPP and the e IDL they are much needed programs can a single business apply for both programs and that's really anywhere yes yeah I'll tackle that one um you can yes you can apply for either/or however what you do need to be careful of and what the advice here is is you can't use the money for the same thing for both programs so you'll need two different for example what you as an example you might want to use the payroll protection for just payroll and use the e IDL for other expenses because you're going to want to be able to substantiate the forgiveness on the payroll protection which means you're going to have to have proof that you use it for those eligible purposes mentioned earlier all right thank you very much obviously the purpose of these programs from a congressional perspective is that businesses keep as many people employed as possible during these unprecedented challenging times as we get through that the public health care crisis and get our economy back on line it's going to be a lot easier if businesses have kept as many people employed as possible including access to much needed health care employment based health care programs okay another question and this is probably the one that many people on this webinar want to know if you successfully apply for a IDL how long until the money arrives in my account yes thank you for that question and realistically we want folks to apply as soon as possible because we have that the advanced component to it it's important that you go ahead and apply right away again I mentioned that when you're applying for the Idol you're applying for both the loan program for working capital as well as that up to $10,000 advance that's money that's going to be directly deposited and I'm told that within the next few days they want to get those advances out to folks so it's important that if you haven't already applied please apply as soon as you get off of this call to make sure that you can have access to that advance money because again that's advanced to you in advance of your actual loan that's great and then another PPP program we hope and pray you can go live tomorrow although there are some reports that banks aren't ready yet what are you hearing about to whether or not the banks are ready to work with you for the PPP program well congressman stan that's an excellent question I mean it's one that I've heard a lot in the community in and each lender is going to be different once we present the guidance to the lenders there are some that are building the infrastructure as we speak there are some that are waiting to hear how the rules and policies are going to affect them and then there are some that may choose not to participate and until we provide that to the learning community we wouldn't be able to tell you exactly which lender but what I would tell you that because the lenders have a lot of businesses and their portfolios if they don't provide the PPP loan program and there are a number of borrowers out there searching for those those opportunities their portfolios are going to go into shambles so it's it's very likely that you will see the majority of our participants aggressively marketing and providing the TPP loan and I would expect that to start immediately for some and then for some they will trickle in as it goes forward but I would just stay tuned to your office congressman Stanton and to the other channels because I do know that we are building an infrastructure to be able to provide a direct signup forward lenders that want to participate in PPP that will be unveiling as well when we provide the guidance to the lending community the borrower's will be able to go in and find a list based on where they're located thank you very much another question about PPP our contractor is eligible when you say contractors you mean individuals who are self-employed contractors yes that is in the guide that the Senate Small Business Committee put out and and all of the fact sheets that have been put out as well so yes they would be eligible to apply as as an entity what about sole proprietors sole proprietors as well yes no see how about the deaf organization please yeah organization type it is all eligible it's just that they need to be in existence by those minimum dates so the type of organization and even if you're you know a contractor it would also be able to apply for for PPP and I believe also with the ideal but I'll yell on to speak to that Thank You Craig and Thank You congressman yes both independent contractors and sole proprietors are eligible to apply for the economic injury disaster loan as well as the advanced for the $10,000 advance obviously it can only be spent for certain types of expended what documents should recipients of that advance maintain so they can show they have spent the money appropriately yes sir yeah I would recommend that anyone that receives the advance to go with your local go to your local bank and set up a separate account you want to have some really nice clean bookkeeping we're encouraging everyone to access all of the programs but of course there may be some that are overlapping so just to take the some of the stress out of it I would encourage you to open a bank account where you'll have a nice clean system of debits and credits and what you use your advanced for now with the economic injury advanced there's not a requirement that you use it for payroll so you can utilize it for four things other than payroll for sick leave for rent for mortgage payments for installment payments so you do have some flexibility with the use of fund another question about PPP are Commission based independent contractors eligible did you ever chance you hear the question if you want if you want time to research that IQ move on a different question then we get back to that one at a later time I want to make sure we're using our time as efficiently as possible you're a little more time on that one can you hear me hello okay Craig can you hear me okay Yolanda can you hear me in there I can hear you just fine okay I was going to say on the issue about Commission based independent contractors we're gonna hold that question and come back to it later on but we want to get an answer for people whether Commission based independent contractors would be eligible for paycheck Protection Act okay I'll make your Craig get that one all right gig economy Airbnb or other similar type a program our Airbnb hosts eligible for either of these programs yes they are eligible for the economic injured disaster loan program thank you very much what if a business has already let some of their employees ago there are some of their employees are now receiving unemployment insurance can that business still qualify for either these programs those businesses would be eligible for the economic injury disaster loan program Gregg would have to give you more information on the triple people they would also be eligible for Triple P and apologize the mute button was not working prod all right now welcome back I did hear you go and yes commissions are an acceptable form of payroll to be counted in the PPP program as well for those independent contractors that that's their primary source of income okay and the earlier question I think you're on mood still was a commission based independent are they eligible they are excellent okay I've applied to imagine I'm a small business I've applied for an SBA loan what can I expect now and is there a way to check on the status of the loan yes I'll take that question to check on the status we encourage everyone to contact SBA's customer service number and 865 nine two nine five five or you can send an email to disaster assistance at sba.gov but we're encouraging everyone to please be patient with us as we step up our call center to accommodate all of the calls the increased call volume so that is the way that you would check the status of your SBA economic injury disaster loan all right I have a question regarding nonprofits we received a question in advance I wanted to give you a chance to answer it nonprofits are such an important part of our local economy they employ a lot of people so imagine a nonprofit partner the City of Phoenix this nonprofit does not doesn't pay rent but they do pay a revenue share to the City of Phoenix can that nonprofit use an SBA assistance to pay the revenue share to the city on the PPP program it is possible that that revenue share would need to employ individuals who are are eligible to be considered employees of the nonprofit all right but that might be more of a legal question because what it comes down to is whether it's a non-profit or whether it's any other entity type is is the proceeds for the PPP loan going towards establishing payroll and payroll benefits for individuals who are not compensated with as a result of the of the covin virus so you'd have to look at that a little deeper but the simple answer would be likely yes as long as that were the case I thank you very much another particular question that someone had to ask in advance it's a business they say they rent sweets to over 200 self-employed independent businesses many of those businesses that they rent to have not been required by law to shut down but many of them have closed the businesses because they are staying home with children are those businesses eligible to apply for the Eid L program again businesses that were not forced to closed but had to close because they had to take care of childcare at home yes those businesses are eligible we would encourage them to apply alright and then one final question we a few more questions to me we launched a new business another particular question a business launched after February 15th are there any SBA benefit or programs that a business launching after February 15th could apply for in terms of the eligibility for the PPP program if they were an entity in operation after February 15 yeah and they would be helpful to submit expenses and then attempt to have them forgiven through PPP not it okay here's another question that was submitted in advance we didn't weave in a business we do not know if we will need a loan currently would it be a good idea to get the process started in case we begin to see past do receivables and a slowdown in the market yes I'll take that question and I would encourage any business owner to go ahead and apply right away there's absolutely no obligation to take the loan if you find that other programs become available that suit your needs but I would encourage you not to wait to go ahead and apply for that idle loan as well as the advance and certainly if you don't need the loan portion you can simply cancel the loan excellent let's see business owners that have daca eligible employees are they eligible to participate in these programs in terms of the status of their employees I'm not aware that the status of their employees has anything to do with eligibility the eligibility is based on the number of employees total and the business being in operation after February 15th so I haven't seen any policy that excludes them based on who their employees are okay next question of course is businesses owned by daca eligible individuals are they are they able to access these important programs you lot I don't know if you have an answer for that I can try to answer on the payroll protection side we don't have any any business owner and on our side any business owner that has as long as they have an EIN number or social security number they're eligible to apply okay so on the ideal side it sounds like they are eligible on the PPP side we don't have guidance on specific eligibility or we'll call it fringe eligibility yet so I wouldn't be able to answer that question until we get guidance on it it is likely to be aligned with with the IDL eligibility but for those particular individuals they may need to stay very very close to your office can congressman Stanton just so that when we can provide it to you and let them know okay thank you very much for the information we're just about out of time if you have any additional questions for people that have

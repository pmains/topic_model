chairman of our oversight investigation subcommittee mr. McHenry 45 minutes thank you for being here today and for your testimony and you know to this question about being a counter-cyclical force you talk about legacy loans that you're dealing with now as impacting your your fund balance now what years are we talking about in particular well if you look at the chart on page 2 of our testimony it's a very small in two years 2001 through 2009 okay so now at that period of time there was you know three percent down payments no minimum credit scores a lack of risk-based pricing is that correct I I'm not sure I heard all three of those but yes okay and what is different now so what is different now is a you still have a three percent down payment requirement well three and a half percent down pain okay I matando that's similar and if you're under a 580 fight ghosts okay but under 580 so you're making lending to those under 584 a FICO score today no let me just be clear on virtually none virtually none or not virtually none let me just this is a really important point if you look at the changes we've made in our credit policies not just down payments but overall credit policies and the tightening that we've done a large percentage thirty forty percent of our portfolio in the past was a lower FICO band scores and I don't believe a person is so our therefore what's the cutoff hey that's for FICO scores my time is limited are our average FICO score today and not average what is the cutoff if I have if I'm a 555 co score can I get an FHA loan yes or no yes only if you meet yes so why are not subprime sating factors oh no I'm asking a question and now i'm following up with this question i would appreciate you answering yes so if i have a 555 co score that is considered subprime right again you would be you would be required to have a ten percent down I understand but I'm asking a different question than you are in fact answering and my time is limited so if i have a 550 psycho score that is subprime it's certainly not a prime you more you you can't just take a FICO score and say that subprime you have to look at the okay but under two RM under a qualified residential mortgage and a qualified Mortgage requirements that would not be permissible not within the box so let me let me get to the point here if we're talking about FHA is a counter-cyclical force what in fact we saw in the early part of the 2000s and leading up to the crisis was FHA following the market as a racing to the bottom in terms of underwriting standards know that and that is illicit part of me that is absolutely not correct FHA and I asked Janice consent to offer a Washington Post editorial from July third of this year going through the very provisions that I'm outlining without objection okay so can you explain to me in March of last year you testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee he said thanks to our effort since taking office i can say that that the long-term outlook of FHA and the MMI f are now much better than they were in 2009 in 2009 the mmm i F capital ratio is point five three percent today it's negative 1.44 and you're drawn over a billion and a half dollars from the taxpayers so do you still stand by your statement that fha's outlook is improving I do believe it's improving look at each book of business that we've done to improve an 2011-2012 so we're saying you're no you're in better shape now than you were in March of 2012 not saying we're in better shape I'm saying we are rebuilding our trajectory again I want to go back to these are based on economic changes in the environment so what is the housing market worse today than it was in March of 2012 it no no it certainly is not so let me go to another question here you expected that a capital reserve and in February of this year when you testify before this committee a capital reserve of eight billion dollars by the end of 2013 do you still expect that again will have a new actuarial coming out I it would have been mid-december I mean mid-november but given the shutdown it'll do we're sitting at the end of October yes and let me just take a gander just take sort of a guess if you will or take a look over the horizon and do you think you'll be close to that eight billion dollars your projected in February I am NOT going to make a estimate sir I totally thank you time of the gentleman has expired sure

Thank You mr. chairman for scheduling this markup on this important bipartisan legislation on various topics within the jurisdiction of our committee you and the staff have worked collaboratively appreciate the bipartisanship the mark-up is an example of what we can do when we work together on a bipartisan basis to develop good policy in fact I'm a firm believer that some of our best work takes place when we come together but I also would use the moment as a reminder just think what would have happened had we actually had witnesses and hearings on the tax bill there would have been an opportunity to create I think legislation that we would not be compelled to revisit regularly now during the next year or more but this morning we will start with a number of bills which would among other things strengthen and modernize the IRS improved taxpayer services and protect Americans from identity theft these bills are sponsored by a number of members from our committee but I do want to single out and applaud the oversight chair and ranking member Lynch Aikens and John Lewis who did hold hearings and met with witnesses to solicit testimony and they are the principal architects of the IRS redesign package there are many important reforms in all nine of the IRS redesigned bills were acting on today but I'm particularly pleased with the many provisions that would help low and moderate income tax payers for example an important reform we'll be voting on today is to codify the existing free file program under which the IRS partners with the tax preparation community to offer free online tax filings to people whose income fall in the bottom 70% a longtime champion of the free file program along with my colleague Ron kind and others so I'm pleased that it's in today's package and then other important reform is codifying the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program under which the IRS partners with nonprofit and community groups to offer income tax assistance to people with low incomes limited English skills or other barriers to tax compliance I certainly encourage our colleagues to support all of these important IRS design bills we will then proceed to the moving Americans Privacy Protection Act which is a common-sense piece of legislation sponsored by representative bill Pascrell and Jeff Denham this bill would strengthen the system used by US Customs and Border Patrol to protect impersonally the personally identifiable information of individuals who are moving internationally I'd like to applaud the leadership of the trade subcommittee ranking member Pasquale in this legislation and urge my colleagues certainly to support this legislation will conclude today with two bipartisan bills relating to identity theft in the misuse of Social Security numbers the Social Security Child Protection Act introduced by representative Doggett and marShon would protect children in cases where their Social Security card is stolen from the mail stolen SS ends can be used to commit identity fraud and such fraud can become quite extensive before the child's family even becomes aware of the problem under the bill SSA would issue a child a new SS in if their card is stolen from the mail the other bill before the committee the protecting children from identity theft Act is intended to address a growing form of identity fraud that involving so-called synthetic identity theft this legislation would allow financial service companies if they have consent from their customer to verify the customers name and SSN with SSA in order to help prevent identity theft so I'm pleased mr. chairman that we were able to work together on the basis of strengthening this legislation in two key ways first we included provisions to ensure that the verification system would be secure and not subject to misuse and second we included provisions to make sure the users of the verification system would pay the full cost of it and not detract from SSA s ability to fulfill its primary mission of running the Social Security program I urge our colleagues today again to support these two important pieces of legislation and we look forward to a productive day Thank You mr. chairman

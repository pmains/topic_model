Mr Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to the Republicans tax scam the middle class receives virtually no benefit from this bill this bill hits middle-class Minnesotans especially hard by dismantling the state and local tax deduction it increases costs for college students and their families it abandons adoptive parents and it punishes people with high medical bills so why does this bill hurt hard-working families so President Trump and the Republicans can pay for giveaways to the wealthiest Americans big corporations and billionaires will see their taxes slash wealthy errors and Harris's will be allowed to dodge taxes entirely while the top one percent of Americans received nearly half the tax cuts ninety-nine percent of us will be stuck with a federal debt that will explode by trillions of dollars mr. speaker this Republican bill is not tax reform it is not a good deal for the middle class it is a scam plain and simple I oppose it and we must defeat it

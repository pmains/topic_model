my amendment i would like to associate myself with remarks of the ranking member and other members this markup is a missing the needs of the moment with the current crisis in afghanistan addition i believe that's a rubber stamp this fundamental request without additional information on how it will be spent without offsets is simply bad governing we must stop funding our agencies to reconciliations and contrived emergencies that leave our children to pay our debts years later and if it feels like we've been here before it's because we have in february of this year this same reconciliation tactic was used by the majority to give the va 17 billion dollars despite va providing shockingly little information as to how that money would be spent during that markup i offered an amendment that would have increased transparency and oversight on the department by requiring the secretary to provide a detailed plan for how va would expend the funds and report bi-weekly on how the funds are being spent additionally my amendment required audits to be performed by the va inspector general and review of the government accountability office after all funds were spent to ensure that taxpayer money was not wasted during that markup my amendment was voted down on party lines however ranking member boss chairman chicano chairman pappas and i worked together to introduce my amendment as a stand-alone bill hr 2911 the va transparency and trust in h.r 2911 passed a full house by a vote of 411-4 i thank ranking member bros for leading it and i thank chairman takano and chairman pappas for their work with us on that bill despite having near unanimous bipartisan support in house h.r 2911 was not moved in the senate i hope to fix that here today the text of my amendment is nearly identical to hr 2911 only now it also includes the new funds granted in this reconciliation as i said in february we cannot ensure that every taxpayer dollar sent to the va is truly improving the delivery of health care and benefits for veterans if we do not know why va needed that dollar in the first place and how it was ultimately spent understandably this necessary and granular oversight does come at a cost that is why my amendment would fence two million dollars from the base amendment to pay for these requirements and reports this is about one one hundredth of a percent of the entire cost of the base amendment that's one dollar out of every ten thousand dollars spent as of last week va still has nearly one billion dollars of cares and over 16.5 billion dollars of american rescue plan funds left unused but congress is no closer to knowing how our constituents hard-earned money is being spent every single member of this committee voted for hr 2911 on the house floor i hope to see that same unanimous commitment to transparency and oversight today and i urge all my colleagues to support my amendment with that mr chairman i yield back i thank you mr man

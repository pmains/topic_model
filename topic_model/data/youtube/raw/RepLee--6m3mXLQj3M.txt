a group of congressional Democrats are advancing legislation to provide direct diaper assistance to families in need the hygiene assistance for families infants and toddlers act of 2015 was introduced last month by Minnesota Democrat congressman keith Ellison and co-sponsored by 19 other members of the House of Representatives one of those co-sponsors is representative barbara Lee a Democrat from California who joins me now from Berkeley and back with us at nerd land from Raleigh North Carolina is Michelle old founder of the diaper bank of north carolina represented Lee I want to start with you tell me what this bill would do if it passes thank you very much listen let me first congratulate Michelle and just thank you because this is an example of how democracy works Robbie we're inspired by what Michelle is done and we want this to be part of a policy that HR 4055 really would put into place what we want to do congressman Ellison congresswoman DeLauro myself and others is to require States to develop a demonstration project or at least allow states to do that and provide grants to assist those who need diaper assistance when you look at the fact that women and men spend seventy to eighty dollars a month on diaper needs yet a large percentage of families either reuse the diapers or delay the changing diapers at that's because they just don't have the resources to purchase the adequate amount of diapers and so we believe that funds that could be allocated for a variety of reasons could be allocated for diaper assistance and we want to give States the authority to develop these demonstration projects throughout the country this is I just have to tell you I was so excited when I heard this and Michelle it's in part because I have become I think as many people who hear you speak I have just become a diaper advocate since the first time I heard you talk about it so understand why diapers are so important why are they a health issue and why are they such a big deal well in our everyday work is about diapers but really it's much more than that it's about connecting families to resources that help them become self sustaining for example Sam Bowie's diapers as a gateway to other services so we see increased home visits that deter child abuse we see increased amuse ations we see families that are able to provide for their children take the diapers that they need a childcare center so that they can go to work that they can buy the things they need for their family and so it is much more than a simple diaper it has a huge impact on our community on the families that live in them and on children because they're healthier this this is such a liver for you making this point Michelle that many child care centers require you to bring diapers and so if you don't have diapers you cannot drop the child off at childcare which means obviously you can't go to work and so representative Lee I just you know you are the one congressional representative who have come repeatedly on this show and talk with regular folks living their lives dealing with a set of problems you had that experience with gianna gains Turner I am when you said this is how democracy is supposed to work I keep feeling representative Lee like exactly we're supposed to look at the problems that exist in our community and then help government is supposed to help us to fix them make them better for people who are trying to do better for themselves tell me how likely you think it is that this will pass the Congress that we know is so split well thank you melissa first of all let me just say once again to michelle and all of those who really are inspiring this effort i formerly was on public assistance myself in food stamps and so many don't understand what this really means and how young women especially single young women have to really struggle just to make meet each and every day and so as chair of the task force on income inequality poverty and opportunity we're looking at innovative ways to help lift families out of poverty this is a very creative and innovative strategy to use and so we're going to fight and we're going to make sure that this legislation gets co-sponsors and Michelle I know that people around the country are going to support this the more co-sponsors we get though and the more public awareness that is made in terms of educating the public about the very important health aspects of this what Michelle said in terms of the comprehensive nature of these strategies to lift people out of poverty I think the more people learn about this the more co-sponsorship we can build and then the more members of Congress will listen so we just got to fight the good fight and we're going to win sooner or later I have this long term struggle it's a marathon but I'm really confident that when people learn about what Michelle and others are going through and what this movement about is about will pass this legislation Michelle what is the one thing that you want people to really know about the work that your diaper bank and others view across the country well we just recently did a study through UNC Greensboro and what was really important to point out about that study is that the majority of families that seek assistance with diapers are working families over seventy-five percent of them in our study alone they are working one to two jobs and they still cannot afford the basic needs to keep their children healthy and keep food on the table and we get calls all the time from teachers from military families that cannot make ends meet and so we are really talking about working poor struggling to provide the basic needs for their children and their families I've said it to everybody in my life all of my friends and family I have every single thing that I need and all our christmas is a donation to your local local diaper bank thank you to a representative barbara lee in berkeley california also thank you to michelle old in raleigh north carolina that's our show for today thanks to you at home for watching and I'll see you tomorrow morning

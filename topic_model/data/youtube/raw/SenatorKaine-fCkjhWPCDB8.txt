new information this morning on the search warrant executed to former president trump's mar-a-lago residents the washington post is reporting that some of the documents the fbi were searching for were related to nuclear weapons as well as signals intelligence which are intercepted digital communications at the highest level joining us now is democratic senator tim kaine of virginia senator thank you so much for being with us this morning your reaction to the news overnight john the washington post says that the fbi was seeking classified documents relating to nuclear weapons now we don't know if they got any we don't know why they thought that but how serious would the existence of such documents be johnny it couldn't be more serious as you say we don't know what they got but it's pretty clear that they had information likely from some source that documents at mar-a-lago dealt with the most sensitive national security matters that the u.s must guard very very jealously i'm on the armed services committee in the foreign relations committee and there's nothing more classified than materials related to the u.s nuclear program and as you said you are on the armed services committee you can help explain to our audience this doesn't necessarily mean it has to be nuclear codes but any information about nuclear weapons american or otherwise right exactly we have we have intelligence about our own capacities that we wouldn't want to share with adversaries we also have our own assessments of adversaries capacities that we would not want to be public this could be very very damaging in the wrong hands somebody could try to make money by selling this kind of information i mean it's you know again this is the the opening stages of an investigation and we have a criminal system in this country where everybody's presumed innocent until proven guilty so search warrants and gathering documents and investigations and even indictments aren't the same as a as a conviction but it shows the level of seriousness with which the fbi has to treat this matter today happens to be uh the fifth anniversary of charlottesville uh in your state and i'm mentioning that because today a man is dead killed in ohio after he tried to enter the fbi field office there there are some signs that maybe he was inspired by or responding to some of the political rhetoric that is out there or his concerns in line with some of the political rhetoric out there just reflect on this moment well john it's it's a tragic moment three three people lost their lives that day heather heyer um and then two virginia state troopers troopers bates and uh colin one of whom i knew because uh he was part of the detail that i would sometimes travel with when i was governor of virginia and you know i think the attack that day inspired by you know right-wing extremism neo-nazis neo-confederates people chanting anti-semitic slogans terrorizing students who were in their first friday at uva first year students and they were in the services at the at the hillel center it was a it was a horrible day and it made me question many assumptions i've had about this country that violence president trump's reaction to cavalierly dismiss it it made me question a lot of assumptions i've had about this country there and there's a direct line between the charlottesville attack the attack on the capital january 6 2021 and then some of the violent rhetoric that you've seen used in just in recent days follow the following the search warrant at mar-a-lago including this tragic instance yesterday in cincinnati and some of the reaction from your republican colleagues to the search at mar-a-lago some floating the notion evidence was planted how do you think that factors into this i'm just shocked that at my colleagues um you know the governor of virginia went after the department of justice and said this is the same department of justice that labeled loudon school parents domestic terrorists there's not a shred of evidence for that proposition attacking the fbi uh for for a political investigation the fbi director is a donald trump appointee christopher wray this is not a biden appointee it's a donald trump appointee i i lived in a military dictatorship in honduras earlier in my life and i know what it's like to live in a society where prosecutors and people trying to hold public officials to account uh get attacked and even have their lives put in jeopardy i never thought that would be the case in the united states of america but this kind of rhetoric by some of my republican colleagues challenging the investigation challenging normal legal processes it's the kind of thing you'd see in a third world country not in a country that respects the rule of law and i find that very very difficult so senator kaine we've been trying to talk to you because i read in politico this week that you've been dealing with long covet for two years um i have john since um go ahead and obviously i mean how are you feeling what has it been like for you and just in general how do you think we as a country have been approaching this issue of lawn covered um john just quickly my personal experience but my personal experience is minor compared to many others who are really suffering i'm dealing with mild symptoms but they're very noticeable i got coveted in march of 2020 we were passing the cares act in opening days of covet and the the capital was kind of empty but there was already community spread i got an unusual set of symptoms that weren't the normal coveted symptoms at the time then i gave kova to my wife one more thing for a you know husband to feel guilty about but within a couple weeks our cases were mild and and we were doing fine but one symptom that kicked in with me was nerve tingling like every nerve ending is dipped in an alka-seltzer that started in late march of 2020 and it's never gone away i can work i can exercise i can sleep if i wake up in the middle of night it's a little bit harder to go back to sleep than it used to be but this gives me an appreciation for people who are still dealing with symptoms much more serious racing heart rate intense fatigue brain fog and confusion other pulmonary issues there's a whole set of symptoms connected to long covet and and the estimates are that about 15 percent of people who've had coven will end up with lingering symptoms and that's going to be a huge issue for our health care system for people's ability to work and just enjoy life and so i decided to talk about my own experience because many people are not believed when they share their symptoms and i wanted to let folks know hey i believe you i thank god my symptoms are mild but i believe you and we need to research and find uh causes but more especially find cures and treatments well uh senator kaine we we glad we're glad that you're well enough to be with us today we wish you the best and we're glad you're speaking out about this because a lot of people i think are not being believed here nice to see you this morning they feel they feel a stigma it's great to be with you john thanks so much

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody got another uh stellar show for you that's why you keep coming back and and uh telling all your friends to give this show five stars i don't know why you give it five stars but it makes me feel good so that's why you do it um we're gonna have a good conversation today a lot of you maybe or may or may not know this uh i spent my entire high school in bowieta colombia i spent about a year and a half in middle school in quito ecuador my stepmother is from peru uh so i i know the region pretty well i've often said that a foreign policy should probably focus a lot more south of our border um we have a lot to gain from that we've got an entire hemisphere um that that for the most part um is based in and um you know judeo-christian western civilization values um allies that we have a uh a huge interest in seeing it develop and thrive um and yet it's it's it feels like we're often focused on many other parts of the world you know you've got a you've got a country like mexico where there's a there's a civil war going on you have a highly elite um highly capable well-funded uh insurgency in mexico um the drug cartels very similar situation to what we used to have in colombia um you have a unmitigated disaster on the border right now and um that also helps fund the drug cartels there's there's a lot of geopolitics in south america that i think we just don't touch upon enough um that are potentially driving a lot of the crisis at the border and and we should really be more aware of as we consider a future foreign policy but i'm no expert um you know i just dabble in it in the expertise portion of this so i brought on an expert uh anna quintana she's a senior policy analyst of latin america western hemisphere at heritage foundation and all all around a great person and great person to have a conversation with anna thanks so much for being on thanks thanks for having me and i think you could have told all of us you definitely are an expert on the region because you also pronounce my name right it's easy i speak spanish so it's i i don't practice enough uh but you know look i i still go back for my high school reunions in bogota and uh like i think i have more friends from colombia than i do from uh college like uh and i don't think that i that that's a fact it's an absolute fact so i have a great deal of love for colombia we're going to talk about colombia because that's um dude i remember in high school so i went to high school from 98 to 2002. um that was a bad time in that country you couldn't even drive out of the city and even in the city it was dangerous we had a bullet hole in our car and then we got an armored car after that um and uh luckily i wasn't in it when that bullet hole appeared but my stepmother was um and it was a dangerous place but now i mean i would recommend anybody goes and visits and it's a great tourist location and maybe maybe we shouldn't let that secret out too much um because you know it ruins it for the rest of us but um man it's a i i just have a lot of love for for colombia and venezuela too my so my parents lived in venezuela um after i moved to college um i've been in venezuela many times and it's a complete disaster now and one of the questions i'm going to ask here is is mexico going to turn into that under obrador a lot of us don't understand amlo um i'm losing um is his initials that's what just people call him uh we'll we'll get to that um i want to begin with you on look mexico and then colombia and there's a reason i want to transition to that but um look i mean i think as a texan we're a bit more aware of our national history and in connection to mexico uh you know remember the alamo basically means this used to be mexico and um and it's also been an inflow for for mass migration over the years um instability caused by cartels uh fighting over different territories so i mean where do we begin um how what's what should we what should we be focused on right now from a security perspective as far as our cartels like what what's an update um on on some of these in places like jalisco sinaloa what's what should we be aware of sure yeah i know so the big thing that's going on right now is the cartel jalisco right the the new generation right you know the the jalisco cartel you know new generation jalisco cartel right i mean right now it's a big war that's going on between them and uh sinaloa cartel because traditionally like this it was the sinaloa cartel and uh and los cetas that like controlled like the dominant areas of the border but now these guys are like really encroaching in on like the dawn like the main points like the profitable profitable rather points of entry and that's where you're seeing like a lot of violence along the border which we saw like during like the like the you know the the mexican like wards like the drug wars of like a few years ago and then upon like these other areas that you were talking about like jalisco and um guadalajara right like within like guadalajara and along like some of like the you know like along the like the pacific coast like in acapulco and stuff there's just like this massive like uptick in violence like every single year since like 2019 mexico like every single year exceeds is its historic level of like violence right like just when you think that the violence can't get any worse it is right now it's recording about 77 000 people who have been like for no rather i'm sorry it's in the hundreds of thousands of people who've been forcibly disappeared right last year was about 70 some odd thousand people who've been you know who are murdered and then there's this other bizarre thing that's been going on with this like resistance cartel um and that's now trying to fight off los cetas and michoacan when it's within um what is it within jalisco like fighting these groups off so it's like what you were saying it's essentially like a civil war within various with various pockets of mexico i mean the violence is just completely unstable and you know on the issue of like amlo there there really is no security agenda he's been in office since december 2018 and there really is no articulated plan forward as to what's going to happen maybe let's take a step back in in history i mean when did these cartels become so powerful is it does it coincide with the demise of the colombian cartels so it's it's it there's there's when did they become powerful and then when did they become ultra violent right so essentially what you had was this kind of like balloon effect right so the colombian cartels never fully demised they splintered and they broke apart right so you had two really like dominant cartels in colombia that you know when the united states came in with like planned colombian you know you had an uptick in u.s colombian collaboration then you kind of had the downswing in like the caribbean corridor trafficking and then it all went to the caribbean to central america and up through mexico right and that also coincided with you know nafta so you had an expansion in like trade and like trade flows like through the actual like physical border and then you had the cartels that just grew right because first you had like the you know there was the the like the jalisco cartel and then that kind of like broke up and splintered apart and you had a formation of like other cartels but it really wasn't until like los cetas came into the game when they splintered off from the golf cartel because they used to be it was weird they were like the on the armed protection wing like the paramilitary wing of the gulf cartel that that's when the violence really came down and then that's also essentially when you know the merida initiative and the really like the war against the cartels launched that the violence in mexico really kind of you know really really began one of the things that stands out about the mexican cartels is there um especially and i look at it from a special operations perspective like if i had to fight these guys um it's one thing to fight isis it's one thing to fight the taliban um i don't respect that enemy a whole lot i mean they're mean but they're not mexican drug cartels mean um and they're not capable like mexican drug cartels how do they recruit their people they get a lot from the police force they get a lot from mexican special forces one of the frustrations we see uh is that we train mexican special forces and then they end up getting recruited into the drug cartels because it pays so much better sure sure i think so i i think the concern yes is is the violence absolutely i think from the u.s perspective because what should be even far more concerning is the fact that these guys are like a mold operate like a multinational you know like business conglomerate right like that's the scariest part and that's the part that's even gonna be far more difficult in defeating them because they don't even just they're not just like co-opting or like you know forcing like government officials to cooperate with them they've essentially now become almost like symbiotic with various parts of the mexican state they've like taken over many parts of like mexican territory so like with isis right when like you know with like defeating of like the actual isis like physical territorial caliphate like that was easy right i mean it took many years and it actually took like bombings and like actual like many you know like military campaigns but that's not what's that's not that's not going to be the the process to get rid of mexican cartels because they are literally one in the same with the mexican state like during you know like coveted relief the mexican state was incapable of providing covert relief to like many to millions of mexican citizens that's what the cartel did right they provide schooling they provide electricity they provide food they fill the role of the state i mean that's the right so how do you separate where right like how do you separate one and the two like how do you square that circle yeah i mean there's and there's areas of mexico right that government's just not welcome in i mean i would assume there's a mexican city where the government's of the capital where the government cannot go geez and so like in the and you said in the meridian initiative there was a high spike in violence right because there was this the mexican government was actually fighting them um and i think people became war weary after that and does that explain why the current president um and i believe the last president as well just weren't that interested in um in really fighting well the issue with the last president it's more about the fact that he and his party officials were just exceptionally corrupt right like the pre um and many pre-officials like pre-governors were um arrested for colluding with you know the narcos um and so this this president essentially he's the first third-party candidate third-party president rather in mexico's history to be elected because he's you know just a populist nationalist figure and he just you know rejected he's rejecting everything of his predecessors right and yes i think there is it's definitely a combination of war weariness like people are just like battle fatigue they want an end to the violence and you know that's understandable right you want an end to the violence but at the same time an end to the violence doesn't necessarily mean uh allowing the cartels to to continue you know running a mock in the country right like it doesn't mean like the president literally meets with el chapo's mother he also ordered the release of ovidio lopez which is the el chapo sun like in the middle of a raid when the police were going after him he's like well you know what the sinaloa cartel is just you know let's just let let's let him go is that the current president or the last one the current president there was i'll i'll send you this video it's absolutely it's horrific in the middle of a raid as they're trying to capture him with the united states as an active extradition warrant out for him they let him go just as the sinaloa cartel is attacking the military attacking civilians in this operation they let the guy go yeah so that's not good i mean it's um it it's really hard to say or hard to see how how mexico gets out of this um and you know especially there has to be first first thing there has to be a desire on the part of the government to to to take that battle to them um that battle has cost and it seems like they just have zero desire to to meet those costs that's that's absolutely it right like the the reason why plan colombia was so successful and we can argue whether you know there's definitely some shortcomings and there's definitely you know areas of improvement that are required in colombia right now but the reason why planned colombia was so successful was because of the political will on behalf of the colombians and the continued political will that the colombians continue to demonstrate to this day decades later that is not something that is that the mexican government that many mexican administrations demonstrate yeah it's almost like a cultural desire to to be independent and free and um maintain some sense of security and uh look i never lived in mexico um but i i you could see that in uh in the colombian culture and and it's hard to explain but there's but culture matters quite a bit um explain how how would the drug have the drug cartels adapted to take advantage of of the border crisis well so one big thing that's now that you know cpb is reporting and other reporters who've gone down there have you know relayed back is this new um process of putting wristbands on migrants right to show that migrants have um paid the like the local like blasa attacks so if a migrant have a migrant is going from one particular area to the next they've you know put a wristband on a migrant to say like hey you've paid this cartel or this local gang's tax you don't owe anybody anything or if you're still conti if you if you still have an outstanding debt it'll have a particular symbol like everything is like color-coded and has a symbol right so if i mean it's it's incredibly innovative i mean and this just goes back to how these guys are not just criminals right and this has been just a failure on like you know mexican policy and u.s policy to continue to treat these guys like criminals these are business enterprises yeah and that's what people don't realize i mean when i was down with border patrol they charged about 300 per per migrant to cross that river and uh it doesn't seem like anybody gets across without going through the cartels and this is super low risk for them um that zero risk actually because i mean they just they just take the money in and they point go that way um you're not losing any drugs in the process uh and in fact it helps you smuggle drugs because now border patrol is tied up and uh not looking for you um you know at that uh at that break in the wall where were you where you're sending your drug or your drug smugglers through absolutely and then different nationalities get charged different prices right because central americans get charged a different price right chinese arabs if you're from like a different if you're from a different region you will get charged a higher premium okay i didn't know that so i mean they you know we did the math and 100 000 people going across a month 30 million dollars for the drug cartels so it makes sense that they're fighting for and they are they're they're warring for these process you know plus this being basically like a crossing point i guess um is that's how i understand it is a particular piece of territory right and that could either be a crossing point or whatever but a plaza is a territory yeah um yeah the border patrol says like you know they hear small arms fire across the border where where these guys are just gunning it out um because there's a that's a very lucrative business um okay and as far as um is keeping keeping with the immigration crisis how do these governments feel about it um we've heard from the mexican presidents from the salvador president that look they're not a fan of thousands and thousands of people coming through their country or leaving their country uh it seems like our interests are aligned on this and that's what the trump administration figured out uh with the mpp protocols uh which is the remaining mexico policy in the asylum cooperation agreements with the northern triangle countries i mean so how did their interests align with ours sure so i think with each country it's completely different right so like with the mexican government the mexican the the mexican president is not a fan of having so many central americans traveling through their country and then going to the united states right because frankly mexican polling within mexico over 60 percent of mexicans are not a fan of the migration crisis simply because of the drain on resources and particularly within the northern region it just it's such an impediment to to commerce up there it just it's not it's it's it's not something that they're that they welcome right and within within guatemala i mean there's always been within central america frankly remittances are a significant percentage of each country's gdp right every country relies on it for about 12 to 15 percentage remittances account for about 12 to 15 of their gross domestic product like let's be 100 honest and so they rely on people living like what they call english whether it's in the united states or whatever to send money back home to relatives what the trump administration did was they changed the calculus and they said look we are going to apply essentially so much political pressure to you guys that that money is just not going to make it palatable palatable enough for you that you're just going to continue allowing the outflow of people and so you now have leaders actually willing to kind of be more vocal and say look we need to stop this right we need to increase our border kind of increase border security we need to like start going after these human smuggling networks and so you've seen more more of that strong leadership coming out of guatemala and el salvador i would say i'd say these two have been more proactive in that i haven't seen that much honestly from from the honduran government and i think honestly the honduran government is more preoccupied with the president of honduras frankly is an unindicted co-conspirator in his brother's drug trafficking case the brother was recently he is he was recently convicted of trafficking cocaine in the united states and there's now another trial going on of another honduran drug trafficker who has pointed significantly to the president of honduras allowing for massive cocaine trafficking of taking money for cocaine trafficking and so there's interests that are aligning here but now you have the binding administration criticizing these guys for being you know for permitting corruption and not wanting to work with them right so it's like we need to find ways of aligning our interests and also collaborating as well even when we disagree on certain issues and that's just something that the the biden administration folks are just being a bit too activist and not and kind of you know pushing away and kind of like pushing these leaders away yeah and there's this uh what i would call a childish reactionary um tendency to just if trump did it it must be bad which is just a deeply stupid policy agenda um and i you can see signs quietly of the body administration saying okay we're gonna we're gonna have some agreements with mexico now okay fine just call it something different if you want but just please do the same thing because it seemed to be working um on you know look i i started off the podcast saying we have an interest in these countries being flourishing places that people want to go visit that would be great for america um if if uh if if mexico was at peace and the drug cartels were gone if there were plenty of jobs to be had uh in the northern triangle countries this would all be good so you know we did pass some legislation to that effect last congress um what are some create i mean besides just throwing money at the problem which doesn't seem to work and corrupt governments you know what's uh what is a what is a some creative ways that we could look at to encourage development there sure so i mean i think it needs to start one i i hate this approach of when it particularly when it comes to central america to the northern triangle at looking at the read and looking at these countries as a region each country is so individually unique and so just has its own individual level of political will of human capital of economic development potentials we need to look at everybody individually right so like el salvador you have this like new young president who really wants to collaborate and work with the united states right you have in guatemala president who's all about sovereignty and who really wants to work on border security issues and in honduras again you have a president who's ensnared and all these like drug trafficking you know allegations so there's significant limitations there one i think we need to start talking about how do you have the region how do you have each country's private sector start working with them to have them start reinvesting capital back into their countries because many of them are just looking elsewhere because they're not looking they just don't they don't want to invest in their countries right they're not safe they're not secure like financially it's just it's not a good bet for them and there is a lot of money that that these individuals just have a lot of money two electricity is exceptionally expensive in this region incredibly expensive how do you turn these countries into big manufacturing hubs if you can't manufacture things at a competitive rate you simply can't yeah why is it so expensive because the infrastructure just isn't there no it's just it's not right i mean these are just these are poor on these are very poor undeveloped countries and the electricity is very it's expensive right and so you have the biden administration now saying well we want to reward countries who adopt green energy mandates and it's like you have people who are still cooking by coal outside because they can't afford to heat and power their homes you want them to adopt these absurdly expensive solar-powered projects you're insane you now have guiana who potentially has more oil more more oil and petroleum than like venezuela and yet you're pushing everybody towards green energy when guiana could be a game changer for latin america start working with guiana guiana could potentially help power the caribbean and central america and then help capitalize like we have a free trade agreement with all of central america and the dominican republic have to dr central america could be a manufacturing hub right people could actually stay in countries exactly instead of china instead of buying all this you know third rate material from china manufactured in central america like there's just so much that can be done and we're just not taking advantage of it because of all this politicized nonsense yeah yeah i mean that seems to be about right like it's security and infrastructure that that's what that's the base that any society needs um you know the security part's difficult um like look we i i was a seal based in san diego and um in the mid 2000s when violence was really bad in tijuana we would we would kind of joke to ourselves it's like look we're deploying across the world to go fight bad guys but like these there's guys in tijuana that are a far bigger threat to the united states um we clean that up pretty quickly uh with you know with with our capabilities but um you know that of course requires an agreement with the mexican government and the mexican government has never been willing to to deliver that kind of cooperation now they they kind of used it it's gone up and down as far as it's mostly related to intelligence cooperation and training but never have americans really taken the fight to the drug cartels um and that's at the mexican that's that's the mexican's choice um that's not going to change it doesn't appear to me it ever will um they don't want the gringos fighting on their soil fine um so it's difficult is my point to fix the security problem for them but um but yeah we have to be looking at infrastructure energy like energy poverty is a big deal uh the left's always talking about environmental justice and they they make up these bs claims like the reason people are leaving is because of climate change as if there's ever been a drought ever no i mean come on you know look they're leaving because of energy and energy injustice and they don't talk about energy injustice enough uh that's that's what poor people actually need you know the left is just very out of touch on this on that particular subject it's it's very frustrating i've heard also good ideas from um i think is the bush institute talking about uh enhancing infrastructure in the telecom networks and and and helping helping these people kind of build their own gig economy right when there's no economy allow people to connect with each other and basically create a gig economy this has helped millions of americans as well um the left hates it because they're not part of labor unions and it means you own your own labor and can sell your own labor at your own leisure um god forbid but but you know that's a great way for people to to enhance their own well-being as well i would think um i want to move on to obrador so andres manuel lopez obrador that that's why they call him amlo um amlo um who is this guy everybody is confused about who this guy is i i'm not an expert on him they say he's like a populist but also a socialist internationalist okay i mean i i you can you can kind of be all those things at once um but like sorry you know like what is he what are his goals so he is an ultra ultra nationalist i mean i i think i can understand why people would think he's a socialist just because he is so you know active with like helping mexico's indigenous and helping you know rule mexicans but it's all just done to empower himself politically right so amlo is the perpetual mexican presidential candidate he's run for president many many times and finally he was elected in 2018 right and this was the year when he essentially turned mexican politics upside down and destroyed the two-party system so he's you know the third part he's he's now essentially rebranded mexican politics after himself right so anybody who thinks that he's a socialist should look at his entire party platform he's defunded and like destroyed any sort of green energy movement right like he is now making hydrocarbons and mexico's national energy sector right particularly mexico's national oil company pemex his baby like he is using this to solidify his political legacy and his political party so pamex under the previous administration was liberalizing and opening it up to foreign investments particularly american companies like companies in texas arizona and whatnot and they had all you know they had all in entered in in energy deals with pemex these deals have now essentially pretty much they yeah he's just canceled notified them many of them will potentially not even be reimbursed right because he passed all these new laws he's governing by referendum imagining if like imagine if you entered to like a billion dollar deal and all of a sudden amlo tells the local villagers hey guys you know what i want you guys to vote if you want the future of this deal to exist and if the villagers say no the deal is all of a sudden cancelled it sounds pretty socialist so far no no nationalizing assets but it's not nationalizing the assets it's essentially nullifying the deal because he wants the national oil company to work on his behalf he is an ultra authoritarian absolute hardcore authoritarian sound socialist because that's what he wants to come off to to his to his base but it's completely authoritarian nationalist and just a few months ago his party and his um his supporters in congress passed a law called the national security law which stripped dea of their immunity so now dea agents operating inside of mexico have no diplomatic immunity they have to report all of their activities and any sort of contact they have with mexican officials to an oversight board a mexican government oversight board um so essentially they have no privacy now right there is going to be no such thing as like so imagine that like imagine the amount of corruption that could potentially happen to any sort of dea investigations yeah i mean well i when i hear that i just think dea investigations stop um there's as an american there's no way just because you know we would never operate as military in another country without a sofa agreement which is a status of forces agreement which gives us that kind of immunity there's no way we just don't do anything because there's no way we're going to risk being thrown into a mexican jail so that's unfortunate that that's bad it obviously makes that um that uh security cooperation uh pretty difficult um i imagine it's not good for the oil industry either uh when you just when you just eliminate all foreign investment into your industry it kind of kind of sounds like what was happening in venezuela to to a to a degree but it's it's a bit different because now what he's done is he's put the military in charge of creating a new refinery because his idea is he's going to create he's going to make mexican oil great again right like he's wants mexican oil to be the backbone of the mexican economy and he wants that to resuscitate the the he wants it to resuscitate essentially mexico's um you know and he calls it the fourth the fourth transformation and and that's it's it's absolutely ludicrous you feel like you're you've walked into like a time machine every time you hear this man speak um but he's like a 1970s nationalist yeah there's a term for uh for latin american politicians that sort of fit this mold what what is it it's like yeah yeah and yeah yeah he's like yeah he's a latin american strong man absolutely no he's targeting canadian mining companies he's targeting he's going across the food and beverage sector so anyone who essentially disagrees with him he's going after them it looks like it's like from a leftist bent but i mean he's he's gone after school funding he's mexico has passed one of uh the one of essentially the mo the the industrialized world's world um smallest uh stim coveted stimulus bills so you know companies and even like just private individuals have essentially received nothing from the state in terms of assistance right because think about it this would have been hugo chavez like he would have given the people money like bolsonaro gave people significantly far more money yeah but so he's not actually a redistributionist not at all not a reduced no but he kind of ran on that didn't he to to a degree yes but he he ran on how can i give power to political power to the people and take it away from the mom but the way he plans on doing that is is less of a redistributionist policy and more and less of a welfare policy and more of a i'm going to keep the the gringos out out exactly yes it's more of a pro-mexican sovereignty let's attack the you know the the the elites that have governed this country for so long and all the while it's the smoke and mirror show of taking advantage of the mexican people absolutely and all and and you know undermining their interests because it would be in their interest to collaborate with the united states to target the cartels it would be um well yeah so so how he's been in power since when couple years december 2018 he was sworn in and you know there must be some outcomes at this point based on these policies is it is it kind of more i mean you know how is mexico doing well i mean the economy is doing awful right like the economy last year contracted at about nine percent i mean it went into covid in a recession right so it was doing bad before before absolutely doing awful right it was it was doing completely awful and i mean it's going to continue doing awful um but their way of scrambling out of it is is to just target the private sector well latin america has a habit of this pattern i mean if you study latin american countries and politics it is it is like this and it's always the same pattern it's it goes from highly nationalistic caudillos to let's liberalize and and let the imf in and and liberalize our economy allow foreign direct investments and and then there's a populist backlash and then they go right back and um and maybe maybe this is a good transition point to colombia um again it's a kind of an odd success story i think chile might might be a success story as well maybe you'd agree with that um you know uh maybe maybe a couple others but let's focus on colombia because i know it and you know it and um look like i said i remember being there and um i've never even been to medellin or kali because we couldn't drive there and um you know and my parents just we just never took a vacation there but but now i could easily take a road trip between bogota and kali and i wouldn't get kidnapped so that's pretty cool um and uh and look there's just there's just a lot of great things about it i've watched bogota transform over the years um a lot of new companies investing there i'm look my school uh i was the only american there all four years and there's just not a lot of americans in colombia during that time again 98 to 2002. i went back a few years ago for my like 15-year reunion and um noticed that there was a lot more expats in my school um there's just so it's very clear that they've opened up um and they've they've consistently been open to the united states and and foreigners and just developing as a country so um it's it's it's it's a it's an interesting case study so what did colombia do do well i mean it seems like a good case study for for how to get this right sure i mean colombia is like one of latin america's greatest success stories right i mean it's like what you were talking about like columbia 5th 20-ish years ago it was literally on the brink of being a failed state i mean it was common in colombia for car bombs and shootings and kidnappings to occur even in the capital like there was a giant car bomb in a place that i frequented all the time uh yeah like this sort of like they call it a country club that wasn't anyway giant car exactly like my one of my my uncle is colombian right he had to leave colombia because of the violence like every person that i know that's colombia like my friend and his twin brother they were almost kidnapped like his brother was actually thrown into a van and then they actually managed to escape and they had to move to the united states everybody that i know that's from colombia just was impacted by the violence in some way shape or form colombia's ambassador to the united states pancho santos he was kidnapped by escobar and held for eight months i mean his story is is incredible like everybody that lived through the violence just experienced it in some way and now i was just in colombia i think the last time was maybe two-ish years ago and i brought my husband who is from northern maine so you can imagine what he just completely stands out he felt completely safe i mean we just you enjoy it because it's such a beautiful and amazing country it's completely transformed now i mean there are so the things that colombia got right right i mean you now have this amazing capable willing partner in the colombian government i i don't think the united states has a better ally in south america than the colombians there's just there's nobody that just truly understands america and that america understands the colombians just more that that relationship is just so symbiotic and amazing and in colombia again it's the security situation has significantly improved the collaboration between both partners has improved and more than that you now have the colombians in a situation where they're training regional militaries and and security forces and police and law enforcement you can't ask for a better partner than that right where they've taken the burden off of you and they're and they're doing your work for you i remember them telling i remember their ambassador explaining that to me at some point it's like you need to let us go and and help out with these security situations i mean they've got a great special forces called los manceros um that that seals and special forces have been training with for years and years and years sure and colombia's navy is the only navy really that is incredibly capable and experienced in dealing with both on both the the atlantic and on the pacific side because colombia has a massive you know has massive territory on both coasts yeah no that's right and help us understand like what is punk colombia you know is it just an aid program based an aid and cooperation program and you know kind of how did it work over the years sure so it was a security and it was a development assistance program right so it was it was just both sides it was just both the big thing to remember about playing columbia everybody thinks that it was mainly the united states just donating and doling out money and equipment and whatnot the colombians put forth 95 of the assistance so the united states put donated upwards about 11 billion dollars the colombians put that was five percent of plain colombia the colombians put 95 right they they paid the majority of it and the other thing to remember is the colombians and what they didn't pay for in cash they put forth in colombian lives like the amount of colombian soldiers and police when policemen that died were in the thousands so right i mean the sacrifice that they made to secure their country is very significant it's important for people to who don't know like we're not really talking in the 90s we're really talking about drug cartels in colombia and everybody should watch narcos it's a great show a fantastic show it's obviously filmed in colombia i believe in medellin um uh about half the actors are genuinely colombian actors you can tell by the accent and uh it's just it's a really cool show that he's brazilian his accent got better over time his accent got better throughout the show i thought which was interesting you can easily tell which ones are colombian which ones aren't um but it's it's still a really good show i think um and uh i haven't watched the mexican version of narcos uh is that is that that's pretty good too just it's interesting how it helps it helps us understand the transition of like how all this happened but it's important to understand so that's the 90s and because there's there's two there's a few big things going on in colombia the drug cartels and which is the gorillas um not like you know animal gorillas uh the other kind of gorilla and um there's a bunch of different kinds there's uh like my memory just serves me a land there's the farc uh the farc was the big one there's that auc is that one of us auc yeah yes paramilitary yep and and like they're all these weird factions like the farc is like communists okay they're like a communist faction and then like maybe it was eln maybe you can explain but el nra you see they came up to counter them but then they all got involved in the drug trade somehow because that's how they fund themselves and then it was because the cartels sort of lost power these guys took it over because when i was living there the big thing was that was the gorillas it was not the cartels the cartels and gorillas were one of the same basically in the early 2000s when i was there that's who was gonna kidnap you that's how they got a lot of their money um the business was kidnapping and so um it's just anyway i just bring that up because people should understand like what we're talking about and so you know you think of cartels in mexico you're thinking of people in like plain clothes they're sort of like you said embedded in the population in many ways you know they're like a gangsters they're like thugs in colombia you need to envision something different these are people with military style equipment they're in uniforms they have a rank structure they have a general they have kernels it's a very different situation they live out in the jungles and they're moving from base to base constantly it's it's a just a fascinating dynamic that people i just want to paint that picture for people no no i absolutely right so yeah so you have fork eln and euc right so farc has now been demobilized because of a peace agreement that was passed and that they that they've signed on to and that was passed a few years ago eln wasn't was in peace talks with the colombian government but um eln um bombed uh colombian uh police force and in bogota about two-ish years ago it ended up um wounding about 80 some odd police officers and the colombian government government called off the police talks uh and so the auc were the paramilitaries right they were the ones who were just going after the farc and they also were involved in the drug trade and the auc not so good right you would think oh yeah these guys are great they're going after the the farc and you know they're going up to the terrorists problem is they would also go after villagers and farmers and whatnot who lived in fart controlled territory because they would just not like the fact that like they lived in part controlled territory right they would go after like you know for like store owners and things like that who didn't fight the fork because they just thought well why aren't you combating why aren't you joining us in this effort yeah and so you're completely right about the about you know for kidnapping people like i mean the amount of people kidnapped by farc was just was astronomical it was it was an absolutely horrific period and like the way that they would they were an actual like military force i mean they they were there was a command structure and they just moved in a way that was and they operate in a way that that was just i mean there's there's i think for the folks who speak spanish i would recommend there's this awesome i mean it's a great show on on netflix called la nina and it's about this one um child uh child soldier who was recruited by the farc and it's her attempt to like reintegrate back into colombian society because that's also one horrible thing the farc uh recruited many tens of thousands of child soldiers and that's now a big process right it's how do you reintegrate these child soldiers like back into colombian society yeah how do you think during this go the last last subject we'll we'll broaden it a little bit and wrap it up but uh you know my experience with um the latino population is that they're extremely skeptical of our intervention there's a long memory of of painful interventions by the united states and uh like some of that's warranted some of it's not i think it depends on how you interpret history uh but nevertheless that that skepticism i think may have prevented um the degree of cooperation that would be needed in so many countries um and and you know how do we fix that i mean i you know what what should we be doing what would you recommend if you were sitting on biden's cabinet um on how we should approach this and where or what's the first step just generally in the region so if i was sitting on biden's cabinet but also if i was like working in congress and just advising everybody just writ large engagement shouldn't be selective engagement needs to be consistent you're not you shouldn't just be there in the bad times and you shouldn't just be there in the good times you should be there all the time and that's why i think that there's so much skepticism and cynicism when it comes to the united states because the idea the the perspe the perception in the region is like well you're only here to tell us not to adopt huawei technology because it suits your interests you're only here to tell us you know to maintain diplomatic relations with taiwan because obviously you're in a battle with china or you're this or you're that or whatever but where were you last year when you know it was our 200th anniversary of independence you know you guys sent a low-level you know diplomat it's that sort of for in latin america these sorts of things matter right it's the persistent engagement and the persistent presence of the united states that like folks need to see that that i think would endear them more to like the hard asks from america and like the hard you know request and like the politically sensitive requests because we have to remember they also have political constituencies as well that aren't necessarily so uh sophisticated that would make it much easier for them to be like hey well you know what i know i'm doing this hard you know this this really unpopular thing for the united states but the gringos like they're our friends and like look they're always here in america they i mean they're always here in our city they enjoy our food and so this is why we're working with them that makes a lot of sense people need to understand latino culture a little bit better um you might americans like to get into business like i like to get to business i don't i don't want to do a whole lot of other thing i want to just let's just that's not how it works there um and it's uh it's not how it works in the middle east either like you just i've got a man i remember conversations i've had uh in an iraqi police station just hours and hours and hours and what i got out of it would be like we could have gotten in five minutes um you know but you just got it you just gotta be there and smoke cigarettes with them um and it's you know it's it's the same like business relationships and and latino culture like yeah they they want to be personal they and you know it makes sense and that's that's the way to overcome skepticism and then get to the policy and there's probably a lot of overlap on on good policy you would you would think um you know it's like how like look if mexico can pull off creating an energy industry for themselves that's great and pull people out of energy poverty throughout mexico and central america great i don't care how you do it um but i have an interest in that happening and you know we need to make that clear to them you know how they do it i don't know but i'm sure and i mean look the vast majority of latin america is deeply socially conservative the fact that when indeed that when people from latin america come to the united states and automatically think that they are liberal just because the democratic party makes them feel good should be such a slap in the face to conservatives to for them to know that they are making a huge mistake here that they are just turning people that it's it's a tone issue right and it's just i think i mean i i don't know i think that this this just goes i guess to other issues i guess more of like outside of the foreign policy realm as well but also it kind of lends itself to it i think there just kind of needs to be like a reassessment and a recalibration it's like how do you approach these countries and also how do you approach the individuals that come from these countries into the united states as well and it's not about this whole identity politics nonsense completely you know ignore and avoid and reject that but it's also understand that culturally everybody is different and you're going to have to kind of you know change and adjust yeah there's there's all yeah politically speaking there's a lot of ground to gain in the latino community as uh as as democrats are totally losing people by by talking about latinx you know everybody's like what the hell is latinx you know it should be pretty easy to win people over they don't like identity politics another question i have for you is like if puerto rico was a state um tomorrow do you really you know there's this belief that they would just vote for democrat senators i actually think we the republicans could win in puerto rico that's my thoughts puerto rico has had republican governors i i i think this idea of resigning yourself to defeat i've never seen i don't understand when republicans became so defeatist i i don't understand that so just no i mean look again latinos are inherently socially conservative so just start from that point yeah in culture in deeper ways it's not just the abortion issue it's like it's like personal responsibility i mean the fundamental aspect of conservatism um in americanism frankly frankly western civilization this sort of individualistic idea that you must be morally and and culturally and personally responsible uh you know that it seems like it's a deeply embedded thing um in in the culture so you know i find that to be the case uh for sure um anna that was a good uh just just under an hour um i think we i think we learned a lot i really appreciate you uh to being on nope this is great thank you

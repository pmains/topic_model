and thanks very much for holding today's markup of these two important bills that will improve our public and private retirement systems the Social Security online tools innovation Act is intended to help Social Security disability beneficiaries who are interested in trying to go back to work the bill would direct the Social Security Administration to publish a calculator tool on its website that would help beneficiaries understand how earnings would affect their Social Security benefit amount and eligibility the second bill the SAV Community Newspapers Act would provide pension funding relief for a number of Community Newspaper plan sponsors this bill provides the struggling employers with some wiggle room allowing them to contribute less money to their pension plans each year and that means maintaining jobs and strengthening their businesses while at the same time maintaining their pension plans and on another front I know that we're all concerned about what is happening given tariffs and newsprint costs for community newspapers across the country and how important it is to address that issue as well I'm pleased to support both of these bills today and I thank the chairman for bringing them up it's imperative that we do much more to address our current retirement crisis than simply acting on these two bills today our country is in the midst of a crisis as I've noted a moment ago when nearly half of the American private sector employs roughly 55 million people work for an employer that does not offer a retirement plan most of these workers are employed by small businesses the fastest growing segment of our economy too many workers in this nation reach retirement age without the savings they need we have to make saving easier and do more to encourage workers to begin saving earlier I have a number of bills that would do just that my automatic retirement plan Act would provide a savings opportunity at work for approximately 30 million American workers I've introduced the retirement plan simplification and Enhancement Act which includes a number of common-sense reforms to simplify enhance our retirement rules now there a number of other members on this committee also have retirement bills that would help to address the retirement crisis for example mr. kind and mr. Kelly have introduced recent that would encourage middle-class families to save more despite partisan bill enjoys the support of both industry and a Arpi it also be remiss if I didn't highlight the multi-employer pensions which are definitely in crisis 10 million Americans participate in multi-employer pension plans and about 1.5 million of them are implants that are quickly running out of money these are American workers who planned for their retirement people who year after year chose to contribute to their pensions instead of taking an increase in their hourly wage then after working for 30 plus years their planned retirement could be taken away from them and taking it away at a time when they no longer have time to prepare for retirement because they're now in retirement it's critical that we address this crisis and help these Americans whose retirements are at risk through no fault of their own or no fault of the employer I must add as well in conclusion I'm pleased that the Chairman has brought up these two bills today I hope that there is an opportunity for us to further enhance retirement savings we need to come together on a bipartisan basis to really address the retirement crisis and I hope and expect that the Chairman will do just that Thank You mr. Neal

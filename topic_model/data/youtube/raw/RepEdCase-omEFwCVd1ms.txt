um that recording thing you just got i'm recording this uh just to let you all know um we're recording this because i use i i sometimes use it in my social media as well as on olo i i do uh regular shows on allele and share what i'm up to with with folks so i hope that's okay with all of you so if you if you guard your comments on that basis i don't happen to do that but um um that's a notification to everybody that that's what we're doing uh that that will be the the use of we're not sure we're gonna do it but uh usually i just have to i like to have the raw material so that i can do it if i if i want to i think this is something that the public would be interested in or at least all right um why don't we go ahead um so again good morning and i really fond aloha to everybody i want to thank each and all of you up front for participating in this my my inaugural renewable energy round table i have talked with most of you from time to time individually on aspects of energy in hawaii and in our country and renewable energy in particular uh but for me this is an opportunity to gather everybody together and just have kind of a group discussion uh to catch up to compare notes um there are a lot of purposes that i want to make out of this particular round table and and i hope it's valuable to you as well i already mentioned that i'm recording this for olelo and other purposes um i want to introduce the people on my staff that many of you have interacted with i've got wisdom matsuzaki here who is an assistant in my dc office wisdom is uh is from hawaii and uh is is captured in the dc environment for for for a while at least uh uh matthew bernard there is a navy lieutenant uh who is a department of defense fellow assigned to my office i take fellas into my office to to foster the relationship between congress and the military and so lieutenant bernard who who flies helicopters off of aircraft carriers for living and spending a year in my office and learning all about renewable energy so those are the folks from from my office on the phone i want to extend some special mahalos before i do some introductory remarks uh first of all senator glenn mckay and representative nicole lowen who chair the state senate and house committees with jurisdiction over renewable energy i really appreciate your participation and leadership at the state level and creating really an incredible foundation that many people across the country and the world that look up to and i and i appreciate your partnership uh here uh i wanna especially thank the hawaii state energy office uh kirsten turner is on the phone for the energy office for your participation today and and you um have really helped me to put this round table together uh we appreciate that uh as well as just been really indispensable in terms of my own uh needs and requests for information and and taking suggestions uh in congress especially on my appropriations committee which i'll get into i appreciate your partnership um and finally uh somebody that we all know dr richard roschelow who is presenting today for all of your incredible uh years of service at the uh manoa as well as the natural energy institute really appreciate that and then we have many uh members of the renewable energy industry and other state officials and county officials that joining us uh together and i really appreciate your collective experience and and hope that we all benefit from your insights today as we chart the next generation of our own renewable energy future um big picture of course our hawaii clean energy initiative and our goal of reaching 100 renewable by 2045 is is the first for the united states remains that and is really the gold standard throughout our throughout our country i was i was on the phone yesterday with the consular corps of hawaii who are the representatives of many foreign countries that that are stationed here in hawaii and this particular issue came up that what he was leading in this area much interest in in what we are doing and i think that's a good sign obviously we've come a long way since uh 2008 when we set out that standard we're up to what 30 percent and now and as we all know some islands on some days are close to or at 100 for uh brief periods of time which is really quite an accomplishment a lot of people contributed to this over time we all have the responsibility to take those contributions forward and and get there and i think we all know that there's a lot of work still to be done for me what this round table that roundtable is all about is a couple of different purposes first of all as your federal representative in congress my goal is to understand exactly what your perspectives are as to renewable energy in hawaii and and try to refine the areas where i can contribute to your efforts in washington dc so that's my kuliana is the federal government you've got the state government the county government the the educational system the the industry where i fit into that is at your federal government level which does have a major role in all of this either through federal programs federal regulations federal policy but federal spending in particular um and so one of my subsets here is to make sure that i'm on the right track in terms of my my appropriations uh contributions here where our federal government spends a great deal of money in in renewable energy um that is on a yearly cycle um and uh this is um even though we haven't settled fiscal year 2022 yet which is about to start on october 1st i'm already working on fiscal year 2023 because by the beginning of next year i will be fully into the appropriations process for fy 2023 so it's a long lead time and the better organized i am and the better partnerships and and relationships i've developed with you the better uh the product is going to be so that's my my first goal here and my second goal here is is simply to kind of sit back and and and try to listen to where you all are and what your questions are uh so that i can again um figure out ways that i can contribute other than strictly through appropriations um so that's my my general uh goal here um i certainly want to answer your questions and there's time for us to um do that um so after a few introductory remarks i'll just lay out some big picture items on my on my side of things uh we're going to hear from the hawaii state energy office about the progress of the hawaii clean energy initiative we're going to hear from representative lowen as to the state legislatures at work and dr rashfo will give us some updates from the hawaii natural energy institute um i think uh and then of course i want to leave plenty of time for questions and and observations and discussion and we hope to have a good solid product by the end of an hour and a half to two hours um a couple of big picture comments about uh where i fit in and where congress fits in here there are uh three major areas that are that are front and center immediately as in the next couple of weeks as a matter of fact very intense time for congress number one is our federal appropriations process uh number two um is the one point uh the one trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure package and i'll get into that and then number three is uh what is often referred to as the 3.5 trillion dollar reconciliation bill i'll try to get i'll try to give you some updates and where this all might fit into that and then go to your questions so let's start with appropriations these are the annual appropriations out of our federal government about 1.5 trillion dollars all all discretionary funding by the federal government every year so discretionary means we actually do fund it every year and make decisions on where that money is going to go to distinguish it from non-discretionary which would be funding that that will flow automatically for example social security benefits veterans benefits which are large in and of themselves but the appropriations committee and the house and the and the appropriations committee in the senate run the annual appropriations process and i'm on the house appropriations committee and senator schatz is on senate appropriations so we we we routinely uh do tag team on this across across the hill and keep it very close contact uh with his office uh congressman kelly and senator hirono are fantastic on these issues as well they contribute on many of the authorizing committees to the to the policy side of the equation so it's a good solid team to take advantage of right now in this particular area in the appropriations area we fund in 12 separate bills that cover 12 separate areas of the government in categories so for example we have a department of defense appropriation bill a department of agriculture appropriation bill um a department of health and human services and etc foreign affairs um renewable energy enters into many more of these than you might expect for example the us department of agriculture runs renewable energy programs that are often overlooked in my estimation uh in terms of of the of the availability of federal funding here and so that's definitely an area for us to investigate if you're interested the department of defense runs a major renewable energy uh programs because the dod is interested from a strategic perspective in reducing its dependence on fossil fuels to to include primarily foreign fossil fuel sources that makes a lot of sense and so you will find a lot more activity uh in the dod on renewable energy and a lot more opportunities for federal funding um in the dod often in partnership with the state state governments and so you really find pockets of renewable energy funding whether it be r d or implementation throughout federal government and we can work with each and all of you on those potential pockets but clearly the the the big one in the room is is the department of energy the u.s department of energy which is funded together with water development so really the u.s army corps of engineers which has a little bit of a piece of renewable energy but but we're really focused here on the department of energy itself and on its programs um the department of energy this year in our fy 2022 appropriations bill was funded at 53 billion dollars which actually is one of the smaller departments that's a whole another story but nonetheless 53 billion to focus in these areas and to accelerate our own efforts is is is nothing to sneeze at and uh we should try uh wherever we can to to identify and access those programs for our own needs uh here in hawaii um there are a couple of areas um that are particularly relevant from from a clean energy perspective whether you want to do r d or or technology development or areas of renewable energy or green jobs uh obviously the climate crisis is front and center and in all of this but just for a little bit of a flavor of some of those areas our bill funds uh energy efficiency and renewable energy projects focusing on clean technologies at about 3.7 billion dollars we uh included in the bill about 10 million dollars for the energy transitions initiative which is focused very much on island and remote communities to develop resilient energy systems so that's that's funding that clearly if we can fund that program um we're going to have a good solid shot at that since it fits our it fits our profile and what we want to accomplish here we actually have a couple of projects already that are funded through this program uh one is an electrical infrastructure resiliency initiative uh here in honolulu and then we also have some alternative and autonomous mobility options on kauai but i think there are opportunities to to increase our participation in this funding program we have about 375 million dollars in the bill for weather weatherization assistance which is a significant increase over over funding for fy 21. um certainly we have opportunities to weatherize our older homes we often think about weatherization as a as a kind of a of a continental uh us uh thing but we're eligible for that money too and and that we should go out and try to access it we have 600 million for advanced research projects energy which is a significant increase as well and that's focused on uh rapidly uh developing technologies that are capable of significantly changing uh the energy sector so so so those shots so to speak and uh we certainly can't have a piece of that and then finally um just to mention one other area we have about 75 million specific to geothermal uh energy technology and the next generations of geothermal those are just a couple of areas in the department of energy bill just just to kind of indicate some of the areas that we can access clearly of course what we want to do is to identify all the programs that we can access to advance our own clean energy initiative and then to tap into them i i say all of this just to just uh you know not to get into the weeds on it necessarily but to to illustrate the availability and the need for us all to coordinate on on what these programs are and how how to get get to them in terms of the appropriations process just quickly my my office is already open uh to your requests uh for for specific appropriations um you will find that on my website at case.house.gov there is an appropriations page here actually i take it back i'm not sure if i actually have it up yet but i certainly will have it up uh shortly for fy23 and we will want to work with you along those lines but it's not too early for for you to contact us to start talking about some of these areas many of you are very astute already at how to work with your federal delegation uh towards appropriations uh requests and whether whether you already know what to do or kind of a beginner at it just just contact us and we'll try to work with you on it um let me talk about the bipartisan infrastructure package which is here in the wisdom has just posted the link to my page on appropriations requests which i guess it is up already for fy23 so my staff is ahead of me on that um let me talk about the bipartisan infrastructure package which is one of the two major initiatives out of president biden in terms of his build back better agenda this is what we refer to as physical infrastructure uh so more traditional infrastructure whether it be you know roads bridges uh you know water pipes harbors airports infrastructure as we usually think about it but with a much broader uh spin to it for example this bill has significant funding for for broadband which i think we would all agree is critical especially to our hawaii and has a role in clean energy for sure um but also um really to try to tackle our nation's um uh energy grid which is um in its own uh you know stage of um deterioration including here in hawaii so um this bill uh which we um are making every effort to bring to a vote in the u.s house it's already passed the senate if we pass it in the house it goes straight to the president it gets signed um we estimate that out of that one trillion dollars of infrastructure there would be somewhere in the range this is senator schatz's analysis of 2.3 billion dollars to hawaii for infrastructure related assistance from the federal government over a five-year period much of that would be eligible uh to to address uh and to supplement and to and to really boost um the clean energy initiative here in hawaii so my efforts are devoted to try to get that bill over the finish line we have a vote that's supposed to be held on september 27th and and i'm doing everything i can to make sure that that happens because i think it's important for us to get this done some of the areas that are particularly interesting to hawaii i think are are 73 billion dollars to update our nation's uh electricity grid um 7.5 billion dollars for low emissions buses and ferries and then 7.5 billion dollars for electrical vehicle charging stations um the electric grid would be the largest single investment by our federal government in clean energy transmission really in our history it also includes an interesting um initiative uh to create a specific uh grid development authority so really a federal coordination of the grid across the entire country and i think that could definitely help us here in hawaii i mean the buses are things that i think we can all understand as well um but the point of the point of the observation is that um this is really a once in a generation opportunity for us to to to you know add to what we're trying to accomplish here in in hawaii um and it is relatively discretionary uh so if we do pass that bill and if that money does start coming here it's definitely something that we need to be very very cognizant that this is not going to go on forever this is a one-time infusion in our in our infrastructure but also to make sure that our priority collective priorities are are devoted to the right purposes finally let me mention the reconciliation package which is the second part of president biden's initiative this is uh referred to as reconciliation because that is a very obscure process that can be used sparingly in congress only one maybe two times per year and the net effect of it is to bypass the senate filibuster uh so simple majorities in the house and the senate um and that bill is often called our social infrastructure bill which encompasses a number of social uh programs ranging from from you know the child care tax credit to to the extension of the affordable care act to to expansion of medicaid etc etc it is by no means a done deal it's going to be a very very difficult lift to get over get it over the finish line i think something will come over the finish line about what it's going to look like or when that's going to happen it's hard to guess right now one area that i think does impact us all specifically in terms of the reconciliation bill um is that it will likely at the end of the day include a huge investment in a variety of climate change related initiatives senator schatz as you all know is very much the leader of this in congress as the chair of the commission on climate change in the senate he's taking the lead on all of these areas again this would be in the range of hundreds of of billions of dollars the largest investment in climate change resiliency and other programs throughout our country and and that would be a major opportunity because like the bipartisan infrastructure bill it would it would accrue to the benefit of of of hawaii and i think we all need to distract that as well okay um i talked too long apologies for that i am going to conclude there and just say again i really appreciate your participation your partnership your your input i can really use your guidance and i will do whatever i can together with our other delegation members to advance our our mutual goals all right i am going to um i can take uh why don't i do this i'm just going to kind of go on the fly on the schedule here can i take one or two questions uh and then i want to move on to other presenters and then we will have time at the end to come back for questions so just raise your hand and i'll try to recognize you if you have any questions right now otherwise we can we can we can move along okay see i don't see any so i will um take that as an indication that we will move along um i am happy now to recognize the hawaii state energy office and kirsten turner who of course has a lot of familiarity as she's worked in in congress for for a while so it's always from my perspective it's always great to have you know folks of the satan county and local level that that have been in our congressional delegation or in congress because it's just easy to kind of cut to the chase on on what can be done from a from a federal perspective so kirsten um over to you thank you congressman case i appreciate it very much and particularly your collaboration um on so many levels over the years and i also want to thank our state legislators our representatives and senators that are here this morning because the collaboration has also been excellent this past session since i've been at the state energy office i have a lot to go through i'm going to talk very quickly and then i'm very uh open to questions at the end i'm going to try and set a stage for you and so i'm going to share some slides and if you'll bear with me for a second if you will let me know as soon as you can see the powerpoint can you see that i can see it great let me put it in sharing mode there we go okay um let me just begin by giving you a little overview of our mission because this is something that people forget is that our mission includes helping achieve a resilient decarbonized economy so it's a it's an economy-wide focus and it includes clean transportation as senator uh lee who's present is well aware so um i also want to share our priorities since the increased number of severe weather events and the pandemic that we've had to put much more of our resources into our number one priority which is energy assurance and resiliency and we have our head of that sector in the state energy office chris younkers is here with us and so he'll be happy to see this as our number one priority i just want to point out we also have community engagements and stakeholder engagement and data analytics that are a big focus because those all support the other priorities in our office and we can't get to every corner of the economy without reaching out to all of the stakeholders which means all energy consumers energy assurance and resiliency is our top priority and i just put some of the highlights here of the kinds of things that chris's outfit within our office is focusing on but most importantly is that we provide the energy emergency response function and so as part of that he's doing hazard mitigation securing independent critical energy infrastructure planning for critical community clusters and mapping potential renewable energy microgrids that is going to come in handy as we look at the overview of our economy you asked me to look to give an overview of the whole energy ecosystem and some of the facts and figures so the dbed data book just came out a few weeks ago and our staff is just beginning to update the hawaii facts and figures so those are not out yet that will be on our website we expect a better total energy ecosystem picture with 2010 2020 data but meanwhile on the left uh this diagram shows the breakdown of total energy sources including transportation with petroleum accounting for 84 and the right hand diagram i thought was interesting because it demonstrates that petroleum and coal made up the majority of all cargo imported into hawaii and the last figure we had was 2016 but you can see what an important part of our overall economy it is the energy ecosystem diagram i'm going to show you in a moment is corresponds with this barrel of oil and you'll see the the correlation in a second but i want you to focus on the fact that the majority of this barrel of oil is goes to transportation okay and if you look at the barrel of oil at the bottom of this diagram um this di sankey diagram that shows energy production and consumption in hawaii created by the lawrence livermore national lab it's i'm gonna show you as a means of orienting you i'm gonna click through some changes here because first of all transportation at the bottom uh to demonstrate that the orange portion of electricity goes up through the orange box at the top and uh let's move nuclear out which i've done and let's bring natural gas down to its size which i've done and you can see the transportation marine is divided between marine ground transportation makes up a whopping 27 percent and air a whopping 34 percent notice that uh bio energy is going mostly to transportation with some of the biomass that goes into electricity generation by this thin green line and energy used is on the right hand side so if you go from left to right you can see all the production sources the majority of the renewable energy is going into the electricity generation and the consumption is on the pink boxes on the right residential commercial industrial and transportation so those represent the energy used and the big gray bar is wasted energy does everybody see this okay yep okay so note that the lion's share of that oil is consumed by the transportation sector our renewable port standard renewable portfolio standard for electricity sales otherwise referred to as our 100 renewable energy goal and the pucs performance-based rate making docket just covers the electricity sector which you can see accounts for a smaller portion of our petroleum use our energy portfolio standard focuses on the consumption or demand side of our energy ecosystem so hawaii's goals focus on energy efficiency and electricity which we learned from the collapse of transportation demand during covid19 from the beginning is subsidized by the transportation sector so when when the jet flights stopped coming uh that huge portion of the barrel of oil on the bottom the demand for that collapsed uh the price of electricity went up because the uh i'm gonna let um chris and maria share and answer any questions you have with regard to that but it was a very interesting docket that went to the puc and maybe rick will cover some of that as well uh but it really was an eye-opener on how transportation subsidizes electricity for our economy so the other important uh element to focus on here is that coal energy ends in one year and will be replaced mainly by solar battery storage and fuel oil plus a little bit of electricity fuel oil for electricity and we also anticipate hydrogen as it comes online will come from various sources and have various uses electrification of transportation for passenger cars and trucks in our island flights and shipping will need to be fueled by all these renewable energy sources including renewable natural gas which hawaii gas is now producing from honolulu wastewater treatment plant methane larger vehicles um long-haul air let's see if i can get to that yeah um and marine will require renewable fuels bioenergy and or hydrogen and other innovations like perhaps direct air capture to fuel transportation perhaps more federal funding will be available through the infrastructure and jobs act particularly renewable aviation fuels so with that i want to talk about progress in these key errors let's look at first that hawaii state agencies electricity use in 2019 if you look at the top box on the right was 17 and a half percent less than it was in 2005 which was the baseline year 1.2 billion will be saved in electricity costs over the life of the contracts hseo has is the elected chair of the hawaii state building code council whose mission is to unify the state and county building codes and the updated international energy conservation code the iecc is um an effort to unify all of those codes and we want we the state building code council tries to look at that and update and make any amendments for hawaii and do that streamline between the state and the counties so the updated energy code is projected projected to the iecc the 2018 is projected to save rate payers 1.4 billion by 2040. and um our hawaii green business program that maria oversees maria tomei is also online here with us the manager of our eere branch the director of it um has worked with and that branch has worked with over 100 businesses organizations and events since 2004 and then last year's cohort saved over 1.1 million kilowatt hours and 91.6 million gallons of water as well other progress is in 2020 if you look at the electricity sales on the red box surpassed 36 from renewable energy that um 90 plus renewable projects are now operating 618 megawatts of renewable generating capacity this is going to be updated with the new uh energy facts and figures and then of course we have i'm sorry uh wrong way we have over uh 16 000 evs statewide and nearly 800 public ev charging ports so let's look at the energy efficiency for state buildings uh if you just look at the graph on the bottom you can see the tremendous progress on many of the state buildings we continue working with cohorts of state buildings to advance that and our renewable portfolio standard as you mentioned uh representative case kiuc is on average almost 68 and on some days 100 percent the heco companies wine electric i should say now is is averaging 34.5 percent rps so this shows the renewable electricity generation by source of the 36 electricity sales for renewable energy in 2020 distributed pv made up the lion's share followed by wind and utility scale pv shown with the orange line and geothermal as you can see dropped precipitously as a result of the volcano eruption on hawaii island but with the reopening of those wells that will be increasing again hydra will be increasing with kiuc's new west kauai pump storage hydro project and aes is in our group that's anticipated to meet more than 25 percent of the island's electricity needs moving hawaii beyond the 80 percent rps of renewable energy generation biofuels currently accounts as you can see on this diagram for only about a one percent of the renewable energy picture with pacific biodiesel supplying about 5 million gallons per year of fuel for wine electrics neighbor islands they also provide fuel for passenger vehicles and medium and heavy duty vehicle fleets for the city and county of honolulu including the bus as well as young brother at least one young brother's tugboat there's clearly great potential for diesel fuel switching with biodiesel with little cost differential at the pump so this shows us overall renewable energy generation in hawaii you can see here that distributed and utility scale pv accounts for 62 of all renewable energy energy generation in hawaii and the market as you see determines the lowest cost resource which also benefits the ratepayers uh biomass is mostly h-power that burns trash and the kauai green energy project that burns trees and its combustion plant in 2020 there was enough renewable electricity generated in hawaii to power the equivalent of all homes plus six percent of non electricity news so some of the renewable energy that's available from solar wind and geothermal facilities isn't shown here since it's wasted it's curtailed by the utility since there is no use for it at the time it's generated so as renewable generation increases the importance of using that curtailed energy will become even greater approaches such as the advanced rate design and smart grid performance incentive mechanisms and others are uh point demand response um and energy storage are and can be further demonstrated in hawaii with great effect and great benefits since our grids are small and not able to export excess electricity to other areas so enter any federal funding for that will be a model for the rest of the country and then finally i want to close out here almost with hawaiian electric stage 1 and stage 2 projects so as you can see the majority are on oahu some of these developers are in our round table thank you very much they're currently 20 projects anticipated statewide representing major editions of solar plus storage on every island uh stage one and two rfps for hawaiian electric included 950 megawatts um i'm not even going to go through this because a lot of this has changed but it's basically going to help move hawaiian electric from to about a 50 rps and higher on maui and hawaii island this includes um about 250 megawatts of what hawaiian electric refers to as shared solar or what is in the legislation has been referred to as community-based renewable energy as you know kiuc is going to move to over 80 renewable energy with its pump storage hydro project by 2025 and hawaii island could reach similar rps levels the governor formed the powering past cold task force which our chief energy officer leads to provide a common operating picture for all parties involved many of whom are on this roundtable including relevant state agencies and some other non-governmental stakeholders to to get a common operating picture of the overall progress to replace the electricity currently provided by oahu's coal plant it's proved to be an excellent forum to help everyone understand where we are where we're going and what some of the potential bottlenecks are and lastly uh here is a it just is moving on its own here's a picture in 2020 of where the total energy generation is the percent of rps and the cost per kilowatt hour and i'm going to be happy i'm happy to share these slides by the way and i just want to mention as i turn this over to representative lowen that we also provide clean transportation support and these are the three bills that are really going to advance electrification of transportation and our office has been providing back-of-the-house behind-the-scenes support to be able to help identify what some of the transportation goals should be and also one of some of the excused upon vehicles for helping with that transition and bringing aboard a data scientist in our office has really helped to be able to break down a lot of the information make it much more palatable and usable and shareable across agencies and the public sector to be able to understand ways in which we can transition more quickly and this is a great waffle diagram that shows each car represents 100 vehicles and this diagram enabled the implementation will enable the implementation of act 74 by helping state agencies see the number of vehicles they have in the fleet the age of the vehicles and when we can transition those out and then this also helped us work with the department of transportation to negotiate a vehicles as a service contract and identify what the cheapest way to go was for adopting uh uh electric vehicles for the state fleets and there's been a lot of controversy out there about teslas uh being rolled out from state agencies but those proved to be the lowest vehicle uh mile travel contract when you roll in the charging infrastructure the maintenance and everything so just wanted to give a shout out to that and i'll end there thank you thanks so much kirsten that's a lot to that's a lot to absorb incredible work um i'd love a copy of the slides myself uh to just kind of digest it all um a couple of uh maybe a few questions i'll just take the prerogative and ask a few questions well first of all i did want to recognize that we have other state legislative partners on the on the line or who are going to come in and out besides reploin and senator wakaya i saw representative marioshi martin um rep peruso and senators lee riviere and visa lucha i think i got everybody that i saw in one way shape or form i really thank you for your partnership as well um let's see kirsten so one one quick one and then one broader one um when you talked about um consumption of energy and you you air transportation is i think 34 if i'm not mistaken um was did that was that was that limited to inter-island air transportation or is that is that actually adding in all airlines uh all airlines okay so okay so obviously that changes the statistic pretty significantly if what we're dealing with is energy consumption inside the state itself um if we're if we're ruling out uh and i'm not saying we should i'm just trying to get my thinking straight on and if we're rolling out international fights in and national flights in then that's a little bit of a different uh profile for that right i mean it's still it's still a matter of converting out of fossil fuel-based airlines so i'm not i'm not getting it at that i'm just trying to get my facts straight there yeah um and then um okay so now that you've you know been on the congress side and you know what i've been talking about in terms of federal uh support federal funding um and and you're over on the state energy side now are there areas that you believe that we're just completely missing the vote on or that we need to pursue a little bit more on the federal support federal funding side where we have real solid shots at significant uh federal uh you know investments in our in in our efforts here well i would point out that one of the errors we need to invest more in is aviation renewable aviation fuels and that's a real potential and our legislators did propose an aviation fuel task force for hawaii in the last session we don't didn't have the bandwidth to be able to stand something like that up so of course we are always looking for more state energy program formula uh funding which we anticipate is going to come at this uh with the new budget um but the uh the opportunities are tremendous the technology is there what's needed is to get over that hump to commercialize to make aviation fuel uh more uh economically viable but it's been tested and proven and there are others uh particularly maria who could comment in more depth but um that i think is a missing element and that yeah this could be a great test case particularly because you mentioned inner island transportation and electrification i mean inter-island flights and electrification of inner island flights is already being demonstrated in hawaii i guess i'm just trying to translate that because renewable aviation fuel that's really a national international effort we would benefit from it here uh for sure i guess we could do some kind of a demonstration project in our island that might that we might be able to justify specific funding to hawaii for for that purpose and that's worth uh us looking at to my staff um i was more thinking about um i guess i was thinking about specific hawaii unique projects whether r d or i'm always looking for the the things that we can that we can best demonstrate in hawaii uh as a matter of not only our own uniqueness for example what i talked about earlier in terms of you know small island uh energy resiliency um you know use dependence or or for that matter uh you know niche areas that that um uh if we can mix and match federal programs so those niche areas it's pretty certain that we're going to get that funding there's tremendous opportunities for electrification of transportation and you know the drive electric hui in hawaii has and chris uh reads that up for our office ben sullivan who's on here is part of that as well okay um so that that is a tremendous opportunity particularly to ramp up the charging infrastructure and roll that in with the demand response and other initiatives that i mentioned with regard to the opportunities energy efficiencies yeah so there's a you can roll every department of the uh doe uh programs into that um but i would i would invite others to comment on that maria or ben or senator lee even i would just uh this is pressure wise data energy office i just reiterate a little bit of what was talking about here uh electric aviation essentially the you know kind of commuter flights between islands is something that's emerging uh and we're uniquely situated here uh in terms of some of the resiliency things that are going on in the various programs i'll say that you know islands and resiliency we are a great demonstration uh we've been working on building resilient infrastructure and communities the fema program and we've had some of the sort of microgrids going through there as well as resiliency hubs um one of the things we're working good with fema and i'm really glad that they've been open to looking at energy but um you know that's one thing that we're really trying to push over as no energy projects were funded out of bricks uh program last year and so we're looking at ways to highlight the benefits of kind of the underlying uh service of energy and how it kind of promotes all the lifelines and acts of the lifeblood for them so areas around that in terms of resiliency and how microgrids uh within the community can help that resiliency and get those projects funded uh would be also a particular interest thank you and noting that again the bipartisan infrastructure bill that we hope to get over the finish line on september 27th would definitely um fit very well with the electrification of transportation it could well be used we'd have to think about it it could well be used for the some of the demonstration stuff on inner island air transportation i would be remiss if i didn't also speak up for particularly hcat and hawaii island that are working for hydrogen infrastructure as well as hydrogen demonstration projects so i know hcat is looking for more funding to be able to move out some of its projects so okay thanks senator vr thank you um while we're talking about electrifying our transportation if if we talk about um just for example oahu's if we electrified every car if everybody was driving an ev and if right now on a daily usage we we have a maximum say of a thousand megawatts of energy is kind of the average high that we need at any given time how much electricity will we need to electrify all the cars on oahu what's the the demand is it doubled of what we produce now or is it fit somewhere in there i hope that i hope that was the curse and not me because yeah it's actually to chris um i don't i actually i'll put over to rick i don't know if an estimation has been done on the amount of electric demand that would be done in particular around aviation um ground no not on aviation i i want to talk about just on cars driving around this island if everybody cars in we're going to need a lot more electricity yeah and i think that that is a that's a very good point and i would say that electrification is one of the key tools that we do in decarbonizing ground transportation but we will need to do other things it's important that it's just one tool and we'll need to look at hydrogen biofuels mass transit and really lower the energy intensity i think is what we're getting at here in order to achieve our goals because we can't simply fuel switch and build our way to uh de-carbon transportation [Music] so if we if everybody switches to electric vehicles in the next 10 years or whatever is the forecast that they're going to be readily available we're going to need a lot of electricity and if our 100 renewable portfolio is 2045 um we're going to have to have not just right now we're 20 at this moment 20 clean energy on this island we're going to need a whole lot more and i just i just think that the this scaling is really important for a kind of a reality check on you know and i i think it's kind of excuse me but i think it's kind of bad we don't have any idea of how much electricity we're going to need to power the cars i think that's a really important question go ahead rick yeah i don't have the number the the total ground transportation is just about equivalent to the power sector right now so you can think of it essentially as a doubling but that's all all ground transportation i believe is a number and heco under their igp process integrated grid planning is going on is looking at a variety of scenarios to forecast how much ev penetration will be by what year and look what that additional demand is but the bottom line is it is significant and i actually have a slide at the back that of my talk that makes a couple of comments about it so we can get you those exact numbers it really depends on the scenario of the growth and also what happens in regard to continued efficiency on the grid and other changes but it it does move the numbers and it does move significantly what we need to put on our grids to achieve the decarbonization goals that we're trying to achieve so and i'll have one more slide at the end of my talk to address it but i agree it's it's it's a big number and it does need to be included in the discussion thank you and i if i may one one more part corollary to this is um i'm curious um a gallon of gas let's just say a gallon of gasoline can power a car for 40 miles just pick a number 35 i don't care what you use but say a gallon gets you 40 miles um what's the equivalency of because right now we're still 80 oil right and um on for powering a lot of a lot of stuff on this island at any given time so if 80 of our electricity is generated out of oil at the moment how many miles can i go on an equivalent of a gallon of gas if i have an electric car because that'll give us a perspective of how much electricity we need right if if your electric car is powered off of the grid uh and you assume it's oil i'm just assuming let's say i plug it in and just use whatever number you like i mean using whatever numbers we have now say 70 and 30 clean energy so 70 right now is of that electricity that's going into my ev is oil right so and it takes an effort to convert the oil into electricity i'm just curious you know if there was a gallon of gas one gallon of gas for the equivalence in oil would i go farther on an ev or on a combustible engine it it actually comes down to what type of combustible engine you have it 40 miles at 40 miles per gallon um depending what you and again i'm going to show one slide on this depending what you assume for what the renewable penetration on the grid is if it's an oil-fired electric car it's equivalent about a 32 mile per gallon vehicle when you count grid losses and what comes off the grid if you say that part of that grid is renewable then that number goes up but there are some other considerations in that and actually i will address it so if you're willing to hold that question it might be a good one to come back to at the end thank you thank you i just i really think this is a key element to the success of this program thank you very much yeah i know the short answer though is that on average even if you have a great 100 powered by fossil fuels that using that energy to charge an ev battery will on average still be more efficient and a 40 mile per gallon um internal combustion engine is not average okay um that's a great question senator i've wondered the same thing myself as we kind of charge so to speak down the road of um ev off the grid uh senator lee thanks um you know i wanted to uh and this is a perfect segue i think because i think to the discussion that was just taking place gil you had asked uh about you know if we convert every car to an electric vehicle and electrify the whole grid what does that look like and i think if we do that you know moving that direction is important but if we just do that we've sort of failed because it's the equivalent of trying to put batteries and pv on every single house without first doing efficiency and reducing our overall load and what we find in hawaii i think is that you know we unfortunately have the worst traffic we have the worst pedestrian fatalities we have one of the highest costs of transportation and we can do a lot in the way that we spend other portions of infrastructure funds on fixing that problem too to give people those alternatives so we don't have to convert just from cars to evs but rather from cars to more efficient modes of transportation altogether like pedestrian public transportation etc and so uh just making that transition i guess the question is uh to both the congressmen as well as um energy office and others you know is there um a piece of this discussion that we can sort of turn into an actionable set of whatever it is coming up you know with some of this rare opportunity we have to focus also on um as part of this question of reducing overall emissions and and achieving our renewable energy goals um reinvesting in our infrastructure that beyond just i think electrification in ways that more efficiently move people around so we can reduce that overall load and our folks willing to partner on that well yes from a federal perspective that's that's the point of of this discussion from for for me um and and i i would i would repeat that i think that um that if we are able to get uh the the infrastructure bill across the finish line there's gonna be a fair bit of discretion to how individual states pursue it and so a lot of those decisions i would hope and believe are going to be made by you all uh in terms of kind of where you want to take that that direction um i'm gonna i'm just gonna just for the interest of time i will go to rep mariachi and then and then we will go on thank you i just had a quick question and i'm sorry i had to step away to speak to hpd about a district issue so if you've gone over this my apologies but has there been any thought given to unifying the electrical grid between the islands uh you know i know oahu sucks up a lot of the energy need but a lot of the other a lot of the renewable energy opportunities at least the affordable ones are located on other islands where there's more space more land more wind what have you i'm wondering if how that would fit would factor in and whether we could get federal funding for that as well um i kind of feel like we've been to this rodeo before i'm trying to remember uh what the maybe noi uh remembers that she's she has institutional knowledge of congress that that's way before me i think we did try to contribute at the federal level to some efforts to to to just to support uh transmission of electricity between islands and uh didn't get there at the time i think that was a function of the economics of the proposal i personally haven't um heard anybody talk about kind of revisiting it i'd be willing to revisit it i still think that that you know inter-island connectivity is is is is one of the answers here but i don't i don't frankly know whether there are initiatives or whether it is realistic at this point and i think it would be hard to to muster the senatory no way style earmarks um that um it would take to to actually achieve that it could be that some of that infrastructure because again remember the infrastructure bill is supposed to be fairly discretionary but one of its key areas is electrical grid you know upgrades and so that would seem to fit into the category but i i don't think i'm not sure 2.3 billion even if you allocated all of it uh to that to that um would get you there but um it's it's definitely worth considering uh noah do you have any um uh you know institutional uh recollections on that uh the the studies on that pre where before i was there but there were studies that the delegation led uh largely through senator inouye's office and taking a look at the studies and the efficacy of the cables at that time um and then back uh in around 2008 2010 there was also another study on inner island cables but other than that i'm not sure um that there's been um additional studies okay i would certainly think about it i don't i don't i don't favor studying studying studying but this might be an appropriate one to revisit with with some of that money okay let's go on to um uh representative thank you so much and um go ahead uh thank you i some of this might be repetitive to some of the things we already talked about so i'll try to move through it pretty quickly um i have just like two slides um whoops where do i start my slideshow um just as kind of a cheat sheet and to give you guys something to look at um so pretty quickly i was asked to talk about you know what the legislature has done in recent years so i started um with 2020 which was you know a year where the session kind of got cut in half by kovid and then when we came back we were very limitedly focused to dealing with covid and karezak funding etc but we did pass act 23 this was the bill that prohibited newer renewed permits for coal power plants by 2023 and so that has been um uh not without its challenges i think for oahu to implement but with the leadership of the energy office we've been moving forward on discussing how to make sure that the renewable energy projects that are planned stay on schedule if they all stay on schedule and get implemented in time and come online then we should be okay to meet that goal 2021 i think a lot of our focus was surrounding clean transportation so thanks kristen for your presentation because now we don't have to explain why that is related to the energy question um but we did pass um act 74 or house bill 552 and this established um clean ground transportation goals for state vehicles to be 100 zero emissions for passenger cars by 2030 and 100 zero emissions for all light duty vehicles by 2035. this bill also updated uh procurement preferences for medium and heavy duty vehicles so that they would have a preference for zero emissions cleaner vehicles if or when those become more available and more cost effective and then we also included a requirement to right size the vehicles and the fleets or not requirement but a preference for that in procurement and the mechanism for accomplishing this is essentially that for all new vehicle acquisitions for state fleets beginning immediately for passenger cars they must be zero emission vehicles um and then beginning as soon as practicable but no later than 2030 for other light duty vehicles and there is a mechanism for an exemption etc but this uh you know has already been moving forward d.o.t has been a real leader and we think this is a real opportunity to actually save money for the state over the long term on fuel costs and especially on maintenance costs and because these vehicles once they're um procured like they last a lot longer so you don't need to replace them as quickly we also passed um house bill 1142 this year this was building on um a billy passed in 2019 that established rebates for ev charging systems uh that were available to publicly accessible areas so like commercial areas workplaces and multi-unit dwellings that was a pretty successful program but the funding got used up so this year we shifted three cents a barrel tax from you know other places it was going into a special fund that would be specifically set aside to fund this ev charging system rebates and i think this amount of funding that's going towards it will be a significant increase so there's a real opportunity to come back look at this next session and think about where we might expand where are the bigger needs i think multi-unit dwellings like how do we get easy charging availability into multi-unit dwellings is a challenge that we can spend more time on and the other piece of that i think we should talk about more is how to help transition our rental car companies and the visitor industry how do we get chargers at hotels and resorts or at tourist destinations as well as evs into rental car fleets um just really quickly these are just some other bills we passed uh house bill 1333 this directed hnei to study renewable energy product recycling or reuse we did pass a bill to provide grants for development development of sustainable aviation fuels but to be honest i think the level of investment that we need in this issue like the state doesn't have funds to invest in it at this level and this is somewhere we could really use help with from the federal government which i know was already discussed and then we passed another bill senate bill 932 to streamline the the gems in structure and authorize it for more clean transportation purposes and also actually some of these amendments allow for leveraging additional sources of funding so that could include federal dollars on the right side of this slide is just some bills that have come up or issues that we've worked on in multiple years that actually did not pass this year so we've talked um a lot about energy efficiency already house bill 550 which will be reintroduced as a new house bill next year would have uh mandated undertaking cost-effective energy efficiency measures for state facilities so the idea was the state would lead by example but this idea of building efficiency is a huge one for you know reaching higher efficiency goals in our energy systems um not just state buildings that's a good place to start and a good place to set an example but we need to do this for you know commercial and residential facilities also um house bill 116 this was appliance efficiency so we actually passed a bill in 2019 to establish the state's first appliance efficiency standards and this bill would have built on that it's not um uh it didn't pass but we can come back to it and this is actually also somewhere where you know there's there's supplies efficiency standards at the federal level those could be looked at and increased and then the last two i have on here um you know we had a bill that would have mandated uh rooftop solar for new residential construction and we you know multiple bills also looking at ev ready new construction so i think that the um discussion here for me is more surrounding the idea that when we build things in the present that are meant to last for the next 50 60 plus years we need to be thinking now about what those need to include to be able to work with our energy systems and transportation systems of the future and so you know those are always not without controversy because anything that adds cost to housing when we already have a housing crisis i mean it's a legitimate concern we have to think about but that could also be somewhere where you know federal incentives or tax credits could be helpful and actually i threw carbon tax on here as well just because we've had this discussion multiple years it's something that is advocated for by multiple um uh advocacy groups and you know i'm sure we'll continue to have a discussion about carbon tax as far as we can at the state level but you know realistically and of course again this can be highly controversial but you know realistically as a economic tool it would be a lot cleaner to have uh federal legislation not a state by state legislation on this level so um i made my next slide was just kind of a stream of consciousness brainstorming about how do i switch oh here we go um the most help might be able to come from um from our congressional delegation and so this is sort of what i what i thought of some of these we've already talked about uh one i think is maintaining existing renewable energy tax credits i don't think that now is the time to take those away um second we've talked about this a lot investing in clean transportation infrastructure ev charging electric buses um you know i've been thinking a lot about school buses because we have a huge school a school transportation problem in hawaii right now as well so that's something where funding could come in helpful if it was available investing in energy and water efficiency for buildings especially at the residential level this can also really be an equity issue where you know like you said the weatherization issue in hawaii is not as um you know it's not as much focused on as it is on the mainland but it is true like it you know as the summers do get hotter here as well and more people are running their air conditioning and causing more strain on the grid and you know those that are typically at the lower end of the income level have the least efficient you know window units and non-insulated louver windows and if there's you know weatherization investments that that can help people to um make their residences more efficient and save money that could be not only good for energy efficiency but also as a you know equity for for every one kind of a measure and then we talked about this a little investing in electric grid transmission to accommodate distributed resources microgrids and increased resilience as chris lee mentioned investing in public transit i think can't be overlooked we don't want to just replace every car in the road with an electric vehicle we already have traffic problems we already you know want to take the excess pressure off the grid um and then i added here ensuring that whatever traditional infrastructure investments are are included in any infrastructure bill that passes that it might be helpful if there were stipulations on those funds that that new projects were built keeping in mind you know climate issues increased temperatures increased you know and more frequent more strong disaster events and things like that so that those funds are getting spent today but planning for the future um and then the second list of things i included here um was thinking about things where we could use investment that's sort of beyond the scope of what the state of hawaii would be able to provide you know financially renewable aviation fuels uh geothermal development i think hawaii has a lot of potential for geothermal but the upfront cost of of of identifying the resource and where it is um is uh like the cost of that is a level of risk i think private developers aren't willing to take on and so we've sort of stagnated on any geothermal development besides in puna where it's obvious there's a resource that you don't have to go searching around for it um offshore wind development i mean this might speak a little bit to what rep mado yoshi was mentioning earlier about connecting the islands i'm not sure there was a long history and i'm not super familiar with it that i think there were a lot of challenges to doing that but you know as far as the need would mainly be for oahu right the connection would be to benefit oahu and it might make more sense to look at offshore wind development of something not quite so far away but where the federal government could help on this too would be interfacing with the navy because some of this would be in federal waters and we don't have state jurisdiction and then i added to this list investments and this is kind of a research and development of long duration storage options that will help the grid support more renewables and and carbon capture technology is just a final thing and some of that carbon capture can be used to create new fuels but i don't think any of those technologies are commercial commercially viable at this point so um yeah i kept it pretty brief i hope that's helpful and happy to answer any questions thank you representative i'm sorry can you just leave that last slide up there and i i maybe i could just comment back to you on a few of those right now okay so let me just let me do this is a great list this is exactly what i would would love to have from from any of you what are the areas where the federal government can can or should get involved um i totally support the renewable energy tax credits um i i i don't sense any desire to end them we have talked about the next couple of issues in terms of the bipartisan infrastructure bill there are major investments in clean transportation in that bill uh to include uh efficiency in buildings residential and commercial that's in there we've talked about the grid that's a major component of that certainly a major component in that bill that um i didn't mention particularly but is definitely in there is uh public transportation and public transit and obviously we all have um in in various shapes and forms very very large decisions to make on heart on on this island um i'm i'm personally of the view that we should continue harp because uh i think in 50 100 years looking back at today we will we will rule through the day if we don't um and that obviously impacts our energy future as well in terms of getting people out of cars whether they're electric vehicles or or fossil fuel driven vehicles and so it's important to always remember that that's a major contributor i think to the to the energy future um i agree with you on traditional infrastructure investments uh uh i liked your earlier comment about um how we're making investments uh for 60 70 80 years out even 50 years out we can't just uh make assumptions as to the status quo um you know in the last couple of decades or even today we've got to guess it and what we what we need into the future um and um i think one area where this is true um is in i mean it's across the board in hawaii but i think in in our department of transportation thinking in terms of kind of you know where and how we place highways and based on what i think we can probably stand a little bit more future oriented thinking to the thing through the the transportation system that we want in 25 years as opposed to just um you know doing what we have been doing for the last couple of decades uh and and i think the federal funding is going to be available for us to start to make some of those more feature oriented decisions there so a little bit of a comment there we talked about renewable aviation fuels um i was a little surprised when you said that geothermal development might be kind of beyond the the pale of the state to support from an r d perspective um i think you're certainly investing in it right now uh oh i don't think beyond but it would help i mean yeah it would help there is um there is there is a geothermal r d going on um i i just spent a couple of days in in utah about six weeks ago uh during which i was at the university of utah um an adjunct of which is doing some very very advanced geothermal r d funded by the federal government and my my natural question was well why aren't we doing that i mean we do geothermal they actually have geothermal surprisingly different kinds of geothermal so that the actual technology is maybe very different right that's exactly right i didn't know that um but nonetheless i we probably don't access the geothermal r d money sufficiently offshore wind um i think we all need to focus on that that is majorly funded by by the federal government nowadays and there are projects uh there are projects that are that are that are ongoing uh in hawaii uh uh private private funded projects that are that are that are um reviewing whether it an offshore wind uh development uh project would be uh you know feasible uh here in hawaii uh they tend to stay off of our grid as you as as you know so to speak because um as you already pointed out they're beyond they're beyond the state's jurisdictional limits they're up beyond three miles um and you're right that and and those have been vetted through the navy so the navy is definitely involved in them my understanding of those projects right now is that essentially they are trying to you know agree with the navy which i think has a legitimate concern by the way so i think that we should be concerned with what the navy needs but there are areas where it may well be feasible and where the navy uh may well not have um any significant uh interest and that's that's developing uh you know as i re as i the last i knew um it's still ongoing um my concern there by the way is uh i don't like the idea that that um the state has nothing to do with offshore wind developments even if beyond the three mile limit we're clearly impacted by it um and so i'm just kind of a little skeptical of of not having it so much on my radar screen so i try to go out and find out what's going on in that area long duration storage absolutely there's federal investment there i think that's a major uh ingredient as well and as we all know uh the answer to uh renewable energy and sustainable energy and and reliable energy um is storage uh where we're we're not where we need to be yet so completely agree with that and carbon capture i did want to note that um the carbon tax is very much an issue right now in congress that's one of the the key questions that we have in the infrastructure bill and in the social infrastructure bill is whether we're going to finally you know enact some form of a carbon tax carbon carbon dividend however you want to phrase it my goal there has been um that i want to see the i i would like to see the proceeds of a carbon tax reinvested directly back into uh climate change related initiatives and energy uh renewable energy r d which would benefit us here um i've had some somewhat of a problem with some of the proposals that carbon tax dividends should just be paid out on a kind of a uniform basis around the country or not uniform but on a on a progressive basis basis if i could put it that way and i and i i'm reluctant to support um um a general distribution as opposed to uh having it go back to the purposes that that we we've intended it to be okay anyway this is a great list and um those are some some quick answers back all right um i should just mention too i didn't include hydrogen on the list because i feel like the hydrogen hype is strong and there's a lot of funding for it out there so but that's another potential yeah and kirsten mentioned that too and i would love to work with you on that i i frankly don't understand it uh enough and i don't understand uh where where i might be able to exploit federal opportunities um to to fund hawaii's specific hydrogen r d and utilization so i i invite anybody that wants to work with me on that i would love to do that um let's see where are we on our time any any other questions for replo okay thank you so much and we will move to rick you're on okay hopefully i can is my screen sharing yep okay i have it on two screens i want to be sure okay um in in in light of time i'm gonna try to work my way through this quite quickly and leave time for general questions at the end but but a lot of this i think uh been a great introduction to some of the things we're doing going on so i'm going to go through it as quickly as i can and not you know over overdo it so basically uh the hawaiian natural energy institute just to clarify some people you know eachine has a lot of visibility these days but we are part of the university of hawaii at manoa we were also established in statute in 2007 and on this slide i just wanted to you know at a high level we we have activities in three big types of areas we do you know research rdt research development testing evaluation what you expect the university group to be doing it ranges from in the lab work to doing work out on the grid that's of general both state and national interest funding for that comes from a wide variety of sources including department of energy office of naval research we do get are able to use part of the state's barrel tax and a number of other organizations including the faa that i'll mention later we have a very significant activity going now on international partnerships we have a couple of large grants and are also doing quite well building into usaid programs to build some international partnerships and the big vision of reducing global carbon is really to take the lessons we're learning in hawaii and help transition some of that stuff into the asia-pacific region uh also helps provide some degree of stability in those regions that they have good energy systems but i i think they're important because those are much larger energy systems than we have here and i got a couple of examples of things that we are doing to help there and then the last activity and most of what i'm going to focus on today is for a long period of time more than a decade now we hadn't been involved in studies technical studies more than policy analysis per se trying to provide guidance to policy on how to reach the goals in hawaii and what some of the implications and subtleties might be and i'm going to show one slide on each of those top two things of some of our activities and then i got just a couple of slides on the back of our recent activity and some of them do touch on items we've discussed so far so this is just a sampling of projects we have going on and people can read and i'll share these slides with everyone but there are a couple that i want to point out hasn't been discussed yet but we do provide technical support and effectively manage the navy's wave energy test site off of the marine corps base it's funded through navy facilities money and it's been a significant program since that site was put in place by navy i think back in about 2012. uh representative you you mentioned the e-tip program that you have supported and we want to thank you for that that essentially funds a number of organizations across the country but the hawaii connection to that has largely been hnei uh mark glick who's on this call is our lead on that funding and uh kind of a little bit outside of etip is we're working with the molokai community to help them on their sustainable energy plan all the labs are now kind of seeing the interest in that and reaching back in again also some work at the natural energy laboratory hawaii a lot of other projects around just one more example in areas we have a bi-directional eb charging demonstration project really looking at the technologies to use bi-directional charging and how to manage and optimize it that just started up here on the uh campus it's a couple of cars and a couple of chargers alternative fuels uh we do operate a hydrogen refilling station 60 kilogram per day potential on the big island have been working closely with the county to demonstrate hydrogen buses out there and and um yes there is some hype around hydrogen there is potential value but i'll be happy to have a discussion in more detail at a subsequent time hnei was one of the early organizations that you know this whole hydrogen program started as a million and a half dollar earmark to four universities back in 1987 and 1988 and h i was one of those we've been in it for a long time we do have funding from the faa i i definitely agree sustainable aviation fuels is beyond the means of of the hawaii hawaii can contribute to it and we are part of the faa center of excellence and do get faa funding working on the technology side of how to develop sustainable aviation fuels and one of our faculty members spends a fair amount of his time working on that i see i listed the bi-directional charging twice it's not that big a project that didn't need to be there and a new project we don't do energy efficiency per se but and this is a little bit premature the way i worded it but we're in discussions with the department of education uh they are actually putting co2 sensors and other sensors in a large number of classrooms we have some funding in a project that has started uh to look much more closely how to combine the safe environment along safe comfortable and energy fish environment and we're having discussions with them to utilize school classrooms as our model for those projects and that's something that's just ongoing i think something in the world of a thousand classrooms are going to get instrumented so it's a pretty broad activity um i don't want to belabor the international collaborations i'll just point out one the second bullet there in thailand we actually work with their largest utility we help them build a model of the country of thailand similar to the models that the utility and hni have developed for the islands in hawaii and that work is now being used by thailand to look at how to integrate more renewables into their grid so substantial impact on potential greenhouse gas globally and a lot of this is by advice consulting and sometimes projects in those locations we have projects in in the country shown also indonesia we're doing work in papua new guinea now and in the philippines as well and we have that information if anybody's interested more kind of i think aligned to what's most important for today's talk and and the timeline across that top there was just intended to show that we've been doing this for quite some time since about 2008 and i don't know how to get to quite well i can kind of put my cursor but there are two studies back here in the early days i wasn't going to point out but in 2010 we were involved in the oahu wind integration and transmission study that was essentially looking at one-way wind that might have been on molokai or lanai that certainly the community didn't support strongly um and but was looking at the potential of developing offshore wind land-based offshore wind resources if you wanted to call it that and bring it to hawaii there was a second study uh in 2013 that looked uh at a connection a two-way connection to oahu and maui so that both islands could benefit um there could be some reasons to revisit that certainly as we get resource limited on oahu but there are a number of issues other than technical and costs that i think are probably much more significant um i think technical and cost issues could be worked through i think it's it's community and and public acceptance and and other issues that might be there anyway we've had an ongoing relationship some work done by hnei some with consultants under us some in partnership with the national renewable energy lab and i just wanted to highlight a couple that are ongoing now and relevant to work that's going on currently hnei and and our primary consultant now a small group called telos energy developed some very powerful tools to assess the impact of the aes retirement in specifically looking at the impact on grid reliability um you know the models have shown we can retire aes and we can replace them with batteries and storage and effectively maintain as good or even better reliability than we have in our current grid the start dates of some of those projects became an issue so we have developed a relatively easy to use tool that we have now provided to the puc in the state energy office that allows you to slide the dates around and see what the impact and reliability might be and that's a tool we're just trying to get a few people to look at it first but we can make it available to a broader range of people something that might be you know kind of this was kind of brand new it's not gone public before but we did do an assessment of what if we converted the aes plant to biomass and this is not us proposing this aes has proposed it it's kind of been identified as not really a significant interest we think we have some analysis that says we need at least need to take a very careful look at that and what its potential is we're actually scheduled to present that work to the puc in the state energy office i think it's next week i might might be one week after that but in the next couple of weeks uh things that have already been mentioned we are doing some greenhouse gas analysis the request of the puc that one's been a little slow but it is ready now for community review we are looking at recycle of the pv and batteries to report back to the legislature and something else we'll be coming out with is there's always the debate of how much rooftop i mean rooftop is somewhat constrained by sighting but it's also we need to reach in and have this very high resolution controls of rooftop and we actually believe that you can max or if not maximize you can get the vast majority of the benefit of that rooftop pv with what i would call dumb controls you know very simple control and operational strategies of that rooftop pv that negates the need to have real time measuring and monitoring of all those systems real-time control like you have on the utility scale systems and so that's information we're writing up at this time and hope to get out in the community so those those are just kind of examples these projects tend to be funded partly by doe and onr but also uh the barrel tax money we get goes into cost sharing needs to get it to the level we need to make it valuable to the state so a couple of slides being forward-looking and and kirsten did a great job of showing where we are she talked a little bit about the stage one and stage two uh plotting things a little bit differently this is looking at oahu and i'm focusing on oahu now we have similar work on the other islands but oahu is clearly the one that's most difficult to get to the higher penetration levels it is about 70 percent of our energy use so a lot of the efforts focused on oahu but if you look at the at the bars up through stage two you know it shows waste biofuels wind and this is the energy that gets delivered to the grid um it shows that once stage one and stage two with the storage on those stage one and two projects are implemented we will be at about 40 renewable energy that's the actual percent of energy delivered to grid on the rps basis uh that is slightly over 50 as kirsten mentioned because the rooftop is a few people have brought up many many times does get double counted just because of the formula that's in there but but it's 40 real about 50 rps within kind of the discussion going on with the integrated grid planet utility there's a number of scenarios that have come forth some involving more heavily solar some with biomass some focused on offshore winds some mixes we're really going to need some of everything but we took a look at what if we went through stage two and then added in another 400 megawatts of utility scale pv and it's actually more than that at the dc level it's more like 550 or 560 dc so more more panels than inverters and an additional 150 megawatts of behind the meter rooftop and what we found and it's kind of the third bullet to the right is that if you put four-hour storage on those utility-scale systems and kind of the equivalent amount of storage it tends to be going into the rooftop systems now that four-hour storage is is both necessary and sufficient to shift the load minimize transmission congestions and not require additional transmission development and facilitate some additional thermal unit required retirement without any significant curtailment of that solar so we can go through stage one stage two and an additional big chunk of solar without curtailment and it's largely brought about because of the power that's introduced to manage the grid by all of the batteries going in both at the utility scale and the grid scale but up to this point four hours is sufficient at some point of even higher penetration longer duration storage is needed and and then there's questions about what's the right strategy going forward the last bar to the right which is you know and and i i will say not even aes saw this before the the talk and i apologize for that but we looked at what if the aes was converted to biomass and we would get an almost instantaneous jump of approximately 20 in our percent of renewables on the grid um so if we went through stage one stage two stagex it doesn't require major transmission infrastructure upgrade and converted that bio we would be at just over 72 percent real energy on the oahu grid which puts us a little bit over 90 percent on the rps that is a remarkable potential with something to me to look quite doable now that much solar is going to require a lot of work with the community there are sighting issues but it is looking at regions that seem to have the ability to accommodate it if it's approached in the right manner with the community so these goals are far far in excess of i think what anybody thought could be done a few years ago well maybe a lot of people thought we could but with my engineering background i was a little more conservative than what i expected this is really significant a little bit more conservative approach i have one last slide and this kind of gets to some of the discussion that's going on so far is that a significant fraction of our energy use and a significant fact amount of our greenhouse gases do come from other sectors besides transportation and so i don't want to go through you know and i and i said approximately 60 of our carbon emissions are from transport and this includes ground and aviation um so continued reduction of those emissions requires us to go substantially beyond what we do with the grid and and again i think ev electrification done appropriately will have an impact but as as uh has been said we really do need to go beyond just electrification we need to look at all new ways to address this we want to get down one point that generally you know takes some explanation and people don't like it so much when i say it is at the current time even with 60 and even with 80 renewables on our grid introduction of evs does not significantly reduce our state's carbon footprint and that's a statement that is sometimes a little complicated so i try to put a little graphic together and so let's assume we get to where i say we can get through through our stage x of solar so i haven't put the biomass plant on and so if i look at my grid i'm at approximately 60 green energy now i got four barrels of of oil coming in and i got six barrels equivalent of green energy and my transportation is still black i'm still burning oil to power my car burning gasoline um and there's some number of vehicles on the car but this is a reasonable and the number of barrels isn't exactly right at the current time and it's the studies i showed from the previous slide all of that electricity can go on the grid so whether it's on an individual rooftop or it's at the utility scale or it's on a business powering that business it's meeting the overall load of the island but 100 of that energy without curtailment can go on our grid if i now reach in and i take out half of those cars and substitute electric vehicles they've got to be powered i can assume that green energy is going to come from the grid and power those vehicles and that could be green energy from somebody's individual rooftop or from the utility scale so my fleet is now you know half green because i got half gasoline powered cars and half clean cars but i still have a load the rest of the load on the grid the industry the residential businesses that needs their 10 barrels equivalent of energy so the two barrels of oil that were going to the car have to go now into the grid to meet that existing demand that was already there so i haven't changed my total number of green and black barrels i've changed where they go this is not to say evs are not good it's not to say that we shouldn't be pursuing it it's to say even if we get to these 70 80 90 numbers we need to go significantly beyond that if we're going to electrify other sectors and have it significantly reduce our carbon footprint so we need to be ev ready uh there's certainly higher efficiency has been stated than existing average cars that are on the road but it means you know it's a little bit it's focused i'm trying to say we really need to focus on getting our renewables on the grid as fast as we can and maybe even going beyond what we think is a 100 percent goal and maybe it's only 80 percent on the grid and more of us into the transportation sector but we need to balance that that where we go so that we we green all sectors together and with that i will stop and happy to answer questions thank you thank you so much and happy to make materials available on any of this thank you so much rick that was that was great and senator revere probably has a question on your last slide i've been i've been he's looking very intently at it um so a couple of just comments back to you and one question i think well first of all i hope everybody's following the chat there's a lot of good stuff going on in the chat one thing that i was in there both kirsten and and noah corrected me accurately that the state is involved in in offshore wind projects so there is that um you know nexus back to the state the state's involvement uh uh through the state administration i i do think it flies under the radar a little bit too much uh uh and with our with our broader uh folks and in our in our state legislature and county council so um i i would just encourage you to take a look at what's happening beyond the state's jurisdiction even if there is a connection back to the state um i'm i'm i'm happy that you've reinforced the uh the the comment i made earlier rick that a lot of this funding of what you're working on is actually dod related funding um again i would i would make the point that um much of the many of the energy projects throughout our throughout our country and and and here are funded um that at the um at the uh at the uh uh uh uh military level they have an interest in doing that and if there are opportunities other opportunities where other branches of the service who are involved as well can participate by the way they also do some pretty advanced climate change related uh studies they've done their own coastal resiliency studies for their military bases that that um and planned uh to what to do about it uh frankly much more than many other parts of our of our country um your comments on storage i thought were really um interesting and and the question that i had as you talked about the storage scenarios and how they could really contribute i guess i asked that i asked the question is there anything unique about hawaii from a storage perspective where we could actually chase federal support for you know battery or other storage r d that somehow hawaii has a niche i mean i it strikes me that that's one of those areas that's fairly generic so so we would be competing really with everybody else from that perspective or maybe we you know yield yield that particular area to somebody else a little bit like aviation fuel but i didn't know whether the that was the question or not um so let's see and then finally rick just those are observations and then to your question to my question at least what are you what do you think are the areas where the federal government can actually step it up uh from a support perspective for hawaii yeah so a couple of questions so one one partly to to kirsten's chat real quickly so don't forget and i meant to mention so in that in that equivalent move of of barrels there um you know there is some net gain and efficiency in generating the electricity on the grid as opposed to burning it in a car but if you look at the balance it's a relatively modest gain actually trans changing until we have the excess renewables on the grid changing to a high efficiency vehicle that's not what's typically on the road you know such as a hybrid would actually have a bigger impact on our on our carbon footprint so it's there is a net savings relative to the to the relatively low uh cafe standard car that's on the road you know by our estimates and other people put it out it's about a 32 or 33 mile per gallon break even point on that so so if you're driving a car that's better than 33 35 miles per gallon you're as good as charging evie off the grid one other point is this is a hawaii specific argument in other parts of the nation when you take a car off of the gasoline you are using natural gas or nuclear or hydro in in greater percentages you're not you're not now burning more oil to make up for the the gasoline that has been displaced it's two very different systems and so this is a hawaii unique um you know the in in terms of you know the resilience one one other point is you know in the money and first of all in terms of the dod money i want to thank our congressional delegation across both house and senate on all sides a good bit of the money we've been able to get is because of it's been a a plus up that's gone into the various services we've been able to tap in that very efficiently particularly on the navy side which comes through the office of naval research and so that's been a very great relationship but it's been very dependent on on the strong support we've gotten from our congressional delegation so i want to thank everybody on it and they did recently from that same money that is called the alternate energy ad fund a sea level rise center here on campus to be looking at some of the climate change issues and in fact in our last two proposals to the office of naval research resilience of the grid particularly the wahoo grid is one of the areas we've been able to add because of their interest in that so it is going from just energy to reliability and resilience so that's kind of so critical to dod um you know one of the things that we are con i'm gonna be real frank one of the things we're constantly fighting you know battling uh pursuing is a lot of money is going into these programs and an awful lot of money goes into the national labs that could be used very very effectively not only at the university by other organizations you know state energy offices partnerships with utilities partnerships with industry and a lot of times the the lab consultants are flown in they fly out or reports delivered but we haven't built the local infrastructure so one of my repeated comments have been and maybe it's not in appropriations it's in report language things that can help the funds get to where they're used and build that local infrastructure would be extremely valuable i mean i'll give more thought to specific topical areas but there's actually a lot of money but it's sometimes difficult to work get it to where i think it could be most valuable i would i would invite your draft report language let's go to the chase on that i think that's something that uh that we can that we can work on and if i missed any questions feel free to come back okay uh senator rivera thank you i'll be very brief i um and thanks rick you kind of validated my my supposition on that that it's shifting um energy if we shift ev to the to the grid so i would just uh like to ask maybe a hawaii energy office can share with us maybe as a follow-up what are the projected levels of energy that will need to be generated uh in say five year increments going forward and with and without the migration of electric vehicles so clearly we're going to need a lot more electricity to power electric vehicles which means we're going to need a lot more um alternative energy so i just i'd like to see those numbers in some sort of chart going forward if i may senator revere uh we'll definitely attend to that that is part of the integrated grid planning process uh at the puc that multiple stakeholders are participating in and so that is the nut that's trying to be cracked uh right now there must be some estimates or some rough numbers and i don't want to take any money you guys time anymore but yeah i think that's that's really the essence of the whole argument or one of the initials for what has to be done to get there yeah one of the very initial steps of the igp work is to forecast what load will be and it looks at existing demand it looks at rooftop pv or distributed resources it looks at increases in energy efficiency and then it looks at ev and there are a number of lines of scenarios on their charts of what ev penetration might be by year which which is converted directly into kilowatt hours required so those those numbers are out there they vary widely depending on the assumptions but but there are ranges and those charts are publicly available and and we can also pull them up and make them available to you thank you thanks so thanks so much rick um we are coming down uh fast on our time uh this has gone by fast and furious i would like to give an opportunity to other folks to to chime in starting with my colleagues that have not chimed in yet if you'd like to from from the state legislature martin i think you're the one on the phone that hasn't do you have anything you want to uh add or ask um gosh not really i just i just wanted to comment that um you know the offshore wind project for oahu has shifted to my district i think they um they were denied by the military their plan in the diamond head area so they're shifting their sites to the waimanalo area and i think in order for the community to not oppose it there has to be a direct linked benefit for the community and because they will naturally post just about everything otherwise and i was told by the private developers that they you know they said well we could maybe fund like a town um you know some sort of town hall gathering place they said no we can fund that you know the state legislature it has to be tied to it and they said we can't do that and so that kind of thing i think has to be worked through um in order to get community buy-in because we will see the offshore you know we will see the structures offshore and um it is a native hawaiian community and they're activated and um and so i think that um early education isn't enough there has to be benefits thank you representative well said um okay we've got a number of our our our colleagues and partners in in non-government uh here can i can i suggest that each of you if you'd like to take take uh you know 30 seconds if we can if we can do that um always hard for us all to do 30 seconds and just just like what are the snapshots of what you think the feds me and the rest of your federal government should be doing right now what do you want us to do so i'm i'm gonna just go with your you know raise your chat and if you'd like to to have a quick uh bite at that okay paulie go ahead hi nurseman aloha and thank you to the many representatives as well today this is public polly shaw of plus power here we are the developer of the 185 megawatt kapolei energy storage project uh congressman case i really want to thank you for your support of energy storage generally and for robust energy storage appropriations funding that funding has huge benefit to hawaii's rd and d on energy storage applications but my one ask from the energy storage industry of which i'm also on the board of the energy storage association is your help to pass the energy storage itc in the reconciliation package that would deploy vast megawatts for renewables energy in hawaii and thank you in particular for co-sponsoring the energy storage tax it's incentive act of 2019 as the process moves along with the bipartisan package and reconciliation we know you are concerned about the price tag but passing the storage itc now would create the grid reliability and system balancing in hawaii to greatly deploy much more customer sided and utility scale renewables it is the bedrock of achieving america's and hawaii's 100 percent decarbonization goals electric transportation domestic manufacturing reliability and resilience goals itc driven storage creates the grid reliability that attracts more high energy users to come and invest in hawaii and it also brings local communities across hawaii that new revenue and jobs from accelerated projects i know others on the call will speak about the concerns that we share about the threat of increased solar and storage import tariffs so i'll leave that to them thank you for this roundtable and thank you for your help to try to pass the storage itc in the reconciliation package thank you so much paulie as you know all of the committees of jurisdiction are we're supposed to report today so i don't exactly know where that ended up in the committee of jurisdiction i'll go try to track it i would observe to you that yes i am concerned about uh about worsening uh national debt and deficits uh and that's why that's my concern in reconciliation but to the extent that this can that this is in the climate change side of things which i think it is um i and most of the rest of us uh understand that that's an investment of of our national uh resources to get there so that that falls in a little bit of a different category for me um let's see who else anybody else just raise your hand uh if you want to weigh in here i anybody go to another screen uh i don't see anybody did i miss anybody okay representative i'm sorry if you don't mind yeah robert robert go ahead okay thank you sorry and for jumping in front of you just real briefly thank you for the opportunity to have this dialogue a lot of fascinating conversation um again reiterating um continued support for the itc you know that has brought in a lot of economic activity in hawaii and hawaii probably disproportionately benefits from that and it's going to be critical to speeding up and accelerating our renewable energy consumption the second thing i'd like to thank your office and it's a relatively small little hanging fruit point the lawrence berkeley just came out to report just uh literally today showing that the cost of installing solar is three dollars and eight cents sorry three dollars and eighty cents per watt in the united states which is roughly triple almost every other country the cost of permitting an interconnection creates huge additional costs on these installations that you know every day residents pay for when they install rooftop solar et cetera so supportive programs like solar app which is a department of energy funded program which creates tools for local administration and local offices to be able to use is critical to lowering that cost and making renewable energy cheaper for everyone thank you very much robert understood all of that um and and and fully supportive um ben uh thanks congressman real briefly i know a lot of folks are thinking about it including yourself and your staff very much but on the subject of equity and and incentives and benefits if there's any vehicles that we can utilize to assure that some of these benefits go where they're really needed as opposed to where they're just helping somebody accrue more wealth it is greatly appreciated i think the example of the tax credits is coming up and we saw what happened with tv tax credits initially it was very very instrumental in motivating the industry to move forward and getting that off the ground but then it really did become something that was a little bit more of a giveaway to folks who already had money because it was a tax credit and not it didn't really open up to votes with with limited means and i'd hate to see the same thing happen or continue to happen with evs and i think there's plenty of work around where we can continue to accelerate uh rooftop development and other things without without just giving away i think with you know giving away to all incomes the incentives that the federal government puts out thank you thank you so much and that's a really uh important point uh we we are definitely trying to work through that in congress to fairly and equitably distribute the the investments that we're making and ensure that they get to the communities most in need um i would observe to you that um um again there will be a fair bit of discretion at the state county level uh to to do that here and by the way i i just make a quick comment uh back to i think it was rep low and if i'm not mistaken who was who was discussing um some of the uh um the issues around um around i think the way you were saying it was um how do we how do we facilitate uh rental car development of rental cars in a way that is sustainable for for our tourists and i think there's a much broader question that we all need to deal with which um that presumes that we want to continue to grow tourism in the way that it has and certainly in the in the ways that we make these decisions uh we can also make a decision about what kind of future we want for tourism uh evs is a good uh a good a good kind of uh you know test of that proposition if all we're gonna do is to try to put out you know uh charging stations to facilitate more and more you know rental cars for tourists uh well that's that's one way to do it but another way to do it is to ask well exactly how do we want to facilitate future tourism in the state and then and then match to that so i just i just offer that since you know if we have 250 000 plus tourists here a day that obviously impacts our or more uh that obviously impacts our energy policy and i don't want the you know card before the horse that's my own editorialization on this uh subject uh matthias did i get that right yeah thanks congressman aloha and mahalo for the opportunity to join this roundtable it's been an interesting uh set of information shared and appreciate all the state representatives as well from their perspectives my name is matthia larkin and i'm responsible for national solar and storage development at clearway energy as some of you may know um clearway has 110 megawatts of operational projects on oahu and we're mid construction on 75 megawatts of additional projects that also include 300 megawatt hours of battery storage so we have work we're serving flying electric and customers across hawaii and we're excited to continue that development and we appreciate your leadership as a number of others have noted in some of the national issues that do impact hawaii based projects and and your and your constituents i will jump very quickly exclaiming we are actually overtime now to uh the two items one which polly mentioned um in addition to uh the battery storage tax credit which we also support um the extension of the uh of the itc um for pv is also um one that i would put critically and to put a really fine point on it i think that there is a there there is a direct connection to the price of electricity that we can sell to hawaiian electric um and the that would be passed along to customers in hawaii with the extension of of a pv itc that's one note and then on the second note um i would just uh to sort of follow on to what what polly was mentioning around the um uh the tariff concerns that we have as an industry the supply chain both for battery and for pv is enormously it's a it's a significantly global supply chain um for pv specifically um in the context of the ac tv ac dvd adcd tariffs that are under consideration at the department of commerce um only 20 of domestic supply can actually be uh only 20 of demand could be achieved with domestic supply of tv today and these kinds of tariffs have significant ramifications both on projects of our size but also on residential and commercial industrial scale projects by limiting the choices um that you have and therefore limiting competition um across quality products that might be available to provide more cost effective solutions to hawaiian customers and so i think in both of those cases across whatever scale of pv deployment um and i think setting a precedent also for given the supply chain um parallels that that we see between pv and battery that um that we really encourage you to reach at the department of commerce and um ask them to not proceed with the um with the process that they've undertaken here around the um adcbd thank you where so where were these where's the primary source of import for what you're talking about is it china the companies themselves many of them are chinese but the but the supply chains themselves are diverse across asia um and and i think that that's one of the challenges as the as the pv industry in particular has grown and matured that those supply chains and manufacturing bases have spread across numerous countries um even if a company is headquartered in in china um and and in fact you know one of our projects that is under construction today is sourcing from a chinese manufacturer who utilizes us-based polysilicon and then and then creates cells and wafers um in other countries around asia and it just so happens that that you know may not be impacted but that is a purely uh sort of that was a plan let's put it that way yeah no i i appreciate it and i i heard both of you i i have not focused in on this issue so let me go do that right away i just don't know enough about it i we clearly have a whole range of very very large decisions to be made on on supplying supply chain vulnerabilities especially for critical infrastructure in this country um much of that is focused on on whether we want our critical supply chain origin to be countries that that appear to you know uh be potential opponents or our opponents uh china in particular and so these are huge issues and i had not focused uh in all honesty on the implications for that debate on the development of renewable energy in hawaii so i just hadn't traced that all the way through so let me go do that so that's what that's one to do for me and my staff um and we'd be happy to um i'm sorry to interrupt we'd be happy to spend more time with internal experts to give you more perspective on that if you if you felt that would be useful um to give you more detail around yeah better uh lieutenant uh bernard maybe you could just put your email in the in the uh the chat here um hey we're down we're down we're over by about seven minutes um i think we could go on for quite a while this has been from my perspective incredible i think we just kind of scratched the surface i i kind of jotted down a number of things that i learned from each of the folks that presented and from the questions today and it's actually a pretty long list i won't i won't go down at some of the key areas you know i'm always just struck at um how much we're doing here in hawaii uh that is quite advanced uh in in the country and in the world and i think you know one of one of the things that i observe when i when i spend two hours with all of you is that we don't tell that story nationally quite as much as perhaps we we could or should um both because we should be proud of it and also because uh frankly it helps us with with federal funding uh and so that's certainly one takeaway for me is how do we how do we assemble what we're actually doing here and show that we're a leader of the country that that deserves to be supported we do have significant federal support here right now uh we do have um a larger share um than you know kind of the average across the country uh but uh you know again i think we should always strive to to support where we're trying to get to um as both for ourselves and for our country and world as much as we possibly can so for me the takeaway is there's a lot to be done still with each and all of you to kind of refine uh what kind of requests what kind of uh you know efforts what kind of uh you know joint um joint approaches we could take uh to facilitate the federal support of what we're trying to do or sometimes we remove federal obstacles so it's not all just a matter of federal funding sometimes it's a matter of the fed's getting in our way so i particularly want to focus on that i've got a couple of other very specific areas to follow up here in particular many many of you talked about aviation fuel i haven't i had not focused on that as a critical uh need of research right there like i said i've got my list here but i'm going to stop there i hope that i hope that you will all follow up you know tonight or tomorrow or whenever you thought well i should have said that or i'd like to say that um lieutenant bernard has his email in here and just reach me through him i'm happy to get back on the phone with any of you um as our schedules permit to follow up on this so just let us know through my office we're happy to do that and other than that i really really thank you for your time your effort uh your commitment your your partnership again and uh with that um i'm gonna sign off and look forward to our next chapters milo thank you thank you all have a good day

hello hey there representative porter we are excited to be with you today i'm glad to be in conversation with you as always indeed so we have posited as we're waiting for you the number one you don't mess around number two you hold the powerful accountable and number three you give us a dose of humor and number four which i didn't say but we're counting on two we're going to make technical things understandable for people who aren't previously familiar with what we're talking about absolutely because these technical things have real make a real difference in people's lives so whether oil and gas companies are allowed to pollute affects the air that every single american breeds so we have to be able to engage on these issues all right let's just jump right in so as i was mentioning before you jumped on the oil and gas industry has benefited for benefited for for decades really from all kinds of subsidies from taxpayers can you talk about what that means what what is the subsidy what are we talking about and why does it matter for how the oil industry and the gas industry function yup so fossil fuel companies have a long history of taking advantage of the tax code taking advantage of taxpayers and a frankly buying and selling influence in washington to get policies that benefit them at the expense of both our planet and the rest of us um and they're not stopping by the way because we're in the middle of a pandemic they actually took billions of dollars in covet-related money um and then rather than actually use that money to pay their workers to help prevent a recession to make sure gas and other things remained affordable they actually laid off more than 100 000 workers after they took that covert relief money which they used to boost their executive pay so it's really really important that we see this both in its historical context which is that this is a long-term continuous strategy of oil and gas um to get policies that benefit them at the expense of everyone else but also that it's not slowing down it's it's it's actually accelerating um and there and then took advantage of the pandemic to make it worse so one of the huge issues for sure in this space is what we call public lands you know i think that's even a term that many people don't understand what does it mean we're talking about what does it mean when we say public lands and what does it have to do with with big oil and the oil and gas industry great great question so public land simply refers broadly to any land that is owned by the federal state or local government so there are local public lands county and state public lands obviously as a congressmember i focus primarily on federal public lands now some people immediately think national parks yes that is one example of public lands but relatively a relatively small portion of public land is designated as national park or national monument much of it is designated as forest national forest or forest service land and the largest proportion of it is controlled by the bureau of land management um which does exactly what it's what it sounds like they're supposed to make sure that those public lands owned and controlled by the us government are being managed in a way that benefits taxpayers as part of managing that land which includes everything from thinking about allowing recreational use to preserving species to thinking about forest fire management um one of the things that we allow on many kinds of public lands like many um bureau of land management parcels is we allow extractive drilling so oil and gas um primarily and the bureau of land management and the federal government the department of interior broadly is in charge of deciding whether somebody can drill um where they can drill what kind of conditions they have to satisfy to protect our environment and what they have to pay in order to use our public lands to make themselves a profit so when people hear public lands they may be thinking of a national park that they've been to where so far as they know all that's going on is hiking and canoeing but really we're talking about vast portions of the country where it's not about hiking and canoeing so much as drilling in mine absolutely and particularly in some of the western states states like nevada california montana huge huge portions of the state are public lands controlled by the federal government so federal government policy here really matters it matters in terms of conservation it matters in terms of shaping the entire energy system how much fossil fuel extraction and the conditions for fossil fuel extraction on public lands is one of many many tools that we need to be using to address climate change so when the when the binding administration came in and said it was going to put a pause on new uh leasing and drilling on public lands and the department of interior has been conducting a study to figure out how it should be managing the lands and i think we're expecting that any second any day or any week how things work in dc maybe any month but anyway soon what are the important reforms that we should be looking for uh in that report what do you what do you hope to see come out of that report as we go forward with a hopefully a really different way of of managing these publicly owned lands yep so i think there's a couple things one is um the biden administration paused granting new rights um but that didn't mean that the previous big bunch of rights that the trump administration granted and some long-standing um rights that have been granted so there's still oil and for people to understand there's still oil and gas extraction going on on public lands what the biden administration did is said we're not going to accelerate or move forward with this without stopping and thinking i think we all as taxpayers ought to be applauding our government thinking um and evaluating and analyzing and trying to make the best decisions that they can so i think there's two things we have to look at one is um what is the return to taxpayers on letting oil and gas companies use our public lands um and there's i think several areas here where we definitely need to make changes and i have a bill that's stopping taxpayer welfare for oil and gas companies and there are some other companions similar bills that do related things that are really important um one of them is that the oil and gas companies pay both a rental rate that is the rate to have the right to use the land and a royalty rate which is they pay on what they extract the oil and gas they actually take from the land um those rates are way way way out of date um the rental rate has not been changed since i was in i think junior high school um the royalty grade i think it has not been changed in like 100 years um for a royalty rate um in 100 years so we need to update those we also need to make sure that oil and gas companies if they receive permits are paying a bonding requirement this is an amount of money that they set aside they purchase a bond so that if there's a need to do environmental remediation or cleanup the taxpayers aren't left holding the bag those bonding requirements are too low and these and what that happens is oil and gas companies set up entity after entity after entity corporate shells in essence to drew this oil and gas drilling and essentially when they're done those entities declare bankrupt and walk away um and the taxpayers wind up on the hook for abandoned wells and public citizens has done amazing work um we really want to complement what you and your team have done in documenting how many abandoned wells there are around the country um and by the way we create really good high paying jobs including for people who are already trained in fossil fuel extraction to do this environmental remediation and clean up these wells but we also have to stop this problem from occurring in the first place so i'm looking to see both what is going to be the fiscal policy going forward in terms of rental rate royalty rate and body rate that's the taxpayer welfare the taxpayer fairness part of this the second big portion i want to see from the administration is how much public land extraction is sensible or reasonable to permit in light of our need to lower our fossil fuel consumption in order to slow the pace of climate change um the number of permits already granted already in existence where they've given a permit someone's bought it they've leased it the rights shouldn't say they bought it they leased it they haven't started drilling yet so we already have set a course for several several years of additional increased fossil fuel extraction on public lands how do we chart a future path forward that's going to contribute to reducing our country's dependence on fossil fuel and creating a balanced energy portfolio that addresses the need to reduce the the fossil fuel pollution that we're seeing and so i think it's both a fiscal issue here and also one about our planet and our health let's just try to walk real quickly through the different pieces you just said so just on this this first thing you're talking about what they're paying to rent and then what they pay what the companies pay and royalties did you say the the royalties are haven't moved in like a hundred years the royalty rate it's hard to believe the royalty rate has not changed in 100 years now it's a percentage so as the price of the oil goes up there's some you know there's additional money but the reality is states private landowners they have increased their royalty rates so in essence the us government is the is is it giving away a bargain basement deal to fossil fuel companies who want to drill and extract on public lands so even very very fossil fuel friendly states states like texas charge a much higher royalty rate to extract from their state lands than the federal government does for extraction from federal land so we need to change that and update that royalty rate so that it's it's set in such a way that it reflects the fact that drilling for example has become a lot less risky than it used to be the technology the predictive ability um the sort of argument you hear sometimes is you know it's really tough to to you know predict where there's going to be oil when we have to make all these investments that has changed a lot with technology that's why a higher royalty rate companies fossil fuel companies can afford to pay a higher royalty rate today than they could 100 years ago because they're the drilling technology and the ability to correctly assess whether a drill is going to be productive or not has improved a lot and so we need to upgrade the federal government should not be in the business of giving sweetheart deals to oil and gas companies we ought to be charging at least as much as states um and private landowners are getting for their land no sweetheart deals that that seems like a pretty modest position you would think you would think i would tell you when i say that people are like what but i mean you would think that would be a fairly straightforward proposition that we all ought to get our fair share as taxpayers when we allow others to use our public lands yeah once upon a time not a hundred years ago but quite a while ago some colleagues of mine looked at the u.s rates versus other countries including countries that we often disparage you know as poor banana republics and stuff and they charge high rates because they're just not willing to be as ripped off as we are right no there's no doubt that we could raise the rate and we and by the way we we do not need to necessarily be so if we raise the rate and in temporarily as the market adjusts there are fewer applications or fewer permits granted on public land while the market adjusts that's fine because we have granted tons of permits to drill that aren't even being used yet that are essentially being purchased as speculative permits at this bargain basement rate and they're hanging on to them not even beginning to drill until it becomes profitable to do so until there's an oil and gas shortage so we definitely need to raise that royalty rate the rental rate the cost for the ability to kind of set aside the land also hasn't changed since i was in junior high and the reality is there are competing uses for this land both in terms of conservation in terms of climate recapture in terms of recreation um and so we have to really be charging a rate that's competitive with the fact that there are other users and other uses for this land that might be more of more benefit to the american people so the second prong of what you were talking about was this term that very few people are going to know bonding but if i get it right the story you're saying is that oil companies are are drilling on public lands taking the oil out then using a subsidiary or a front company or a shell company or whatever to declare bankruptcy and then just leaving the well behind to just be a mess or to let the taxpayers clean up is that is that fair and if that's right then what does bonding have to do with it that's absolutely what it is so the idea behind bonding is that you at the the polluter the driller because there is no way to drill in a way that doesn't create some environmental need for environmental remediation after you're done the wells don't cap themselves okay you have to do the work and so the idea is that you take out you buy a bond um you basically put down you purchase a bond you put down a portion of the money and the company says if you don't pay for this people can look to the bond to cover the cost and what's happening is those bonding requirements are so low that it doesn't even begin to cover the cost of capping the well of doing the environmental remediation of doing the cleanup and so what happens is one of two things and they're both really really bad for the american people either these wells sit abandoned where they prevent both you know potential risks of people wandering onto the land getting harmed the land is polluted it can't be used and that's a loss of economic loss to the taxpayers or we the federal government pick up the tab and do the work or we put it onto the states this is really simple for me as a parent if you want to dump the bin of legos out on the floor and play with the legos that's fine you will pick up every single lego it's the every parent understands this you want to make a mess you got to pick it up same thing for the oil and gas companies you want to drill you need to clean up your messes you can't just walk off and leave the rest of us on the hook everyday american people working hard you know some of them many of them making minimum wage people paying taxes why are we on the hook for cleaning up after your profit your profits the mess you made to make a buck is your problem to clean up that comes out of your buck um it should not be on the rest of us and the last piece of what you talked about was just being upfront and direct about the the climate crisis and raising the question of whether and to what extent there should be any more drilling on public lands um and certainly new public trading i think a lot of us would like to see new leases just ended forever more on public lands do you see that happening or or how do you think the the administration should be handling that going forward well we'll see what the administration comes up with i certainly think that i'm looking for them to provide real analysis um and justification for any um conclusion that they present so it may be that we say you know we're not going to do as much of it we're going to keep allowing these permits we're going to slow the pace we're going to wait till actually these companies are doing the drilling why are we putting these public lands up for auction if there's not really any need to drill on them today we can simply do what governments do which is protect and preserve national resources until they're needed so i think there certainly are environmentally sensitive areas where we need to just say flat out no either for environmental reasons sometimes cultural reasons relating to indigenous peoples but we just shouldn't be doing drilling at all and i think one of the parts of binds 30 by 30 commitment that's really important is setting aside that 30 percent that 30 would not be available for extractive industries would not be available for oil and gas so when we think about things like carbon recapture preservation of species climate resilience all of those things you know we have to understand that we cannot allow this pace of continued drilling and meet our commitment to conservation and preservation and climate change goals those two things are just inconsistent and climate change is a huge problem we have to do all of the above good strategies so public land drilling is only a time is only a i shouldn't say tiny but it's only a portion because it's not tiny it's millions of acres but public land drilling is one of the tools that we can use to create a more sustainable energy future and we need to use it we need to use every tool that we have with regard to climate change so i hope that we see both an updated and sort of better common sense fiscal requirements um but also some real thoughtful guidelines about when and where we're going to allow oil and gas drilling going forward okay and you mentioned that you have a bill a public citizen we like legislation um so let's let's get an ad in for what's your what what is your bill and what would it do yes so it's called the ending taxpayer welfare for oil and gas companies um and what it would essentially do is update um that royalty and rental rate for onshore drilling um and we have when we talk about onshore that just means drilling that's occurring on land as opposed to offshore drilling that's um occurring off the shore and we have different royalty and rental rates for onshore and offshore and the onshore drilling in part because it's much older um the need to update the royal the royalty rate um it's been sort of it's been around longer um and there's more of a need to update it so i think it's really really important that we that we pass this legislation i think when we talk about how can we afford this or that environmental thing here's an easy answer we can collect our fair share from the companies that are making money off our public lands and we can take that money which is owed to us for using our public lands and put it right back in to remediation efforts things like reclaiming abandoned wells dealing with you know coastal resilience all of those priorities so i think we i'm very hopeful that we'll see this bill and the related bills that deal with offshore drilling um with bonding requirements in other areas i'm hopeful that we'll see them be part of the budget reconciliation process going forward in terms of how do we afford to to address all of this pollution how can we afford to do this the answer is the money is right there we get it simply by charging a fair market rate for drilling on our public lands we owe that to our planet we owe that to each other as taxpayers so you've been amazing of course shining a light on this but i have to say this these are not novel issues um they certainly have been talked about before you entered congress and really for decades and we really have not seen meaningful progress so this is a 101 question but why not well i look i don't think it's any big surprise to you robert but i think it's important just to state it plainly because oil and gas companies have bought legislation that works for them these are not sort of natural policies they didn't fall from the sky oil and gas companies went to congress and year after year after year advocated to keep this royalty rate unchanged to continue to get the tax breaks that they get in our tax code they spend a lot of money um you know taking people making corporate pac donations on lobbyists who walk the halls of congress in creating organizations that uh including within their own organization painting themselves as environmental champions even as they're out there with their other hand on the one hand they say look at us we're this green energy company that drills for oil and then on the very same time they're walking the halls of congress opposing legislation that would actually help clean up and bring some environmental accountability to drilling so there's a huge tie here obviously to campaign finance to anti-corruption um and so i think it's really really important that we that we see the obvious connect here um these are not natural policies they're not policies nobody sat around and said you know i would be really really smart under charging for our public lands that is not the result of this this is a result of oil and gas companies influencing lobbying pressuring donating doing whatever they can misinformation every tool in the special interest playbook they have done in order to preserve these these favorable this favorable policy to them and it's come at our expense the expense of every single taxpayer in this country of every single other competing priority where we could be putting this money to good use and it's come at the expense of our planet i think our time is winding down let me just ask a couple of last things as a thought to that how how people think help me think about how do you think about the sort of the two tracks so on the one hand you're saying look there's been this corruption that has blocked anything from moving for decades so obviously we have to take on the problem of of corruption and the purchase of legislation as you called it and we have a solution for that which a little stuck right now in the senate but we're going to break through on that at least i'm really optimistic we will um before the people but how do we simultaneously get our heads around needing to do the work on anti-corruption at the same time not being able to wait for any corruption although hopefully it's coming next few weeks not being able to wait to push on this reform or many other reforms that you and others are working on well i think one of the answers is um engaging the american people and understanding what the facts are so when you explain to the american people you know the united states charges way less to drill on its public lands than other countries people are like what that doesn't sound right to me when you explain that it's more expensive to drill on land owned by the state of texas for example than it is federal public land people think what that doesn't make any sense so exposing these problems and engaging people and the message i have to everybody is please keep learning about these things please keep asking questions ask your representative about this problem call their office ask them whether they're co-sponsors on this legislation and one important thing about this legislation is that the bill that i have the ending taxpayer welfare and oil and gas companies in the senate is bipartisan it's bipartisan co-sponsors jackie rosen on the senator from nevada and chuck grassley the senator from iowa in the house there is not one republican who has stepped up and been willing to say that taxpayers should get their fair share for drawing and so i encourage everybody whether you've got a republican congress person or a democrat one call them and ask them to co-sponsor this bill and ask them to make it part of the budget reconciliation process but part of how oil and gas companies get away with this yes it's political influence but it's also trying to convince the american people oh it's so complicated it's really not complicated you're getting cheated let me break it down for you you and everyday american are getting cheated by the big guys the fossil fuel companies it's really that simple and so when you put it that way i think americans feel more engaged and more ready and able to push back and make their voices heard you know it's interesting saying that there's no um you can't get bipartisan support in in the house it's been a shift in the in the republican party for sure in the last 20 years because we used to be involved in genuine bipartisan coalitions on corporate welfare including some of the same things we're talking about oil gas royalty rates and stuff like that and uh and you see that the the leftover of that older days and someone like chuck grassley has been around for forever um but it's it does not seem to have much life right now in the current house republican membership well let me just the last thing just play off this last point you made about telling you know telling truth and telling it straight forward for people let's talk about the whiteboard and and how you use that and and when's it coming up next okay this is my new thing i just ordered this and i'm super excited so i carry a white board in my purse all right and i have this favorite one that was like a super hero it's like it's like your super hero thing yeah i really have a huge purse you should keep that in mind my mama three but i just got this new whiteboard that i'm really excited about look it has this cool cover so it keeps it clean and then it has this little stand on it so it stands up and the pen and the eraser fits right here and it's super thin and super flat so this for everyone's shopping this is a great whiteboard because it slides right into your purse so you always have it um because i've been surprised when i've been doing hearing sometimes how effective it is to just even reflect back the nonsense that the witness is saying um onto the whiteboard and when i think when you put it on you know sort of put the whiteboard put the information on the whiteboard people are like what what that makes no sense at all um and so it's you know it's a visual tool to help make it easier for everyday americans who are trying to get dinner on the table figure out how they're gonna you know pay for pay their rent get to work make it easier for them to engage and understand what's going on in washington and why it needs to change so you've got that portable whiteboard you you come across a ceo on the airplane flying back and forth between dc and california you can grab them and put on a show for the plane someone's um i didn't have any paper and i used it to make a grocery shopping list um and just crossed it off as i went through the grocery store and um somebody pointed out it's also very environmentally friendly because i'm not destroying i don't have to carry around a notepad which is heavier and i'm not wasting any paper um but i think that the lesson sort of i would say for for people that i've been really encouraged by and there's a lot of things that are discouraging in washington one thing i've been really encouraged by is when you work to give information to the american people about what is really happening they engage and i think that's been the important work that public citizen has been doing for so so long and to be able to amplify that work that you're doing for example you've documented what's going on with these abandoned wells humble oil and gas companies are leaving the rest of us holding the bag to clean up this their messes and then my job is really to to amplify that fact and to push oil and gas companies to take responsibility i invited three oil and gas companies to come testify before the subcommittee i chair on natural resources and my question was really simple come tell me about all of the jobs that you saved through the cobit relief money that you took you took billions come tell me about all the jobs that you saved can you have any workers come testify come explain to me you know how did the american people benefit from giving you billions of dollars all three energy companies declined to come they declined to simply answer the question what did you do with our taxpayer money and i think that not only in the oil and gas industry but across so many of these coveted relief programs and so many other programs that's the question we all should be asking democrats republicans young old white brown black everybody should be asking where did our money go did we get the value yeah well of course it's great to partner with you and you're such an inspiration in terms of doing just what you said i mean not just holding people accountable which itself is is quite something but really you know digesting these these complicated things and of course you you understand this way more than we do but then explain it presenting it to the american people in ways that they can get and get angry about because they should be angry and not letting the complexity obfuscate what's actually going on i know we have to wrap up but i just think this is such an important point to end on for everybody watching this don't let any government official i don't care what party they're in or what office they hold don't let any public official tell you that it's too complicated for you to make your voice heard if it's complicated they need to explain it to you if they can't explain it to you they need to do their jobs and do more research and be able to because we all deserve answers that's fundamentally a part of democracy the biggest check and balance in a democracy is the voices of the american people speaking up asking questions and getting answers so i you know this this this it's too complicated it's too hard it would take too long i'd be happy to follow up with you later all of that isn't coincidental it is part of a strategy to avoid accountability well that's a perfect endpoint representative katie porter thanks so much for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again and watching you tear into the powerful on c-span thanks so much for what you're doing thank you to everyone at public citizen thank you

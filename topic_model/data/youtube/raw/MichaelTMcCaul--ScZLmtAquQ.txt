many Thank You mr. chairman let me take the witnesses I am in some respects feel like the trains already left the station even if we disapprove of this that's vetoed and we override a veto this still goes before the UN Security Council and unless the administration exercises leadership those sanctions will certainly be lifted regardless of what we do in the United States and I think that's maybe something we haven't discussed here today and then from a homeland security standpoint what is that that means we have billions of dollars being restored to the Iranians that can then go into these terrorist operations we know they control five capitals now really arguably Tehran Baghdad Damascus Beirut and sauna and Yemen that's what greatly concerns me and I don't know if we can turn the clock back on this now and now that the p5 plus one has agreed to this when I was in Europe Mike O'Dell you're absolutely correct ambassador they're very supportive of this deal and primarily I think because they have a lot of money to be made on this and so I don't know what we can do to stop it I can tell you what I'm concerned about is the last minute as the chairman mentioned the last minute arms embargo being lifted which can lead to Russian technology and the sanctions against the Kurds force being lifted as well not to mention you know when you look at the track record of the IAEA and whether they can truly perform this mission with unfettered access which I highly doubt the Iranians are going going to give us access to and when I look at what is what are they giving us access to nuclear facility site it doesn't include their military facilities which arguably is where a lot of this could potentially take place and then the lastly the intercontinental ballistic missiles which have been talked about a great deal if they can mass produce in general as you know that intelligence estimates are in cating by the end of possibly as early as next year could have capability to hit the United States of America there's only one reason why you produce these things it's to deliver a nuclear warhead so all these things put together in addition to the RET rhetoric I think I agree with Senator Lieberman it's more risk for America and more reward for Iran I want to end with this because I this this is probably the worst when I was in Saudi I think senator in general as you mentioned they asked me why are you negotiating with Iran why are you doing it I've met with Netanyahu why are you doing this this will result in a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and as you indicated Saudis are already taken steps now maybe work with Pakistan to produce her own nuclear capability the turkeys going to want that then Egypt's going to want it and on and on and on I think that's one of my biggest concerns here is the result of all this backfiring in it not so great result at senator general if you could both comment on that well chairman McCaul it's good to see you I of course I agree with you all your concerns or question about what happens at the United Nations if we reject if Congress rejects e agreement and President's veto was overridden is a really interesting question I mean in the most direct sense you'd think that the deal therefore would be dead so that it would not be there not be a basis for going to the United Nations but based on having read it one and a half times this morning i'm not sure i could swear to that under oath so it's it's a really interesting question and again i come back to what I said before let's never underestimate our power in the United States knowledge and military power we're in economic power and if we continue to apply sanctions which deny Iran and countries that deal with Iran to our banking system it's going to affect the Iranian economy and then let's never forget that general Hayden very very briefly mr. chairman I'm trying to play catch-up with the agreement and read the fine print this morning it's not at all clear to me that this will not be resolved in New York before the Congressional review period has expired and so we may have the administration going to one delivered deliberative body about this before this deliberative body has a chance to vote but sure if I could just echo that point I don't I don't know the answer to that either the UN Security Council peruse this before Congress even has a chance to vote on it and then what happens are the sanctions and lifted by the European our international partners irrespective of what the United States does I don't know the answers to this as you know this agreement just came out but I think that's something we need to take all mr. chairman if I may say so take the liberty you're raising a really interesting question and it may be that one of the points as you start your deliberation here on this agreement that you could achieve bipartisan agreement on is to ask the administration not to go to the United Nations before they come to Congress I mean that that's that seems to me that our Constitution requires that kind of respect first for congressional consideration I agree on a percent I yield back let's go to Lois Frankel of Florida Thank You mr. chair well first of all I want to thank you gentlemen for this very

at the VA is struggling to bounce back its problems have been well documented a report reveals the hampton VA had some of the worst wait times across the country the hospital says it has made big changes and cut wait times in half today senator Tim Kaine went to check out his progress for himself he joins us now live with our Mike Gooding for today's newsmakers well and Regina a year ago Hampton did have the absolute worst in the nation wait times of more than 30 days today it is now at seven days which is better but still ain't great what did you find there today Mike I definitely found that there been improvements and so the 30-day wait time a year ago for primary care visits was termed was the worst of the nation and dramatically worse than the national average hiring new staff doing some construction for new primary care facilities about to open a facility in Chesapeake they've cut the wedding time to seven which is that about at the national average still a little bit high they've got plans to bring it down i think opening the chesapeake facility will help with that but we still have ways to go and obviously i came there to thank him for the work that they've done but to encourage let's keep it moving for the bigger wrong well look i think some of this is it was a national problem we have we changed the VA director we had to do a national reform bill because the waiting times were unacceptable and they were being gained but people weren't getting honest information and so we had to put a new leadership and that's what we've done shifting gears senator for more than a year now the united states has been at war with the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria you've been one of the leading voices in Washington pushing for the Congress to debate this and to vote on it so far nothing ya have any hope today that that's going to change well I I certainly hope so we need to we're not supposed to be at war without a declaration of Congress and you're right the war started on the eighth of august 3,500 American troops deployed many from Hampton Roads the Carrier Strike Group Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group is there what I had been told by my colleagues in the Senate on the Foreign Relations Committee is when we get over the hump on the Iran deal vote which will be mid-september we're going to turn to trying to finally craft this authorization but you know every day there's news about the war spreading about more atrocities that ISIL is committing it's time for Congress to do the job and actually have the debate and vote but so far it's been crickets it has been i think that there's kind of a backbone issue people know that a war vote will be controversial e1 avoided i have had support in Virginia from senators Warner congressman Scott congressman Ridgeland and others but generally the the leadership on both sides both houses doesn't want to pick take it out and in the 30 seconds until we have left sequestration is coming back October first unless Congress acts do you have any confidence at all well I think we're going to find a deal we may not find it by October first I hope we would find a deal that would lift some of the sequester cuts which will hurt our defense on her new hampton roads are more than most parts of the country and my senator warren and our members of the budget committee working very hard to do that okay fingers crossed senator Tim Kaine thanks for the time senator Cain will be back on TV with Senator Warner coming up at five-thirty for now reporting a lot like getting 13news now

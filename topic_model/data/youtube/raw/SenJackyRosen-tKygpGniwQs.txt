SO THANK YOU. BUT, NONETHELESS THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON OVERTURN ROW V. WADE DOES THAT AWAY A WOMAN'S RIGHT OVER HER BODY AND HAND IT TO ANTI-CHOICE PILULETITIONS. IN STATES LIKE NEVADA, ACCESS, REMAINS PROTECTED BUT THE THREAT OF A NATIONWIDE BAN IS REAL. IT WILL HAVE, IT WILL HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING CALL PRESIDENT BIDEN TO TAKE ALL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS HE CAN TO PROTECTORY PRODUCTIVE RIGHTS TO PROTECT WOMEN'S LIVE AND WHY WE NEED ENSURE A TOTAL BAN ON ABORTION NEVER BECOMES FEDERAL LAW. SO ALL OF US HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING EXTREME ABORTION BANS AND ANTI-CHOICE POLITICIANS ROLLING OUT RIGID BANS. FORCING WOMEN TO CARRY PREGNANCIES AGAINST THEIR WILL. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE EXSETTLES FOR RAPE OR INSET OF. SO I KNOW WE'RE TOWARDS THE END AFTER HEARING SO DOCTOR BRANDY MAYBE WE'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION.  BILLION HOW THE LACK OF TOTAL LACK OF EXEXCEPTIONS THESE VERY RIGID STATE LAWS, HOW IT IS HARMFUL TO WOMEN, AND CREATES A BURDEN ON YOU, AND THE PAYMENTS AND THE DOCTOR WAITING UNTIL SOMEBODY IS MOMENTS PERHAPS FROM DEATH IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. CAN YOU JUST SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.  I HAVE A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS. >> THANK YOU. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION OS THIS.  I THINK IT'S IT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THERE ARE EXSENSES FOR THE LIFE AFTER MOTHER. SO OF COURSE, THAT IS OKAY. THAT'S GREAT FOR OUR PAY HADN'TS. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE VERY FEW RESTRICTIONS VERY FEW ALLOW ANSWERS FOR BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ABORTION CARE IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ON THE GROUND. >> AS PHYSICIAN IF HAVE I A PATIENT THAT HAS AN ILLNESS I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TREAT IT RIGHT AND THEN THERE. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT A COUPLE HOURS OR DAYS FOR CONDITIONS TO GET WORSE AND MANY DOCTORS ARE ASKING HOW BAD DOES IT HAVE TO BE. >> WHERE IS THE THIN LINE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR BOTH THE MOTHER AND THE FETUS? >>> YOU TALK ABOUT THIS, WHAT ABOUT IN CASE HE IS SEVERE ANOMNOLLY, WHERE SOMEONE IS FORCED TO CARRY THEIR PREGNANCY AND HOW YOU GO TO THAT. IT'S REALLY A THREAT TO THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF A WOMAN. >> SURE, I THINK I BRING UP A GOOD POINT. EVERY PREGNANCY IS DIFFERENT. SOLPREGNANCIES MAY BE VIABLE AT CERTAIN STAGES, AND SOMEWHERE THE FETUS HAS AS ANOMALY MAY NEVER BE VIABLE. SO WHEN THEY HAVE IT, IT'S ALWAYS NUANCED A VERSUS ABOUT WHAT ARE THEIR GOALS FOR THIS PREGNANCY AND FOR THE POTENTIAL CHILD. DO THEY WANT TO COULDN'T THEIR PREGNANCY? WATCH THAT FETUS WHEN IT IS DELIVERED, WATCH THAT BABY DIE SHORTLY AFTER OR DO THEY WANT TO HAVE AN ABORTION OR A ABORTION LATER. >> THAT DECISION SHOULD BE THAT INDIVIDUAL PERSON'S DECISION. I DON'T THINK I'M ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR HEM AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THEIR FAMILIES WILL WON'T BE ABLUTOMANIA DECISION FOR THEM EITHER. >> IT'S ABOUT ROD TRUTH PRIVACY. BUT IN SOME STATES WOMEN CAN FACE JAIL-TIME, STEEP FINANCIAL PENALTIES. POSSIBLY PHYSICIANS NURSES, FRIENDS OR NEIGHBORS OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MAY HELP YOU. WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK THIS THESE THREATS OF JAIL-TIME EVERYONE ARE GOING TO IMPOSE ON PEOPLE? >>> THANK YOU FOR QUESTION. I THINK I ASSUME MOST DOCKS TORS DENY GO TO MEDICAL TO DO WAIT TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS. ALL OF US TO WANT PROVIDE THE STANDARD OF CARE. HELP OUR PATIENTS. NOW IF ATITIONSES ARE BEING PUT IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO FOLLOW THEIR OATH TO DO NO HARM OR PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES? AND PROTECT OUR LICENSES. THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION. DOCTORS CARE FOR OUR PAY HADN'TS I KNOW I DO AND IT'S HARD TO THINK ABOUT BEING IN THAT POSITION WHERE I CAN'T INTERVENE BECAUSE I HAVE TO CALL MY LAYER FIRST, AND/OR GAME TOGETHER WAIT AND WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE GETS SICKER AND SICKER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LAW MEANS. WE'RE SOMETHING THAT. I'VE BEEN HEARING STORIES FROM ALL OVER. THEY ARE WITH HOLDING LIFESAVERRING CARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL. >>> INCREDIBLE BURDEN YOU'RE RIGHT FOR THE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO CARE SO DEEPLY

so now that the smoke from the last election is clearing and donald trump is gone the republican party has to figure out what it is and what it should be is it going to be the gop of 2006 foreign wars plus corporate tax cuts the party of john boehner and liz cheney that's what it's been for a long time or will it become or is it already something very different from that something new and potentially much broader than what it was that's the question congressman jim banks of indiana has thought a lot about it banks released a memo this week that seems to answer that question conclusively the republican party he writes is no longer an arm of the chamber of commerce in fact it is already the party of the american middle class and we know that because they're its voters consider these numbers 79 percent of mechanics who gave in the last election gave to the republican donald trump so did 60 of small business owners and 59 percent of custodians to the republican party when was the last time the republican party won janitors probably been 100 years at least the democratic party meanwhile has now solidified its position as the party of entrenched power 94 of college professors gave to joe biden so much for diversity on campus so did 73 of bankers and that's a remarkable change as recently as 2012 wall street donors gave more than three times as much to the republican as they did to the democrat it was the party of wall street for generations but it isn't anymore last year joe biden took in four times as much from the finance establishment as donald trump did now congressman banks calls this a paradigm reversal and he's absolutely right about that it's likely permanent huge groups of people have changed how they vote so how should the republican party respond to these facts and they are facts well for starters how about stop sucking up to the people who hate you corporate america has gone mostly hard left so stop doing their bidding don't help the people who want to hurt you and then when you get a minute start representing and defending your own voters find the people who vote for you and do something for them the issues aren't complicated we know what they're interested in control the border demand fair trade deals fight the power of bid big tech stand up for small business and as you do all this denounce wokeness as the moral atrocity that it is wokeness banks rights was cooked up by college professors then boosted by corporations of course it was and that's why normal people hate it all normal people no matter what they look like consider this quote hispanic and especially african-american voters are even more put off by democratic efforts to redefine sex than your average voter hispanic and african-american voters oppose the equality act by ten and five more points than the average voter does and amazingly 42 percent of hispanic biden voters have a negative opinion of the black lives matter movement and their opposition to the nuclear family and their support for defunding the police compare that to just six percent of white biden voters get it not everyone is for this stuff most people aren't and it doesn't break along racial lines at all the memo goes on like this it's fascinating and you want to read it banks ends on a hopeful note he ends this way quote the democratic party today is more vulnerable than it's ever been in modern history the democrats agenda is now shaped entirely by corporate interests and radical elite cultural mores but they still rely on many blue-collar voters that is not sustainable it can't continue quote democrats will keep alienating working-class voters because that's what their donors demand and republicans should welcome those voters with open arms by fully embracing an agenda that is worthy of their support end quote amen it is not complicated

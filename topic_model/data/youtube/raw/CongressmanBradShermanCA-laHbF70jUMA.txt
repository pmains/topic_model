what happened ten years ago ten years ago Hank Paulson in your industry came to Congress with their tarp program toxic asset recovery program the plan was for the federal government to buy toxic assets from you that is to say to buy the worst mortgages in the back of yours Balt if we had spent seven hundred billion dollars on toxic assets we would have lost the lion's share of the seven hundred billion dollars and the effect on our social structure if we were having this hearing and the federal government had lost the lion's share of seven hundred billion dollars everybody in this room would be a socialist that's the effect it would have had on our social fabric instead this house stood strong this house demanded changes they jettisoned the idea of buying toxic assets and instead bought preferred stock and the only reason we got our money back and the only reason that capitalism continues to be the majority of you in this country is because we didn't buy toxic assets but instead by buying preferred stock we got our money back with interest real capitalism is that every bank of every size competes fairly but too big to fail is too big to exist for ten years senator Bernie Sanders and I and I invite more co-sponsors this year have been putting forward our bill to say too big to fail is too big to exist the giant institutions need to be broken up why I'll give you the capitalists reason why the IMF study says that you derive an eight point eight percent cheaper cost of funds because Wall Street knows big money knows that if you're going down you'll be here and they believe we will bail you out whereas a medium or small sized bank if they go down their creditors are not getting bailed out it to the extent they're over the fdic limit let's talk about consumer protection I'd like you to raise your hand if you don't impose forced arbitration provisions on your regular middle-class customers i everyones let the record show that with the exception of mr. Gorman of Rehan went up so mr. diamond that means if one of your customers say had a phony account opened by an overzealous one of your employees and they already had one account with you but all of a sudden a different account got open they would be free to go to court you couldn't we prefer arbitration but we give them $500 to take us to a small claims court so they're free to go to court wait a minute you get a phoney account your credit rating goes down you miss an opportunity to buy a house two years later that house is worth 200 that is worth $100,000 more and you get to go to small claims court about that so you're saying they you will not allow the regular court system to be available to them is that correct mr. diamond system the small claims court is a separate court system you will not allow them to go to federal court you will not allow them to go into a court of general jurisdiction is there anyone I'll do it again is there anyone here that will allow a regular middle-class customer to if they had a dispute go to a regular court of general jurisdiction I see mr. on hands hand went up and it was Corbett's hand went up I want to focus on Ms Maloney's bill for one it would prohibit manipulating the order in which you debit an account in order to maximize overdraft protection how many please raise your hand if I can count on your lobbyists here in Washington you all have them to support a bill that will prevent manipulating the order in which accounts are debit not a single hey thank you the whole bill what bill I okay but this one provision you would support the gentleman from Florida mr. Posey is recognized for five minutes

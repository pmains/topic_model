dozens of military families are living in hotel rooms in Virginia because of a mold crisis on their base a crisis that's been going on for a long time CNN's Deborah Feyerick investigates Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia is the largest in the world home to the US atlantic fleet but it's facing a crisis I'm in essence of adding a war on two fronts I don't feel safe in these houses I've never not felt safe in a house a crisis that has turned dozens of military families their children and pets into virtual refugees holed up in cramped hotel rooms for weeks at a time they call this hotel wing the mold way she was hospitalized displaced families who tell us their their kids are sick after living in rotting homes and bing extend some cases to unhealthy levels of mold jeribliss runs Lincoln military housing a private company that took over Navy family housing seven years ago under the terms of the contract within a two-year period all homes were supposed to be brought up to a suitable level was that done in your opinion and by suitable I mean all of them livable yes I believe it was under the terms of our agreement with the Navy yet military spouses we spoke with tell a very different story including the second story was sinking into the first a story of decaying homes and well-meaning but incompetent maintenance people is it fair to say that Lincoln was simply fixing the same problem over and over and over again it's almost kind of like they just put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig Lincoln knew it was inheriting hundreds of older poorly built homes I understand why some of the families are in this issue I'd be frustrated to some things who went on at an emergency town hall meeting US Senator Mark Warner who himself has a daughter with asthma listened in disbelief it's been 20 years in business and I voted this is not a way to run a business what struck me was here are these Navy spouses with their husbands deployed defending our country and they were living in substandard housing I mean this is not how we should be treating the families of the guys who are defending our country when Lincoln tried to defend itself with its own test results suggesting no mold was present Senator Mark Warner demand and Lincoln fire its mold inspectors telling the Navy to step in and do its job overseeing its public-private partnership with Lincoln many of the families feel that the Navy dropped the ball when it came to oversight do you think that's a fair description I think the Navy if they didn't drop the ball they took their eye off the ball Lincoln representatives were denying there was a problem the Navy was denying there was a problem now all of a sudden there's been a 180-degree reversal and you guys are now acting on it well we've made mistakes and we're not happy about what happened here one of our lessons learned has been in this particular partnership and for the time being that we need to increase the amount of oversight that we provide sort of at the deck plate level homes are now being patched almost 90 have now been remediated for mold Lincoln in the Navy are not doing this out of the goodness of their heart they're doing it because they caught they got caught

Thank You mr. attorney general I mentioned in my opening remarks that the Department of Justice's along with the Department of Homeland Security plays a critical role in reviewing claims for asylum I believe that this system is seriously broken it has allowed individuals to remain in this country under grants of asylum who never should have been allowed to remain here and yet it takes too long to adjudicate the legitimate cases of asylum seekers that's delaying their ability to work and support their families and imposing a huge burden on communities general assistance funds well these asylum seekers are waiting for their cases to be adjudicated I'd like to give you an example of both and then get your response and find out what you're doing with the Department of Homeland Security to improve the system later this month as we who live in New England are particularly aware it will be one year since the terrorist attacks at the bus and marathon the circumstances under which the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing came to be in the United States underscores the need for reform of our asylum process the younger of the two tsarnaev brothers came to the US on a tourist visa in 2002 and was granted asylum on his father's petitions shortly thereafter now asylum is supposed to be available only to those who can show a credible fear of persecution in their home country yet the elders sarnath came to the United States leaving behind his wife and three other children in the country that he claimed to fear so it's difficult for me to understand how he possibly could have met the burden of proving a credible fear of persecution by the country in which he left his wife and remaining children even more troubling are the questions surrounding the grant of asylum to Ibrahim tadashi that is the Chechen immigrant who was killed while being questioned by the FBI agents and local law enforcement regarding his association with the tsarnaev and also a triple homicide it turns out that he came to the US and 2008 on a j-1 visa to participate in an exchange program that was sponsored by an entity in my state the Council on international education exchange and that is a j-1 visa sponsor organization now from the start it appears that todashev had no intention of complying with the j-1 visa rules and indeed shortly after he arrived the council with drew his sponsorship of him because he failed to provide the required documentation with respect to employment that very day the council amane instructed him to make immediate plans to leave the country recorded the information on the federal database that is used and yet despite this agency doing everything correct and despite the fact that mr. todashev was out of compliance with the requirements of his visa he was later granted asylum and even a green card this shocked the entity humane that reported him from being out of compliance with the visa years ago I'd find this very troubling how is it that a young man from Chechnya comes to the united states to participate in a cultural exchange program immediately violates the conditions of his visa is told to leave the country and then is granted asylum that to me shows there's a real problem with sharing of information and with the system now on the other side we have the problem of legitimate asylum seekers and I they have been forced to rely on local governments for the money that they need to live on in Maine for example the cities of Portland and Lewiston alone have contributed 10 million dollars from their general assistance programs to support nearly 4,000 asylum seekers and their families over the past two and a half years while they're awaiting the adjudication of their claims to give them a work authorization so we've got problems on both ends of the spectrum which suggests to me that the entire system is broken what is the Department of Justice doing to work with the Department of Homeland Security to solve these very serious problems well the responsibility for the immigration system I think largely falls into the hands of DHS but that is not to try to shirk the responsibility that the Justice Department has we simply need more immigration judges the number of cases that have been pending has continued to increase an increase of fifty-six percent to since 2009 our budget request will enable ile a or the executive our immigration component to add 35 new immigration judge teams that would increase our capacity to look at these cases adjudicate them in an appropriate way listen to the evidence and make decisions that are based on the facts as they are actually developed we simply don't have at this point the ability to do the job in as timely away as I think we should we should have that ability to do well I support your request for additional resources by frankly if those judges aren't looking at the databases and aren't looking at the information from DHS consulting with the Department of State on whether there should be a credible fear of prosecution looking at whether they're violations of visas adding more judges won't solve the problem I think we need to do both thank you madam chairman that was an eye-opener thank you very much it was very meeting and it also shows when we do immigration reform we have to look at these practical implementations at the local level would mean is paying is stunning senator Shane

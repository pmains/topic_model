secretary blinken congratulations on your confirmation and for your service to our country you identified as the administration's top priorities strengthening global health security and also identified managing a relationship with china as your top priorities i applaud the administration for identifying those priorities but it's precisely why i'm so dismayed by the president's decision on january 21st to rejoin the world health organization an international organization that was a co-conspirator in covering up the 19 outbreak in wuhan parroting the ccp's propaganda and disinformation leading to millions of deaths worldwide uh secretary how does rejoining an organization that aided and abetted china's cover-up strengthened global health security and how does this not send the very regrettable signal as you head to alaska next week to meet with your chinese counterparts that this administration simply is not serious about holding the ccp accountable i think the answer to that is is straightforward our prospects for reforming the world health organization which very much needs it i agree with you uh are much better served if we're in the room and at the table than outside the room yeah i uh when we pull out uh china fills in and when we pulled out of the who who uh is then in a position to better dominate it uh china well we were in the world health organization before uh the outbreak of the pandemic and i understand the administration's position on this and the u.n uh human rights council on engagement i get it uh but i do think it does send a mixed sick mismessage and when you head to anchorage i would urge you to not let them misinterpret that as weakness and i don't uh i don't say that you're weak but i'm just saying that could be perceived as a position of weakness and appeasement i think that the administration is going to have a difficult time when you're across the table from a member of the pulp bureau on that point on the human rights council on february 8th you announced that the u.s was rejoining the u.n human rights council as you know this is a council with china that you admit is committing genocide authoritarian and communist regimes like cuba russia since its founding in 2006 the human rights council has not passed a single resolution condemning any of these countries meanwhile israel has been the target of 90 separate condemnations mr secretary how does rejoining the the human rights council and legitimizing the council which is a platform for chinese communist party propaganda how in the world does that in any way hold china accountable i guess two things one i share your concerns as we discussed a little bit earlier about the council about its um unfairly singling out israel when we remember the council we managed to turn off a lot of those efforts when we were outside the council no one was there to do it so we're much more effective when we're there similarly on china again i i agree with you but it's interesting this is the one area where the council actually has uh put the spotlight on my time has expired but we want to hear the plan gentlemen i yield back i know

uh director in the 1990s was such a golden era why can't we return to the clinton era spending life you agree that uh with president obama that a balanced budget is not a worthwhile goal so let's actually go back to the 1990s let's go back to the early 1990s when we had four percent gdp projected deficits according to cbo we did balance deficit reduction the projection after that was 2.5 percent not that different than where we are today we're at the end of this window we're at negative or at 1.7 so we're a little bit below so the forecast at the time was 2.5 deficits what do we end up with surplus how did that happen economic growth that's exactly why we need a plan here that gets us on a physical economy it's not economic growth happen in the private sector not in government of course and that's what's happening seems to me that the budget that's before us is to grow government but not to grow the prices let's stick with the statistic the projected deficit for the federal government was 2.5 we're lower than that in the president's plan what took us from negative 2.5 percent to a surplus was economic growth absolutely the private sector growth so we need to do both here we need to get ourselves on a fiscally sustainable path downward deficits downward debt as a percent of gdp but we also have to invest in our economy and get people back and that's very similar or is similar to what the plan was in the 1990s it seems to me by the numbers we've raised we've increased government spending by thirty three percent general's time has expired

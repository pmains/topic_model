well listen first of all i think the whole gun control debate is driving uh everybody's buying guns and ammo right now and rightly so i think they're afraid that the you know the the president and the congress are to pass gun control legislation taking the stuff away and so i think that's part partly driving it with respect to this ammunition issue in dhs this kind of got on my radar shortly after i got sworn as as chairman in february and it's now my constituents it's kind of reaching critical mass i think as you have mentioned you're getting a lot of calls and emails on this so in february i initiated through our congressional investigative arm which is the government accountability office i launched an investigation into this issue so i met with the team of investigators they're now investigating reviewing this and outside outside of the executive branch investigation to determine what what is the truth here you know my constituents and the american people deserve answers as to why they have purchased such a large amount of ammunition now they'll tell you look we we purchased five five-year advance contract to save money and that's why the number looks so big now to some extent that does make some sense but we really don't have all the answers right now and this is again uh getting the secretary putting her before my committee uh when we return after easter is again one of the tough questions that we're going to ask her and you know everybody demands and and should just is entitled to an answer to this stuff congressman she's she was asked this before and she she avoided the question she would not give an answer if the answer is simply we're buying you know like what the sam's club does uh were you going by you know 50 rolls of toilet paper um why wouldn't she just say that she would not provide an answer do you feel well i think that's part of the problem is you know the department uh typical or not they're not uh responding to these questions they haven't provided any answers and that's what's very frustrating uh to the american people and then my job is chairman of homeland security is to provide that oversight bring her before the committee demand the answers to the tough questions which is precisely what we're going to do and when this investigation is concluded we'll know what the reality is i mean i can't tell you matt what in fact this is all about other than we are investigating it and we she will testify uh to this when she comes before the homeland security committee uh and yeah your listeners my constituents the american people deserve answers to those questions you um are telling us this afternoon that you will get to the bottom of this you will i'm sure make every effort what happens if she looks at you mr chairman just says i i'm not i'm not answering that question or you don't get an answer i mean what's next i mean how do you compel her i mean we've seen this with holder um you know when he doesn't want to uh to give an answer what what can you do with what is within your legal right i guess uh well i mean the the ultimate hammer i have is subpoena power so uh in order to exercise that power i have to first you know try to get the information voluntarily so she is points she is prepared to testify uh i you know if she dodges and doesn't answer the question then we could subpoena that information so i i do think she i've never you know i do think she'll answer the question uh and you know like you said i think part of this is that they haven't responded to this issue and so the american people don't really understand what this is all about um i personally don't want to believe that you know to the paranoia level that the federal government's going to go to work its own people i just don't think that's you know the case but they haven't adequately responded and therefore raises a lot of issues and and that i think they've created some this problem you know with themselves so that's why i think an independent investigation that i have initiated uh will answer a lot of these questions and i think also the secretary herself yeah can you bring her before the congress will testify and give a response uh you know answering these questions and if not then i do have the power to subpoena texas congressman mike mccall joining us and uh i just want you to know that congressman reached out said listen we'd like to come on the show uh talk about anything that you want that was very nice uh i appreciate that let's talk about uh you know i really do that it's great to have that kind of a relationship i think it's important too that you know because this issue everywhere i go it comes up and i think you know i think that um you know the reason why i'm on your radio show the reason why i was on other radio shows this morning uh is to address this very issue but look you know the chairman who now has via texan is is gonna get the answers and we've launched an investigation we're gonna holler before the committee to answer these questions and we're gonna get those answers you

prayer has played such an important role in our nation from the Puritans who first arrived here looking for religious freedom dreaming of a nation that could one day be a city on a hill for the world to the Constitutional Convention that had reached an impasse until Benjamin Franklin stood up and suggested prayer and certainly the Constitutional Convention moved on from that point to George Washington to his farewell in his farewell address who admonished us as a nation that we should never forget that religion and morality are indispensable supports of a free society and so today on the National Day of Prayer it's important that we all remember how important faith plays a role especially in the world today where we see so many people of faith under attack it's important that we continue as scripture reminds us to pray for our leaders pray for those in authority pray for those who serve in the public sector so that we can live in peace and so today I encourage you to take time to pray for our nation pray for the Peace of the world pray that we have peace in our society and that together we can work together for a more perfect union god bless you

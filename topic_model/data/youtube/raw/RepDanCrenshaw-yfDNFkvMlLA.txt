we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw okay welcome back folks for your favorite kind of solo episode and today we're going to talk about the texas democrats i know we've been talking about them a lot uh but what you probably haven't heard a whole bunch of is exactly what they're against and what we are for uh you know we're going to get into that in a lot of detail but i think we should start off with a prayer we should pray for these democrats who have sacrificed so much who have left their families behind who are now stuck in hotels quarantined with covid and no more miller light i think they're out of miller light and um you know texans understand this at least texas democrats because the dallas the dallas democrat party uh put out a tweet yesterday asking for care packages care packages for the texas democrats that are in afghanistan right nightmare they're not afghanistan they're they're in washington dc at a hotel uh but they need care packages apparently and prayers and love and cuddling um i mean you can't make this stuff up if if i wanted to do parody on this i i couldn't have come up with that i think i'm kind of funny i'm not that funny yeah but i mean that's literally what they're asking for i mean this entire thing has been such a charade um this entire thing has has been riddled with this with this sort of savior mentality right like they're like they're looking down on everybody like they're like they're fighting for a cause that is so noble i mean it's it's it's it's really astonishing and and you're going to understand why after the end of this episode because what they're really fighting against is just really basic common sense reforms and process changes very minute process changes the kind of changes you wouldn't even notice as a voter to be honest so a little background why are they in dc um i'll go into a little bit of an explanation on that every state legislature has rules for a quorum typically enshrined in the state constitution in 45 states the states only require half the chamber to be present to constitute a quorum four more including texas require two-thirds of the legislature to be present so we should change that quorum rules are designed to prevent abuse by a majority of lawmakers who without such protections could convene a snap session and debate and pass legislation without input from the minority but in this case the requirements for a quorum are being exploited for a different purpose which is to prevent considerable consideration of legislation by shutting down a duly elected special session of the texas legislature and they have to be outside the state in order to do it now if they're within the state they could be um they could be arrested and forced into the house chamber so it's always important to note imagine if 50 gop members just skipped work drank beer in a private jet while ignoring federal mass mandates and then held a press conference to spread flagrant lies that have been debunked multiple times and then infected the speaker's office and white house staff yeah i think that kind of backlash would be would be uh pretty immediate um and but now to be honest i don't think it's going well for these texas democrats either i don't think they're getting a lot of love and and i i think they're certainly ensuring that they will continue to lose elections in texas so but they have they have caused a lot of uh confusion and it you know on a serious note it is sad when people believe their voting rights are actually under threat it's sad and it's not true and you don't want people to feel that way but there are a lot of people that listen to these lawmakers that listen to the lies that democrats tell and that's unfortunate i i don't think any american should feel like it's hard to vote good news for every american it's not hard to vote has been hard to vote for a very long time yes we do have a bad history in this country in some states and we have to recognize that but that is not the case now um hasn't been for a long time and there's no reason to pretend like it is so we're going to go through some of these um i think actually you know what let's hear from them i'm going to play you a clip that um when they showed up here they had this big press conference and uh right on the right on the steps of the capitol and um one of my uh one of my guys went up to him and asked him some questions and uh a very basic question like what's the most egregious part of this bill so this is what they said you know this is a death by a thousand cuts just creating intentional chaos uh you can't even vote with a college id one thing two things may not be a big deal you gotta beat like one time you gotta punch one time may not be a big deal but if somebody punches you a hundred times and and and encourage bad behavior we have a 24 hour boating you could drive up and vote at the curbside you can't even use an uber to get to the polls anymore now we're taking steps backwards having people actually go through new hurdles and obstacles to vote so there's a lot of things maybe inevitably fall inevitably falling into a pitfall of a nuanced law i mean i you got to love these responses right i mean they're just caught flat-footed because if if you go back to the beginning of this supposed controversy this manufactured controversy they've never used an example of why it's jim crow jim crow 2.0 they've never used one example they've never said if you do this it will cause this and they make an argument why they don't even try because there's nothing in this legislation that if if they actually said it out loud would constitute voter suppression it wouldn't even constitute it being easier or sorry harder to vote and look let me address this too democrats always um democrats always say this you know you see this in in in the news media if they're questioning a republican on this they'll say okay but why don't why do you want to make it harder to vote like shouldn't why why don't you want to make it easier to vote and they say it with a sort of condescending sense of compassion and they look at you down to you from their high horse um okay here's the thing here's the answer to that question it's already easier to vote okay we want to make it harder to cheat and in the end an election is a game it's a competition and people compete within this game just like any game you have to have rules okay now look i think my wide receiver should be able to run 10 yards further to the right so i could pass it to him and then he could run back in bounds and score a touchdown but he can't because at a certain point you just have to have boundaries on the game just like you have to have boundaries on the election okay so it's not absurd to say that we should regulate elections and and it should be easy to vote but it's already very easy to vote you show up and you vote okay but you can't start adding things in in foolish processes into the mix that undermine the very nature of the competition okay because then that that takes away confidence in the outcome of that competition and that competition is pretty important that competition is our democracy so this stuff actually matters quite a bit and it's quite suspicious that this is the one thing they don't want to regulate right they want to they love regulating you if you're you know if you own a business if you create jobs you should create investments if you create growth for our economy if you bring people out of poverty they don't trust you they don't like you but if uh if when it comes to our border and when it comes to elections it's like whew anarchy i mean why is that maybe because they're driven by power and not policy and principles okay so that's that's the dirty little secret and so that's why they don't have any answers for this stuff right because they don't think through these things so they'll say it's a death by a thousand cuts they'll say it's well it's chaos or something you know and they're like well you can't use a student id to vote well yeah that that's true but you can use your driver's license okay i mean it's it's it's very it's very absurd um you know okay so okay so let's go into some of the details so you know exactly how absurd this is so let's examine what the texas bill actually does number one bans paid ballot harvesting the practice of gathering and submitting complete absentee or mail-in ballots by third-party individuals or paid campaign workers rather than submission by the voters themselves directly to ballot collection sites okay so what does that mean it means i can't hire my campaign staff to go fill out people's ballots for them collect them for them and bring them to the polls okay because because that's there's an obvious element of corruption in doing that that's why and there's no reason why people can't send their ballots themselves okay again you gotta have some kind of rules on the game of the game so that people believe that it's that they can trust the outcome number two requires voter id verification for mail-in ballots in line with in-person voting voters can also provide the last four digits of their social security number if they don't have a driver's license which is still again very few people don't have an id or a driver's license and if they don't have one it's usually temporary for whatever reason here you go you can also provide the last four of your social security number that's a decent way to at least ascertain that you are the person sending in this mail-in ballot okay common sense if you're gonna have voter id when you show up to the polls you should have voter id for mail and ballots as well this is the same controversy in georgia by the way um again very easy to do very it look if you have that many problems with id you've got bigger problems and if there was if there was truly widespread problems with communities not having ids then we should really work hard to get them ids because you need id for everything like if you board a private plane and uh buy some miller lite and come to dc and check in at your hotel you need an id for all of those things just like the texas democrats had to show but they apparently think that you the citizen and minorities especially are too dumb to get id's i don't actually think that they do number three sets uniform voting times for early voting to reduce confusion while expanding hours on the weekend so it's extremely easy to vote in texas um we have two weeks of early voting and uh i i don't actually know what the new times of this are is it seven to nine or seven to seven yeah so it's 12 hours of it's a lot of voting 12 hours of voting um now the only change this has always been the case the only change here in this new law is saying all counties have to be the same right because before we had different counties um with different voting times people got confused they might have shown up um thinking the polls might be open but they weren't you know because they just they just got the wrong words so uniform voting times for the whole for the whole early voting period um nothing wrong with that i think that makes a lot of sense that actually probably makes it easier to vote avoiding confusion as opposed to making it harder to vote number four ensures accountability at the polls by allowing poll watchers to observe election workers improve transparency and confidence in the results so again just it just strengthening the ability of poll watchers to come and make sure that everything is going smoothly common sense number five strengthens the ban on unmanned mail-in drop boxes and prohibits unsolicited distribution of mail-in ballot applications by public officials i think this was a necessary look that was already not supposed to happen in texas but because democrats tried so hard to make this happen over the last year and this is a recipe for disaster the disasters in other states are and the lack of trust in the election outcomes is is because of things like this um people are people get ballots in the mail that they didn't request and maybe they have somebody else's name on it look because voter registration is that's a difficult thing to get perfectly right it's extremely difficult people move they don't change you know they don't go through the address changes they don't do all that it's very very commonplace in states that just mail out unsolicited ballots for people to be getting ballots without their name on it and so it's really that and then that causes distrust in the election because you know that if you wanted to you could fill that out under somebody else's name and cast their vote for them if you know you can do that well then you wonder how often it's happening and you know when people are winning by fractions of a percent uh which is which is often the case in america you know we had a member of congress up here went by six votes i won my first election by 155 votes so every little bit matters every you know so how much you know how much fraud is too much one vote that's how secure these things have to be so that we have trust in them and that we don't go through what america has been through over the last year number six sets uniform procedures for verifying the authenticity of mail-in ballots while also giving voters the chance to correct the mistakes if they are discovered okay so just just just cleaning up some processes there um number seven requires those assisting voters with filling out their ballots to complete a form verifying their identity and to take an oath stating that they will not try to influence a vote one way or another this is one the democrats were really freaking out about because they love filling out people's ballots for them okay it's one of their it's one of their big games um they go to people who look especially senior citizens homes minority communities and they basically just tell them how to vote and they're like look we'll help you and they they they pretend like they're being compassionate they pretend like these people can't possibly figure it out on their own um now you got a question that if somebody is unable to figure it out on their own they might not be in a good mental place to be voting okay that's just that's something worth considering but if we're going to allow this practice then and like sometimes we should sometimes people are of a sound mind but they need some kind of assistance that's fair but you have to at least verify their identity and take an oath stating that they'll try to influence the voter one way or another and again there should be poll watchers to be able to to verify that as well okay number eight ends the temporary emergency measures that were put into place solely because of the pandemic like drive-through voting and 24-hour early voting um these are logistical nightmares i mean you don't need 24-hour early voting again we've got 12 hours a day in early voting that's uh that's more than a lot of liberal states by the way biden's home state of delaware has zero days of early voting so um look 24 hour early voting is unnecessary creates a huge burden on the system and uh drive-through voting is is another logistical nightmare uh how many you need more personnel for that and it's pointless there's no reason to do that so and again why are some of these necessary look a lot of counties in texas took advantage of the pandemic to weaken security measures like i went over that briefly they were trying to implement some of these things trying to mail out ballots to just everybody and second democrats say that there's no election fraud in texas now i think there's less election fraud in texas than a lot of other states but here's the reality here's just the stats on it the texas attorney general's office has convicted convicted 140 people for election fraud since 2005 with 44 open election fraud cases pending more than half of the convictions involved mail-in ballot fraud um also worth noting the bipartisan commission on that that was that studied election integrity in 2005. i think it was headed by uh jimmy carter and um james baker and so it it had a lot of good recommendations that most of america didn't follow and it was very explicit that mail-in ballots mail-in voting in general is extremely susceptible to fraud for obvious reasons um there's a break-in chain of custody and there's there's just a lot of room for error there the the best way to have a secure election is to have people show up with an id and you and and then you have a mechanism to make sure they can't vote twice you know i always like to point out in the united states actually ran unbelievably secure elections uh in fair elections in iraq and what i think that was also 2005. and uh we did it because we made them show an id and after they voted they they got a an ink stain on their finger that showed that they'd voted very simple so and they had to be there in person very simple this worked still a lot of problems in iraq after that obviously but it wasn't because they didn't trust the outcome the elections so it's worth going into so that that's that's the basis now you guys know now you guys know what the democrats are against and uh they can spin that stuff however they want but that's i i just read in very plain language what exactly these things do so what do they want so obviously they don't want all that stuff i just said well what do they want they want hr1 at the federal level and that's what texas democrats say they're up here fighting for they say they think congress needs to come save them right so they need care packages in their hotel and then and they need a u.s congress to save texas because texas is uh it's terrible down there all these businesses and people keep moving there and starting lives and going to church and being free it is oh i mean it is hot other than that i don't know i think it's pretty great but um but would you rather be super hot or super cold i don't know would you rather live in canada i don't think so i'd rather live in texas so hr1 what does that do it basically um it's the opposite of everything we just said it's um it basically makes it impossible to secure elections that's the real goal it sort of makes it um extremely difficult and uh to do basic things um to secure elections we'll go over some of these it also puts some federal money taxpayer money into campaign coffers great for politicians uh but also pretty corrupt i think and um probably not what you think should happen with your with your taxpayer dollars so i'm going to i'm going to give you we've done a lot of these before um an explanation so you don't have to keep listening if you don't want to but i'm going to go through some of the some of the things on here for hr1 so again it provides taxpayer money to congressional campaigns what do i mean by that it's a six to one match of small dollar donations to congressional campaigns and establishes a voucher pilot program that would give eligible voters just 25 25 to give to whatever campaign they want um i think that's ridiculous so a small dollar donation is what 200 um that means that if you gave me 200 then i would get twelve hundred dollars from the federal government so again great for my campaign i'd make a ton of money off of this but i don't think that's what you would want from your with your taxpayer dollars it uh it overrules and like i said it makes it hard to secure elections so it overrules election practices that have been tailored for thousands of different localities across the country including requiring same-day road just registration without any integrity measures like some places some places do same-day registration i i think it's possible to do that correctly and safely but um it kind of depends on where you're at and it depends on what other mechanisms are in place at the state level whether whether that's a a a process that can be corrupted or not um it it's this would just this would just this would just force it upon states that haven't really dealt with it before um and with no integrity measures in place and and frankly cause chaos um it under vin undermines voter id at the polls and prohibiting it actually in absentee voting so again the opposite of what we're passing in georgia and texas where we say look if you're doing absentee ballots if you're doing a mail-in ballot have have an id associated with that or last four year social this says it's prohibited it also mandates that states allow ballot harvesting permanently locks in nationwide no excuse mail and ballot voting while lengthening post-election uncertainty so no excuse mail-in ballot so so what does that mean it it it means anybody would be able to request a mail-in ballot and a lot of states not anybody can request a mail-in ballot like in texas you got to be a senior citizen or have some kind of um disability so you you end up with a situation that looks a lot like california their entire election system is basically an honor system it's uh no official id required to register or vote and 87 of the ballots are cast by mail yeah you just you just go um you know they assume that if you registered and so they did they have a list of names and you go and you say one of those names and they'll they'll count your vote they they don't ask for id the other thing hr one does is politicize the fec changes which is a neutral body federal federal election committee by the way it's an evenly divided six member body and they put it into a five-member panel chaired by an appointee of the president the new partisan fec would also have greater latitude to determine what speech is campaign related and um they would investigate it on a partisan basis so i i believe um uh like free speech groups are against hr one two um aclu the aclu which has become unfortunately extremely left-wing partisan is even against this so that says something they're against it because it's such massive infringement on on free speech so what else does it do reduces the integrity of the voter rolls by restricting states ability to maintain voter roll records and ensure voter identity and accuracy right because there's this myth and democrat circles that every time we want to clean up voter rolls it's it's it's just to purge voters we don't like that's not true hasn't been true uh for a very long time um forces states to automatically register convicted felo felons upon release from prison democrats are really into prisoners getting to vote um also mandate states automatically register 16 and 17 year olds despite federal law requirements that voters be 18 years of age so yeah they think uh 16 year olds should vote again what's the what's the limiting principle here i'm still not sure we in america 18 is is when you're adult um it's when you can join the military but uh they they think 16 is when you should vote okay um maybe because they believe that more 16 year olds will vote for them that's the obvious reason also creates numerous private rights of action that pave the way for trial lawyers to sue when the results of an election are not to their liking um this is a common theme in most democrat policy making is um creates a lot of excess liability uh whether for a business whether for a state and like in this case for elections but it's something you notice quite a bit because that's also why a huge amount of democrat donations come from the from the lawyer space so it's the opposite of everything that's happening in texas um in georgia i i do think this is inevitable um these people have to come back to texas eventually and they will be forced into quorum but they got to make their stand and they hopefully got some care packages along the way to ease their suffering that's all folks thanks for listening

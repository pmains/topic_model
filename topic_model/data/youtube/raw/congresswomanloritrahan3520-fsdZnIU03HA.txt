good morning everyone and thank you for tuning in to today's critical discussion i'm congresswoman laurie trahan and i'm so thrilled to be joined by two incredible panelists uh pam wilmot from common cause and quinton pelfrey from the voter protection corps for a conversation where we're going to focus on the myths and the disinformation that has been spreading online and frankly from the president directly regarding this year's election as you know by now we're just five days away from the most consequential election of our lifetime and voting has been underway here in massachusetts for weeks with early voting set to conclude tomorrow across our country more than 78 million people have already cast their votes including nearly 2 million people here in the commonwealth just to put those numbers in perspective that means we've already surpassed more than half of the total number of votes cast in the 2016 election both in massachusetts and around the country those numbers indicate that we are likely seeing historic voter turnout in this election something everyone should be able to agree is good for our democracy but here's why today's conversation is so important we've seen everything from erroneous claims that voting by mail will increase voter fraud uh to the arrests of individuals running robocalls designed to suppress voter turnout or sway voters from supporting a particular candidate nearly two-thirds of all votes that have been reported so far were cast using mail-in or absentee ballots and people with nefarious intentions are purposely attempting to spread disinformation that threatens to undermine the integrity of our election and even intimidate people into not voting you know just last week fbi and intelligence community officials informed us that iran was behind threatening emails sent to democratic voters in some states designed to intimidate them into not voting or to vote against joe biden they also said that both iran and russia had gotten a hold of voter registration information in some states while this doesn't necessarily mean that they had to hack into any system since some of this information is already publicly available it does mean that they could have the ability to target disinformation campaigns based on voters registration status so my plea to all of you tuning in is that you take what you see on social media whether that's here on facebook twitter instagram or youtube with a grain of salt if it looks suspect there's probably a reason for it and if you know it's wrong don't hesitate to report it most importantly if you feel like your right to vote has been impacted or your rights under the massachusetts voter bill of rights have been violated in any way call the secretary of the commonwealth's elections division at 1-800-462-vote now with all that being said i'd like to introduce our expert panelists because they're going to answer some really important questions today our first guest is quentin pelfrey the chair of voter protection corps and clinton has played a leadership role in voter protection programs in battleground states in countless presidential senatorial and gubernatorial campaigns over the last 16 years he was the 2004 new hampshire voter protection director for the kerry edwards campaign the 2008 ohio voter protection director for the obama biden campaign and has been a senior advisor to numerous voter protection programs at the national level and here in massachusetts as well as virginia pennsylvania and north carolina during the obama administration clinton served as a senior advisor for jobs and competitiveness in the white house office of science and technology and deputy general counsel for strategic initiatives at the united states department of commerce clinton welcome thank you so much for having me congresswoman trahan and thank you so much for your leadership on this issue it is a really exciting time with the election just five days away and as you say we're seeing this voter enthusiasm all over the country and it's just really important we make sure this election's free and fair and that we make sure that voters have access to accurate information about their rights so i'm really excited about our conversation that's right we are too uh our next guest is pam wilmot the vice president of state operations at common cause in her role pam oversees a nationwide network of 30 state offices and advisory boards each of which advocates for a different slate of locally needed democracy reforms she previously served as the executive director of common cause massachusetts where she built broad coalitions advised legislators and state officials and employed grassroots organizing techniques to win dozens of groundbreaking changes she's widely recognized for her expertise on the electoral college campaign finance ethics elections and government transparency laws she also serves as the director of the national popular vote initiative at common cause pam welcome today thank you so much for having me congresswoman um let me just add one other thing since we're talking about voter protection today common cause is a member of the election protection coalition which is the largest nonpartisan voter protection program in the country that features the 1866 our vote hotline and i've been doing that personally since 2004 including in ohio and some other states in addition to here in massachusetts so um a lot of voter protection work uh together i don't think i don't think we could have two better experts on today's call to help guide this discussion so thank you thank you for your time oh let's get right into it you know president trump has continually called for people to show up on election day to join the army for trump and watch people vote now there are actual poll watchers in voting locations on election day but they aren't just random people who show up demanding to watch people vote uh quintim can you explain what a poll watcher is how they're chosen and what the difference is between being a poll watcher and engaging in voter intimidation sure thanks so much for the questions so um all across the country there are different rules for who's allowed to be a poll monitor or in some cases they're called technically a challenger but often there's a rule for somebody to be designated as somebody who can be at the um at the polling location in official capacity either um either in connection with the campaign or in connection with nonpartisan efforts like the election protection coalition to help voters uh as assist in in their voting to identify problems and help resolve those and this is a really important service that folks can uh can do i do recommend that folks get engaged with the election protection coalition that pam just mentioned it's a really great way to help with your democracy another great thing to do is to be a poll worker yourself there are poll worker shortages um in a number of parts of the country um particularly because of the pandemic and so those are great ways to serve and make the elections smooth voter intimidation is a totally different thing it's illegal under federal law it's illegal under a number of different statutes and i do agree that president trump's rhetoric and and don jr's rhetoric around this issue has been deeply unhelpful um and there will be poll observers who can work with election officials all across the country if there is any voter intimidation to resolve it quickly and quietly but what voters need to know is that generally voting is easy and smooth whether you choose to vote in person early or on election day or if you choose to vote by mail this is a system that's going to go really smoothly um and you should be confident that this is going to work very well over the next five days thank you uh it's so great to have that all cleared up you know the intelligence community unanimously agrees uh that russia meddled in the 2016 election and they've already briefed congressional leaders and even the public about attempts by foreign adversaries to do so again this year when a tele intelligence officials talk about meddling they're often careful to clarify that they aren't necessarily talking about the manipulation of votes being tallied but rather attempts to sow doubt in the results of the election so pam can you talk a little bit about how what you have been doing at common cause to ensure the integrity of our elections and what people really need to take seriously over the coming days and weeks with regard to posts on social media or even from the president about unfounded uh conspiracy theories yeah i mean social media is rife with disinformation and misinformation as you've mentioned a chunk of it from foreign actors that are intentionally misleading some of them for partisan gain and some of it just innocent people forwarding things that they haven't checked out themselves or saying something in inaccurate and so it's always best first before you share anything please think twice they'll look at it evaluate it and then second common cause is doing a program to monitor misinformation and disinformation we have about thousand three thousand voters that are online uh volunteers every day combing through facebook twitter um even instagram some of these other things to look to see if there are posts that are inaccurate of course the the media themselves have added a layer of evaluation and things but they don't actually do the job quite as well as i think they say they do so we flagged over 5000 pieces of content and had most of them or many of them removed people can also go to reportdisinfo.org to report something they think is disinformation and sort of uh just do that independently but we um it's it's very um it's it's pretty scary i mean part of the the goal is actually to sew partisan division to create doubt to increase our divisions so it isn't just it's the red meat and it's a red meat on both sides in some ways and i think people just have to stay t step back take a deep breath the system has worked i think it will work it doesn't mean we're gonna have some bumps along the road but we have uh at common cause 40 000 volunteers nationwide that will be at the polls helping um to answer questions on election day as well as these hotlines the parties have theirs uh and i think that um it's it's it's going to be a record turnout and people should feel confident that their vote will be counted i i could not agree more um quentin uh when i've talked to people about casting their vote by mail this year i'm i'm often met with questions about the president's claims that you know increased mail-in voting means that there will be widespread voter fraud this year now i'm usually quick to point out that it's not the case and that there's no real basis for that claim and i'm grateful that you know governor baker and secretary galvin have been quick to do the same but i think it's important that people know the process behind mail and voting so that they hear what actually goes into counting these ballots once they're received so can you take a moment to explain the importance of offering expanded mail-in and absentee voting especially this year and what exactly the process is when a mail-in ballot is received by their uh local election office to ensure that it's counted yeah thank you so much for that question and um i think you're absolutely right um so we've had a very good track record with vote by mail across the country a number of states have implemented it for several years um and their experience with mailing voting even at scale has been extremely positive uh it increases voter turnout including uh voter turnout for both parties so in utah a lot of people vote by mail and they vote for republicans so it's not a partisan thing every independent analysis of vote by mail has suggested that it's it's effective uh and remarkably free of fraud and that's the brennan center that's the nonpartisan policy center so these are these are independent assessments um that show that what donald trump and attorney general bar have been saying about vote by mail is frankly uh just lies um and it is intended to destabilize uh and discourage voters um from voting that way but you know we're in the middle of a pandemic um and it is really important that we make sure that folks are able um to vote uh in a way that they feel safe about um and that uh you know as the numbers are spiking up a little bit i think a number of folks would prefer uh to vote by the vote by mail options um and this is an ordinary process um you apply for a ballot you get the ballot you fill it in um and it's counted like ordinary ballots um and uh i think that the way that we've thought about this is that it's important for voters to have a number of different options so vote by mail has been a great strategy as as you talked about at the beginning a large number of voters have already voted voted and that's good for democracy but as we head into the next five days i think a lot of folks are going to vote in person and that's important too um we're going to have uh you know we're going to have polling places open across the state and across the country we need to make sure there are enough poll workers enough ppe and that that moves moves well but those are good options for voters as well absolutely and you know we're seeing that now i mean the whole point of this is to make uh voting more accessible uh get more people uh to exercise this you know important right uh and so it's uh it's great that in this election that folks are afforded more options than than ever before um a lot of people have heard of the abstain the unsubstantiated uh claims that the postal service is intentionally leaving mail-in ballots in trash cans or down by the river these claims have been repeatedly debunked by media outlets and secretaries of state in both red and blue states but i think a lot of people are concerned about what this kind of rhetoric regarding the postal service combined with the postmaster general's cuts to service are going to mean for the delivery of mail-in ballots um so pam i find myself uh thanking my mail carrier more and more these days for all the work he's doing uh but can you take a moment to explain just how essential it is that people know they can rely on the postal service if they've mailed in their ballot uh already and even more importantly how they can track their ballots yes uh so um mail the mail is very reliable and safe it has been slowed down however i think that is a reality that um even though there were cuts from the postmaster general that those have been um those allegedly have been rolled back but at least myself i still notice that mail is taking a little longer than it has in the past so people should be aware of that but in terms of the security of that that is very clear your ballot is secure it is also secure if you've used a dropbox this is new for massachusetts but there are drop boxes now in most communities there was maybe people might have heard an incident where a homeless person put an incendiary device in a a box that was clearly not intentional it only affected a a handful of ballots which is you know a handful too many but it really um is still a very effective way of casting your ballot we we haven't seen that anywhere else and also many of these boxes are fireproof so to find out whether your ballot has been received you can go to trackmyballetma.com it's a great site it will say you know when your mouth bail it was mailed out when it was received or accepted and frankly if you mailed it back um now you're probably okay because massachusetts extended our deadline all the way through friday after the election but as we get closer to the election and because of the delays if you're you can actually cast your ballot by mail if it's postmarked on election day but it since it has to have been received three days later we're advising people to use another dropping location such as the dropbox um but it is um it i think we are going to have record participation and these are some of the reasons why um and i'm looking forward to trying to make some of these changes permanent here in massachusetts and across the country well well we're with you uh we are your partners uh in that for sure uh and you know we really we voted early uh today you know my husband and i and we brought our two young daughters but you know dropped off our son's mail-in ballots to the uh to the drop-off box because i don't want to i don't want to take a chance either uh as you said you know we have been experiencing some delays and if your vote if you've already put it uh in the mailbox you're probably fine but if you can get to your drop-off box um as we get closer to tuesday i would definitely suggest putting that ballot right in that uh box in front of your city or town hall it's no secret that social media is often a vehicle for disinformation in fact you know platform algorithms on facebook and twitter uh and all the others they're designed uh to keep us interacting with their content longer by any in all means necessary sending us down you know a rabbit hole and creating an echo chamber from which outside perspectives including facts are sometimes unable to penetrate and this can result in an individual developing extreme views that they feel are entirely rooted in fact and it has undoubtedly played a role in the polarization of our country quentin what steps do you think uh social media companies should be taking uh to combat disinformation and and where does the responsibility fall uh and what can we do uh to avoid it yes so um as you as you say the disinformation environment has been increasingly bad foreign adversaries pitting us against each other and trying to confuse voters unfortunately president trump has been one of the key sources of disinformation online and his behavior has been reckless and anti-democratic we have also seen voter suppression efforts targeted at people of color and students and other historically disenfranchised groups online um i want to give a shout out to common clause pam mentioned some of the great work that they're doing on combating uh misinformation and disinformation online and i think that there's really a three-part strategy for making sure that we help voters know their rights the first is that the best solution is to disseminate good information we want to make sure that voters know their rights they want to we want to make sure they know any changes to state laws any changes to polling places and the most effective strategy for combating disinformation is actually just to disseminate positive accurate information i think social media companies election officials and the public all have a role in making sure that people know their rights the second thing as pam pointed out there are listening networks to identify times when information is not correct uh either because of confusion or because of attempts to confuse people and if you're interested in a way to help with the election over the next five days signing up for common causes a listening network would be a great strategy and then the final thing is rapid response so groups like the voter protection corps and other voting rights groups all over the country have been trying to identify groups of people who are receiving confusing uh information and and responding to that so just this week we had a campaign to make sure that new hampshire students know their rights there was some confusing messaging and voter suppressive messaging that we saw coming out of the new hampshire republican party and wanted to make sure that student voters knew that they were entitled to vote in new hampshire so it's important for us to give good information listen for bad information and respond with good information that dispels that confusion that's terrific uh and those are good uh those are good easy steps uh that we can all take i mean too often you know uh something will come from a trusted source or a friend or a relative um and it'll be shared or will be liked and uh you know folks won't take the time to read it uh and they share it and all of a sudden it it spreads like wildfire and unwittingly folks are uh sometimes spreading uh bad uh or uh inaccurate information um so that's great we all have a role to play uh in all of this you know i'm so grateful uh for both of you taking the time to answer these important questions uh so that we can set the record straight you know before we wrap up i do want to give each of you a chance to talk about any myths or disinformation attempts we haven't already discussed that you feel are imperative to address before election day and leave voters tuning in with some parting words so quentin would you like to would you like to go first absolutely well thank you so much for this opportunity for this great conversation one thing i would say is that disinformation and confusion tends to be targeted at exactly the sad of voters uh who have historically faced other kinds of voter suppression and who have historically been disenfranchised so communities of communities of color uh particularly african americans and latinos are subject to a lot of the worst voter suppression online and those are communities that we need to be particularly focused on as we're combating voter suppression students or another group and as congresswoman tragen just mentioned we shouldn't be repeating this information even if we're trying to rebut it we should be focusing on the positive information and just sort of a little bit more broadly as we think about the five days that remain in the most important election cycle of our of our lifetimes i think that we all have a role to play in making sure that this election is free and fair and just want to suggest a few ways that we can do that the first is to vote make a plan to vote make sure that people in your family and your community go out to vote if you have an opportunity to spend some time over the next few days working on a campaign working as a poll monitor um they're great opportunities through the election protection coalition to work as a poll monitor volunteer to be a poll worker um or just help with the campaign you believe in i think that's an important thing and then i mentioned these listening networks it's great if you can help with common cause to identify uh these uh problematic messages and make sure that we're in a position to respond to them but whatever we do i think we all to wake up on wednesday morning knowing we did everything we could um to make sure that this election was free and fair um and that we get our democracy back on track um so thank you for including me in this conversation and thanks for everybody for tuning in thank you thank you quentin so i think clinton said it very very well um make a plan to vote and do it don't let misinformation and disinformation dissuade you from voting that's the whole purpose of it is to suppress voter participation to sow confusion to um to make people feel like their vote is not safe just go out and vote one thing that i meant to mention during the the vote by mail discussion was that if you have received your ballot even if you received it and mailed it back and it has not been accepted you can still vote in person if it has not been received by your election official you still have the right to vote in person um and they will set aside then that ballot later so use every opportunity you can whether it's coming out to vote early through friday or casting a ballot by mail or in person make sure you participate and then i also agree that it's incumbent on all of us to participate and do whatever we can to spread that good information common cause has sent out texts to 12 million people in the past two weeks with voting rights with responsibilities with the one eight six six our vote hotline which is the number to call if you have questions or uh have a problem and there are legal volunteers standing by if you want to join us with voter protection efforts or social media monitoring protectthevote.net is the way to do that and you know this and also remember that we will not probably have uh i know we will not have election results on election night this year that is one of the big pieces of misinformation disinformation that will be spread and is spreading that there's something wrong if we don't know the final results in fact many states accept ballots well after the election some as long as two weeks and during that period they're still counting the ballots and that is the right thing to do we want everyone to vote so take a deep breath we will get through this uh we may not know the results on on tuesday night but that's okay we will count the vote and we will get get uh everybody involved to the extent that we can and um it'll be an interesting time for sure well uh i want to just thank you i want to thank you both again for taking the time out of your busy schedules especially five days before this um unprecedented election to join us for this important discussion uh i know that voters who are tuning in greatly appreciate your expertise on this vitally important issue and pam thank you for reminding folks that it will be normal for us not to have uh election results on tuesday night because i think managing expectations around what's in store for us next week is so important so that that um you know discord isn't uh sowed uh in our country by you know malign uh uh nefarious actors you know for for those of you who took the time to tune in live or watching this later on i want to thank you for your commitment to just staying informed about this election if you haven't voted already please make that plan to go vote uh it's so important if you've received your mail-in ballot but you haven't put it in the mail yet you know please consider dropping it off at your town's local ballot dropbox or at your clerk's office this will ensure that your vote is counted as we are just five days away from election day uh you can visit trahan.house.gov and click on our voter resource page to find out more information on this and if you aren't planning to vote by mail tomorrow october 30th is the last day that you'll be able to vote early in person if you can't make it tomorrow you'll have to wait until election day and go to your specific voting location so for more important dates and additional voting information please visit the voter resource guide on my website at again trahan.house.gov or by clicking on the link that i posted in the comments and since i'm a mom i wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't close by encouraging you to continue taking care of yourself and being respectful of others we're seeing surges in covid19 in communities across massachusetts and each of us still have an important role to play in slowing the spread of this virus so please continue to avoid large groups and parties maintain a safe social distance when you're out in public and keep wearing that mask and of course washing your hands we are not out of the woods and as we enter the winter it is so important that we do everything we can to slow the spread of this virus so thank you all again stay safe stay healthy and vote alright everyone take care

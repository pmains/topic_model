sure well we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are the heartbeat of the American economy and access to financial capital is vital for entrepreneurs seeking to startup operate or expand their businesses however gaining access to capital has remained an enduring challenge for many small businesses the financial crisis and the Great Recession made the situation worse frankly as capital became increasingly hard to to access from institutional banks in various capital market players and while conditions have improved somewhat in recent years many entrepreneurs continue to struggle with accessing the capital they need to compete and to grow in order to succeed these companies need capital and credit the lifeblood for growth expansion and job creation yet the government continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught in a sea of regulatory red tape created by Washington bureaucrats we know that sixty percent of all net new jobs that have come into this country have been created here in the United States come from these small businesses they're often times S corporations LLC sole proprietorships and small small companies often have those owners also be operators they are working alongside with their with their fellow employees and that sixty percent of those jobs that have been created here in the United States isn't just a one-time blip that's over the 20 years the last two decades that we have seen that trend while Congress has made strides and tailoring the regulatory environment for smaller companies no doubt most notably when we pass with strong bipartisan support the jumpstart our business startups or Jobs Act in 2012 this was a bipartisan bill that was signed into law by President Obama the jobs ax benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital on both the public and private markets the job Act Jobs Act has raised the cap on investors in a privately held company from 500 to 2,000 investors but the limit on the number of investors acting as a coordinated group to invest in a company remained at 100 where it has been since nineteen forty some 70 years 77 years ago as noted by kevin laws of angel list and his written testimony before our capital markets subcommittee quote with online fundraising and general solicitation becoming more common because of the JOBS Act companies are bumping up against the limit more frequently the current limit now acts as a break on the amount of money the company wanted to raise leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table that did not go into startups while HR 1219 the supporting America's investors innovators Act bipartisan bill introduced by the vice chairman of our of our financial services committee representative Patrick McHenry Henry and Nadia Velazquez from New York would amend the cap currently contained in the investment company Act to allow 250 investors for a quote qualified venture capital fund and therefore enhancing angel investors ability to provide important funding to small businesses this bill is a very modest increase to the current exemption that has been in place for nearly seventy seven years modernizing this cap is long overdue and reflects today's capital markets and the in the reality of the increasingly important role that angel investors others and others play to funds necessary to help small businesses grow the Securities and Exchange Commission unfortunately continues to ignore the backlog of good ideas to spur capital formation which is recommended by their by entrepreneurs small businesses and market participants at their from their annual sec government business forum on capital formation this is a form that is put together annually they take in solicit ideas they want to hear from people that are in the marketplace to figure out what in what ways they could go to improve that well unfortunately they have not acted on this and then the SEC s absence Congress must act to promote market efficiency and capital formation I think we can all agree that we support small smart regulation that protects investors and maintains orderly and efficient markets but outdated excessive and unnecessary regulation whose cost outweighs benefits is dumb regulation that overly burdened smaller companies let's provide some regulatory relief by enacting the bipartisan bill that will ease the burdens on small businesses and job creators and help foster capital formation and get Americans back to work and Mr Speaker I also like to note that in a hearing that we had on this bill last Congress it passed our committee 52 22 including with the ranking my the ranking member voting for it there was no dissenting minority views that were that were offered and no amendments were offered at the Rules Committee on this so we've got a lot of consensus and I believe this is the right thing to do to move forward with that I reserve the balance of my

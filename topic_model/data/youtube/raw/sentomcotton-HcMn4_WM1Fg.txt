with five days until the midterm elections candidates around the country are making their final pitches to voters the ones who haven't voted already early among those hitting the trail from Republicans GOP Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas who's been campaigning with Dr mehmen Oz in Pennsylvania and Herschel Walker in Georgia JD Vance and Ohio Senator cotton also has a brand new book out called Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power where he gives his take on how democratic presidents all the way back to Woodrow Wilson have been steering the country down the wrong path when it comes to Military and foreign policy issues he writes for example quote America's recent decline isn't an accident it's declined by design for more than a century liberal Democrats have plotted to sabotage American power these Democrats believe a strong confident America brings War arrogance and oppression not safety freedom and prosperity and Senator cotton joins us now here in studio thank you so much for being here good to have you here it's a pointed book it's a very important is that fair to say you think it's a pointed book I mean you had a lot to get off my chest yeah there's it's very sharp criticism about Democrats and I don't I knew you were very conservative I don't think I I knew fully or realized fully how is contempt and okay word to use how how much contempt you had for these policies and I wonder does it make it difficult to work with Senate Democrats given how strongly you feel that they stand for all these wrong things no not at all I mean look you've got to deal with Senators every day one day a senator's gonna be your adversary the next day they're going to be your ally that's not an issue but yeah I mean going back 100 years to Woodrow Wilson as I outlined Only the Strong uh he was the first president to openly repudiate the Declaration and the Constitution at home that meant that he and the progressives wanted to create this vast administrative state of unelected bureaucrats trying to set the course for our country segregated too he was a horrible he was a virulent racist as well but I'm just saying he was like I didn't like re-segregate things I did and but you know the you can the the left can take his name off the buildings because of that they can't take his ideas out of their movement and you still see that today domestically but you see it abroad as well like when he went to when he declared war on Germany shortly after his re-election it wasn't for any of the many good reasons to declare war in Germany that founding fathers would have cited like Germany conspiring with Mexico to seize territory in our Southwest or killing Americans by sinking the Lusitania or interrupting our economy uh here in America because of unrestricted submarine warfare it was on behalf of abstract ideals and you know he famously said that we're going to make the world safe for democracy and I would suggest there's one word missing from that and I think our Founders would have suggested there's a order missing from that as well America we should make the world safe for America's democracy America's democracy so it's a lot of pointed criticisms of democratic presidents dating back to to Wilson all the way through to today to President Biden just uh FDR and Truman were present during the Allies victory in World War II Obama okayed the the mission to go kill Osama Bin Laden you cite that to criticize Biden for not not agreeing with him but you don't really give Obama the credit I mean there are some things democratic presidents they don't get everything wrong obviously and the older presidents in the 20th century are better than the more recent ones especially the post-vietnam democratic presidents but even with FDR and Truman they cut the defense budget badly I mean our army was smaller than Portugal's Army before World War II well then they cranked it back up same same thing before uh the Korean War I mean we deployed our troops into the Korean War woefully unprepared uh and under trained but but really starting with JFK and it's a misnomer to think that JFK was a strong president he was a a disaster as a foreign policy president but then especially after Vietnam when the left turned not just on American America's founding but on America itself then you begin to see a steady erosion of American power throughout Democratic presidencies of Jimmy Carter Bill Clinton and especially Barack Obama so one thing that I was interested since you bring up Vietnam I was interested to read your criticism of the New York Times for publishing the Pentagon papers um which were leaked to the Times by Daniel Ellsberg who thought that the war wasn't winnable and that the leaders were hiding this from the public and the public had a right to know he first tried to bring it to members of Congress they didn't want to do it so then he went to the Press but here's the thing you're also so critical and I'm not saying you're wrong of JFK and LBJ and how they waged the war in Vietnam what's wrong with the New York Times bringing the failures of these Democratic administrations two of them to the public so they could see what was really going on you're a veteran you know how many Americans died in Vietnam uh when the generals didn't think the war was winnable but they didn't have the guts to to tell the commander-in-chief or to tell the country well it's just another example of the New York Times putting itself in the position of judging what classified information should and should not be revealed which is not its position yeah the Supreme Court decided with them but the New York well they they said that the New York Times couldn't uh be subjected to a prior restraint they said that you could have consequences after that did the public have a right to know of all these failures you you could well about the Pentagon papers itself I would say there wasn't a lot of New Revelations there A lot of it was already well known to the public and it didn't show that the war was unwinnable because once Richard Nixon became president and he took the handcuffs off of our military we in effect had the war won by 1973. we had stabilized the situation the Vietcong had been destroyed as a fighting force Ho Chi minh's Army had no longer gained purchase in the South it was only when he was weakened by Watergate Democratic congresses began to cut funding including a very young Senator Joe Biden that we had the absolute disaster in South Vietnam when we had helicopters lifting off our Embassy there in 1975. well on that subject you compared that to the boxed withdrawal from Afghanistan under the by the administration I want to share with you something that a fellow veteran Republican congressman Adam kinzinger tweeted he said I blame both Trump for this moment coming and Biden for this botched ending I'm not picking signs because both sides have failed you it's the truth about Afghanistan do you hold president Trump accountable at all for that peace treaty that he and secretary Pompeo negotiated with the talibans which Biden inherited and you might remember Trump wanted to have the Taliban leaders come to Camp David right near the anniversary of 9 11. no it's President Biden who's responsible for what happened last year in Afghanistan as I write in Only the Strong that agreement was not without flaw but it was based on conditions on the ground which the Taliban was not meeting in 2021 I think a lot of what happened in 2021 is that Joe Biden had a chip on his shoulder going back to 2009 that Barack Obama had sided with military advisors like Stan mccrystal and Dave Petraeus and added troops to Afghanistan and Bob Gates the secretary and Bob Gates and Hillary Clinton and everyone else and Joe Biden was the one person 2009 who kept kind of poisoning the well between President Obama and a senior military leader saying you got to get out you can't do this I thought the generals were blaming him yeah and he wanted to prove he wanted to prove that he was right and we had numerous instances of testimony after the collapse in Afghanistan last year of secretary Austin and general milley and general McKenzie and other saying that their best advice is that we keep a small contingent in Afghanistan that we keep military con or I'm sorry civilian contractors there to keep the Afghan Air Force flying so they can provide air cover for the Afghan troops even most of the advisors my understanding is in the White House and the state department advised Joe Biden against this course of action right but you you don't hold Trump responsible for that you say it's a flawed treaty but I think in the end it was Joe Biden's decision commander-in-chief last year so first of all this underlines why you should be coming on CNN more so that we can have these conversations because it's good for people to hear from you not just on Fox or in Arkansas I know you're not going to announce on my show that you're running for president in 2024. but two questions questions does Trump's decision as to whether or not he's going to run will that play any role in whether or not you decide to run and do you think you'd make a good president those are out I'll just say say two things first we have an election five days from now sure and that's where my focus is there'll be time after that election to think about the 2024 election but anyone who thinks they can be president and wants to run for President should check out a copy of Only the Strong so they can learn how to restore American power all right your publisher is going to be very happy with that I'm interested to see what your Amazon rank is please come back it's good to see you Senator both best of your wife and your boys

mr chairman i'll be brief and unfortunately like everybody else i've got another issue to go to i do welcome the administrator here i do agree that it's one of the most difficult jobs i i once said i didn't know whether offer congratulations or condolences on the job but i'm glad you're there you've worked a lot with us in vermont you've and since the lake champlain designation act 20 years ago epa has been a strong partner in the cleanup of lake champlain i think both vermont and new york have valued that we've worked with republican democratic administrations republican and democratic governors now like to identify and dress the quality of lake champlain we want to preserve it we think it's a natural wonder but it's also an integral part of our economy so i thank you for your help helping facilitate a movement on the echo grant in vermont i understand this these funds may be available the first part of april which will be very helpful in that program the agency's interest in lake champlain is stronger than ever especially with your move earlier this year to acquire a new pros phosphorus tmdl plan be written by epa and i know that vermont and the vermont the governor's office will be working closely with you on that but we welcome epa's participation but we also want to see a commitment when epa budget for other watersheds has grown significantly over the past few years the budget request for lake champlain remains relatively flat in fact the fy 12 budget request recommends a reduction from the level in fy10 so i hope that i hope vermont and new york can work together on that i know you were disappointed when the gulf oil spill requires you to postpone a planned visit to vermont but i want you know we'll all be welcome we'll all welcome you when you get there and so that's my host statement which may have actually sounded somewhat parochial mr chairman but it is an area of some concern i have talked with miss jackson before about these subjects

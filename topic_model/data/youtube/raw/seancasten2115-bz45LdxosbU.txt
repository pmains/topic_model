[Music] so recently L Iike Francis wrote a letter to the editor at the Daily Herald and she said that in the recent debate that Peter Roskam and I had her son submitted a question that wasn't answered what are you going to do for children it's always struck me that our politicians should be judged ultimately by one question and one question only well a grandchildren be proud of us when I was growing up I didn't have lockdown drills at my school my daughters now do unless your job requires you to kill large numbers of people quickly there is no reason for you to have access to weapons that are designed to kill large numbers of people quickly but let's go beyond gun control and that's also recognized that if we're gonna give the kind of world to our kids that our parents gave to us it means we're gonna leave in the world where climate change is a problem that we solved not a problem we are bequeathing to you to solve let's recognize that we want to give our kids a world where access to health care is universal and not a function of whether or not you can afford it those are the things that I want to run my campaign on those are the things I want to do if elected and I thank you for your question Ellie and I hope I can earn your vote and the respect of your son [Music] you

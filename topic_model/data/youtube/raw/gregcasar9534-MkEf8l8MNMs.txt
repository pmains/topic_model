so far we're incredibly disappointed by a lot of the behavior that cognizant and Google are displaying in an effort to bust our Union all of us are so underpay that we cannot afford the gas child care and skyrocketing local rent that would be required for us to work at the physical location about half of Google's employees are so-called full-time employees directly employed within over half of the rest of the workflows are temporary workers vendors and contractors called tbcs they are paid significantly less offered significantly less benefits and are essentially treated as second class employees it is a way for Google to almost double their Workforce but without really claiming us as workers the people that made Austin Alive music capital of the world the people that run YouTube music for the world are paid very low wages can hardly pay the rent or just trying to organize a union and no matter whether they work for Google or cognizant or whatever contractor they're the people that make YouTube music work and they should be able to share it in just a bit of that Prosperity though right now the vast majority of our department is ready to vote Yes in an nlrb election and an act of retaliation against her organizing efforts our employer is forcing an ends to remote work before the vote which would dramatically interfere with the fair voting conditions mandated by federal law about 20 percent of our Workforce is outside of Austin so either just in surrounding areas in Texas that are not a commutable drive or people who are even hired out of state knowingly by the company and some people who moved out of state after getting hired a lot of those people are proudly Union supporters and we believe that this was an attempt to disrupt our unit and to disrupt our vote [Music] [Applause]

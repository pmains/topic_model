just today the director of the federal bureau of investigation testifying for the judiciary committee told me that cyber stalking cyber assault violence against women committed by using the internet is an increasing problem that's a problem that would be addressed by the violence against women act which i was proud to vote for along with 67 of my colleagues an overwhelming bipartisan coalition on april 26th now that bill is before the house of representatives where it may be watered down indeed the draft before the house is watered down on cyber stalking on protection of women against domestic violence and sexual assault in highly significant ways i urge you to give me your voice because it is so important that you are heard and urge house members to make sure we have a strong and effective violence against women act it has been in existence for 17 years it needs to be strengthened against cyber stalking and cyber assault which is the amendment i added but we need that bill as strong as possible to protect women and others against assault and attack and violence in homes on the streets in our neighborhood i thank you

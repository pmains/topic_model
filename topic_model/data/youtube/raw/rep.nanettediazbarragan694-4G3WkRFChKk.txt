thank you for sharing your very personal story with us for your testimony that was just very moving this issue is very personal I'm the youngest of 11 kids and when I was very young my sister one of my sister's got pregnant at 15 and my this juster got pregnant at 16 and my third sister also got pregnant at a very young age and two of my sisters one at 15 and one at 16 made a very personal decision to give birth my third sister made a very personal decision that it wasn't time for her and she wasn't ready and it was an important life decision that all three of my sisters made and if I talk to them they'll tell you how grateful they are to have the ability to make a choice and so you coming forward today and sharing your story is not easy because when I've had this conversation with my sisters they've told me that it wasn't easy and so having you here today means a lot because I believe it's important that other women regardless of age but especially our young people hear from people like you um and I just want to give you an opportunity if there is anything that you want to add based on your own personal experience or perspective to emphasize why it's important that we hear from people like you and people like my sisters I talked about the issue of reproductive health care and the importance of having a choice thank you so much for sharing as well if I could just address that my story of no regret and the story that miss for nee shared of regret they live in the same world they coexist and I'm only sorry that those individuals that regret their abortion were not empowered to make the best choice for themselves and at the heart of that is choice of the women that do have an abortion ninety-five percent of those women do not regret their abortion and I am part of that majority and I think that the only way moving forward is to trust and empower women by giving them access without restrictions

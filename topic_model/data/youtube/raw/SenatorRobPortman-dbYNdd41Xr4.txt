Mr President uh 12 years ago I stood on this senate floor for my maiden speech I was new to the Senate but I had a sense of what I thought was possible to achieve for my constituents in Ohio having served in the house for 12 years and in two cabinet level jobs in the bush 43 Administration in that speech I talked about my interest in solving problems and working across the aisle to tackle big issues facing our country that's what we've tried to do we've had some successes and some disappointments but through it all I've always considered it a great honor to have been given the chance to represent my neighbors the people of Ohio my team and I have viewed it as a sacred trust to do all we could while we had this temporary privilege our commitment was to move the ball forward wherever possible for our great country and for the families we represented and through our legislative and oversight results I believe we've honored that pledge it's been a team effort I've been blessed with an awesome staff sitting behind me today some amazing Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle willing to find common ground and friends in every corner of Ohio whose input helped me to represent our diverse state maybe most importantly an understanding family and a partner in all things in Jane Portman all of us get asked what inspired us to get into public service in the first place in my family my mom Joanne taught by her example that serving others was our duty we had no choice and through their own volunteer work my brother and my sister have helped change lives and I respect that and respect all the caring and giving Ohioans who do that I chose to serve in a different way which involved the Rough and Tumble of politics not for everybody but also a way to help others another impetus for getting involved in politics uh was actually my father Bill Portman even though he's a small business guy he thought I was absolutely crazy to get into this line of business when I was a kid he gave up his safe job as a forklift truck salesman for a bigger company to live out his own American dream and start his own business he took a big risk gave up Health Care gave up a retirement plan and five people my mom was a bookkeeper started Portman equipment company with lots of debt they actually lost money the first few years but he never gave up on his dream and eventually through hard work and integrity found his niche my brother my sister and I all worked at Portland equipment company in high school and in college by the time my dad retired my brother took over the company there were almost 300 people working there keeping that American Dream alive and creating the conditions to allow that next bill Portman to take that risk to build his or her dream and in doing so help so many other families and help so many communities it's really been my North Star that's what's guided me dad also played a special role in my decision to run for the United States Senate as you'll recall in a couple years before 2010 we had the Great Recession our country went through some tough times I had stepped away from public service at that time I was back in the private sector thinking I would probably not ever run again then my friend and Mentor Senator George voinovich surprised all of you here in the Senate as well as his constituents in Ohio with his decision to retire and Jane and I began thinking about it and traveling around talking to people across Ohio people told me about the real world ramifications of the policy decisions being made here in Washington and how it affected them and I remember in early 2009 asking my dad if he would do it again would he take that risk and start a business from scratch his answer was troubling he said you know he just wasn't sure and he listed higher taxes that were being talked about you know more health care costs more regulations he said I just don't know if it'd be worth it that conversation with my dad was part of what drove me to run for the Senate I believe that the country needed leadership to drive policy in a direction of more economic growth and more opportunity to help more people achieve their American Dream not many people these days would say politics is an honorable profession a recent poll suggests only 20 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing and I guess we all give people reasons to be skeptical especially when we seem too political and partisan gridlock keeps us from solving problems people care about like Energy prices or what's happening on our Southern border but I know it doesn't have to be that way politics is its best can be honorable it's about finding common ground to help people we all have our own views and that's fine and as elected leaders who certainly have a responsibility to represent our states in our constituents but I think sometimes we forget we were also hired to do our best to find that common ground and to achieve results that's what we're hired to do when I need to be reminded about that I think about my political Mentor George H.W bush who gave me my first job in politics first on the campaign Trail and then in his White House to him public service was absolutely a noble calling a way to serve and he helped young people like me see that by his example and working for his son George W bush I witnessed that same commitment to public service in my Senate Office as these folks behind me can recite we have a mission statement and we developed it together and it says the following our mission is to deliver bipartisan results through effective servant leadership with Integrity selflessness and Excellence so all Ohioans can reach their god-given potential what is servant leadership I think it begins with the respect for constituents by listening to them and understanding their concerns and then whatever possible delivering those results for them from casework to legislation during my time in the Senate I'm proud to what we've been able to accomplish for Ohio and the country by trying to follow that formula I'm told by my staff today that as of this week over the past 12 years there are 195 bills that I have authored or co-authored that have been signed into law by definition almost all are bipartisan and the product of the back and forth that leads to that Common Ground not all these bills are Monumental I will say that and my constituents will never hear about the vast majority of them because they aren't controversial and therefore the media doesn't cover it but they make a difference as an example a bill I wrote with Senator Hassan is on the president's desks today about early hearing detection not the most pressing issue to many people but to the Ohio family whose child's hearing loss will be diagnosed early it can be life-changing these accomplishments are a testament to the willingness of members and staff on both sides of the aisle to find a way to achieve Mutual objectives by listening and respecting different points of view by doing that even during a time when there's so much distrust and dysfunction we've been able to achieve a lot together today I want to touch on a few of those areas don't worry it's not going to be 195 but a few of them thanks to the senate formulations committee chairman Bob Menendez and ranking member Rish for working with me on a number of bills including the establishment of the global engagement center with Senator Murphy that's combating the glowing threat of disinformation and propaganda thanks to the leaders of the finance committee chairman Wyden and ranking member crapo for working with me on so many bills including working this week with my friend Ben Cardin on our retirement Bill Senator Cardin thanks for being my partner for over 20 years on successfully expanding retirement savings and a bunch of other issues from hospice to Israel to IRS reform to affordable housing I dragged him into IRS reform he didn't want to do it as a ranking member of the homeland security government Affairs committee I'd like to thank all my committee colleagues and the chairman Gary Peters while we may hail from different states in fact he hails from that state to the north and as an Ohio State fan I'm I have to make that point uh we are friends and we've been able to accomplish a lot in the last couple years from helping protect houses of worship to essential postal reform to combating cyber attacks I've been proud of the work we've done at his GAC where I've served for the last 12 years the bipartisan investigations I spearheaded as chair of the permanent subcommittee investigations with Senator carper led to the end of websites like backpage.com that allowed the trafficking of Women and Children online I also LED efforts to ensure our federal government doesn't allow human trafficking to occur with the influx of unaccompanied minors crossing our U.S Mexican border our bipartisan oversight on the safety of unaccompanied children crossing the border demonstrated that federal agencies must Implement reforms immediately to ensure the safety and security of these vulnerable children our 18-month bipartisan PSI investigation that detailed how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship synthetic illegal narcotics like Fentanyl from China into the United States through the Postal Service led to the successful implementation of the stop Act through a bipartisan investigation we also found that China has been targeting and stealing U.S taxpayer-funded scientific research and intellectual property through its Talent programs essentially American taxpayers have been unwittingly funding the rise of China's military and economy over the past couple of decades well federal agencies have done little to stop it with Senator Carper introduced the safeguarding American innovation act to require the federal government to take decisive action to safeguard our intellectual property our inventions our research here in America it is passed the Senate thank you I'm disappointed certain house members have blocked it and I urge my colleagues to get it enacted in the next Congress our investigations this year also revealed China's malign influence to Target influence and undermine the U.S federal reserve we must do more to safeguard our homeland from the threat of foreign adversaries especially China I appreciate Senator Heinrich for launching the bipartisan Senate artificial intelligence caucus with me to ensure thoughtful bipartisan policy making on AI 15 of our bills to ensure safe and coordinate use of artificial intelligence have now become law since 2015 when my bipartisan Federal permitting Improvement Act was signed into law is title 41 of the fast act I've worked to update our aging infrastructure and create good jobs while expanding and streamlining the permitting process thanks to Center cinema and Senator Sullivan for their passion on this issue and their leadership in passing the federal permitting reform and jobs act to make these key provisions of fast 41 and the permitting Council permanent which speeds up the permitting process for some of the largest infrastructure projects resulting by the way on average with a 45 Time Savings and major cost savings we should expand that I also want to thank the bipartisan group of senators who worked with me on the historic infrastructure bill with a special thanks to my lead Democratic partner Senator Cinema along with Senators Collins Romney Cassidy murkowski Warner Shaheen tester and mansion every president and every Congress in modern times has talked about the need to fix our aging infrastructure but we work from the middle out to form a bipartisan Coalition of 69 members to go beyond the talk and make some of these needed and historic improvements to our nation's roads and bridges ports and rail and upgrade our nation's broadband system and so much more the process to me was almost as important as the substance we did it by focusing on our key principles of core infrastructure only no tax hikes and bipartisan consensus I was proud to team up with each one of you and I thank you for your willingness to find that elusive common ground and so do people in my hometown who have heard politicians talk about fixing the Brent Spence Bridge which connects Ohio to Senator McConnell state of Kentucky for over 30 years we've been talking about it it's at the Confluence of two major interstate highways it currently carries more than 160 thousand Vehicles today which is twice as many as it was ever designed to carry it has no shoulders on the bridge because they've been eliminated to carry more traffic which makes it unsafe and it's still congested at every Rush Hour local state and federal stakeholders have never been able to come up with a way to solve this problem the bipartisan infrastructure law finally pays the way to fix the Brent Spence Bridge which will not only make travel safer and easier for Ohioans but improve the movement of goods throughout the Midwest and actually strengthen our national economy there are so many people I'd like to recognize and an apologies in advance for those that I will miss uh Senator Blumenthal thanks for working with me on the greatest one of the greatest humanitarian and civil and civil rights causes of the 21st century human trafficking we started a caucus and we've enacted a number of bills to address trafficking including ensuring Justice for victims of sex trafficking and holding internet sites accountable to prevent the facilitation of trafficking the one time that Congress has been able to successfully eliminate the section 230 immunity Senator whitehouse's work would be to change the way addiction is addressed in this country by authoring the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act to provide a broad response to the opioid crisis that provides individuals with the evidence-based treatment and Recovery Services they need I think looking at addiction as a disease is probably the most important thing we did in that legislation in addition to the significant funding I want to thank Senator blunt who I see here for his role on the Appropriations Committee for funding the federal government's addiction programs at record levels Senator capito has been right there with him Senator Klobuchar and I work to pass the stop act affected keeping China from Shipping fentanyl through the U.S mail and Center capital and Senator Mansion of work with me to pass important bills on scheduling fentanyl analogs to make sure that it's illegal I've been deeply and personally engaged on the substance abuse issue for over 25 years when I started my own anti-drug group in Ohio that has become over time a model prevention coalition and enacted the drug-free communities act that has helped spur the establishment of about 2 000 Community coalitions around the country by the way I worked on that with Senator Chuck Grassley when I was in the house in fact Chuck took me to Iowa with him to help set up an anti-drug Coalition there that was almost as interesting as going as his guest to the Iowa State Fair when I was U.S trade representative Senator Shaheen and I have worked over the years on so many foreign policy issues as well as Energy Efficiency we introduced our first Energy Efficiency bill in 2011 we've got most of it signed into law in the years since helping reduce energy bills for families and businesses and actually reduce emissions by simply using less energy and I thank my college classmate senator hoeven for his leadership on our Energy Efficiency bill and his all of the above energy approach and mostly for helping me improve my Spanish by adding a North Dakota accent I also want to thank Senator Bennett for our successful efforts on encouraging carbon capture and sequestration our legislation is starting to work to do that I appreciate Senator stabenow's partnership as my co-chair on the Great Lakes task force working with her and all members of the task force we've made a lot of progress fighting harmful algal blooms invasive species and so many other issues important to our constituents along the world's largest freshwater resource thanks to Senator Kane as my co-chair of the Career and Technical education caucus working with me to challenge Congress to do more to address the nation's skills Gap and promote the jobs act to provide individuals the skills they need to get good paying jobs those skills are needed out there we need to focus more on how we ensure that we're not just spending money to send young people to college but also getting them the industry recognized skills that they need Senator Coons Burr and white house as co-chairs of their National Conservation caucus you've been great Partners over the years on our legislation to combat Wildlife for African conserve forests and develop strategies to protect some International Treasures like the okavanga delta in southern Africa I appreciate Senators Warner and King and former Senator Alexander for working with me to pass our historic restore our Parks act which is finally addressing the massive deferred maintenance backlog at our national parks so that some of our nation's most treasured Landscapes memorials and monuments can be enjoyed by visitors and generations to come because of the chips and science act bipartisan legislation I worked on closely with my colleague Senators Young Tillis Cinema and Schumer Intel recently broke ground on its semiconductor plant outside of Columbus the largest investment in the history of Ohio in an investment We Believe will grow over time with the chip sack now in law we can reverse this trend of this critical semiconductor manufacturing capability being sent overseas it's going to create thousands of high-paying jobs here but most importantly to me helps strengthen our national security these remarks will be incomplete without a reference to our work on tax reform as I mentioned when I decided to run for the senate in 2009 Ohio was losing jobs our economy was falling behind my campaign was based in part on a plan for jobs that focused on a number of economic policies including fixing our tax code making it competitive again for American workers and businesses in 2017 one of the highlights in the senate for me was when I was able to work with a small group of lawmakers Pat Toomey Tim Scott John thune helped develop prom the promise with the tax cuts and jobs Act the first time Congress had passed comprehensive tax reform in 31 years it cut taxes for middle-class families reformed our business tax code to create more and higher wages for Ohio Workers and updated our international code to encourage employers to actually bring jobs and investment back here to America I wish it could have been more bipartisan but frankly much of what I led on the international side had absolute bipartisan roots and I believe it worked tax reform helped usher in a period of unprecedented economic growth felt broadly after tax reform and before the pandemic we had 19 straight months of wage gain of 19 or more well above inflation and most of those wage games by the way went to lower income and middle income workers we also had the lowest poverty races who started keeping track of it back in the 1950s and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks women Hispanics it was an opportunity economy unfortunately a lot of those gains have been washed away by the pandemic in an avalanche of stimulus spending over the last two years that has fed the demand side of the economy while supply has been constricted by covid but also by regulations particularly on energy contributing to the highest inflation in 40 years I hope the new Senate will have an opportunity to reset and working with the house make pro-growth economic policies a higher priority I want to thank so many of my colleagues who've worked with me over the years to support Ukraine and its ongoing fight for freedom this is an issue near and dear to my heart and to Ohio as some of you know we're the home of many Ukrainian Americans and other nationality groups that are committed to the goal of a free and independent Europe I want to thank Dick Durbin the co-founder and co-chair with me of the Ukraine caucus and my Republican colleagues in the caucus who are so passionate on Ukraine Senators Graham wicker Kramer cotton barrasso Rish Burr murkowski Sullivan corn and McConnell Johnson Ernst and others and I want to thank all those who joined me on 10 trips to Ukraine since 2014 when Ukraine rose up and threw off a corrupt russian-backed government and turned to us turn to the West this includes two recent sobering visits to you to Ukraine with Senators Klobuchar and Coons in 2015 I authored a book called the Ukraine security assistance initiative which has become the key funding account we've used to train and equip the Ukrainian Armed Forces we need to continue to fund this account and lead the Free World carrying the torch of freedom since Russia's original occupation of Ukraine escalated into a full-scale war on February 24th of this year I've now spoken on the senate floor 27 times every week we've been in session about the unprovoked illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine my most recent speech was last night so I won't go on but except to say that we're at a critical juncture right now and it is more important than ever that we support Ukraine so I'm going to be fighting hard for a continuation of Aid to Ukraine Before Christmas we just discussed so many examples of breaking through the partisan gridlock and getting things done despite these achievements I do worry about the divisive political rhetoric in our country it's important we restore faith in our Democratic institutions both for our own country's sake and so we can continue to be that Beacon of Hope an opportunity for the rest of the world we can rise above the cynicism and the dysfunction we just talked a lot about how that's happening and has happened over my last 12 years in this body we certainly did it on infrastructure as I've outlined we've done it in so many other ways I urge all of us to remember that there is more that unites us than divides us I hope that one of the things we can agree on is the need to uphold this institution and what it stands for I strongly believe that means preserving the legislative filibuster that protects the rights of the minority in the Senate and it's really the only thing that forces us to work in a bipartisan way the result when we find common ground is better legislation that will stand the test of time and not be changed every time there's a change in the majority in this body our country and this body faces enormous challenges whether it's economy and the record inflation the national debt that's robbing future Generations the absence of any real border security and our broken immigration system or the looming insolvency of our entitlement programs these issues won't be solved by one party running over the other and imposing its will on the Senate and the country they'll only be solved by us working together in good faith at the start of my remarks today I said that serving the people of Ohio is the greatest honor of my life over the past 12 years I've worked well with my colleague and friend from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown I know she's important to our state shared we've canceled each other's votes out many times on the floor of the Senate but we've also figured out how to work together and I'm proud of the work we've done on issues that are important to Ohio like the Great Lakes trade enforcement addiction and important judicial nominations like the district court judge we just confirmed this afternoon despite our differences we made progress for Ohio together I hope you have the same type of relationship good working relationship with my friend Senator elect JD Vance JD has an impressive background of service in our military and in the private sector I know he wants to make a difference in the lives of Ohio Workers and families and I look forward to watching him in action here in the Senate I know what it's like to be in public service with young children so I want to wish JD his wife Usha and their three kids well Jane and I support you both thanks to everyone he was served on team Portman throughout my career the first Bush White House the House of Representatives at ustr OMB and here in the Senate we're having an alumni event tonight with a couple of hundred of some of the best public servants ever assembled and Jane and I are looking forward to seeing you all there I have an amazing Senate staff who stuck with me to The Bitter End thank you both in Ohio and in Washington D.C many of them are here in the chamber today I want to thank them for their hard work and their dedication to getting things done they work really hard for the people of Ohio and for our country and have enabled us to be so much more effective nothing we accomplished would have been possible without you I want to thank everyone who works in the Senate and makes it function well whether it's the cloakroom staff the door Keepers the Capitol Police the cafeteria workers the subway drivers all of them in a very practical way democracy functions because of you so thank you I hope many of you can join us at our thank you reception for you on Friday afternoon special thanks to leader McConnell Mitch I appreciate your encouragement over the years your trust in me to take on a leadership role on some important assignments and for your commitment and Devotion to this institution and the health of our democracy none of this works without having a loving and supportive family all of you know that so to my wife Jane and the three people in the world I'm most proud of Chad will and Sally thank you for your unconditional support and the sacrifices you made I'm looking forward to being in Ohio full time spending more time with family and friends the Golden Lamb our family restaurant and getting back to the private sector and somehow I hope to stay involved in the public policy issues we've been talking about today finally thanks to my Senate colleagues who made coming to work every day enjoyable and productive thanks for reaching out to me to work together and accepting my offers to work with you relationships matter in this place I'll miss my colleagues one consolation is that our retiring class consists of good friends who I hope to cross paths with in the real world Senators blunt Burr inhofe Leahy and to me have all made impressive contributions in their tender here I'm thinking maybe we should start a post-senate support group and come January this place loses a great intellect and a great friend Ben sass I think Ben you should hold the meetings at the University of Florida if it's okay okay done so to my colleagues I've worked with every one of you in one way or another thank you for that privilege and Godspeed as you continue to serve your constituents and continue to carry that torch of Freedom forward thank you [Applause] foreign senator from South Dakota Madam president um we all just had the opportunity to hear from our colleagues somebody who I'm really going to miss with his final remarks here on the center of these final remarks but certainly his uh his uh I guess you call it going away speech but I just appreciate so much having had the opportunity to work with Senator Portman I know that as he pointed out the staff not only here in the chamber around the capitol his personal staff all people who made profound contributions to that incredible record of accomplishment that he just talked about that doesn't happen anybody who who works here for very long realizes the incredible contributions that staff make to getting things done around here and so I expressed my appreciation as he did to all of them for all you did to make Senator Portman's time here so productive and um and great to see his his wife Jane a daughter Sally here as well who are all part of this partnership and this team that all of us know are so critical to being able to make a difference here in the Senate and the many sometimes sacrifices contributions that they make on a day in a day out basis but Madam president I Rob is someone I've gotten to break bread with a lot of times during our years together here in the Senate and we become really good friends and I'm going to miss having him here as I said Rob has spent a lot of years in public service serving this country 12 years in the House of Representatives where I first got acquainted with him U.S trade representative director of The Office of Management and budget and finally 12 years here in the United States Senate I've served with him on the Senate finance committee for nearly 10 years and his going I will tell you is a huge loss he played an indispensable role in the historic tax reform legislation we passed in 2017 particularly with the transition to a modernized international tax system our outdated International tax rules had left America's Global businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy in one of our priorities when it came time to pass tax reform was ensuring that American businesses could compete on a Level Playing Field with their foreign counterparts between his time in Congress and as director of OMB and the U.S trade representative's office Rob has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to American economic competitiveness and in the international tax system and he quickly became the lead on that aspect of tax reform and not just on that but on so many aspects on that very complicated piece of legislation our final legislation brought the United States international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors and we saw an almost immediate positive effect for American businesses which which of course means that we saw positive results for American workers and that is really in large part thanks to Rob it's an important Legacy and it joins Rob's long list of achievements in public service some of which he mentioned from restraining unfunded mandates on states to securing resources for addiction prevention and treatment to advancing a pro-growth trade agenda good for American workers and businesses alike he's also been a strong voice for American leadership and values on the global stage especially as he mentioned as a co-founder of the Senate Ukraine caucus better president is sad to see Rob leaving the Senate but he spent a lifetime helping to build up our country and I know his contributions won't end here I'm also happy that he'll have more time to spend with his family and with his wife Jane is terrific like me Rob married up and I know Rob is looking forward to having more time to spend together I also know Rob is planning to get more involved in the family business the Golden Lamb Inn and Restaurant in Lebanon Ohio which has played host to at least a dozen U.S presidents over the years and as I said while Rob's time in the Senate may be coming to a close I know that he fully intends to continue doing what he's been doing throughout his career and that is working to make our country a better and more prosperous place Rob congratulations on your years here in the Senate I hope you get some very well deserved rest in the coming months and I like everyone else here looks forward to seeing your next chapter Madam president senator thank you madam president I also rise today to pay tribute to someone who is literally a friend across the aisle and across state lines now you might not think that the senior center from Michigan a Democrat and the junior senator from Ohio a republican would be friends after all our states share a long and passionate rivalry particularly on the football field this rivalry is especially intense on game day like recently when the Michigan Wolverines defeated Ohio State Buckeyes 45-23 I'm just saying I particularly Senator Portman wanted to say this out loud to make sure Senator Brown heard it also of course my friend Rob Portman may have been cheering and he may never really say this he but you know I'm often wondering if behind the scenes you're sort of cheering both sides on that because he's never advertised it and he has never said it up to this point but let me say today that he is a graduate of the University of Michigan law school now that he's retiring maybe you can say it out loud so we're glad to glad to have you there Senator Portman has been a wonderful partner on issues important to both of our states both great lakes and trade we've SEC we've served as co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes task force since 2017. and we've gone to bat together on behalf of our beloved Lakes time and time again we've introduced in passed legislation to stop invasive species from reaching and destroying our Great Lakes when the Trump Administration tried to slationally all the funding for the Great Lakes restoration initiative we fought back together and we won and since then we've passed legislation to reauthorize the program and celebrated when we secured one billion dollars through the bipartisan infrastructure investment in jobs act the single largest investment ever for the great lakes and it would not have happened without Senator Portman I've always said that the Great Lakes shouldn't be a partisan issue and thanks to Rob they have not been we found ways to work together on the issue of trade as well we fought for American workers when we served together in the house and then continued a strong working relationship when Senator Portman left to become the U.S trade representative under President Bush in the Senate we've partnered to ensure that American workers have a Level Playing Field that included a great Congressional Delegation trip to Vietnam and South Korea where we met with trade officials Senator Portman and I and I got to see Madam president how much he is respected by these world leaders from strengthening our supply chains to securing funding to revitalize communities to promoting recycling to planting trees to funding our community health centers to keeping plastic pollution out of the Great Lakes there is no end to the number of issues we've worked on together Rob I'm going to miss you I have so valued your friendship and working relationship here you have made a real difference but I know you're going to enjoy spending more time with Jane and Jed and will and Sally and watching more Michigan games that you can finally admit you enjoy I wish you the best of everything and hope we're going to continue to see you yield of four Madam president senator from Utah Madam president I have had both the Good Fortune and The Misfortune of working closely with Senator Rob Portman I had The Misfortune of debating him in 2012. he was kind enough to play the part of President Obama in my debate practice sessions he was relentless determined unforgiving and anxious to delve into the most minute facts and figures in order to defeat me and to knock any complacency I might have had out of my heart he more than made up for my debate whooping by tirelessly and repeatedly accompanying me across Ohio and other states drumming up support from my campaign raising money and jousting with the wing nuts that tried to derail my campaign when I came to the Senate I found that many of those same qualities his relentlessness determination tirelessness and ability to dig into the details have made him a singularly successful United States Senator I worked alongside him on several bills on each occasion they became law because he dug into them negotiated the most thorny of issues drove the process to result and never ever gave up we formed eight working groups on the bipartisan infrastructure bill because there were too many conflicts too many subjects too many obstacles for our entire group of ten to resolve without dividing it into parts we could deal with one by one he then decided that he would be a member of every single one of those subgroups knowing that he would be needed to actually drive each of us to a conclusion and a result you see there are some people in politics who believe that a fiery speech or a bold appearance on a cable show and a reputation for fighting the opposition that that's the measure of success not so Rob Portman he came here to pass bills and actually shape policy that would help the American people and strengthen our country he came to fight and win not just to fight and he is one for America time and time again but more important to me personally than all his winning is his friendship his honor and his character he is a genuinely good man and he is blessed to have married an even better woman I will miss Rob Portman in the Senate as I think many of my colleagues know he's been a bit of a stabilizer for me here I will miss him and Jane in the neighborhood of Our Lives God bless you Rob Portman Madam president senator from Delaware founder president I Rise to also offer my thoughts on the career and the service the personality the values of Senator Rob Portman one of a number of retiring colleagues whom I will dearly Miss I was somewhat surprised by the timing of Senator Blunt's farewell address and missed the opportunity to also speak to his departure they have in common an important shared characteristic a passion for getting things done for being a senator who serves their state and Nation who works across the aisle and delivers real solutions stop taxing death and disability that's the first bill that Rob and I got to the president's desk and signed into law under the previous administration it had a very catchy name and it was a simple solution to a problem most of us had never heard of which was if someone who had taken out student loans died and thus was unlikely to repay them and those student loans were discharged as a result of their permanent disability or death that benefit was taxed and the tax attached in the case of one of my constituents to their parents to the estate of their deceased child when I first talked to Rob about this on the floor he said that's a terrible thing we should stop it and from that simple germ grew a dozen different legislative initiatives before this Congress ends we will get the reauthorization of the end Wildlife trafficking Act and the reauthorization of Rob's Landmark work in tropical rainforest and coal reef and coral reef preservation to the president's desk we've had the chance to travel the world together we had a remarkable trip as did Senator Klobuchar to Ukraine although I think our trip was just a little bit more comfortable on the train than yours but it was a memorable opportunity to visit with Ukrainian refugees with our own incredible Embassy staff and to present the Liberty medal from the national Constitution Center to president zielinski and I'm also I must say grateful for your leadership on the respect for Marriage Act which is today going to the president's desk but it was in August as we traveled to five countries in Africa together with our spouses and a great bipartisan group you helped pull together to look at how human development can be the key to wildlife conservation in countries across a continent where too often there's instability that leads to the loss of biodiversity and to an increase in lawlessness and terrorism and we found a way to craft together a potential legislative solution that I look forward to carrying in the years ahead to Jed to will to Sally you have a remarkable debt and to Jane thank you for being such a delightful engaging and supportive partner my wife Annie and I will deeply miss you and Rob as colleagues here in the Senate as a legislative partner and as a personal friend God bless you on the next chapter of your life and we look forward to staying in touch with that I yield the floor Madam president senator from North Dakota thank you uh you know listening to Senator Portman's speech I don't know how you cannot be impressed with his incredible record of accomplishment and it's a record of accomplishment that will stand the test of time and it's it's not surprising because all you have to do is look at all the things he accomplished before coming to the United States Senate so it's certainly no surprise that he has done incredible work over the last 12 years he was 14 years I think in the house and had a tremendous record of success there he was a U.S trade ambassador for President Bush and that has the same status as full Ambassador so for all this time here in the Senate he didn't want me to call him Senator apartment he always wanted me to call him ambassador Department and instead I call him El Gran Toro but that's another story which I'll get to uh and he was OMB director for President Bush so when you look at you know his the incredible experience and track record of accomplishment that he brought here it is no surprise uh that in in his speech he talked about a lot of incredible accomplishments but there's a lot more that you didn't talk about you could have talked for a long long time because you truly did accomplish so many things so many things that are important not just for the Buckeye state but for our country and I'm just pleased to have had the opportunity to work with you uh you mentioned some of the things we worked on and it's interesting because as you were talking about the things that you'd worked on and with and the members that you'd worked with that I would I just took a quick there were more than 20 Senators sitting here and you mentioned every single one of them and many many more I I kind of got the feeling that you probably if all 100 senators were here you probably could have mentioned every single one of them and something that you accomplished with them think about what that says Republican and Democrat I think you could add every single Senator on the floor and he could have gone around and talked about hey you remember we worked on this and we worked on that and not just worked on it but passed it into legislation and in every case something that had a meaningful impact for our country and for our respective States Senator Portman I came here together so we and we've been close right from the start probably a little bit of our shared Heritage from college um we've worked together we've traveled together um you know around the world Place India South Korea obviously Mexico Central America and invariably learned in an incredible amount on those trips but whether it was on those trips or almost any other time I always learned from Rob I mean the guy is I mean incredible experience and a lifetime of learning but such a keen intellect such a keen intellect and somebody who imparts that knowledge to you in the best way possible never coming across with any kind of ego or I know something and maybe you don't or anything like that but in just a friendly helpful great way and the other thing his ability to work with people I've observed and tried to learn uh from it as well I mean it doesn't matter where you're going or what you're doing he takes the time to talk to people and really talk to him not just talk Adam but actually connect with them get a smile on their face that's one of the things one of the reasons that I said hey Rob why don't you teach me some Spanish because we would go to a restaurant and he would start speaking Spanish with somebody and you could just see him that their face would light up they'd smile he'd he'd make them happy and make him feel welcome and warm and always genuine always genuine not not doing it like a politician would do it but the way a person would do it to another person somebody who actually cares about people and that's maybe where I kind of kind of want to go as I wrap up here is that you know all the work you talked about all these accomplishments these things are important they're important for Ohio they're important uh for our country and Beyond but his motivation in doing it was always because he does care about people he recognized the things he's doing and you know you have to compromise or you don't get things all your own way or the way you think it would be absolutely the best outcome you have to work with people you have to compromise to get a result but he always was Guided by the fact that he knew what he was doing did make things a little bit better for other people and that's the right motivation that's the right reason to be here and do this work and so we will truly truly miss Rob um and Jane and their wonderful family and I've gotten to know them all um we're gonna miss you a lot um but I do know this we're going to continue to see it we're going to continue to work on things with you and I'm not sure what he's going to do next but it's just like I started out talking about his incredible record of accomplishment before he got here his incredible record of accomplishment here both in what he's done and the relationships and the friendships he's built leaves no doubt no doubt whatsoever that he's going to continue to do some wonderful and amazing things and I look forward to seeing what those things are Rob we're going to miss you and uh thanks for all you've done thanks for being such a good friend are you before Madam president senator from Minnesota I'll take off where Senator hoeven left off and I was listening to Senator Hoven talk I was thinking what are we going to do John and me without Rob here to give us grief about our joint events that we do between Fargo North Dakota and Moorhead several times we have told Rob that we were heading out to do some esoteric event together and he would give us a lot of grief but then we would always send him pictures of the event to verify that this actually happened and we had a lot of fun doing that I was actually thinking as I heard our colleagues talk about how Rob always teaches and this is something John mentioned he always passes on the torch and my favorite example of that and you're going to remember this story Rob was when my daughter started college and Senator Portman was going to speak at the college because his son was there there and he figured out that she was there and he personally invited her to his talk at a residential college she was a brand new freshman she went in there and sat down she told me how nervous she was two hours later she comes back and calls me Rob has spoken in his typical way in a very very authoritative manner but in a very nice way maybe a little critical of the then president President Obama where he didn't agree with him my daughter freshman in college called me and says mom you know Senator Portman said this why didn't President Obama do this why did this happen that way and I said uh honey and I explained everything and I said Abigail you have lived with me for 18 years and I would hope that you would like give some Credence to what I said you have been with Rob Portman for an hour and a half and she says but mom I will never forget this Senator Portman is really distinguished mom Senator Poorman just has a lot of dignity mom anyway this was a family story for a long period of time and I think part of that was he was able to reach out to students at a school be able to make his case make the world bigger for my daughter in that way just as he has made the world bigger for all of us for me it started with our work on human trafficking under both Democratic and Republican president extended into I remember the work on the usmca and there was a moment where we feared Canada was not going to be it was just going to be usma and as head of the Canadian Enterprise parliamentarian group reached out to Rob and many other Senators but Rob was incredibly helpful in working with the previous administration to work out some details and get that done you mentioned in your speech Rob fentanyl our work together on that you've just been tremendous in understanding that it's two two sides of this prosecution going after the bad guys doing everything we can to keep drugs out of the hands of people that don't deserve to get addicted to them but also the treatment and the what we did along with Sheldon Whitehouse and way back then Kelly ayotte and many others with the first step act and your understanding of the need to work on addiction for me last I'll just say there's no better sign of you or someone that wasn't just as Senator blunt the same wasn't just kind of ending your time with doing nothing far from it everything from the infrastructure bill as I see Center our Cinema here to the work that you've done with so many for me it was your Devotion to Ukraine people who will never know your name who will never know how many times you went there to stand up for the people of their country against the inhuman barbarism of Vladimir Putin I remember standing with you at that mass grave at those burned out apartment buildings the way that you were able to make the case working with the state department for what the people of Ukraine needed and what would work in a thoughtful and considerate way of the people at our Embassy and all the work that they did I remember the joy we took in finding out that one of the top names that week for new babies in Ukraine was heimar and the smile on your face Rob we're going to miss you so much but just as John said I have a feeling that this is not your last act and that along with Jane and your wonderful family there'll be much more to come thank you Senator Portman Madam president senator from Missouri you know it's often said here that everything's been said but not everybody's said it yet this is actually a case where everything won't be said today can't be said the remarkable legislative accomplishments that Rob's made are truly that they are just remarkable and when I was serving early in the house together there's this big retirement bill I thought for a while Senator courtman then Congressman cardin's the first name was Portman all about the Portman carton act the Portman card and this and that I had a little piece we were able to put in it that was called The Simple Plan maybe that's because the only thing I understood was the simple plan but it was it was a helpful plan but we probably wouldn't got it done if Rob hadn't been constantly making the legislative things happen that he makes happen I said yesterday in my remarks I've never served on a committee with Rob Portman house or Senate more than 20 years working together but I probably spent more time with him in meetings as we tried to figure out how to move forward than I have almost anybody else some house leadership meetings a senate leadership meetings I knew so much about Robin not only did Abby and I really know and appreciate the friendship with he and Jane and I knew their kids there was a while I knew the name of both of their dogs that shows you spent a lot of time with somebody if you know the name of both of their dogs and I did that with Rob he has done so well here um I was the whip in the house when Rob was the U.S trade Ambassador and those trade bills are always hard to get done no matter how easy it seems like there I remember the Central American trade deal we took to the floor and like in so many of the case we just decide okay Now's the Time to go I think we're going to get this done today the work is good now we just got to get the members willing to go home and admit that they did this trade agreements are good for the country but often members don't want to talk about them when they got home because you can always find somewhere somebody in your state that might think you could have done a better job negotiating part of this and then the other thing I think that Rob and I had in common and understood I just heard today on on a news radio driving in this morning talking about the new highly competitive States and they mentioned for decades Missouri and Ohio were always considered the two Bellwether States those were the two states I think in our state for a hundred years we voted for the presidential winner every time but one Ohio had about that same record we've also seen a political transition in our states where they've gone from highly competitive were you really out there in so many ways on your own running for office to where just the parties have changed in ways that we may appreciate more than a lot of other people here would I hadn't thought about the support group I'm not sure I hope I don't need that but I sure do need and hope to have the additional times to continue our great friendship times to talk and as several people have said you always listen when Rob talks because he knows what he's talking about um that's a relatively rare currency anywhere and even in the United States Senate um I hope we're going to spend enough time together that we won't miss each other but certainly I'll miss the times we've had to work together on both sides of the building sometimes when you were in the administration and I was here but congratulations on what you've done for America and what you've done for your family and the future of the country I yield back foreign president senator from Arizona Madam president um thanks for letting me just be on in here I'm not even on the list uh I just wanted to say a few comments about my friend and colleague Rob Portman I you know I'm not actually one to come and give a lot of speeches on the floor so this is a big deal and a lot of people have stood up today to talk about Rob's accomplishments of which they are numerous but I want to talk about Rob who's my friend Rob and I worked together for six months straight on the infrastructure package last year which as Rob mentioned in his comments we built from the center out which I am inordinately proud of it is the model for how the legislative process should work in this country I couldn't be more proud of that I think over the course of those six months though I shared more meals and more glasses of wine with Rob than anyone in my personal life ever um and so for that I say to his wife and his children I'm sorry um because Rob and I spent more time together pouring over spreadsheets in the basement of this United States capital than I've ever spent with anyone and I couldn't be more grateful for every one of those minutes Rob in addition to being incredibly smart incredibly focused incredibly committed to outcomes is also a delightful human being and I consider him one of my closest friends in the world Rob I'm going to miss you so much and I can't wait to go ride bikes together I don't want to come to the support group I have no interest in that but what I do have an interest in is spending time with you for many years to come you're an incredible friend you've got an incredible team that you've assembled and I couldn't be more honored and privileged to consider you a lifelong friend thanks I yield back better president senator from Illinois Madam president I'm sure some people tuned in to C-SPAN think they are watching an alternative universe as all of these Democrats come to the floor to say something nice about a Republican but it's Rob Portman a special Republican and a special friend we've worked on many things together over the years but I really think the highlight of it has been the work that we've done together in the past year as co-chairs of the Ukrainian caucus I know that you've been there more often than I have but I also know that your commitment to this issue goes Way Beyond anything political it's personal it's real it's human you can feel it and Rob is the type of person the type of senator who takes his job so very seriously he put me to shame with the map maps that you brought to the floor of the Senate on a regular basis to chart the course of the bravery and courage of the people of Ukraine as they fight for their freedom and their future and resist the invasion of Vladimir Putin and his thugs I know that you've been there to meet with Mr zielinski who heads up the Ukrainian effort and I know as we met this week and many weeks before that when the Ukrainian parliamentarians come to town they look forward to meeting our caucus and particularly meeting the senator from Ohio because they know that he understands their plight and he's a voice for them it must be difficult to be the native of a small country some so distant from the United States that is under constant attack where people are leaving their lives are being turned upside down and innocent people are being killed every day counting on your friends in other parts of the world the NATO alliance and particularly the United States of America they find their way here to this Capitol building with their Ambassador we sit down and we talk about the state of the war in Ukraine and so many times they look to you Rob and they look to our caucus for the kind of message to take back home a message of hope that there are not in this alone of all the causes that I have worked on in the course of my senatorial career this is one that means a lot to me my mother was born in Lithuania as I probably mentioned to you my feelings about freedom and my feelings about the oppression of the Russians and the Soviets over the years are very strong that is being played out today in the course of the war in Ukraine I think President Biden for his leadership and I thank you rob for making this bipartisan honest to goodness that's why it's strong that's why it's credible that's why it's the cause that many of us in the Senate take so very seriously you have made that commitment I'd like to mention one other issue I know that you take pride in your legislative Legacy and you should but back in 19 back in 2013 you made an announcement that sent shock waves throughout Washington he became the only sitting Republican senator to endorse marriage equality at the time the attributed your position to your family and a member of your family who is part of the lgbtq community you said that your son's courage quote allowed me to think about this issue from A New Perspective that as a dad who loves his son so very much well that Evolution came full circle when you joined 11 of your Republican colleagues in supporting the respect for Marriage Act which protects marriage equality under federal law it was one of your final votes in the chamber and a fitting coded to a proud legislative career Loretta and I wish you and your wife Jane and your three children all the best and say farewell to Washington and welcome to Cincinnati or wherever your life may take you next but it's been an honor and pleasure to serve with you thank you Rob and present senator from Ohio I see my colleague Senator Murray is here to talk about more important legislative matters and I just want to say thank you to all my colleagues my colleague from Illinois who spoke and the others who were overly generous in their comments uh it doesn't mean I didn't appreciate it as as I I think my mom would have believed it my dad would have liked it what everybody said but seriously you can see why I will miss this place and why I believe that these colleagues who talked all about the need for us to find that common ground to make a difference for our constituents you know our people who I've enjoyed working with and look forward to staying in touch with so this is a Bittersweet moment I'm looking forward to getting back to Ohio full time with family friends as I said in the private sector but uh I have I have deep respect for my colleagues and I thank them for being on the floor today even though the jet fumes can already be smelled and people are already heading heading back for the for the weekends and their important meetings back home so thank you madam president with that I yield back balance my time now Mr President on one final matter fewer than 40 miles from Ohio's border with Kentucky about halfway between Cincinnati and Dayton is a suburb called Lebanon the corner of Main Street and Broadway looks much like it did almost a century ago in 1926. that's when a young couple Robert and Virginia Jones bought and renovated and unasseming brick building called the Golden Glam restaurant and hotel but the golden Lambs modest exterior conceals major history its prime location on the highway between Cincinnati and Columbus made it a key stopover for important Travelers by 1926 each of our country's eight presidents from Ohio plus Henry Clay plus a long list of other luminaries every one of them had spent a night at this particular end or at least broken bread in his dining room the Joneses small town American entrepreneurial spirit won their family right into the history of American statesmanship as it turned out it also started a family tradition because a few years later those newly minted innkeepers had a daughter named Joan and then Joan and her husband Bill had their own kids and though Bill Portman would pass away just a few months before the swearing-in his son would one day cap an incredible career in government by representing Ohio right here in the U.S Senate and foreign as Rob explained in his Maiden speech he spent his own formative years in and around a different family business Bill risk everything in early middle age to strike out and start an equipment business Joan kept the books and the way I've heard it young Rob's own involvement was as a hand about his Hands-On As It Gets foreign there wasn't just no nepotism Mr President there was negative nepotism one summer break Rob was put to work grinding old paint off the trucks even a supervisor called it quote the lowest job in the place this team this whole team effort grew Portman equipment from five jobs created to more than 300. Rob sell firsthand how growing Prosperity if it's done right can create big win-wins for both small business owners and well-paid workers so there were two family businesses in Rob's bloodline Crossroads were a Statesman hashed out consequential decisions and a company that created jobs and helped workers support their families and our distinguished colleague has spent his career continuing both those things at an even greater scale for decades now from the executive branch to the house to the center Rob's desk and phone line have been the site of History changing conversations just like his grandparents in and he's worked to create a National Climate where Millions more Main Street entrepreneurs like his father can literally lift up workers and communities now I suspect that from time to time robs felt like law economics and policy may not be so different from grinding paint off Rusty trucks but the gifts and talents that our friend commands have been making an impact an incredible impact our future colleague was such a top-notch lawyer that he wound up as a young associate White House counsel and then director of legislative affairs for President Bush 41. then such a whiz at the legislative process that is Ohio Neighbors send him back to Washington as their congressman then such a leader on economic policy that President Bush 43 made Rob U.S trade representative and then turned around and asked him to run the Office of Management and budget so no wonder Rob fit right in and hit the ground running when he came to the senate in 2011. sometimes our friend even fit in a bit too well see Rob has a great challenge for impersonations he spent several presidential Cycles impersonating some of our prior colleagues for Republican tickets debate prep Rob's Talent became such an Open Secret that during the 2000 campaign Joe Lieberman joked he was going to start dispatching Rob to handle campaign stops and instead but the real reason the Rob's impact are his deep knowledge his work ethic and his passion for finding his way through the thick of each consequential issue our friends are focus on growth and prosperity landed him at the center of the most consequential tax reform in a generation and Rob spearheaded the complex overhaul of international tax policy that passed as part of the 2017 tax bill and helped unlock a literal tidal wave of growth reinvestment and job creation spent long nights securing huge bipartisan winds on infrastructure policy not unlike how Ohio State's been 150 years earlier may have discussed internal improvements around a wooden table at the Golden Lab but Rob isn't just a macro level policy quiz who focuses on top line numbers as much as Rob is passionate about growing the overall pie he also knows that Rising Tides don't automatically Lift Every boat sometimes Ohioans and Americans face challenges that call for a special Champion so Rob stuffed up he's been at this one of his body's sharpest early warning signals on crises like opioid addiction and human trafficking he's used Congress investigative powers to craft Solutions and he's built the relationships to make law the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act and its sequels have brought hope to families in Ohio and across the country who have battled the onslaught of opioids to stop enabling sex traffickers act forced big Tech Kicking and Screaming to finally crack down on exploitation and on and on from International Trade to national parks and everything in between even at the tail end of a long session Rob's been known to linger even longer in the cloak room patiently resolving the last few objections to some final policy he's got all the way to the one yard line but even when you get results at this scale even when you leave Ohio and our country a better place late night policy visuals eventually lose their luster when you've got an even more appealing home front we know Rob loves public service but we also know that even that passion comes second to his beloved wife and partner Jane and their three kids Jed will and Fally who I know Rob considers his proudest accomplishment of all for years Washington and Ohio's great gain have been their sacrifice so while the Senate is sorry to lose our friend we can't be too upset that we now have to repay the favor and so Rob congratulations on your outstanding service I was on the floor earlier this afternoon listening to Senator Portman's Farewell Address to his colleagues in the United States Senate and I must tell you it brought back some very fond memories over three decades of friendship between Rob Portman and myself as colleagues as partners and as friends earlier this week we had a chance instead of Foreign Relations Committee to express our appreciation to Senator Portman for his service on the center Foreign Relations Committee his wife Jane was there and I made an observation that the sacrifice that Jane has made and that his three children Jed will and Sally we thank them for sharing Senator Portman with us and with public service I think back about three decades I first got to know Congressman Portman in 1993. when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives an introduction came from former Congressman Bill gratison Bill gratison was a congressman from Ohio that Rob Portman succeeded in the United States House of Representatives I knew bill gradison from my days in the state legislature we were friends we had done some business uh some bills together in the House of Representatives and he told me you know you're going to like this Rob Portman he's the type of guy you're going to be able to work with and by the way I have an issue I'd like the two of you to take off it was a legacy issue for Bill gratison and dealt with hospice care there wasn't a lot of interest in Hospice Care in the 1990s but Congressman Portman and myself got together and we worked on a bill and we followed and Bill gratison's foot footsteps to get that legislation accomplished that was a beginning of a three-decade relationship that the two of us have had in pursuing legislation perhaps our best known legislation is to Portman Cardin pension reform legislation for many years people thought my first name was Portman because of the association with Congressman Portman at the time and I must tell you it was we've got amazing things done to expand retirement savings opportunities we're very proud that several bills were enacted and signed into law but we're equally proud of the process that was used in order to put that that legislation together we invited all stakeholders to join us it was truly bipartisan we wanted to get the best policy and it was that process that led to the successful passage of the first Portman carton bill that dramatically expanded retirement savings opportunities even though it was not in either the Democrat or Republican leadership package we were able to get it into the balanced budget Act I mentioned the process because that's the process that Senator Portman Congressman Portman has always used he's used a bipartisan process to try to bring us together to get the very best possible solutions to problems it's been the Bedrock of his career and that's why he has been so successful here in the United States Senate and so many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed our gratitude for his public service now I must tell you he used that relationship sometimes the moon's issues that were not necessarily his partner's top priority as he mentioned on the floor he got me engaged in the IRS Reform Bill that dealt with the nuts and bolts of the IRS now Mr President I asked you how many people want to be known in their district for improving the IRS services for collecting their taxes but Rob Portman was was the leader on this and he needed a democrat in the house and he was very persistent and we were able to get significant reform done in the IRS when we were both members of the House well as you know Rob Portman moved on to become the U.S TR to become the budget director and then returned to the United States Senate and I was so pleased to be able to partner with him again when he returned to the United States Senate uh on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee we talked about some of his major accomplishments the two of us have worked together to promote the U.S Israel special relationship to fight against anti-Semitism and BDS movement and there has been no stronger advocate in the United States Senate for the defense of Ukraine his record has been unbelievable a amount of accomplishments of getting solid legislation accomplished because he has that ability to work across Party Line he's very engaged on the issues he knows the issues he knows the substance he knows your concerns so we can work it out and reach a common level of an agreement so we get a bill to the finish line so that is why he has had such a remarkable record in getting retirement legislation enacted into law getting trade legislation enacted into law dealing with our National Park Service enacted into law fighting drug addiction which has been one of his major passions making a huge difference on our war against drugs and as was pointed out earlier and I just really want to underscore that his values of promoting human rights in so many cases he has been the key supporter initiator and ability to reach the Finish Line on bills that affect the basic rights of Americans going against such issues as human trafficking and so many other areas so Mr President I just really wanted to take this time to say to my friend Rob Portman through the presiding officer thank you so much for your many many years of public service we wish Jane and you and your entire family only the best going forward you've left the legislature once before and returned maybe you'll return again we'll see but I wish you only happiness and success in what follows your Senate career thank you for sharing your talent with the American people with that Mr President I yield the floor and suggest

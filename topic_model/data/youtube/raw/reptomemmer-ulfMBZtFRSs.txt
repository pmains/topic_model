hello everyone i'd like to take a moment to recognize minnesota atomic veterans day every july 16th we honor the hundreds of thousands of veterans who were exposed to radiation during their service these brave service members risked their lives often in secret developing the united states nuclear program this technology saved countless lives by ending world war ii and served as a powerful deterrent against aggression we work hard to give our atomic veterans the recognition they deserve in 2020 we sent a letter urging leaders in the house and senate armed services committees to issue a service medal to these heroes i'm proud to announce that this month the department of defense will establish the atomic veterans commemorative service medal to finally award these veterans for their service to our atomic veterans thank you for your service we will never forget your sacrifice thank you

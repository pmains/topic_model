well good morning everyone thanks for joining us for this webinar today we're really excited about uh today's conversation about the emergency broadband benefit program uh which is opening up for applications and uh we've got some great experts with us here today who know the ins and outs of broadband policy across the united states and we want to try to tailor this for a new hampshire audience to make sure that our constituents know what is available to them so i want to thank andy kuster for her work on these issues over a long period of time as a member of the energy commerce committee and the broadband task force at the house um and we are really honored to be joined by the chairwoman of the fcc jessica rosa uh who will provide some comments a little bit later uh as well as ed uh bartholomew who uh can perhaps get into some of the more technical uh questions uh that you may have about this particular program uh clearly this is an important time uh to ensure that everyone has affordable access to high-speed broadband it's never been more important to our daily lives than it has over the past year but we know that the experience that we have seen because of covet 19 um is going to remain with us um we are still going to see services offered in a virtual environment whether that's education health care government services and so it's really crucial that all granite staters uh have access to the technology and affordable internet service to make sure that they can access these services and participate in our communities and in our economy over the last year on a moment's notice we've all set up our home offices we've adjusted to seeing friends and colleagues and teachers on our screens we have all gotten accustomed to platforms like facetime and zoom and it's been so crucial to allow us to consult with doctors to attend classes and to connect with loved ones from whom we've been socially distanced for a lot of months um so we've relied on our computers we've relied on that internet service to make our day-to-day lives work and we've all recognized that this is not a luxury it is an absolute necessity moving forward and that's why this program arrives at an important point in time this emergency broadband program was authorized as part of the end-of-year coronavirus relief package and it's going to help eligible households make these connections in an affordable manner uh they will be eligible uh up to fifty dollars per month to help them pay for broadband services uh there's also a one-time discount of a hundred dollars to purchase a device so you can access uh the internet and uh we will get a little bit more into the ins and outs from uh with the fcc but i'm just really pleased uh to be with you all today we want to help spread the word to make sure as many people as possible sign up for this program with that i'll turn things first over to congresswoman custer uh for some opening remarks great thank you so much it's wonderful to be with you chris and i'm very grateful for you including me in this panel and thank you to acting chairwoman rosen morsell and our distinguished panelists wonderful to join you in the rollout of the emergency broadband benefit fund which as chris described will provide critical funding to make broadband access more affordable for granite state families the kobit 19 pandemic highlighted the need for affordable broadband internet in communities all across the state and as chris pappas just mentioned whether it was your kid suddenly going to school online or your college-age children trying to compete and keep up online whether it was you getting your mental health or substance abuse treatment or medical appointments online or whether it was working from home as so many granite staters did over the past year i've heard from constituents all across the state about the need for accessible affordable internet access and i want to make sure that everyone whether you're have school-age children whether you're working from home whether you're a business trying to navigate e-commerce for the first time that you have access to reliable broadband service so i was proud to support the end of the year agreement authorizing 3.2 billion dollars for the fcc's emergency broadband benefit fund to help those most in need gain access to the tools they need to live and learn and work and prosper here at home i'm also proud to be an original co-sponsor of the accessible affordable internet for all act and as chris mentioned i am a member of the house rural broadband task force so i will continue to work on legislation in the energy and commerce committee that will help close this digital divide great to be with you i look forward to the discussion and now i'll turn it over to the acting fcc chairwoman thank you so much congressman pappas and congresswoman custer it is a treat to be with you virtually today um in part because i serve as the acting chairwoman of the fcc so i think it is a priority for the united states to make sure that everyone everywhere gets connected to high-speed broadband service it's also a treat to be here virtually because i'm from new england so um you know my summers are either hiking in the white mountains or the green mountains so it feels a little bit like being close to home and i want to make sure that uh we get the part of the country i'm from and everywhere else connected so there was this time before this pandemic when we treated broadband as nice to have but i think as we exit this time we all know it's need to have for everyone everywhere we all know that there is probably still some students sitting outside the parking lot at a school or library right now trying to catch a free wi-fi signal there's probably someone else who's putting off a telemedicine appointment because they don't have the service necessary to follow up with their health care provider and there might be someone else who isn't signing up for a vaccine because they don't know how to go online or have the service necessary to secure an appointment so the good news is we can fix those things this is a problem we can fix and the legislation late last year created the nation's largest ever broadband affordability program this is the emergency broadband benefit and it starts tomorrow so new hampshire's ahead of the curve and it will provide as much as a 50 a month for households to help them get connected and there's a discounted computer laptop or tablet that's also available we've never had a program this big that's all about broadband affordability and i can't think of a better time to do it so i am excited about this program but i also believe that me preaching about it from the federal communications commission will only go so far we are going to need local people local leaders boys and girls clubs faith institutions people who know what it's like to live in new hampshire and know what problems are in their backyard who's disconnected and who needs to be connected i believe these programs are only successful if we get trusted local officials to talk about them and help people sign up and so this session today is important we want to be able to help you with the information you need to get your friends your neighbors in the granite state connected and uh without spending much more time on my uh soap box here i want to pass it on if i can to ed bartholomew who is from the federal communications commission and can walk through the program in a little more detail before we all answer some questions thank you acting chairwoman rosen morsel and thank you representatives papas and custer i also like to thank today's attendees for joining us this morning this is an exciting and important program and i'm glad that we have an opportunity to share some information about it with you as the acting chairwoman mentioned i plan to provide an overview of the program and talk a little bit about how it's designed to assist households struggling to pay for internet service during the pandemic we'll we'll go through who's eligible how households can apply and i'll talk a little bit about a toolkit that the fcc has developed to aid partners navigators and others directly serving their communities and getting the word out about this important program i'll also share some websites and some more detailed information about how you can follow up with the fcc if you have some extra questions after we're done today as you've heard mentioned a few times already this morning broadband is truly need to have this new program will allow students to connect the classrooms individuals to work remotely and it connects and it can help all of us connect with family friends telehealth services and other critical resources the benefit provides eligible households with up to a 50 a month discount for broadband services including associated equipment rentals such as a modem it can provide up to 75 dollars for households on tribal lands and it provides a one-time discount of up to a hundred dollars for a laptop desktop or tablet purchased through a participating provider if the household contributes more than 10 and less than 50 towards the purchase price and that's been explained to me to mean somewhere between ten dollars and one cents and 49.99 is what a household would need to contribute it's important to note that the connected device must be provided by the same provider that the eligible household is receiving discounted broadband service from as part of the emergency benefit program it's not a coupon or a rebate that can be used at a third-party retail store to buy a device the emergency broadband benefits limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount per eligible household the benefit is not a direct to consumer benefit it's a discount up off of the monthly service bill or device and the service provider who's providing service will seek reimbursement directly from the program the the benefit is a temporary program developed in response to the pandemic and it will end once the program funds are exhausted or six months after the department of health and human services declares an end to the pandemic whichever comes first and as was mentioned it's a 3.2 billion dollar fund if the program itself is administered by the universal service administrative company they also administer the lifeline program which hopefully some of you are familiar with uh usac hosts the application portal and the get emergency broadband.org consumer website so who's eligible there are five eligibility categories for the benefit a household is eligible if a member of the household meets one of these criteria has an income that is at or below 135 percent of federal poverty guidelines or participates in certain assistance programs such as snap medicaid or lifeline and i'll talk a little bit more about lifeline in a moment has received a pell grant in the current award year it is approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced school lunch or school breakfast program including through the usda community eligibility provision in both the 2019-2020 or 2020-2021 school year we know that a number of students have been fully remote so if they were receiving the benefit in the previous school year before the pandemic began that would also make the household eligible a household can also qualify if they've experienced a substantial loss of income do it due to a job loss or furlough since the end of february 2020 and the household had a total income in 2020 at or below 99 000 for single filers or 198 000 for joint filers or if the household meets the eligibility criteria for a participating provider's existing low-income or covid 19 program so many of you may be aware that a number of providers have had low income programs for a number of years and then many develop covid 19 specific programs in response to pandemics so if someone in the household qualified for one of those they would now be eligible for the emergency broadband benefit it's important to keep in mind that a member of the household must meet only one of the criteria i just listed they don't need to check all five of those boxes so to speak it's just one so lifeline lifeline's a federal program that lowers the monthly cost of phone and internet services eligible customers get up to 9.25 or 34.25 on tribal lands towards their bill you can learn more about that program at fcc.gov forward slash lifeline dash consumers it's important to note that current lifeline participants are automatically eligible for the ebb the emergency broadband benefit and in most cases they don't need to apply separately for the benefit but they will need to select a provider and an eligible plan in order to receive the benefit current lifeline recipients cannot be auto enrolled in the benefit program by their lifeline service provider they need to provide affirmative consent before they can be enrolled and households can receive both lifeline and the emergency broadband benefit at the same time they can be applied to the same qualifying service or separately to a lifeline service and an emergency broadband benefits service with the same or different providers so for example an eligible household can have a lifeline supported mobile phone service and a separate home broadband service that's supported through the emergency broadband benefit you've probably noticed i've been using the word household a lot in describing eligibility a household is a group of people who live together and share money even if they're not related to each other if you live together and share money you're one household if you either don't live together or don't share money you are two or more households you can qual a household can qualify because of an eligible dependent child that meets the eligibility criteria so if you remember we talked about school lunch program participation having received a pell grant um that's those are ways households can qualify for a child when completing the application and i'll talk a little bit about how to apply in a minute you may be asked to answer questions about your household and there is a household worksheet that can help determine household eligibility if a household has a bill or other liability for broadband that someone else such as a landlord or property owner or a school is helping to pay the household can switch temporarily to using the emergency broadband benefit to pay for broadband service instead of relying on third party support households within multi-unit dwellings such as apartment buildings nursing homes and group homes can also take advantage of the benefit there are also ways with there are ways within for households within a multi-unit dwelling where the landlord or property manager is the internet account holder and then the household may pay a monthly fee to the um to the landlord or the property manager for internet access they can also take advantage of the benefit and in those situations the they should talk to the landlord or property manager and ask them to work with the participating broadband provider to find out more about the program you can learn more about how the program defines a household by visiting git emergency broadband broadband.org and there's a navigation there and it's under do i qualify and what is a household so as we mentioned tomorrow is the big day beginning on may 12th there will be three ways to apply for the emergency broadband benefit one is to contact a participating provider directly to learn about their application process the second is to go to get emergency broadband.org and apply online a third way to apply is to mail in an application along with copies of documentation that prove eligibility to emergency broadband support center p.o box 7081 london kentucky 40742 and you don't have to write that down it will be on a website that i'll give you in a little bit so you can find it again later as navigators or others serving to help eligible households enroll it's important to remember that assistance with online or paper applications must be provided in person and that the individual applying for the benefit must sign the application and make other attestations in the online portal as part of the application process another important thing to note about this new temporary program is that the fcc designed the program to include some important consumer protections that will prevent things like bill shock from occurring so participating providers must give you notice about the last day or billing cycle that the full benefit will apply to your bill and the date or billing cycle that a partial benefit will apply to your bill in addition to information about the cost of the broad of your broadband service when the program ends so if the funds are beginning to run out providers must start to notify households about the projected end date of the program and how that will impact their bill households also need to opt-in or request to continue broadband services with the provider if they don't opt in to continue receiving broadband services with the provider or select a new plan their broadband service will end once the program ends um this really prevents people from getting an unexpected bill when the discount stops and then it's important to note here too that this applies even for customers who had service with that same provider prior to the program starting so if you were on a service plan with a provider you you begin to get the ebb the emergency broadband benefit you still have to opt in to continue service otherwise your service will end households that are eligible can be excluded but cannot be excluded based on prior debt with the participating providers so if you have a previous overdue balance you can't be excluded from this program and consumers can change their benefit to a participating provider at any time so consumer choice remains you're not locked into the company that you first enroll with however you can only get one eligible device discount even if you do change providers couple notes about providers there are over 825 across the country that are participating in the program the program is open to all broadband providers that meet program requirements not just those currently offering life lifeline services we have both fixed and mobile providers that have elected to participate in the program and you can check directly with providers in your area to learn about their the programs and the service plans they're offering as part of the emergency broadband benefit you can find a list of those participating providers by state or territory at fcc.gov forward slash broad band benefit many providers will be asking consumers to complete the online or mail-in applications that i talked about and those will be available starting tomorrow at get emergency broadband.org but there are some providers that have received approval from the fcc to use their own alternative verification processes to enroll eligible households i want to talk briefly about a toolkit that we developed to help people spread the word about this important program so as the chairwoman mentioned due to the unique circumstances of the pandemic we knew early on that we would need trusted voices and outreach partners that know their local communities in order to drive awareness about this program as this is both a new and temporary program it's important to work together to build awareness about the program itself and the opportunities it can bring to eligible households including hard to reach consumer groups so our toolkit is a collection of social media materials printables and other tools designed to help communities partners grassroots organizers constituent services teams and other navigators in raising awareness about the emergency broadband benefit the tools are for public access they're downloadable they're free to use they can be co-branded adjusted into your voice the goal is to create easy to use materials that partners and others that serve their communities can grab and quickly make use of they're there for your use and hopefully will make discussing the program with your audience easy and accurate you can find the toolkit online at fcc.gov forward slash broadband benefit and in the toolkit we have sample social media posts images a draft newsletter insert a factsheet a flyer a 9x5 info card a quarter page handout a poster infographics audio psas and a powerpoint slide deck that can be used to conduct train

we want to tackle that problem we're going to have deployment challenges and some of the rural reaches of this country that's absolutely true but it's also true that we have an affordability crisis in this country and there are a lot of households who are not online today because they can't afford to go online this program is directed at them and now we hope that we can get uh local actors to uh to

even in a place like Oregon we're now at forty-one percent Medicare Advantage and it's good Medicare Advantage the medicare advantage of high quality you know guaranteed-issue community rating that sort of thing we still have well over half in traditional medicare and if you all could just tell us what you think ought to be done to deal with the fact that i was glad that the Chairman piped piped in that he's a low-cost day too because a big chunk of us on this committee have what amounts to millions of seniors going to see you know doctors and there is a baked in disadvantaged under the reimbursement system for treating those people and we thought it was going to get taken care of in the Affordable Care Act and as of yesterday a big group of providers you know came in and said we sure haven't seen much happen so what would you tell us to advocate for it to try to get the incentives that you correctly identify every one of the incentives and the paying for value that you have talked about um for it's just as of today for a lot of us those three up there at the top of the dais and Senator Cantwell in myself it sure doesn't look very good because it just looks like we're getting another hit from what already is a system that discriminates against us we'll start with you mark and just tell us what you would do to make sure that all states can get the fruits of this new approach that rewards incentives and value well so long as Medicare fee-for-service is paying doctors on the basis of volume and intensity which the current sgr program does your physicians are not going to get ahead and say for Senator Roberts who I've not been de some of his critical access hospitals and Kansas and the way that they want to deliver care the way that they need to deliver care involves things like telehealth involves relying on nurse clinicians and other health providers and set of physicians and those things is you heard from him are not covered under even though we've got ten thousand codes that they don't squarely fit within any of them what will help is a move away from fee-for-service towards the payments that are more tied to what each patient really needs and as well that's why I talked about in my testimony with Bruce and and others on the panel have referred to as different kinds of bundling but focusing specifically on physician services and done I think not as a pilot I think we're past that stage I mean building this into the Medicare program systematically maybe it can be done as an option that people could stay in the traditional fee-for-service system or opt into this more bundle approach to do but I think we're at the stage now where they're enough good ideas out there and you seem in Oregon your state is trying to do this the state has a real effort to move away from fee-for-service and its Medicaid and employee plans and the like and that can be reinforced in in Medicare and can be reinforced in every single specialty and primary care that the ideas are out there among the physician groups I think it's it's up to this committee and leaders in Congress to give the physicians an opportunity to say good how they would make those moves good ideas I'm just not sure they work for those three states and mine unless we take away just bait in advance but that that's what you would do you would be taking you be taking some of the payments that are baked in a fee-for-service volume and intensity and shift them to something else if what is working in Oregon is things like a primary care physician or cardiologist spending more time working together to track what a patient's medication needs are make sure they're on the latest evidence-based treatments and spend time with them to prevent complications the way to do that is to take what's currently in their fee for service payments that doesn't support that you know the payments for the maybe extra payments for the issue imaging procedures or lab tests or things like that and convert some of those to a payment that would go to keeping the patient keeping the patient's needs met and there are good measures for that that's what dr. Coburn was talking about it's not easy to do in many cases especially in small practices especially in practices that are treating vulnerable patients but we don't have to make a wholesale change right now overnight to make this much easier for the doctors in your state so i can target of it yeah let me let me senators getting that is I'm little concerned about but the end of their the discrimination if will will also be baked in yeah look and I think that's his concern it's go to bunt leave me so that's good still be baked in her for low-cost areas heathrow 202 ideas I'm dealing with the senator the disparity of different parts of the country Bruce as as a New Yorker i would probably load lee them want to respond to this issue and Senator Wyden I've talked about in the past and and Mark hit on one piece of this issue that's very critical if we're going to address these issues appropriately and that is until we can adjust act adequately in the data about utilization patterns and outcome for the characteristics and the differences in the characteristics of the patients being served from one community to another we can't fairly say that one place is more efficient than another and in fact if you contrast some of the three and four and five year old Dartmouth rankings of relative metropolitan relative metropolitan areas on their relative efficiency with some of the more recent work done by med pack or by CMS which has the appropriate data adjustments you get very different rankings and you find out that most of the difference in per capita Medicare expenditures from one region of the United States the other is in fact associated with home care and durable medical equipment not with differences in utilization patterns because when you adjust for the characteristics of the patients the differences are not as dramatic has has long been described now I think we have two sets of problems here one problem which is very rare which is very real in which senator Roberts talk about Senator Coburn talked about is I am increasingly convinced that when it comes to physician payment and physician incentives we probably just need to have a separate system for rural communities than we use for urban communities because all of these new bundles and systems of care people are talking about require a degree of infrastructure and a critical mass that as Senator Roberts said is not realistic in smaller community college gobble gobble care like lexi critical access hospitals for example if just reimburse differently than well I'm and I think we have a model and not we sort of gave up in the hospital sector we said four hospitals of a certain so below a certain size serving certain kinds of communities the PPS system is never going to work equitably for them because the numbers just don't work and so we created a critical access category and I think there's no logical reason why we shouldn't apply the same logic to paying physicians in rural communities and figure out what it takes the most important variable with the physician in rural community is not how high quality is highly efficient is but whether he's there or not in the first place so that's less of a problem in on the Allen Manhattan so we shouldn't try to us again developer one-size-fits-all formula for these very different issues on the other hand I think we know less than we believe we do about the causes of variations in Medicare expenditures between the high cost States and the local estates as is evidenced by the fact again that the most recent data shows very different rankings of high cost and low cost than the dartmouth atlas has been showing and the IOM is in the middle of a study which you commissioned to try to look at these issues and disentangle them I think we need to get some better information about these issues and it's in the process of being developed let's Thailand let's do the matter i'll pick on the new york

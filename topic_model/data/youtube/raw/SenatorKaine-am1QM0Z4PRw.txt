a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee Democratic senator Tim Kaine and Virginia good to have you both on board this hour so in what you know we were talking a little bit about the president's handling of sort of the concept that people see from the outside the polls or whatever but he has gotten this done he's gotten this deal through not without a lot of pain along the way but isn't that for the process absolutely and six months ago we're talking about Obama's foreign policy and you'd say the legacy was negative almost across the board now he's got a number of wins the trade promotion Authority got done he's on track to finish this big trade deal with the the Pacific allies you saw of course the Cuba opening now you've got the Iran deal in his last Africa trip was probably the best single international trip that he's had over the course of his administration I I do think this means that this China summit that's coming up is going to be a lot tougher than the Chinese expected because he does want to show he has more strength on foreign issues senator how concerned are you that the president's going to have this become a law this Iran deal despite the fact that he's not going to get a half the support in Congress and that Americans oppose adil according to a new pupil by more than two-to-one margin Joe doing diplomacy with friends is hard and doing diplomacy's with adversaries tougher remember when when Truman said we're going to invest billions and rebuild the economies of Japan and Germany that was controversial when Kennedy tried to negotiate the nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union that was controversial when Nixon said let's go to China and reopen to China that was controversial this is very difficult stuff but great presidents in America have often decided that tomorrow is more important than yesterday and you got to do tough diplomacy even with adversaries in this case diplomacy that will deprive Iran of a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years or more is is something that's worth doing and that's why can you recall any time that any foreign policy measured this important this sweeping David Ignatius said this much of a cosmic bet was so unpopular with the American people I just can't can you well I I think look I think the opening to China would have been unpopular at the time the the marshall plan to rebuild Germany in Japan was controversial at the time I know this when Kennedy was negotiating the nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union right after the Cuban Missile Crisis hugely unpopular and that's why he went to and gave that famous speech at American University this is a very difficult thing to do but you know for me all you got to do is look at the status quo I'm not even thinking about alternatives the status quo was an Iranian nuclear program rocketing ahead nearly 20,000 centrifuges nearly 12,000 kilograms of enriched uranium for at least 15 years in my view this is a dramatic improvement over the status quo it's not perfect because no compromise or concession is but it is dramatically better than what we had certainly better than the path that Vice President Cheney you know laid out yesterday that the track record of that path followed the Cheney doctrine and you end up with an expanding and accelerating Iranian nuclear program that's the last thing we need to do for the US or our allies an entertainment willie geist as you set with your balance on this deal wing the pros and cons you said one of the cons was what might happen in 10 or 15 years to some of the terms of the deal expire what are those specific concerns what do you worry might happen a decade from now right so so Willie really quickly I think the caps in place on plutonium facility enriched uranium and centrifuges from now through year 15 are very strong and also the inspections regime is very strong what happens after your 15 as you know is some of the caps start to come off enhanced inspections stay on through year 25 after year 25 basically Iran is only then subject to the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which includes inspections intrusive inspections that we haven't had before so as the caps on uranium and centrifuges start to come off after your 15 we enter into a more challenging period but 15 years is a long time and 15 you know even the critics of the deal here's what they're saying they were saying Iran is months away from a nuclear weapon now they're saying they don't like the deal because in 15 years Iran could be months away from a nuclear weapon 15 years of peace is worth during diplomacy and more importantly as a member of the Armed Services Committee I want to hold out the ability to use a military threat doing diplomacy gives us more of a military threat because we'll be able to do inspections that will give us better Intel and we have a coalition together around us doing diplomacy first and we should always do diplomacy first that enhances our military threat its senator Tim Kaine thanks so much for being with us this morning we appreciate it you know

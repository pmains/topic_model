you and all your time in Congress passed one bill that was to name a post office is that a fair charge and what's your reaction well I did have one bill that changed the name of post office to Gordon Chan and I'm proud of that but the thing about Congress is that it's not only about having a name on a bill is that an accurate characterization though that you have your name on just one bill that part is accurate but what we do as congressional members is a lot of other things too

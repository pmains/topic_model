Mr. Speaker, Every day in and day out, more than 115 Americans
die from overdosing on opioids. We are in the midst of a devastating national
epidemic that does not discriminate by geography, age, income, education, or race. I have heard from families who have lost loved
ones to this epidemic. I've talked to the first responders who are
on the front lines. I've talked to the doctors who treat the patients
and the victims of this disease. I've talked to community leaders about the
impacts this epidemic is having in their communities, in our states, and across the nation. So today I rised encouraged that this House
this week is finally poised to take action to address the addiction and abuse hurting
so many of our communities. This week we will work on several bills that
among other things seek to provide communities with needed resources to fight the epidemic,
crack down on dangerous synthetics coming into our nation, and improve care available
to our veterans. Among these I am pleased that the House is
voting on two specific measures I've co-sponsored. The Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers
Act would create centers pairing treatment and recovery services together with community
engagement. The Preventing Overdoses While in Emergency
Rooms, or POWER Act, would increase the coordinated care options available for patients who have
survived an overdose. These people in particular need more than
just Naloxone, they need extended treatment and support to overcome their addiction. This epidemic is a crisis. We, as a country, as a body need to act. I urge my colleagues to support these measures
as we work to turn the tide and I hope that we can continue to build on the bipartisan
progress we are making in the days ahead, and I yield back.

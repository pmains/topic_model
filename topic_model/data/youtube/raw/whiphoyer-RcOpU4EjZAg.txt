so let's ask one of those Democrats what he thinks House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer is with me so sir the president says it is your fault that you and other Democrats want a government shutdown do you that's absurd the only president I mean the only person who's talked about shutting down the government in the last four months has been President Trump himself he said that might be good for the government would be bad for the government bad for the American people and we don't want it now we don't have the votes to either shut it down or keep it open the fact is that Republicans as you've discussed just earlier in your program have consciously shut down the government to try to take the government hostage as well to keep it open no sir I mean respectfully you do have the votes to to keep it open and father Republicans vote against it the Republicans have we had a no-drama keep the government open extend the debt limit in September 19th at every Democrat voted for it and so the government kept open what we are now confronted with is a take it or leave a proposition on a CR and on a supplemental both of which we think do not properly do the business of government so we may not vote for things that are jammed down our throat but we don't want to shut down the government we think the Republicans should not the shot down the government and if they want to do things purely on a partisan basis which has been the fact that we've been confronted with then frankly it's their responsibility to vote for their partisan bills and if they don't vote for their partisan bills the result may well be the shutting down of government which would be a bad policy but a policy in which they pursued in the in the 90s and a policy which they pursued just a couple of years ago but we have no intention of wanting to shut down the government I hear that but it also sounds like you you know you're saying that Democrats really don't have a role here when I mean they do I mean what what must be included in a stopgap bill for you to come to the table or what can you just not vote for well look we think a simple CR which has no other policy in it which is essentially what we did in September which we voted for we understand that policy but only in the event that they'll do some work in the interim to try to do the right things that we need to do to keep government funding that we need to invest in the chip program to keep the chip program operating what they've included we understand in the chip program is a short-term extension and we already have States saying even in light of that short-term extension they're gonna have to shut down because they can't plan for an insurance program which is obviously not a month-to-month program tell lets tell viewers what you're talking about you're talking about the children's health insurance program for nine million children and a million children who as you pointed out are in between Medicaid and this was a bipartisan effort it ran out of funding at the end of September 16 states are gonna have no money for this coming the end of next month twenty more states tack on to that with no funding for this a few months later are you willing to vote against a spending bill at some point that does not fully fund chip again I mean are you willing to say that is my stake in the ground and there's going to be five certainties that certainly is a stake in the ground because we need to make sure chip can effectively operate for those nine million children frankly we've got a bill that's been passed twice through the House of Representatives which we have made very clear to the majority leader to the Republicans it's a partisan bill it's not going anywhere in the Senate it didn't go anywhere in the Senate we were very close to making a deal but as one of your commentators pointed out they wouldn't make a deal without cutting further in the affordable care act which cut health care for children cut vaccination programs for children and other programs for children we didn't think that was paying Peter to pay Paul we thought that was bad policy said we said we've already agreed on the authorizing so let's agree on the funding and by the way as it was pointed out they repealed the one provision of the ACA cost 7ft seventeen and a half billion dollars to do so and they didn't pay for that I want to get you quickly on the tax bill because I know you hate it it's about to be signed into law to build it you called it a perverse giveaway to wealthy Americans I hear you that the biggest I hear you that the biggest cuts are for corporations and for the wealthiest Americans however you know they make money certain ways right they cap for example the the you know the the loophole for hedge fund managers that the president said you get rid of that's not gone I hear you but here's my other question when you look at the independent analysis of this the Tax Policy Center part of Brookings the oldest think-tank in the country says 80 percent of American families will feel a tax cut next year will see an actual tax cut next year that is more than just the wealthy American - no no I think well no that's correct that they will get a tax cut some people will get a very small tax cut and some people will get large tax cut they had one point five trillion dollars a borrowed money increase in the deficit increase in the debt and that money was on the table they talked about how we needed to help working people what did they do yes they gave some tax relief to working people seventeen percent of that 1.5 trillion eighty three percent of that one five trillion they gave to the top one percent of America our pinion is that is perverse that's not helping working men and women by giving eighty three percent of all the resources to the wealthiest in America so yes they're right somebody may get $10 maybe get $100 maybe even get $1,000 the top it is more than let's say it's let's say it's $1,800 let's say it's $1,800 they phase out that $1,800 in 2005 why did they do that because to meet scoring rules in the Senate but they don't phase out the top 1% resources so yes I understand Brooking says that 80% gets some money they do but the overwhelming majority the money was not used for the struggling family making fifty nine thousand dollars that Paul Ryan talked about it before that mr. Brady talked about on the floor yesterday I have to leave it there but it is a true and fair point that the corporate tax cuts do not sunset and the individual tax cuts do sunset unless they are extended thank you very much congressman appreciated you happy holidays thanks a lot growing concern on Capitol Hill over attempts to discredit special counsel

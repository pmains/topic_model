thank you madam chair and this amendment underscores a bipartisan approach to national security legislation that republicans and democrats of the committee have long embraced just as the united states is the steward of the global financial system the financial services committee is it steward in congress republicans and democrats have worked together to ensure that sanctions and other financial restrictions are held accountable for results these aren't feel good measures and they're not a way just to vent can't hear you sanctions and financial restrictions are tools to advance our national security interests as we work to confront the systemic risk posed by china in the financial system and as we look to the national security threat presented by uh the chinese communist party especially in its economic malfeasance maligned foreign investment theft of intellectual property forced transfer of technology manipulative and mercantilist trade policies and its deep commitment to a hostile communist ideology our use of sanctions investment restrictions and other financial measures must aim for clear and realistic goals in particular we should tailor these measures to actually bring about behavioral change by the communists by the chinese communist party that's what this amendment seeks to do this philosophy has already formed the basis of numerous bipartisan efforts in our committee that have been enacted into law and i've been proud to work with democrats across the aisle on some of those initiatives including sanctions directed at chinese banks that deal with north korea targeted authorities for the committee on foreign investment in the united states national interest reviews for the export import bank assistance to china and legislation shaping our role at international financial institutions in each of these areas democrats and republicans have acknowledged that prohibitions on certain transactions involving china may be necessary but they're necessary because they move us toward a foreign policy goal they envision a world where the united states and its allies unite to compel china to adapt to international rules of the road not the other way around and if committee legislation doesn't move us toward that goal it risks incentivizing the world to look elsewhere for economic leadership investment and the markets in capital that drive innovation and safeguard america's national security interests i hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will support this amendment as a common-sense effort to codify our committee's cooperation on confronting the economic and national security threat posed by china i yield back

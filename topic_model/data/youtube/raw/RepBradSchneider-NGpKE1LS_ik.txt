here at community leadership in America tour I believe community foundation we are marketing so we serve all the way Connie and I'm very pleased to be here with me today and what I'm going to be with you all today is people walk you through a little bit about what our Community Foundation says talk to you about our specific investment strategy of priority areas as well as our family eats timeline and process and then may be sure to redirect their questions as well but first of all I want to start with a question to you all how many of you know what a Community Foundation is our familiar possum that's great so you probably know that it's a placed based public charity and what means Community Foundation's unique is that no two are exactly the same so our Community Foundation's are as unique as the organizations that we represent here in Vietnam there's approximately 30 Community Foundation's in Illinois that have a community foundation Lake County is fortunate to have our community in our nation which serves a lovely country there's also the Highland Park Community Foundation as well as the Community Foundation located in Farrington and she mentioned that our Community Foundation is the geographic affiliate of the Chicago Community Trust so that enables us to do a lot with a staff of three so we have three folks on the ground myself included up in Latvian who do this work with the support of our earth team hunkers family members from the Chicago future so the Lake County Community Foundation where I'm celebrating our 15th birthday this year and our mission is to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable residents across Lake County we do this in four ways by serving as a catalyst a connector a grant maker and a steward so what exactly does meanwhiie do you want a day-to-day basis if you kind of think of our focus is being in two buckets the first is inspiring philanthropy so what's unique about Community Foundation's relative to other foundations is we are a fundraising entity so we pull resources from the community from our partners and invest those into about strategies that address specific issues pertaining to our communities we partner with a lot of individuals with families we partner with organizations as well to help them achieve organizational sustainability through the creation of donor advised fund or operating endowment there's a lot of a lot of flexibility at Community Foundation which makes for a lot of fun the second piece is working on strengthening communities and growing impact and that's really with all of my work resides so in addition to our traditional grant making we also work with younger advised fund holders to help guide their philanthropic goals provide support to the community and addressing specific issues we also do a lot of convening around particular issues that our communities facing whether it's related to issues of you know immigration and needs for new members of our community or if there's a specific emergency that occurs in the county a lot of times Community Foundation's will step up to try and convene stakeholders from both the public and the private sector to really begin that dialogue with your positive strategy to move forward all of you are going to receive a copy of this electronically and there are hardcopy the outside kind of in the lobby area you're interested this is sort of them I like to call it a hybrid in your report because it's not fancy tilapia nor a report it's really just a nuts-and-bolts so it doesn't like weigh your personnel which is fine oh this just gives you an overview of what our managed finest little plates though you'll be able to look at this more closely but equaled a variety of funds including endowments organizational endowments restricted funds and that comprises the 13 million that makes up our Community Foundation's resources this is just again an overview the the various themes that we do as a Community Foundation outside of the traditional grant making process which I'll share more about momentarily so now kind of moving into our grant-making priorities a couple of years ago as I mentioned we're about 15 years old we recognized that we needed to be more strategic in how we were investing our plans so our board and staff came together and underwent a strategic planning process to really hone in on areas where we thought we could make a significant impact with our resources in leadership and partnership work so our group identified three specific needs areas one was access to affordable nutritious food another was education in the very broadest sense of the word so everything from early childhood education to college access and persistence as well as Adult Basic Education and the last was the mental or behavioral health so has this long Community Foundation and that's really in the process of the beginning operationally sustainable we recognize that we have some limited capacity yeah we're very fortunate in Lake County that a lot of our partner organizations other government entities and funders are focused on education and it's mental behavioral health so we decided that the best fit for us was to really hone in on access to affordable nutritious food and link coming we know that the food effect so that's not the issue the issue is getting the food to the people that need it most so we've been working for the last two years with two organizations than Northern Illinois food me at Liberty Prairie foundation to address these three issues so those two agencies are really focused on partnering and the community with a lot of member organization for the Health Department hospitals municipal leaders churches so it's really a nice broad public-private partnership of effort to coordinate the food system locally they're also looking at informing local food policy the food make has a relatively new advocacy position that was added to their organization a couple of years ago so we we do focus on that as well as running and supporting local sustainable food production which is really the main focus of Liberty Prairie foundation in addition to land access so this priority area for us is something that we proactively go out and place dollars for so it's not an invitation to apply because it's a very focused investment process for the next three years so we're getting ready to enter your to of this priority focus additionally over the years we've always invested in basic human needs and we use that term pretty loosely so that could be any from preventing violence for example access to affordable housing access to health care as to education we've worked with a lot of organizations over the years to invest in ensuring that families can meet their basic human needs in a variety of ways so this is a priority area that will continue to fund regardless of whatever our proactive priority area grows to become and lastly we have to restricted funds that we have these are results of acquisition and access that well for example the early childhood education fund that was a result of the closure of a nursery school so we have an operating endowment for well the endowment I should say for that fund which and that allows us to report nonprofit organizations that are really focused on working with children zero to five across Lake County a couple of examples of agencies that we funded over the years reading power which is an organization that does literacy interventions in Lake County we've also funded devices and ice mother and child which is a paper date which is a little unconventional but still when you consider the fact that if your child is not clean and you can't get them into daycare then they're not having those educational enrichment opportunities to build that firm foundation for preschool and beyond so those are a couple of examples and lastly we also funded animal welfare which is kind of a surprising priority area and misses that kind of fell into our lap a little bit but 16 percent of our annual distributions are weak to organizations that tend to the needs of animals across laconic so our most recent grants have been to equestrian connections which provides a a non mounted horse therapy equine therapy which is really beneficial to individuals who have experienced some form of trauma what we like about that specific grant is that it's generally benefiting community members but also the enemies who are providing Vietnam so therefore those community members additionally we've invested in paws in their Northshore location which is located just down the road in Highland Park so they have an adoption center and we're always looking for native animal organizations to work with these are both funds that we grant on a regular basis so annually they're a little bit of a smaller grant third place but it's based on our spendable balances that we figure out annually so a lot of transport advertised on our website so moving into our grant making process Suzie I thought you did a phenomenal job of kind of touching that I points of what the process best practices are I actually participated in a focus group with forefront a few years ago to specifically address the issue of general operating support our hope is that community foundation is that other Community Foundation's and private funders will follow suit in really prioritizing in general operations because ultimately we should be investing in people and not things we don't have the capacity to invest in people you can expect your programs to be strong right you all know this so with that in mind we've tried to simplify our grant-making process historically be happy with a two-part very traditional process so a letter of inquiry and then the grant application you no longer require the letter of inquiry we go straight to the grant application which shapes some time off for everybody involved we use a system called grant central are any of you familiar with that system ok a little bit so we follow suit with the Chicago Community Trust and using that system the nice thing about it the online platform if your organization serves multiple communities or counties this enables you to have access to a variety of opportunities and you don't have to continuously input the same information over and over again which is kind of nice this just gives you an overview of what our cycle looks like we typically open our annual grant making cycle shortly after the holidays so you'll get a notification electronically about when the cycle is going to be opening applications are due shortly thereafter and then we spent a bit of time on our due diligence process which typically involves phone calls site visits when possible we have a grant committee that oversees a lot of the work of our community investment strategies so in partnership with myself and other staff members we will reach out with organizations to ask questions about specific program requests we'll get some additional information and put that forth to the full grants committee for review and recommendation that then goes to our Board typically at our organizations receive funding over the summer this year they're going to receive funding earlier and which is really nice for them so will will have notifications going out in June I can't help but call out the point that you made about not including a lot of like a dead no items or appendices I'm in the middle of vetting all the grant applications we have and it's so nice when everything is concise and we can just go to you if you need something else so I have a second that that recommendation thank you so this is just a screenshot of what our Community Foundation's website looks like you can access the grant central system directly from our site our web address is down below and there's a grant seeker login button I'm going to go clearly put me through the next series of slides you'll get a copy of this information it's kind of a step-by-step tutorial of how you can work on your application once you've logged into the system and setup an organizational profile so this is the grant central login it's just what it looks like if you're new to the organization or new to Grand Central you'll need to set up a registration before you're able to identify the different opportunities or revisit your applications because we don't do a letter of inquiry we do ask a short series of kind of vetting questions just to ensure that we're not wasting your time so there's some particular things that we have to be mindful as a community foundation of when we're investing in a community organization so we do all of that up front and then once we have that information and know that you're good to go then you're able to really input all of the details about organizations background and information and again that state than their so then in future cycles you don't have to go in and change that again this is just an example of what the application system looks like you get a lovely notification saying that you've been invited to use the system and have a password we do have great technical support from our team at the Chicago Community Trust you know occasionally there's questions or specific technical issues and it's been wonderful having that kind of as that second layer of support to us so I will say that I feel like we're able to provide the customer service needed to help you effectively complete your application on time moving through this quickly I want to highlight here our application is tab based so if you do choose to participate in our grant cycle in the coming year since we're in the middle of it this year we won't be offering it again until the next calendar year but do you know that building to fill out all of the information on all of the tabs in order to have it be completed the nice thing about the system is though you're not on a timer restriction up until you submit so you can go back in and out of the system multiple times to gather information and input it this is our contact information for all of our staff so again I'm the director of community leadership and investment my contact information is below and then my colleagues my identity are also available for questions it's been a pleasure this afternoon and I look forward to taking your questions thank you

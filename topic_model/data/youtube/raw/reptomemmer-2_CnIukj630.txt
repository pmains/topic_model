joining us now for the first time he's House Majority Whip Congress and Tom emmer great to see you congressman and congratulations on your new position thank you Liz great to be with you okay we've got Texas Republican Pat Fallon he filed impeachment articles to house Judiciary against Homeland Security secretary mayorkas what are the high crimes and misdemeanors here because you know I tell you Americans are sick and tired of how abused the Border has been there's a real war for control of the Border against the drug and human trafficking cartels but what are the high crimes and misdemeanors well actually uh to your point if you think about this uh President Biden understands there is a new majority in town Liz that's why he scrambled to get his butt down to the border to El Paso uh last weekend for his first visit for something that he's denied even existed for the last couple of years uh you've got almost 4.5 million illegals have been apprehended at our Southern Border in the past two years last month alone you had almost 75 000 gotaways this is unprecedented and it's unacceptable and House Republicans are going to hold the Biden Administration accountable with both the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena and what Pat did is he's filing a uh articles of impeachment and he said that mayorkas lied to Congress quite frankly he's not doing his job he is ignoring his mission which is to protect the southern border and quite frankly the Safety and Security of American citizens not just on the border because is uh every board every state we would argue today is a border state because of the fentanyl that's Crossing that border every day you need two-thirds of the Senate to convict Democrats control the chamber you're going to convince them I I don't know about that but you definitely need to continue to raise the awareness like I said this president has denied you even have a problem this Administration has denied this problem for the past two years President Biden recognizes we have a new majority in town that is why for the first time ever he got his rear end down to the southern border and literally they cleared the streets of El Paso so he could have a sanitized visit so he really didn't do much but the point is you've got to continue to raise this for the American public because this is going to be an issue today it's going to be an issue tomorrow and it's going to be an issue going to the uh presidential election in 2024 House Republicans are going to make sure that one we address the issue to try and solve the problem and if this Administration refuses to the American public is going to be well aware of who is responsible and why it's happening well to your point let's watch secretary mayorkas testify he claims in testimony that the border is secure watch this the border is secure the Border we are working to make the Border more secure that has been a historic challenge secretary Meyer orcas do you continue to maintain that the border is secure yes and we are working day in and day out to enhance its security Congressman there's no question that the um the number of encounters that we are experiencing at the border is training our system uh and this Harkens back to um the question you previously posed which is we're operating uh within a system that is fundamentally broken okay so he says it's fundamentally broken in a podcast but then testify it's secure how can he say it's secure when 98 terrorists on the watch list were caught trying to cross I mean this is just a generation after 9 11. Liz I let me translate with secretary miarcus is really saying to the American people and more importantly in those instances to Congress he's saying are you going to believe me or you're going to believe Your Lying Eyes he has not been doing his job the southern border is not secure you talk about the the folks on the terrorist watch list that are coming across you've got approximately 300 Americans per day that are dying from fentanyl overdoses and the fentanyl is coming across that southern border everybody knows it these people know it and they're not doing anything about it so I'm going to keep going back to it they wouldn't do anything about it now they know there's a new majority in town and they are going to try and cover their tracks but quite frankly unless they're willing to do what needs to be done to close that border the open border that they've created uh we're going to continue to raise the raise the issue so Americans understand just how serious this is the Administration has to be held accountable as all right in short we're going to say on a congressman thanks for joining us it's good to see you again thanks for having me

Thank You mr. chairman I'm told that the Ambassador from Bangladesh is here thank you sir for being here but more importantly thank you for what's your country one of the poorest countries in the world is doing to take care of hundreds of thousands of refugees I'd also like to introduce the ambassador of Burma but unfortunately I can't because that ambassador is not here if that ambassador were here that ambassador could find out what the world thinks of the policy of the Burmese government toward hundreds of thousands of its own citizens a humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Burma which is also referred to as Mayan Mar the Burma's military that taught Mahad taught madhai moved against the Rohingya population after an August 25th attack by row hanga militants on Burmese security forces and nearly half a million Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled their homeland in the rockiness state following Burmese military operations against them the UN High Commission for Human Rights noted that this situation seems to be a textbook example of ethnic cleansing late last year something similar occurred on a smaller scale when an estimated 60,000 and 90,000 rangas fled to Bangladesh as a result of Burmese military operations that have followed on October 2016 running a militant attack on border police the vast majority of those who fled to blingle adesh which is point as I pointed out already impoverished and overcrowded though the so the vast majority have fled there or roughly 40,000 fled in to India unfortunately media reports indicate that India's border security forces are attempt to prevent Ranga from entering India through Bangladesh amidst the ongoing exodus from Burma including the reported use of stun guns and pepper grenades however I should point out that the international law is different for Bangladesh which is the first resting place of those fleeing once the people are in Bangladesh they're not being oppressed although they are not economically viable at the present time and so whether India has an obligation to accept them from Bangladesh is a subject that perhaps our witnesses can get into the United States has led an international response to protect them we've led the international response to protect Muslims in Kosovo and in Bosnia against Serb aggression we need to play a role along with others in Burak protecting the Rohingya and dealing with the humanitarian needs and we also need to make sure that the Muslim world realizes that we are the only country to bomb a a Christian nation Serbia for the defence of Muslims something that is not widely focused on in the Muslim world the administration should work to ensure that the physical needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees are provided for secure a halt to Burmese military operations against the Rohingya secure a safe return of the Rohingya population back to Burma demand that Burma in decades of discrimination against the Rohingya including addressing cases of appropriated land citizenship rights political representation the lack of free movement and economic improvements this is especially necessary is citizenship rights the idea that a people could live in a country generation after generation and still be called foreigners under that country's laws is simply outrageous we are to urge the United Nations Security Council to establish a UN security so probe Commission on Burmese ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya enters the United Nations Security Council to establish a UN monitored safe zone for the Rohingya in Rakhine State to protect it from future mass killings the Burmese government says it will allow the return of these refugees catch-22 when they provide proof of nationality but since 1982 the Burmese government has stripped thorough hanga of their citizenship making it impossible for them to prove Burmese nationality this is outrageous every group of people on the earth has emigrated to where they live from somewhere else since we all came from apparently Eastern Africa and to say that you are not a citizen of a country because you cannot prove that your most ancient ancestors were born there would make us all citizens perhaps of Ethiopia and no citizens of any other country in the world it is say that just to show how absurd the position is to deny citizenship for people not only born in a country but whose parents and even grandparents were born in that country the United States who was closely involved in bringing democracy to Burma a process that included elections in 2010 and 2015 the release of political prisoners the formation of a civilian government and the lifting of UN sanctions the United States should also take the lead and upholding democratic practices and democracy goes with fair treatment of minorities and a protection of minorities it must press the Burmese government and military operations against the Rohingya accept the refugees back and grant them citizenship McNair already legally citizens get recognized that citizenship and a in September of last year I along with other members of this subcommittee met with anxiety as the former administration decided to lift a number of economic sanctions on Burma it's clear after the massacres and cleansing of October 2016 and the recent actions that we need to reevaluate that policy last week the State Department announced the u.s. is providing an additional 32 million in humanitarian assistance I look forward to hearing from our witnesses whether that's sufficient and I yield back particularly USAID do we know I don't know the precise figure out the top of my head I can certainly be arranged roughly about eighty million dollars a year right now physically no other so the first thing we could do is cut that is is much of that for democracy and human rights promotion or is it mostly economic development there's a combination of economic development promotion but also we have been a significant supporter of the peace process that's underway under the terms of what is called the national ceasefire agreement bear in mind only eight of the roughly 20 to 23 EA OS have signed that ceasefire agreement and I will throw in that the slogan no justice no peace the idea that we'd be giving money to the Burmese government to help it achieve its objectives now human rights and democracy may not be its objectives but anything that is consistent whether that we'd be giving the money for that seems absurd especially when we're talking about thing doing things that would cost the US taxpayer money such as sanctions or or or humanitarian aid all of which may be warranted but we should first do the thing that reduces expenditures I'm gonna ask this question probably for the record unless somebody knows but I hope dr. Martin and his team that the CRS will get me an answer what's being done to publicize to the Muslim world China's support for this murderous regime and what's being done to publicize the fact that we are doing more to protect the RO hanga than any other state other other than those in the immediate neighborhood I don't see anyone anxious to answer that question right now so I'll ask that for the record now an uncomfortable question is arson gauging in some smaller atrocities and given our support for the ring can we persuade them to limit their actions to those against the Burmese military mr. Lewman or anyone else there there are reports of varsity making and carrying out attacks and and against civilians yes of course and and and for the record they are a tiny in quantity compared to what the ring two people are facing at the same time they undermine arses whether the the the moral case that we are trying to make and they also undermine the ability of the Bernese government to change its policy and become more reasonable one atrocity against Buddhists in rakion state could make it difficult for those inside the Burmese government to to change its policy let's see is Voice of America carrying the message that it should to do the the average person in Burma know what the world thinks of what their government is doing mr. Lewman anybody know if we don't have an answer I'll ask her for the record I can get you more information sir I know Radio Free Asia for example as regular stories about what's going on in Rakhine State and those in America are those in the Burmese language yes there is a Voice of America Radio Free Asia Burmese broadcasts one would hope that they would have the courage at the burmese service to push these stories not just in the i assume we have a that we also broadcast in the language bangladesh it's a lot easier for that service to cover to cover this message and i'll just throw this out here if the Burmese government disenfranchises some of its people I mean a government has a certain amount of territory for the benefit of its people they have disclaimed over a million of their people if they permanently show that they're unwilling or unable to protect the he is a long term solution the transfer of territory to Bangladesh we obviously as a nation don't like to see sovereign borders changed but when a nation refuses to allow its own people to live on its territory it loses the right to control that territory mister dr. Martin real quick the same thing you bring that up because in the early days when there was a previous insurgent group among the reh√©n juh what they wanted at that time was to be part of what was Pakistan East Pakistan which is today Bangladesh which is today Bangladesh so I do not know if our son is leadership or the reign general obviously the first choice is the return of the refugees in pass citizenship protection and living in harmony with the other people Rakhine State but if that cannot be achieved then a chance fer of a population has been achieved through this ethnic cleansing perhaps a transfer of territory would go along with it I for the record I want to point out that the ambassador from Bangladesh has no coming Thank You mr.

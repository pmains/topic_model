good evening J Street my name is avital Brown and I'm a co-founder of a management training company for the high-tech sector many four projects involve connecting Israeli and Palestinian companies unlike Ettie politics never interested me I thought I could live my life quietly pursue my career raise my children but the 2014 war in Gaza woke me up or rather shook me up I had two sons and a son-in-law and on the frontline in Gaza I can't even begin to tell you what I was going through luckily they all returned home safely but I then realized that this scenario might be a ritual I'll have to go through every two or three years I then said enough as an Israeli Patriot as a Zionist I said no more there must be another way this endless fighting does not make sense it doesn't gets us anywhere as the war ended and I heard there were women who decided to get off the couch and bring an end to this cycle of madness a thousand women put on a white shirt a turquoise scarf and boarded the train to the road near the Gaza border on that train we launched a new kind of women's movement women wage peace three and a half years later not only my entire wardrobe has changed to white but my whole life has changed as well I have become an activist and have vowed not to stop until there is an agreement with the Palestinians today I serve as the coordinator of the movement strategy team so I can tell you firsthand that our theory of change involves the strategy that no Israeli piece group has yet proposed we believe that the need for peace and security does not belong and cannot be monopolized by only one sector we understand that people from across the political spectrum must join together and together compel our decision maker makers to end the conflict by mobilize more of the political center and right we can more successfully influence elected officials on all levels from the Knesset to the security cabinet to local government we have adopted the new language of radical inclusivity focusing on the existential necessity of reaching a political agreement rather than advocating for any one specific plan we work together Jewish and Arab women religious and secular women women from tel-aviv and the periphery veterans and newcomers and yes even women from the West Bank settlements as you can imagine this diversity is challenging but we are learning how to stash away even our most scared ideological position at times for the sake of our common goal a political agreement to end the israeli-palestinian conflict with equal representation of women in every phase of the negotiations can women wage peace you might be right you convinced me you might be surprised to hear of the ongoing dialogue between secular left-wing women from the kibbutzim up north and women from the settlements in the West Bank this interaction began when a right to be a right-wing settler rabbi so women which be standing at every traffic intersection he passed holding signs and pictures of begging Sadat in Carter declaring this was achieved in the past it can be achieved again he stopped ask questions and ended up inviting women many of whom have never crossed the green line before to visit and speak with settlers women from the heart about the meaning of home security and peace and the dialogue continues ok so you might be thinking dialog is nice but can women wage peace last October during our massive journey to peace thousands of Israeli women gathered with 3,000 Palestinian women from the West Bank in a huge tent we constructed in the desert near Jericho we called it the tent of Sarah in hagatha the mothers of Isaac and Ishmael we their daughters walked out of that tent vowing to changed our long and painful history we their daughters vow to take responsibility for the kind of world we are leaving our children without to make this region safe and prosperous for all of us the viral video you are about to watch pray of the mothers was filmed two years ago during our march of hope in it you will also see who de aborto be the next speaker tonight a Palestinian partner and mentor so woman can women wage peace [Music] we are encouraged by what Nelson Mandela noticed about a nature of social change it always seems impossible until it's done we invite you to join us in doing the impossible thank you [Applause]

Mr Speaker I rise today in the vent in defense of one of our most magnificent natural wonders the Great Lakes they contain a fifth of the world's fresh water and are vitally important to the economy and a quality of life in my district the Great Lakes restoration initiative which as we see strong support from both sides of the aisle works to clean up the Great Lakes control invasive species we store habitats and reduce runoff yet we have heard the president Trump may virtually eliminate this critical program with an eye-popping irresponsible ninety-seven percent cut to the budget three hundred billion dollars in funding would be reduced to just 10 million dollars at the same time his administration may gut EPA funds for climate science clean air and safe water let me be clear I am adamantly opposed to these cuts and will do everything in my power to stop them tomorrow on Great Lakes day the president is expected to release a budget proposal I urge him to include robust funding for the Great Lakes restoration initiative and the EPA programs and ensure we pass on a sustainable healthy planet to our children thank you

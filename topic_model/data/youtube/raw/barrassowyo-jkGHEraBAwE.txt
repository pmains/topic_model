well good afternoon everyone uh you may recall the president asked for about 45 billion dollars in the supplemental we've now negotiated it down to about 17. in my view the money for Ukraine is critically important so I think we've got this in the area where it should pass here in the next day or two and then you're going to I'll say goodbye to us and we're going to go out and Slug It Out well for the next uh six weeks and I think front and center for us is to take the case of the American people that inflation is outrageous the border is open and crime is rampant and I think that will be in most of our campaigns the principal message will be taken to the American people this November thank you one of the defining features of the Biden presidency is his willingness to sacrifice security for um political gain in the case of our economy our economy is less secure today because of his Reckless spending which has given us the 40-year high inflation that everybody in this country American families are dealing with on a daily basis our nation's finances are less secure because of the student loan bailout which is racking up up to a trillion dollars of additional debt in this country our energies Nations energies energy Supply is less secure because of the president's willingness to rely on foreign countries and his resistance to creating homegrown sources of energy and all all the above American Energy Independence plan and just to put a fine point on that if you look at the Strategic petroleum Reserve which is supposed to be for emergencies has been used routinely by this Administration to try and score political points with the American people to the tune that the Strategic petroleum Reserve is at its lowest level since 1984. 1984. and if you look at the border again the country is just it's just less secure this fiscal year the numbers that we have up until the final month of this fiscal year has the number of apprehensions at the board are now over 2 million which is historic record never seen anything like that in terms of apprehensions and that doesn't count the god the god of ways that those people that they get through that don't get counted and what's probably even more disturbing about that is of all those uh folks that they've apprehended at the border there have been 78 people apprehended in this last year that were on the terrorist watch list which is five times the um the amount that they've had in the last five years combined so these are historic problems that this Administration and their leadership here in Congress have created we need a an America that is more secure when it comes to our economy more secure when it comes to energy security and more secure when it comes to our national security and I can assure you that if the Republicans get the majority here in the Senate after this election we will reply or and the agenda that this Administration has put forward and hopefully get Joe Biden to become the moderate that he promised he would be in the first place we are 20 months into this period where the Democrats have been in complete control in Washington D.C so where are we well we're at the worst inflation in the history in 40 years you know the great majority of Americans saying that the country is on the wrong track and is coming off the rails 25-year high of murder in States across the country you can see in a poorest border and a really disgraceful and deadly evacuation from Afghanistan so where were we when Joe Biden came to office in January of 2021. gas prices were 2.35 cents a gallon inflation was negligible under Joe Biden prices are now up over 13 since the day he came to office cannot afford to fill their grocery cart and their gas tank in the same week people are really hurting and struggling as they see their savings their retirements melting away and then Kamala Harris goes on TV and says the border is secure millions and millions and millions of illegal water Crossings have occurred since they've been in office she's either lying or she is clueless when you look at the amount of fentanyl coming across the border and the deaths over a hundred thousand Americans dead from fentanyl brought in by drug cartels and the vice president thinks everything is fine at the border another Democrats went on this Reckless tax and spending spree but they didn't spend on issues that were important to the American people they ignored inflation ignored affordable energy ignored crime and ignored the Border and the money they poured onto the economy and the spending added to make inflation worse there are Democrat economists who are very well respected who said to the house and said to the Senate and said to the White House do not do this this is going to be bad for the economy it's going to be bad for inflation and the Democrats in the house and the Senate and the White House just ignored them and then Joe Biden goes on television on 60 Minutes and is dismissive of the inflation that is hitting the American people because he's that far out of touch so here we are 20 months later this is the nation where people all across the country feel that they have been forgotten ignored and betrayed by the Democrats the Democrats in the house senate White House have failed the American people and voters will have a chance to express their opinion on this in six weeks well folks I'm one County shy of completing my 99 County tour so just one one remaining County and this last Monday I was able to start the day with a group of law enforcement officials in Northern Northwestern Iowa in O'Brien County and these law enforcement officials that came together they wanted to talk mostly about drug trafficking and so we started with the normal conversation centering around methamphetamine that's still the number one drug of choice in Iowa however what was new to this recurring conversation is that we are seeing more fentanyl in Iowa and this is a real issue they are very worried about what this is doing to our communities so I asked them okay where is it coming from yes you know where I'm going with this it's the wide open Southern border and they said this administration's inability to stop the flow coming in from our Southern border is poisoning our Iowa communities it flows up Interstate 35 it hits other highways and byways all along the way including I-80 and it runs all across the United States so we have got to do something about this I've got a couple different Common Sense solutions that would help curb this one is charging those Distributors who knowingly deliver products tainted with fentanyl charge them with felony murder the second thing is there's a lot of spotters along our border working for the drug cartels and it is imposing steeper fines on those that are spotters enabling the cartels as well as a maximum prison time of up to 10 years we've got to get serious about this folks our children are at risk our populations are at risk and we're knowingly allowing it to happen here in the United States by not closing up our border and enforcing stiffer penalties with the drug cartels and their enablers there's a proposal in the house that deals with stock trades by numbers to what degree do you think members should be allowed to trade stocks and should any of those limits go to family members or even staff well we've had very few discussions over here about that particular measure and I I'm not really conversant with the details of what the house may be doing I can only speak for myself I only have investments in mutual funds and uh I decided a number of years ago I thought that was the best way to avoid criticism that somehow I was trading stocks as a result of Insider information so that's the way I've operated for for years beyond that I don't have any observations but are you being overly dismissive about the impact proportion might have especially among Suburban women and some of these crucial valves on stages and parties non-stop your strategies well I think that issue is playing out in different ways in different states the three big National issues that we're going to be addressed address addressing here that people are most concerned about nationally are the ones that I mentioned inflation crime and open borders that's clearly where we're going to be putting the focus with regard to the issue you raised I think every one of our candidates may have a different answer to that depending upon where they are um well let me tell you where we are yeah where we are now is the Fed is going to have to squeeze this inflation down there's no other way to fix it after this explosion of spending 1.9 trillion last year another 750 billion this year It produced this rampant inflation as others pointed out the highest in 40 years the solution at least on the fiscal side quit doing what we've been doing on the monetary side the chairman of the feds have been quite clear it's going to have to raise rates that runs the risk of having a recession and that'll be the price the American people had to pay once again not only are they paying too much now but then they may have to suffer through the recession that was created and some would argue it's already here by the FED providing the only fix that anybody's been able to think of to begin to grind inflation down limited quality or has your outlook changed in every election every year this year past years it's great to have terrific candidates we're in a bunch of close races I think we have a 50 50 shot of getting the Senate back it's going to be really really close either way in my view

good morning I'm here in my office today joined by my fellow freshmen the conversation from Wyoming Liz shame Liz welcome to my office Thank You Roger community thanks you know what our subject today is military and readiness and this is a written books on some of these topics on national security and it's certainly my go-to person that bricen class on this topic in Liz I was just hoping you would just paint a big picture of the national security issues facing our country right now sure well you know we paint a really complicated array expressed and we've had periods upon our history certainty when we could choose challenges no question what's different today is how many press there are not complex that are applicable is grown so whether you're talking about North Korea and their nuclear program and their twisted missile program the Iranians obviously Russia in their aggression in eastern europe and you know their aggression in cyberspace as well the Chinese you really just have a whole host of sort of national stress in addition to the reputation - Kristin al-qaeda and Carol organization so it is a very challenging time and while these stresses grown over the last eight years our own capabilities have been somewhat decline so we're in a situation where we're facing number of different adversaries especially the Chinese and the Russians and obvious is North Korean - but the Chinese and the Russians are developing weapons systems they're technologically some ways large and some of which we've been turned the ability at this point to defend against so we really decided in moving got to give the resources military let's talk about China just for a second you and I have to sit down gentlemen a couple weeks ago and he describes kind of China's future for the military they're no fewer goals which I was not aware of maybe you could share whether what you're what you see China doing over the next 13 14 15 years well the Chinese have a very concerted and disciplined focused effort that is aimed at denying us access to the region do we know the entire of Asia region if they can they would like to compete with us they'd like to overcome us globally as a superpower their military programs particularly designed toward figuring out places where we have have strengths like for example being able to project our power with our aircraft carriers and developing weapon systems to counter that the counter those candidates ability they there there's a for a Chinese phrase or Chinese staple which is like the David and Goliath story basically called the assassin to me we're basically an assassin is able to overcome a stronger adversaries with the use of a maze that's you know the notion of going had an adversary particularly once and so the Chinese really have been targeting us and they're doing it across the board they're Judith not just and sort of traditional military areas but face as well when you look at capabilities that they have you know there was for many years a sort of a sense that you should weaponizing space and in some ways I think that got left back because the Russians and the Chinese vote has progressed along that electron way they certainly have I think the other one topic on your line go back home is North Korea what where we thought Korea you say that's not worrying about North Korea and you feel like maybe we have it enter at least we're aware of what's going on I mean it's North Sea as there is inserting because they clearly have been very focused on developing this capability to launch an attack on a nuclear attack and they made no progress and so when when you think about what we have to be doing you know we certain acts be in a position where they're expanding our missile defense capability and we have to be careful that a lot of kind of you will hear people say well they now have tested a ballistic missile that can reach the United States but they don't necessarily have the kind of targeting technology that that we do you know we don't number one really know whether they do or not and number two you're talking about a nuclear-tipped ICBM you know targeting is not that important you don't have to be that precise in order to do you know very significant devastating damage so I think we've got to make sure both that we're defending ourselves and with the defense authorization bill we have we increase funding and a whole range of areas for missile defense and we also have to take another look I think at how we're deterrence like North Korea and how we're using our own nuclear forces to deter action by others and whether that means we need to have more forward presence in Asia to be absolutely cleared of no mistake that you know Kim jong-un wherever launched against cestus without response be devastating and if they decide to hopefully be on point that you would be all too common to launch an attack let's talk about military readiness for a second I just welcome back 4,000 troops to the big red one at Fort Riley with been stationed in South Korea and doing some maneuvers with them and training with them and we break them a little bit concerned about our military readiness I think our troops are doing everything they can with what we've given them but just address our military readiness as we know that as you know what on the Armed Services Commission what you're absolutely right to be concerned and you know we're so blessed in the nation to have incredible you know young men and women like those in the visit one and and people who really are one put their lives on the line to defend us defend our freedom and in too many cases we haven't kept up our end of the bargain in terms of making sure they have everything you need you know the chairman of Joint Chiefs likes to say we never want our soldiers or sailors remembering to have to go into a fair fight we want to make sure that we go in always in advance and that means ensuring that the airplanes work and they've got their cars and they've been able to fly and if I believe weapons systems they've been able to train and that we better force it's large enough so that people are going to be able to have a kind of rotation you know between deployment that we know we need to maintain our fighting forces necessary you know we also I think what happens when you get into a vicious cycle where you know we obviously as a nation have been at war now for 16 years since 9/11 almost 16 years and what that means is it really we have a lot of very skilled officers now and enlisted individuals who have had no combat experience but if they're worried about I'll of course if they're worried that you know we also have the resources necessary arms supplies to them or then we'll take care of them and their families then they'll leave and we've got to make sure that that doesn't happen that we don't lose that kind of experience because you know of every everything we have every single resource we have the most valuable and important and hard to obtain are those skills you know men and women in Cyprus so we've got to make sure to be pleased they're going to do direct benefit provide them with a certain if it's Angelis the other ways themselves human resources and the tools we give them get some specific examples it seems like I heard that half the part of the Navy's airplanes are are grounded continue to give me notices any across the board you know you've got over half the Navy aircraft unable to fly the Marine Corps for senators even higher than that I think if you look at the army for example we have no 850 a brigade combat team and the vast majority of those were not ready tonight you've got stories of mediators having to take spare parts out of airplane at museum aircraft because they can't get a mouse where and of course you have these really tragic accident where the latest one we lost 50 Marines and one sailor now we don't know yet what caused that and there's an investigation underway but certainly when you have you know the situation where you see an increase in accidents and training you've got to be very concerned that you know that could be a result of not having the kind of equipment and spare parts necessary let's talk about sequester the Budget Control Act is in second what many people don't realize is the sequester not only impacts the military that also impacted my rural hospitals and I'm not sure if it impacted your hospital didn't in Wyoming but just describe what sequester had done you know to the military and your concerns about that yeah it's really been devastating you know Secretary Clinton mattis has said no bows in the field could have done more damage to our horses than sequester is done and you know it was put in place with a good intention basically the idea was to force the Congress back in 2011 to come to bipartisan agreement on budget deal and on kind of spending cuts that are necessary and so those who were involved that let's put this list of really propel me and cut two systems that's going to cut very deeply out here and sort of the alternative to in green and now horses also read but unfortunately it didn't force agreement and so we ended up with sequester which takes 50% of the tests from domestic spending and 50% to military and the cuts have to be there basically like a meat cleaver across the board and so the military is not able under sequester to say what are the threats and what we need to meet the threat they basically dedicated me task to the budget it's you know luminous and we've seen the results and unfortunately you know the Budget Control Act is what mandates sequester it was put in place to try to cut the debt try to get spending under control haven't done those things all it's done really is devastate the military and some of the hostile which you mentioned in other places on the domestic side where it hasn't been so bad I feel very strongly that we've got to repeal as much as before and part of it is number one because we've seen the damages during the military but secondly we economists have to do our job and our job is make those tough decisions and make sure that you know we are appropriating funds that we think are necessary and will along is that the kind of autopilot sequester going on in my view that that's you know that's us advocating responsibility and especially no damages as a non-politician looking from the outside in I felt like sequester was a symptom of the disease and the disease is Congress's inability to govern that to figure out solutions that then when we couldn't here was Plan B and so where that's just advocate advocating are our duties and our chores that we need do ya do that good right and they'd get so I'm hopeful I think that they're enough we're seeing certainly growing recognition of the damage that question is done and so I'm hopeful that we be able to get a vote to repeal the legislation that so so lastly I just want to talk about what we've done in Congress this year to fund the military what are some highlights of the appropriation for our military what some highlights why are you supporting and why do you think it's important the right thing they're coming for it well if you look across the board you know there are number of things we know we need to do we've got to increase the in strength of our force and that the authorization we passed the appropriation is coming up we'll do that we've got to get to I think at the end of discussion maybe and this puts us on a path beginning to do that who's got expand missile defense again I talked about before that in here this also has a raise the durability of hormuz hugely important and so you can look serving in every aspect we also include funding for our cyber operations the authorization bill includes a new structure for how the military organized about the old space and I think it's very important you know you can go back to 1982 and there have been study after study after study all the way back to 82 showing that there are simply too many chiefs involved when you're talking about how we're operating spatially military perspective and this is be comfortable now that you've got our adversaries moving very quickly in that direction so the authorization bill does that as well so there are never a really important aspect to this we also make sure that we sort of get off the path of the past and off the path of sequestration and appropriate sufficient funds to begin to dig out of the hole do you remember President Reagan talking about SPR space defense the mission yeah you and I were just probably I'm already know your ecuadorian item and that i just thinking oh my gosh for such a time as this with North Korea a rogue nation wouldn't be nice to have had that developed for the only usually has a pretty good foresight well if you if you want to be very concerned and scary of shuttle because worth worth watching there the CNN special called war and space and it's on YouTube is upwards on has long and it's worth the 45 minutes they interviewed all the key military commanders they talked about some of the things our adversaries can do it's the best unclassified version I've seen of what's really happening in and if you think about how to pendant we are on GPS system this is one example you know there's a lot of damage that could be done differently on on hapless Liz um I think one thing that people back home don't realize is that were people too with same and would you mind just sharing a little bit about your family and we're good live I'm sure well we live in Jacksonville Wow too bad I agree nobody asked us to a terrific pizza which is just a gorgeous place my family's from castle and we originally and so women Jassa now my husband Don has five kids our oldest daughter is graduating college and our second daughter is in college and they are both in Colorado and then we have a daughter in high school and two boys in elementary school and so it's all you know trying to juggle as moms everywhere you and Dad and for me I think that the mom is always popular always Killinger pulled in many different direction but partly eyes you sort of this process Sealand also as somebody who was a child when my back was an office you know I was about the age of some of my kids my dad was first elected to Congress and so I feel very blessed to have had that experience of being able to see how our government works and sort of learn about public policy in these issues firsthand so I know there are a lot of benefits to that I have them I want to tell one story and held under your $2 for you at 10 o'clock 10:00 and 12:00 and the sheriff I told it to you or not but you and I were walking in to be sworn in and we didn't really know each other we met each other twice and and some reason you had to turn around and do something and your dad was with your two little boys and I reached over to shake hands with the Vice President of the United States and was going to be a nod to be off to be honest grown-up having watched Dick Cheney's career and what what an important person he was for our country but he made such a point to introduce your two little boys to me now and to make sure and he was more concerned about your little boy and even he was the grandfather not the vice president of the United States and dismay I think I get it I like Dick Cheney and while is Shane or the people they are it's their integrity their wife family's important he wanted to make sure his two grandsons met another congressman and he was so proud of you you just beaming with pride and I said we're going to have a great personal class well thank you thank you for sharing that story for saying that and that it was a really special day for all of us to be on the floor that day and my dad and voids are particular special but it is a great burden class and that the people of pianists are very blessed to have you here representing them and it's been great to get to know you and not research with you we got work to do don't we did do that this change thanks for joining we enjoy editing it would Forge that it's doing great things for our country together thank you

further on the role of women in politics a new film highlights the record number of first-time female candidates who ran won and upended politics and what became the historic barrier breaking 2018 midterm elections i always tell the story that i never slept on november 8th the scene here is so different than a few hours ago what started off as impossible is now reality but i sure as hell woke up on november 9th it might not have been the glass ceiling that shattered but something exploded powerful men have existed inside what seemed like a perfectly protective bubble i am sick and tired of a congress made up of this old boys club it's not okay we deserve better there's a record number of women getting into politics nearly two-thirds are seeking office for the first time seeing a surge of women this huge surge of women what's behind the surge of women there are just so many elected positions in this country where a woman has ever served where a woman of color has never served the right race it's the right time and i'm the right candidate i had to run i had to do it women are now the most important political force in the united states of america the new documentary is called surge and it is set to premiere on tuesday and showtime joining us now democratic congresswoman lauren underwood of illinois she's the youngest african-american woman to be elected to congress and is one of the women profiled in the film also with us directors and producers of the film serge hannah rosenswag and wendy sacks hannah formally served as a videographer for hillary clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and wendy formerly served as press secretary on capitol hill okay so hannah and wendy i'll start with you on i mean first of all i love this on so many levels because it is very much like a woman to say you know what forget it i'll just do it myself you guys are so bad and it feels like that's what happened in 2018 during the midterms it just felt like so many women were just so fed up that they rolled up their sleeves and had to pick up the pieces what was really i guess the inspiration for this film hannah start with you well we were just seeing after the massive women's marches and 2017 we were seeing that women were not only marching but there were all these women from all over the country who were just saying hey we need to run for office to make real change in our communities so wendy and i felt like it was just such an important story and that it would be a historic moment and it ended up being a historic moment with the new congress in 2018 and lauren's incredible win uh so that was really the genesis of the story so so wendy tell us because i know lauren will tell us why lauren was sort of a focus here and why she thought you thought she'd be perfect for this film well when we were casting really for characters and we were trying to figure out who were the races that we wanted to follow we knew that we wanted to follow a really diverse representative group of women and they were all running for the very first time another thing that we were looking for were women who were looking to flip their red districts to blue this was very important so we were looking for these women who really represented this movement and lauren underwood just popped i mean we were early on we had heard about her race we knew she was running in a really challenging district um she's young she's a nurse and she was out there running a really scrappy campaign and fighting the fight and she just really emerged as one of these incredible candidates to follow donnie deutsch i just want as a lone guy on the panel i want to make a point not only i don't know about the fake women's film but the women voters i do believe women are going to save this country uh i've written a book in a chapter in my book i talk about how women are superior the black woman voter the suburban woman voter they have a sense of preservation they have a sense of strength and i really believe at the end of the day we're going to be talking the first week of november about how women save this country so not really a question but really congratulations and i'm reaching out to this superior gender to save us because i know that's what's going to happen it's the women are going to break down donald trump johnny you couldn't you couldn't be more right katy k jump in well a congressman let me take this to you i mean you came into office not knowing that there was going to be a massive pandemic around the corner you have a medical background you are a nurse you would think that would make you a shoo-in for re-election because you understand the science you can deal with the biggest crisis that your constituents are facing at the moment how is it looking for you going into 2020 does the fact that you have this medical background help you well my community certainly knows my credentials and are familiar with our accomplishments three bipartisan bills signed into law by president trump but we do have a competitive race uh and so we're not taking anything for granted we have 60 days until the election about three weeks until ballots are mailed out across my community to those who have requested them and so we are in the thick of it right now you know i learned under what i i i wondered what was the inspiration for your campaign was it sort of being was it being fed up or was this a lifelong career aspiration for you i decided to run after serving in the obama administration you know i worked on public health emergencies and disasters we did ebola and zika and i stayed and served until the very last day and returned home to illinois our state expanded medicaid and i began working for a medicaid managed care plan in chicago when i went to my congressman's one and only public event of 2017. it was during the time of obamacare repeal and he made a promise he said he was only going to vote for a version of repeal that let people with pre-existing conditions keep their health care coverage now i'm a nurse i worked on the affordable care act and i have a pre-existing condition so i believed him because it was personal and then two weeks later he broke his word and voted for the american health care act the version of repeal that did the opposite it made it cost prohibitive for people like me to get affordable coverage and i decided you know what it's on i'm running i love it the new documentary is surge and it premieres on showtime this tuesday at 9 pm hannah rosenswag wendy sachs thank you so much congresswoman lauren underwood thank you as well

how's kenosha recovering well before about this time last year kenosha was growing at a tremendous pace i mean from compared to throughout wisconsin and really throughout the country one of the leaders of growth in the entire country and the government here the people here the schools here the parks everything here was is fantastic and it still is uh but then in august we had we had the unfortunate situation we had the shooting and then we had the riots that followed for days afterwards and it changed i mean the location we're at right now was a was a thriving office furniture place and and it's one of the places that got burnt and it's a terrible situation we had nights of of unrest here we had people that were in their homes afraid of the thousands of people that were marching through the streets oh my god we had i would say most of the sheriff's departments in the state and police departments in the state of wisconsin kane and we had up to we had about 1800 national guard from wisconsin and throughout the four different states too they all came to help protect kenosha and we had at one point over three thousand boots on the ground just to protect us for um what boiled down to about the last week of of the riots and unrest here and it was uh it was a very difficult time it was a very stressful time law enforcement here we we would sleep we'd sleep in our cars at the command post for an hour or two hours every single night and we'd just get up and go back to what we're doing is a very difficult time and i remember just hoping and praying that it would come to an end soon there are also people coming from portland going to washington dc that seemed to take a left-hand detour once they found out what happened to kenosha and found out where kenosha was did you ever get any sense in terms of what percentage roughly uh i would say half of the people that were here in kenosha and it's just it truly is a rough guess i mean we had people from coming down the interstate from the north we had people coming from the south and they were coming off the interstate so we were monitoring that and we had buses of people coming here to do protests and it was kind of amazing we had people from all over the country we had plates we had the fbi and federal agencies intercepting people that were coming here to uh they were threatening to do major harm to our community and to people here so before i move on to how kenosha is doing dead i'm an accountant i like numbers so in the end how many businesses were burned i mean this one oh my god completely completely destroyed i've never when i drove through right afterwards i i thought a couple dozen maybe three dozen and then how many people were arrested charged how many people been convicted do you have any oh i don't know that i think it was about 30 businesses that were looted and burned uh but i mean it's a small percentage of what kenosha is i mean a lot of people when after this happened thought that all of kenosha burnt to the ground it didn't i mean it was a small it was some small mom-and-pop businesses and it was extremely dreadful that that happened but most of kenosha was still up surviving thriving and that black eye that we got last august and september i think we're bouncing back very nicely one of my messages for law enforcement is you know i certainly get the sense the vast majority of americans support you absolutely i mean they are so grateful for the service for the sacrifice i mean the risk you and your loved ones are taking each and every day um i i'm always begging people please don't be discouraged but but i know they are talking to sheriffs around the state and really around the country can you talk a little bit about that i mean the officers that are quitting the difficulty in recruiting just to speak to that um back when i applied for the sheriff's department there were hundreds of people that were at my test uh now in that test that list that we created lasted two years uh now we're testing every six months about 60 people apply and we have people that are after the riots that quit or even people that quit during the rides and they their families wouldn't let them go to it so it's becoming very very difficult for that and i don't know what the future is going to to hold for law enforcement it's something we all need well again you know thank you for your service and sacrifice that and your family and i think it's an important message so the people who are considering law enforcement do realize it's not just it's not the negative drum beat i mean there's some of that that is a very small very small majority and the vast majority of americans are just so appreciative so god bless him thank you thank you okay thanks senator i appreciate it very much

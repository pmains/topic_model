Sherman you paint a picture of luxury if someone has a mortgage of over half a million dollars in California I welcome you to go to the average home in your home state knock on the door say you've got so many bedrooms in that most average home you are living in luxury because I assure you that the average home on the average lot in the state of Wisconsin would cost over a million dollars if located within commuting distance of Silicon Valley those are the prices and perhaps we need to organize you know we take go on Codell z-- to strange and foreign countries perhaps we need a Codell California so that you will see that things are different in my state then they than they are in yours as to our housing finance system we currently have a 30-year fixed-rate non-recourse with a gentleman available can we go in January or February yes done maybe when the Grammys the Emmys will talk it's about time on foreign affairs I never thought of a Codell from this committee but I think it would make sense I we have the 30-year fixed-rate non-recourse pre-payable loan that's the best deal homebuyers have anywhere in the world and oh by the way with a 10% down payment in so many countries if you don't have parental help if you know you can't buy a home you can't get the down payment the tradition in Iceland was is that you work for many many years on on ships in order to get the down payment and it is so I think we've got a system that is good for homebuyers it's also been profitable over the last few years for the government it is not true that back in the 60s we didn't have government involvement what we had then was Savings and Loan institutions with enormous lehigh leverage all supported by the government that provided good mortgages until it collapsed at government cost Ms mcCargo you're absolutely right we need to build more homes mr. Zandi a lot of people in my district which the Chairman will be visiting this winter I come to absolutely they've gotten they've saved all their lives they've put their kids through school and what they have is about a 20% equity in a home that's worth between half a million and a million so let's say we limit the home mortgage deduction to half a million we limit the property tax deduction at ten thousand and we and they go to sell their home the buyers gonna know that there was limits exist and oh by the way the buyers gonna know that those limits aren't indexed so ten twenty years from now when they go to sell their home the word half million dollars will mean a very different thing that it means now what happens to the value of that half million two million dollar home with the if the tax law changes well the analysis I've done is to take the entire house bill and that includes all the things you mentioned plus the increase in the standard deduction yeah which reduces the value of the mid-1500s all else being equal house prices would decline by three to five percent mm-hmm in districts like yours I don't know your specifically but I can guess and areas like in rent where I live in you know suburban Philly New York New Jersey the price declines will be double-digit you know 10 12 percent not that I'm a fan of the mi di mata Hari and I don't think it's as effective in promoting home ownership as it should be so I'm not a fan but I think it is important to recognize that if this plan were adopted HPI house price declines you you should expect in those and that's no obviously gonna be a lot of stress you know for those people for the lenders that made those loans you know it's it's meaningful the government that has insured those loans and if you've got twenty percent equity and your poem goes down twelve percent in value and then you have some transactions cost to sell you're just not going to be able to retire to Wisconsin after you sell your home and finally there's this well I've read a I yield back

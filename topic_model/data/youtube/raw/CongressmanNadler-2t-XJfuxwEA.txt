let me bring in right now congressman jerry nadler Democratic US Rep for New York's 8th congressional district serves as ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee is called for immediate withdrawal and for some time now of US troops from Afghanistan congressman nadler thank you very much for joining us today hi Tom so here it's good to have you how do you look at this Ryan Crocker has a lot of experience in a lot of countries across this region as much as anybody in in American service and he says you know we've got to stay in so we don't repeat history our caller you know right there says look I was in Vietnam I saw what happened there it's going to happen again in Afghanistan as soon as we're gone it'll be like we're never there well I agree with the caller Afghanistan is in the middle of what is so far a 35-year Civil War we do not have the ability or the need to determine the winner in that war which is what we're trying to do if we continue in this course and a couple years will be hundreds of more debt American soldiers a couple hundred billion dollars more wasted and two or three more provinces labeled pacified but as soon as we leave whether we leave now in 2014 and 2016 or 2024 whenever those provinces will promptly become untied the Taliban and the Warlord's will step up the fighting and the Afghan civil war will resume its normal natural course now I heard the the Ambassador talk about al-qaeda but the fact is that our Qaeda not the Taliban attack the Sun 911 al-qaeda had bases in Afghanistan from which they were fighting mayhem we rightly attacked and destroyed those bases and that should have been that but he says look it all repeat they'll come right back there still tight with the Taliban and back they come and we have drones we can destroy the bases again but why is Afghanistan as a base for al-qaeda and the CIA tells us so fewer than 100 are Qaeda personnel in the entire country why do we have to occupy and determine the government in Afghanistan any more than in Yemen or Somalia or a dozen other countries ambassador Crocker how about it get out use drones go after them if it becomes a problem well a couple of points by my first if I could just say say to Greg simply thank you you know thank you for your service at a hard time you know we had Vietnam and Southeast Asia a second thing I'd say is there are a lot of scenarios for at gana stands future returned to the Civil War the early 90s I i do not see as one of them that was a true Civil War at least seven major factions Hazaras against Pashtuns tajuk's against his arse and posh tunes so forth and so on one of the things alaban threatened to take over again anybody's resisting them isn't that in effect a civil war not the same one but isn't that well well in a sense it's it's it's a mirror image the prospect of a you know a Taliban returns has been a enormous unifying factor among Afghans you know the two vice-presidents with Afghanistan one at tajuk another hazara fought each other in the 90s Fred and shed in enormous amounts flood now there are allies against a common foe as are the vast majority of questions so you know this you don't have the fragmentation within Afghanistan that you saw in the early nineties I think it's just a fundamentally different geopolitical in strategic situation will come back and look at that ambassador Ryan Crocker please stand by and congressman jerry nadler we're talking about the turmoil in Afghanistan and the way ahead I'm Tom Ashbrook this is on point we'll be right back talking to Sarah about Afghanistan the troubled war effort and what the US will ultimately leave behind their US ambassador Ryan Crocker is with us until just this July he was top US envoy in Afghanistan he has served all over the Muslim world six time ambassador Presidential Medal of Freedom winner a highly honored and now out and looking back with us today joins us from Spokane Washington congressman jerry nadler is with us as well US Representative from New York's eighth congressional district he has called for immediate US withdrawal from Afghanistan let's get a call her right here Joe in Lexington Kentucky Joe you're on the air thanks for calling I Tom thank you very much for taking my call I just wanted to say that ambassador Crocker has got quite impressive credentials and I think he's wanting to kind of protect his his his image because what he's telling you is going on over is just absolutely BS and spin and it kind of goes with his name it's all a crock no well that's that's a little low he served a lot but what do you know about it Joe well I am I have a son over there and what he tells me and what some other soldiers are telling me that it's what the color from Alabama says that these people none of them want us over there they want us gone now and 30 days after we're gone it's going to be the meanest most American hating group there who comes out on top regardless of what we do how long we stay 10 years 20 years how many hundreds of lives we lose lose it's going to be the same thing soon as we leave it's the art of an army all over again referencing their Vietnam again Joe thank you for your call ambassador Crocker again with respect cuz your service is large but you hear you know there's the father of a serving soldier there who what he's hearing back just doesn't feel hopeful to him say the least and I have enormous respect for his son and and sons and daughters of so many Americans who are doing the nation's work it's the risk and sometimes the cost of their lives I hope they received the honor they deserve when they return home with respect to his specific point you know Afghanistan is a complex place to say the least and there is something going on out there that I think doesn't make the headlines there's a new generation of Afghans the the 20-somethings the early 30-somethings who've grown up in a free society with a free media with access to the internet with educational opportunities that simply never existed before they are totally different than their parents or grandparents who who brought about the Civil War they want a completely changed Afghanistan a democratic peaceful Afghanistan ruled by institutions and by law they are joined by Afghanistan's women who have stepped forward or encouragement here just a moment comes never on the women well I mean this step forward at some risk to themselves an introduction risk and at our encouragement and they will be the first ones to get it in the neck if we decide we're done before the Afghans are able to take control of their own destiny and I don't think as Americans as a moral people we're going to want to have that on our hands congressman how about it you've got Afghans who are stepping up in response to have got to reponsibility five years civil war going on we can't choose the winner in that war which is what we're trying to do it's the game isn't worth the candle it's not worth the American lives it's not worth the hundreds of billions of dollars we're throwing down a drainpipe over there and as this couple of your callers have said they're entirely right the moment we withdraw whether immediately or two years from now or six years from now the Civil War will resume the presently pacified provinces will become an pacified and what will happen will happen and the fact is we have no justification for being there the justification which is that if we withdraw al Qaeda will come back is ridiculous if al Qaeda which had bases there which we destroyed and that was proper to do so if they establish bases there we can destroy them again but they have no more likelihood or it's no more threatening to us have an al Qaeda basin in Pakistan I'm sorry in Afghanistan that in Somalia or Yemen or any other place and we do not have the ability or the need to determine or try to determine the outcome of the Civil War there i'll put the al qaeda question to ambassador Crocker but what about you and your conscience maybe all of ours think think of the Afghan women who have stepped up who have taken a more public less traditional role we know what life was like them under the Taliban we remember the pictures of them being stoned to death ambassador says you know we leave there they're going to get it in the neck we what about that on your conscience well my conscience I would say the following we can continue to help the more enlightened elements with arms but we do not have an obligation to keep American troops there in harm's way indefinitely and it will be indefinite because you have the same argument two years from now and I was going to withdraw in two years we might as well withdraw now there will be no difference ambassador Crocker what about the idea of an al Qaeda come back as ridiculous as the congressman says in Afghanistan that they could set up camp anywhere Yemen Somalia so and it's not going to happen and if it does again that the drone response al-qaeda courses is a global risk and a global enemy of the United States and clearly al Qaeda and the Arabian Peninsula is a concern when one we're dealing with but these are not those countries that you mentioned Yemen and Somalia for example because of their intricate tribal structures are not going to provide a universal safe haven for al Qaeda there are elements that absolutely loathe them for complex reasons Afghanistan was the one country where they could set up shop and plan strategic attacks and unfortunately execute them congressman Adler says well we've taken a lot of them out there not there to do that that is correct they have shown a remarkable ability to regenerate and you know my prediction would be should we pull out prematurely should al Qaeda the Taliban retake control over significant chunks of Afghanistan they will be back not just from the tribal areas in Pakistan across the border but from other parts of the Muslim world and if we will not like the consequences are other gateways was special if we do this by by drone that was Joe Biden's hope that was it that's what he pushed for when this one the Obama surge was under debate I just ask you to bear in mind that the most experienced special forces commander that we have produced general Stan McChrystal when he was in command in Afghanistan and when the discussion was going on in the second half of 2009 about you know to surge or not to surge as a special forces commander as someone intimately familiar with all of our special operating capabilities was the strongest advocate for an increased conventional force because he knew that Special Operations tactics alone would not be sufficient just as they were not sufficient in 1998 to disestablish al-qaeda it was three years after those attacks of course we saw 911 but the the real problem is that we're in the wrong mission we yes Special Forces drones are not sufficient to establish and maintain a stable government in Afghanistan that we would like but we don't need to do that we need to prevent or to stop al Qaeda from having basis the CIA tells us there are fewer than a hundred al-qaeda people in the entire country or they said so last year and the fact is you can take out those bases if they establish them again but we don't have to control the whole country ambassador how about that Oh Special Forces be enough to control the the to constrain a emergence of a terrorist threat in Afghanistan ms alert Tom 22 points the reason that al-qaeda is such a small presence in Afghanistan is because of us you know we we are there if we're not there and if we're not there under circumstances that does not allow the Afghan government and its forces sufficient time to build the capabilities to manage the security situation they will be back and it's quite convinced of that the second point is no one I think is talking about a permanent US presence at substantial levels there will be further draw downs and I said we've given ourselves the flexibilities with the Afghans to take a look at the situation in 2014 but you know whatever comes out wherever we are on 2014 whatever decisions are made I am confident we are not going to be looking at anything even remotely approaching our current force levels because their capabilities will have increased congressman to come soon Edler a messenger Crocker has said that the price of staying on at a lower level than we're there now but but staying on is a pretty reasonably priced insurance policy I've read him characterized as saying against another 911 and against the slaughter of those who have responded the American invitation to a more modern way of life what about that well I don't think the facts bear that up I mean the fact is we keep talking about training the Afghani at the Afghans training them and training them what if they were law is if they really cared it wouldn't take us long to train doesn't take him more than a few months to train a combat soldier why does it take us whether in Vietnam or here years and years and years and years to train our side when who's training the other side and the answer is because we don't have reliable allies who really care about it now the ambassador on the one hand says we can't withdraw on the other hand half because the al Qaeda will reestablish itself in a way that they can't elsewhere because in Somalia Yemen there are tribes and others places but and on the other hand he tells us that half the country hates the Taliban the fact is as I said from the beginning it's a civil war going on there that civil war is going to continue at full force at the moment we leave and you know they're there are people we r who are better than others in terms of our values and I favor helping them but the game is not worth the candle of thousands more or hundreds more American lives than hundreds of billions of dollars arm it makes no sense to concentrate on a war in Afghanistan what do we have to show for Vietnam the same thing is going to be true of Afghanistan we're looking at the American effort in Afghanistan where it goes from here with Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York and ambassador Ryan Crocker just out of services top US envoy in Afghanistan I'm Tom Ashbrook this is on point let me get a caller right here Jimmy Columbus Georgia Jimmy you're on the air thanks for calling yes sir I do all right good I know I just had a couple of points i'm a service member i just got back from Afghanistan about months ago is my 8th trip 7s games and one in Iraq I'm in the soft community and the ambassador Crocker you know completely commend your service to our country and your service there in Afghanistan the only thing is that you know the way I look at it is risk versus reward you know we've already lost nearly 2,000 you know your forces there in Afghanistan and I'll Qaeda you know we need to focus on al-qaeda but at the same time our current forces are you know I focused on Pig focused on the Taliban focused on how Connie focus on TPP focused on you know people coming in from the north you know from foreign foreign fighters north and then you know the Pakistani ISI there's so much at stake there in afghan then I think it's a lost cause in the beginning it was a noble cause but due to this Mac you know issues and the whole you know problem with your politics is just it it through a third a wrench into the military working machine Jimmy may I ask you you you've been there you've been serving seven times you've been there we respect that here's ambassador Crocker he has spent a lot of time in this region as well and he's a smart guys well how do you account for the difference between his perspective and yours how do you account for that I ground and not on the ground if that makes any sense there I you know there's difference between you know being on the ground and actually knowing exactly what's going on I was in you know just recently about a month ago did a four month or there i was in konark which I'm sure ambassador Crocker nose is a heavily contested area of Afghanistan that al-qaeda and you could be and learn another enemy factions are fighting over you know it's just granted granted al-qaeda is you know probably under 100 people 100 fighters but they have if you want to say trees with other enemy factions that kind of bolster their their enemy strength to beyond that so you're looking at not a civil war as the other gentleman was talking about but as a Afghanistan as an enemy as a territory being contested over by enemy factions with the same ideological beliefs so that they can you know house you know you know the infidels in the end resources Jimmy we've got our time is short I apologize we thank you for your service I appreciate your observations there a lot Congress and never go finally to the Ambassador but first you you know the 911 threat it you can say let's get out but the Ambassador says you know what you can find yourself right back in that situation I with all due respect I don't believe that at all I think when the Germans take down an al-qaeda cell in Frankfort that's equally or more important because the al-qaeda threat is they're not training battalions and divisions and armored Panzer divisions that there that they're staging and Afghanistan that if their camps their training camps are relatively that you can first so that you can take out by bombing but second of all the threat al-qaeda poses is not of an invasion of this country's by a few terrorists infiltrating us well we know what that I mean ambassador Crocker them and last word goes to you you've got a minute here to talk to Americans who are clearly responding pretty skeptically today what do you say about the the horizon here in Afghanistan first Tom I i do see a premature withdrawal as creating the conditions that would allow al-qaeda to reestablish and regroup and what they need in order to run a successful international network is a solid and secure base of operations you've got to watch cells in Germany and elsewhere but that becomes a whole lot easier to do if they don't have that base and that's what we've seen over the past decade we have to be sure they don't get it back they want it back in Afghanistan we need to be certain they don't get it second that doesn't mean a permanent major US military presence quite the opposite we are going to draw down we simply have to do so in a responsible way that ensures the Afghans can maintain broad control over their own security and therefore our needs a picture ambassador Ryan Crocker our thanks to you today congressman jerry nadler thanks to you as well I'm Tom Ashbrook this is on point

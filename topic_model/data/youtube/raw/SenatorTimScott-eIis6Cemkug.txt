to be very blunt let us speak plainly a permanent member of the united nations security council invaded its neighbor attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map what he didn't do which i wish he would have gone further is call out the countries that are helping russia call out the fact that china is helping call out the fact that iran's sending drones call out north korea for doing rockets he could have made that a bigger isolation if he would have called those countries out that was former u.n ambassador south carolina governor nikki haley they're slamming the president for his speech at the u.n earlier today but from the tension on the world stage to liberal media pettiness on the sound stage one of the women of the view taking issue with nikki haley over her name i think that nikki haley was an incredibly effective governor of south carolina nikki haley's gone by nikki since she was a child it's documented in high school i wouldn't be shocked that as somebody an indian woman growing up in south carolina at that time she actually did to avoid prejudice so i just want to be careful about critiquing her going back there are some of us that can be chameleons and decide not to embrace our ethnicity so that we can pass i don't think that's fair by a different name i didn't want to be the one to say it americans can't pronounce austin because of the education nikki haley firing back and tweeting thanks for your concern sonny it's racist of you to judge my name nikki is an indian name and is on my birth certificate and i'm proud of that what's sad is the left's hypocrisy toward conservative minorities by the way last i checked sunny isn't your birth name speaking of names critics pointing out if sunny has such an issue she could be could speak to her liberal co-host let's get reaction now from a fellow south carolinian republican senator tim scott extremely offensive that exchange on that show sandra absolutely i can't imagine that in america today that sonny's having a conversation about nikki haley's name let's have a conversation about how good of a governor she was let's have a conversation about how all of south carolinians especially minorities in our state saw their opportunities go up not down under her leadership the fact of the matter is that when you see strong powerful positive minorities standing up on the conservative side the love always wants to hit and demoralize diminish our impact i am thanking god that i was born and raised in south carolina and i thank god that nikki haley was our governor i can't think of a worse situation to see on tv than someone who doesn't go by her own name talking about nikki haley whose name is nikki she spent the hour with our harris faulkner they had a lot obviously to get to because the president was speaking at the united nations ultimately they did get around to this topic here's what nikki haley said just a short time ago the idea that they can do this you're not going to see her fired from that show we're not even going to see an apology from that show because they let liberals say that about conservative republican minorities all the time but yet nothing is done had this been said about a democrat all hell would have broken loose so let's just pick up on on that thing because you uh were the victim of they were different allegations but they were of a piece of of this and it was unfair and didn't tell your story yes absolutely well listen one of the things i've learned from liberal media is they will question your own life story i mean the fact that washington post did a fact check to see if my grandfather in 1927 finished uh school in the third grade or the fourth grade they spent three months doing a research to figure out when my grandfather stopped going to school the fact that there are hosts that say call me uncle tim the the the bigotry from the left is condoned by today's media and or celebrated in today's media i feel i feel sorry for those folks who are afraid of conservatives who are minorities it is the power of choice the power of being an individual that we should all celebrate the power of choosing your own destiny that's the power of choice that sets people free all right i want to move on to the momentum that seems to be on the side of democrats as we work our way seven weeks out from the midterm elections you put up put up on the screen here the balance of power and now 30 toss-ups in the race in the house which if democrats run run the table uh they could keep the majority there um and republicans could gain a major majority if they were to run the table so we're watching that and then you can put up the senate power rankings with the forecast majority 51-4 toss-up senator what is going on here and why did it look like a red wave was coming months ago and that potential margin of victory for your party seems to be shrinking well sandra i'm so very bullish on our odds of winning back the majority in the house and the senate uh this november there's no doubt about it that our candidates on the field are executing in really positive fashion it's one of the reasons why i have chosen to not only campaign at home in south carolina but to go to wisconsin into ohio and hopefully philadelphia and also in nevada really soon as well so i'm traveling the country while maintaining my presence at home because we are going to win back majorities and frankly all the polls that suggest otherwise they've been wrong so often i don't even pay attention to them yeah i mean nate cohen did an article in the new york times about how wrong some of the polls are in some of these battleground states and have been since 2016 but but here's but here's the reality the democrats have really been able to leverage the messaging on the dobbs decision from at the beginning of the summer and the abortion issue and that's being credited with cutting into what was looked like was an insurmountable republican lead at the same time republicans should be running away on the economy inflation and jobs i mean when you take a look at the president the other night on 60 minutes down playing eight point three percent saying well i was just just an inch from the previous month but you're not well john i i disagree with you let me tell you this one of the things that the american people are focused on is the fact that for six consecutive months inflation has been over eight percent for 17 consecutive months inflation has outpaced wage growth so when you talk to the average voter across the country as i am in person the one thing they talk about is inflation the second they talk about is the economy the third thing they talk about is gas and when you get to the fourth it's crime the truth is that we are going to win bank majorities because we're talking about what the american people want to hear i know that there is a progressive movement that wants to change the subject because they're so terrible on the economy i'd want to change the subject if i was on their side too but the truth is you can't change the subject when you pull up to the gas pump you can't change the subject when you go to the grocery store this is coming there's a red wave coming and i thank god we're writing it i think i think also people are really hungry for some some positive messaging on the economy because people are living through this and it's it's economic pain on the average american family that's shelling out more and more money every month nearly 500 now more than last year just to pay for inflation working more 70 hours a week some families an all-time high working two full-time jobs a week now living paycheck to paycheck 60 of the population i want to pop the dow up because we just got this major decision by the federal reserve that has been tasked to tame that 40-year high inflation markets are selling off here they're down 225 points said since the fed just announced this another interest rate hike senator so are they going to be able to get this under control should they been a more aggressive well sandra i think we are in a very uh precarious position as it relates to our economy the truth is that as the fed continues to use their biggest tool in the toolbox it's just not enough to slow down this inflationary effect that we're seeing throughout the economy and i would suspect that next month will be much like this month much like last month the truth is 75 basis points is the best they could have done we're already in a recession more than half this country has less than a thousand dollars in their savings account the truth is andrew as a kid who grew up in a single parent household i will tell you when my mom pulled up to the gas pump and gases are 50 or 60 percent higher that was a crisis in our lives we were looking for nickels and quarters and dimes to put gas in the car to get to work people misunderstand what's happening in america because they spend too much time in washington and too little time in somerville south carolina or in anderson south carolina this is a challenge and it's not going away between on the election i want to move on to another issue if we could senator that seems to be building in terms of an election year issue it was a big one last year in the virginia governor's race and that is parental rights when it comes to what your children are being taught in schools or basically whether or not their life at school is being forcefully separated from yours you have introduced the protect act and i'm always amazed by these acronyms which stands for parental rights education yeah the parental rights over the education and care of their kids act it would prohibit schools from concealing information about students gender from their parents people at home might say well what are you talking about that's exactly what the fairfax county public school system wants to do here in virginia well exactly john i'm just saying let's follow the laws the fact of the matter is that your child is your most precious of possession it's your greatest asset is your wonderful hope for your future and to literally separate the child from the parent at 9 10 11 and 12 years old is just i can't imagine it's unimaginable what's happening in schools big labor unions and bureaucrats are stopping parents from knowing what's happening to their kids parents should be talking to their teachers not having to file a freedom of information act to see if their kids learning about crt or some gender issue in the fourth grade that's unconscionable literally unconscionable we should stop seeing schools indoctrinate kids and get back to educating that child this is just one aspect of getting our education system back on track it's really been a mess and a lot of parents have gotten a first-hand look at that because of the pandemic looking over their kid's shoulder during virtual learning hearing what teachers were teaching in the classroom but we know we also have a problem of teacher shortages in this country it's a bit of a mess when it comes to our public education system how do we get back senator well sandra one of the things that i've been saying for the last nine years is that we have to introduce more options for parents the more choices a parent has the better chance the kid has for succeeding out of all that money given away last year to schools about 93 percent of the dollars are still unspent i have legislation that would take a portion of those dollars give it to the parents so they can choose a school that's actually having in-room curriculum in-room classes or you can actually find a mentor or find a tutor to help your kid with math or science or reading the basics so one of the ways that we get ourselves back in line with the future of america by educating kids today is simply by giving the parents the resources they need and the options they need to make simple choices and by the way sandra this country spends nearly 750 billion dollars overall k-12 we're not it's not a money issue it's who is who has the power and the powers in the hands of labor unions adults not children that's what it's all about that's what it's all about who's got the power well we'll see how this plays out as we wind down to november the 8th senator it's always great to catch up with you thanks for coming thank you so much senator great to have you thank you john take care yes ma'am all right

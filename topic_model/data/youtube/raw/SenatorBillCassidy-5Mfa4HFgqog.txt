look who's here from senate finances senator bill cassidy and carol roth senator and carol it's so good to have you both on this friday thanks for spending time with us it's good to see you thank you senator those 230 economists include a nobel laureate academics from the university of chicago princeton and duke but you know what what really jumped out senator is that senator chuck schumer claims moody says it will cut inflation it didn't say that at all well chuck has grasped his straws when just about everybody is saying that you're going to increase inflation um you know to quote mitch mcconnell apparently democrats didn't think that a record low 30 percent of americans approve of how they're handling the economy was low enough and and i think this is going to be um jacking up inflation hurting people in their pockets book both by increased taxes but also by making them pay more and to what the senator is saying what's happening here is carol is senator kirsten sinema and senator chuck schumer they get a lot of campaign money from wall street from private equity now senator cinema says yes to it after they dropped that 14 billion tax increase on private equity that could that maybe that could mean more irs audits of the middle class and small businesses to make up for that void what do you think yes i'm very shocked that they're not going after their billionaire cronies who give them their funding and lobbyist money and that they're going after the middle tech class just like they did in the american rescue plan when they lowered the reporting threshold from twenty thousand dollars to six hundred dollars on e-commerce this is the plan the billionaires they're never gonna go after them the real money grab is with the middle class and so if you get everyone to agree to something in principle then all of a sudden when the details come out and go well it wasn't really a tax but you know you're gonna pay more in terms of inflation and corporations are gonna pass those taxes on to you unfortunately this is what happens every time and people are starting to get the rules and starting to push back lives yeah to what carol is saying senator uh if people don't want fastballs whipped past them can you talk to us more about how the the gop is ramping up amendments to embarrass democrats into admitting on the record that during an inflation crisis they want to pay for their billions in corporate welfare with massive middle class tax hikes including more taxes on u.s oil and gas and manufacturers hidden excise tax and royalty rate hikes too right yeah so we used the amendments just to kind of expose what carol was talking about that for all the high-minded rhetoric the title that says it's going to reduce inflation that's not what it's going to do and go through how wait a second we are going to have basically a a oil a per barrel of oil tax that's passed straight down to the gasoline pump and other things that are going to drive up the cost for the average consumer and and how she pays for her groceries her utilities and her fuel those amendments will attempt to establish that for the american people and to what the senator's saying carol people are sick of how dishonest democrats are consistently chronically dishonest right you know so you can't force companies to pay taxes they're saying this 15 tax rate minimum tax on companies with a billion in profits that they're going to bring in revenue from that no companies can just pass it on now this is so frustrating because these are the people who have lied about and been wrong about everything whether it is the economy starting to contract whether it's inflation with stimulus money every single thing they have been wrong on and now all of a sudden they are going to centrally plan the economy and it is going to be perfect it's insane of course corporations aren't going to eat this increase in taxes of course their shareholders aren't going to increase or eat the increase in taxes it is going to either stifle some of the expenses in terms of innovation um and expect capital expenditures and or it's going to be passed along directly to the consumer which means the consumer once again is bearing more of the brunt of the cost at a time right when their savings are going down and their credit cards are going up you know people are feeling the pain senator you know there was a time when democrats said do not do not raise taxes in the teeth of a recession we're in one watch this the last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the middle of a recession when the economy is in decline you don't want to raise overall taxes i i don't think during a time of recession you mess with any of the taxes or increase any taxes in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and this is a global recession we can't lose sight of that that this is a gl this what's happening here in the united states is happening all across the globe and quite honestly in a higher level something in some places labor secretary saying we're in a recession that democrats in the white house keep denying what what is going on with this party senator yeah i'm not quite sure and there's worse than that building on what carol said cbo says because of this tax upon manufacturers that they are going to invest less in our country it means and and the national association manufacturers estimates two hundred thousand manufacturing jobs will be lost now we're in a jobs war we're in a jobs world china with other countries they are subsidizing people to build there corporations to build there and yet all of a sudden we're going to raise tax on the manufacturers who are creating jobs for our middle class so it's the taxes it's the higher fuel prices it is also fewer jobs it's a bad blow to people's pocketbook to the what the senator just said carol republican senators were just off the hook upset today including senator cassidy we're going to show the senator weighing in with other republicans today and yesterday watch this well the cbo says next year inflation will go up or down 0.1 percent so that's not much of a reduction it's about as accurate as saying the border secure and the taliban didn't knows our area was in kabul this is a fraud it's a lie joe manchin what the heck are you thinking why why why much of it is going to be geared and oriented toward increasing the cost of energy the economy is coming to a halt we're in a recession this is going to make it worse i will not vote for a continuing resolution that is part of a political payback scheme if you think you're going to get 60 votes you need to think long and hard about what you're doing well let me tell you who's going to feel the brunt of that it's going to be small businesses if you want to lose a manufacturing war this is what you do there's senator cassidy uh you know carol how can they think you know what's really disturbing too and the center is going to weigh in on this that they want to raise taxes with just democrat votes with no republican votes what does this mean for the state of our country today that you can do that and put that in the american people with no bipartisan behind it whatsoever is that for me liz yes that's for you carol sorry okay sorry about that yeah i mean they don't have the mandate people are frustrated look at the poll numbers they're frustrated by the way the congress is handling the economy we heard it from the senator before and amen to you senator for standing up for us this is really crushing and hollowing out the middle class and the working class at the benefit of the elite and the wealthy of well-connected we have been through a historic wealth transfer over the last couple of years it is going to continue and we're going to be in a place where the middle class and working class are entirely decimated senator cassidy your final word yeah this is a bill that's going to touch the american people in a bad way they'll pay more at the pump more for utilities more for groceries because fuel is so much a part of getting groceries to you right and i agree with carol this is this is not this is not a mandate to raise taxes if anything they should lower taxes senator cassidy carol raw thanks for joining us it's good to see you thank you

so I'm working my way through this disaster of a Republican health care bill in many ways as I'm going through it it's even meaner than the house proposal it's even dumber than the house proposal but I wanted to clean in as to what I found so far so that if you have a copy if you want to print it out at home if you want to spend your weekend working through it you know what to look for so the first and maybe most important thing is right around page 39 this is where the gigantic Medicaid cuts start talking about bigger deeper cuts to Medicaid than were even in the House bill that means states are going to have their Medicaid dollars lopped off it means states are going to have to make choices between seniors staying in nursing homes being kicked out of nursing homes it means that millions and millions of kids who get their health care through Medicaid are going to be throwing off their health care after that maybe the second most important thing is the section that begins on page 7 this is where the tax credits that right now help Americans buy insurance on these health care insurance exchanges get decimated the tax credits go way down so that less and less Americans are going to be able to afford health care and even if you do get the tax credits more of your money is going to have to come out of pockets that means premiums go up or the amount of money you pay for premiums goes up then all the way back on page 134 you're going to be looking at the section of the bill that puts an age tax on older Americans right now insurance companies can't charge you at an older American more than three times as much as younger Americans that number goes up to five times as much so in the House bill that would be an 800 percent increase in premiums for the lower income older Americans let's see you next thing I think is important to talk about is right at the end and that's the waiver section of the bill page 136 starts the the part of the bill that allows for states to get rid of some of the insurance protections one of those is the essential health care benefits protection saying if you're going to buy an insurance plan ask to cover a minimum amount of health care including maternity care including mental health care including prescription drugs that's all gone in this bill now states don't have to protect you against insurance companies that want to give you a bare-bones health care plan that means for people with mental illness you may not be able to find a plan in your state that covers it and lastly back to the middle of the bill somewhere around page 29 is the tax cuts all of this is designed to fund a giant tax cut for millionaires billionaires insurance companies and drug companies if you're making under two hundred thousand dollars a year you get almost nothing out of this bill in terms of tax cuts whereas tens of thousands of dollars will go to millionaires and billions of dollars will go to drug companies and insurance companies there's your highlights read it for yourself this weekend and then call your legislator if you're in a Republican state get on the phone come down to Washington we only have a few days to stop this from decimating the American health care system

quarterback candidate who just won nebraska's gop senate primary this week joining me right now for his first cable news interview since claiming victory is ben sass congratulations ben and i know you must be uh everything must be in a whirlwind right now but before we talk about his candidacy and chances of keeping that senate seat republican i want to talk to you first about these new emails that have come to light thanks to the freedom of information watch and judicial watch i should say that show a connection between washington cincinnati and the irs targeting of tea party groups your reaction you know there's a pattern with this administration you try to obfuscate and deny and delay and then by the time there's information that comes out they say it's old news and it's really troubling we need more aggressive congressional oversight and this administration needs to stop trying to write law and uh and just if they're out of control i mean it really took high profile tea party type candidates like sarah palin ted cruz and others to help you out but other people didn't have the benefit weren't the beneficiary of the tea party and how they've organized that that election is now in our rearview mirror do you think it's time for us to move on or drill down you know what i find in nebraska is that the the folks here they believe that the center of life is in nebraska not in washington dc and what tea party means to most of the folks across our state is they want more urgency out of washington about the bigger things and staying out of the vast majority of life so i think when you when you talk to people across the 93 counties in nebraska what they're looking for is a lot more serious return to constitutional principles which is just the american idea that life has fundamentally lived in the private sector i think that idea is a winning idea all across the electorate so ben you're you're a guy that just collected 49 of the vote in your district so you're looking to fill that republican seat of uh that's being vacated right now but in the big picture you're a guy that fixes things starting from your old university on down you think you could do that same thing with washington you know i i think the people of america when they're set free to build great things they do it and and we can fix big things in this country but not if you try to centrally plan life you look at obamacare trying to essentially plan 18 percent of gdp it's not working the people know it isn't going to work you need to re-empower doctors and patients and the local community and i think that's true in sector after sector in america so we need to we need to free up the american people to be fixing things by having washington d.c stop meddling in every area of life do you think ted cruz and company and uh and senator lee are coming out and saying it's good we hope ben gets in because we need some help in there do you find yourself much different than the so-called mainstream republican you know i i'm not always sure what mainstream republican means so many of these labels seem like they're driven by national liberal media whose favorite topic is republicans fighting republicans in the election that we just had tuesday night we had five good candidates running on the republican side but what ultimately happened in our election was people rallied around the idea of america and i think that you know if if mainstream republican means you're satisfied with the way washington works right now then the people in nebraska we don't believe in that we don't think i'm a very conservative guy but we don't think the problem in washington is just that the democrats are in charge we think that it's too many republicans want washington to be dc to be in charge and we want nebraska to be in charge and we want our neighbors in the south and kansas and oklahoma and texas to want their states and their communities to be in charge so i think we can bridge a lot of these republican divides and we can move forward building a bigger future but not if you think that washington rule in the country is in our interest because we don't believe that and uh and ben when you look at uh the tea party today and the fact that you are the so-called tea party candidate who won convincingly the nomination uh what do you think that says about the health of the tea party that so many want to write off you know in our case in our campaign what we were trying to do is say we wanted more of everybody we wanted more pro-lifers more second amendment folks and more tea partiers or constitutional conservatives and more small business people but what most tea party people want to talk about is a constitutional recovery and i really believe that that's a winning message across the whole republican party and across the middle of the electorate as well so i want to celebrate the the tea party ideals of constitutional conservatism but let's talk about what it means and what we're for not just what we're against and when you talk to to nebraskans all across this state that's what they want they want to hear what we're for i don't think a ben nelson nebraska compromise is on your agenda but let's see if you get the uh seat dave domino will be your opponent on the democratic side it's game on congratulations ben sasse on your victory on tuesday thanks a lot welcome to nebraska we're glad you're here all right

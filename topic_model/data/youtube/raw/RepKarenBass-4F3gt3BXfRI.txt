gentlelady from California Thank You mr. chair director Muller as you know we are focusing on five obstruction episodes today I would like to ask you about the second of those five obstruction episodes it is in the section of your report beginning on page 113 of volume 2 entitled quote the president orders Magan to deny that the president tried to fire the Special Counsel in quote On January 25th 2018 the New York Times reported that quote the president had ordered Magan to have the Department of Justice fire you is that correct correct and that story related to the events you already testified about here today the president's calls to McCann to have you removed correct correct after the news broke did the president go on TV and deny the story do not know in fact the president said quote fake news folks fake news a typical New York Times fake story in quote correct correct but your investigation actually found substantial evidence that Magan was ordered by the President to fire you correct yes did the president's personal lawyer do something the following day in response to that news report I'd refer you to the coverage of this in the report on page 114 quote On January 26 2018 the president's personal counsel called McGann's attorney and said that the president wanted Magan to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel in quote did McCann do what the president asked I refer you to the report communicating through his personal attorney McCann refused because he said quote that the Times story was accurate in reporting that the president wanted the special counsel removed isn't that right I believe it is but I refer you again to the report okay so mr. McCann through his personal attorney told the president that he is was not going to lie is that run true did the president drop the issue I refer to the write-up of this and the report okay next the president told the White House staff secretary Rob Porter to try to pressure McCann to make a false denial is that correct that's correct what did he actually direct Porter to do and I would send you back to the report okay well on page 113 it says quote the president been directed Porter to tell him again to create a record to make it clear that the president never directed McCann to fire you in quote is that correct that is as a statement as stated in the report and you found quote the president said he wanted Magan to write a letter to the file for our records correct correct and to be clear the president is asking his White House Counsel Dan McCann to create a record that McCann believed to be untrue while you were in the midst of investigating the president for obstruction of justice correct generally correct and mr. McCann was an important witness in that investigation wasn't he I'd have to say yes did the president tell Porter to threaten the can if he didn't create the written denial I'd completed a write-up of it in the report in fact didn't the president say quote and this is on page 116 if he doesn't write a letter then maybe I'll have to get rid of him in quote yes did Porter deliver that threat I again refer you to the discussion that's found on a 2115 okay but the president still didn't give up duty so the president told McGann directly to deny that the president told him to have you fired can you tell me exactly what happened I can't be on what's in the report well on page 116 it says the president met him in the Oval Office quote the president began the oval office meeting by telling McCann that the New York Times story didn't look good and McCann needed to correct it is that correct right so as it's written in the report yes the president asked McGann whether he would do a correction and McCann said no correct that's accurate well mr. Muller thank you for your investigation uncovering this very disturbing evidence my friend mr. Richmond will have additional questions on the subject however it is clear to me if anyone else had ordered a witness to create a false record and cover up acts that are subject of a law enforcement investigation that person would be facing criminal charges I yield back my time

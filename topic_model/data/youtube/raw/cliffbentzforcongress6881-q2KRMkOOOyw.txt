hi this is cliff bents happy to be with you this afternoon I'm going to talk about the 2017 transportation package there was some suggestion that this somehow escaped Brownsville it wasn't the bill was designed and put together by legislators it happened that during 2017 there were 35 Democrats in the Oregon House and 25 Republicans so the Democrats only needed one Republican vote to get to the magic 36 which is the amount of votes it takes to pass a transportation or a tax bill a transportation tax or gas tax is dedicated by the Constitution to roads the money raised at the pump must be used for roads and bridges it happened that there is a incredible need in Oregon to maintain bridges the ODOT analysis indicates that of the state owned bridges at the rate of repair and replacement it would have taken us somewhere between 700 and 900 years to replace our bridges the life of a bridge is about 150 years so this was not going to work and in addition we had a slow but sure crumbling and deterioration of our state highways so something happened to be it had to be done this is not a situation where one can hope that somehow the economy will expand and thus allow more gasoline to be sold in fact just the opposite this happening as more people drive higher mileage cars and in fact electric cars they're not paying into the the ODOT funds to help keep our roads maintained so something had to be done House bill 2017 was that bill and we Republicans had a choice we could have stood over on the side and watched and eventually one of those 25 Republicans would have joined the Democrats made a deal of some sort and the rest of us would have been left watching a really bad bill so the caucus appointed me to go in and negotiate for them and put together the best Bill possible report back to them frequently to let them know what was going on and this idea now it happened that dr. Bueller was a member of our caucus at the time and he was kept up to speed on every part of the bill and he did not object to the bill and in fact sat down with me on a case on a number of occasions to go over the content of the bill not to mention asking for a project the Cooley interchange of 50 million dollars eventually he was doing this request because he had decided he was going to vote against the bill he was running for governor so that was certainly his choice and it turned out that gene Whisnant represent Whisnant wanted the Cooley interchange also so that's a that's why the 50 million went to bend they came to me and asked if I would put it on the list and I did the the the rest of the bill is is replete with things that are good for rural Oregon and this is because weed Republicans were at the table and we managed to leverage that one vote into hundreds of millions of dollars coming back from Portland and into rural Oregon because like President Trump I understand that infrastructure is an absolutely essential part of what we do in this huge part of the state known as rural Oregon we have to have bridges we have to have roads and this bill gives us gives those things to us in addition it preserves the inheritance if you will the legacy of our parents and grandparents who have built such a wonderful system of roads bridges culverts and it's incumbent upon us to make sure we don't just use them up and leave it up to our kids to somehow come in and find the money to repair infrastructure they see the very foundation of our economy so much more to talk about on this but I'll stop at this point [Applause] [Music]

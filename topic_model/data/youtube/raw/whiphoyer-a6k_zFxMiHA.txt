panel and the politics lead but first as Congress appears to slide closer to a potential government shutdown tomorrow with members of both parties saying that they will reject a stopgap measure to keep the government open just another month house Minority Whip Steny Hoyer Democrat of Maryland joins me now and Congressman thanks for joining me I guess the big the big question for Democrats is it worth shutting down the government if the Republicans short term government funding deal doesn't include provisions for the dreamers this is not solely about the dreamers the Republicans have had a hundred and twenty days plus we all were whelmingly but mattified every Democrat voted for a 90-day extension in September to give us time to reach an agreement on some of the important issues the most important of which was working funding caps so that we would know how much we were going to spend in the coming year we asked for the same deal that Paul Ryan made with Senator Murray for four years running and we still have not had that agreement so we're asking for an additional time but the Republicans have not done anything in the time there and to them to get to the issues that we need to follow including for instance in this bill we've had a major major disaster in for two states and and the Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands there's no supplemental relief here we don't have community health centers included in this bill yes they include this chip but a lot of the chip children go to community health centers and they're not funded in this bill so so there are a lot of things that the Republicans have not done that we're saying look don't ask us to vote for just kicking the can down the road when you don't address in the time we give you any kind of compromises which will get a majority of votes in the house representing okay but this bill would fund the government through February and they included measures to directly try to appeal to you and and Democrats in the House and Senate including as you note six years of funding for children's health insurance as well as provisions to delay some unpopular Obamacare taxes you could do all that keep the government open use the next month to negotiate everything you're talking about plus help the dreamers aren't you worried about that about firing it voting against funding chip I don't know that this bill helps the dreamers I'm not sure will you get to that I could negotiate in that in the ensuing well of course we could have negotiated for the last 90 days last 120 days Jake we haven't done that they're just asking to kick the can down the road again they have not said they're going to negotiate with us they have not said what any of the agreements that we think are necessary to move forward will be so that they're just saying look we haven't been able to do our work we we Republicans we haven't passed a single appropriation bill and sent it to the president we haven't set caps for 2018 spending we're a third of the way into 2018 the Republicans have a responsibility to say look here are the funding levels we did that when we were in the majority they need to do that as well very frankly they have the votes to keep government open all they have to do is cast those votes they you need 218 votes they have 241 votes exercise your responsibilities as the majority so as the people who have been given them responsibility by the American people to run this house don't look to us to just kick the can down the road without any agreements from you on the priorities that we think are important we think s chip is important by the way Paul Ryan said he would not put non-controversial bills in with controversial bills that's exactly what he's doing today we're all for chip we're going to have an opportunity to vote on making chip go forward on its own right we Democrats going to vote for that we're for chip we ought to do that so I told I told the majority leader two months ago two and a half months ago when he put a partisan chip bill through the house I said mr. McCarthy that's not going to work let's come together and reach agreement we didn't do it now they can move it because OMB has made it much easier to do in terms of paying for it but we want to see that bill pass it could pass on suspension this afternoon so let me just ask you and show you first of all how how Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan are describing the Democrats stance take a listen look at the states are gonna be shutting down ship in days Alabama Connecticut Kentucky Louisiana Oregon Virginia Washington State these are states that are running out of chip money if we don't get this thing passed and I can't imagine why somebody would want to vote against doing that isn't it possible that voters might punish Democrats in the midterms if they if these programs shut down because you vote against this government funding bill look this is the crowd that shut down government for 16 days purposefully if we didn't repeal the Affordable Care Act Paul Ryan didn't put this bill on the floor s chip that he talks being so concerned about until long after it the authorization had run out in September Paul Ryan put a partisan bill on the floor knowing full well that it would not pass the Senate and it didn't pass the Senate Paul Ryan knows that he can put the s chip bill on the floor this afternoon and then we'll pass probably unanimously and certainly will get every Democratic vote Paul Ryan is trying to blackmail the Democratic Party into doing what he wants without in fact coming to agreements that are necessary to move this country forward I think it's pretty disingenuous and I'm disappointed with the speaker all right Democratic whip Steny Hoyer thanks so much for joining me good to see you so Easter breaking news just in about the testimony of one of President Trump's closest confidants hope Hicks and the rush investigation we're gonna bring that to you right after this quick break stay with us [Music]

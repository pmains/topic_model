things and joining us now is democratic congressman adam schiff california he's the chair of the house intelligence committee and chairmanship we heard president biden today say clearly uh vladimir putin is a war criminal does that mean that intelligence indicates that the targeting we are seeing in ukraine is deliberate and can be proved to be deliberate targeting of civilians including babies and every other age group i think the president's statement was really from the heart of his sense which i agree with that putin is a war criminal uh that he has now the blood of children on his hands um i think it was more of a human statement than it was a legal statement but uh but i think it's pretty clear lawrence any way you slice it that these this bombing is indiscriminate uh at best and it works deliberately targeting civilian structures and i do think that that he has committed war crimes and he ought to be held accountable um but but first of all we have to do everything we can to help the ukrainian people and i think administration is doing a great deal and we'll be doing more what was your reaction to being in the room today uh with president zielinski delivering that historic address well it was one of those few times in recent memory where it would be hard to tell democrats from republicans i think we were all very moved by what he had to say and uh and also by those images of civilians being killed and to me among the most staggering was the image of a father holding the hand of his disease child in the hospital hard to to see that and not be moved not want to do everything to move heaven and earth to bring this uh war putin's war of aggression to an end so i think we all left with even greater resolve to do what we can to support ukraine and its time of need to rebolster its defenses and also provide even more sanctions on russia for this heinous act of terror i want to put up in the screen uh an outline of what president biden has announced is being sent to ukraine now in nine thousand anti-armor systems including 2 000 javelins 800 anti-aircraft systems 7 000 small arm machine guns shotguns grenade launchers 20 million rounds in ammunition 100 switchblade killer drones other military equipment uh with your knowledge of the utility of these things uh what do you see as the most important elements of that package i think most important elements are the anti-aircraft editions that will help ukraine shoot down russian planes uh but also keep russian planes uh from uh owning the skies uh which would accelerate the russian land operations um i also think the anti-tank weapons have been used by ukraine ukraine to great effect uh taking out tanks taking out other armed vehicles and now uh the the provision of drones um public reporting about the turkish drones being utilized the great effect by ukrainian forces uh and uh the provision now of the germans united states only adding to ukraine's many capabilities chairman adam schiff thank you very much for joining us once again tonight we always appreciate it thank you

West Virginians are some
of the kindest, most big hearted people that you'll
ever meet. And as a US Senator, I'm proud to help
West Virginians help others. Earlier this year,
Mrs. Janette Reever of Hampshire County reached
out for assistance receiving her passport.
Mrs. Reever works for the Humane Society
International and she was set to travel to Costa
Rica and Mexico this summer to train
authorities and nonprofit organizations in
identifying, investigating and prosecuting cases of
animal cruelty. My caseworker Angie
immediately reached out to Mrs. Reever to offer
assistance, and I contacted the National
Passport Center to request her passport be expedited.
I am happy to report that within 24 hours, Mrs.
Reever had her passport in hand. When I received that call
from Senator Manchin's office saying that he got
it done, it was literally, the weight had been
lifted, and it was literally like a miracle
had happened. I really truly did not think it was
going to happen. And I thought if it does come
it's going to be weeks before. Nope, it was
within 24 hours. It was overnighted to me. To say
I was relieved as an understatement. There was
tears, there was clapping, joy. I cannot begin to
tell you how much I appreciate Senator Manchin
and his office. Thank you, Mrs. Reever for
your dedication protecting animals. It was an honor
to help make this trip a success. If you or someone
you know is in need of assistance with a state or
federal agency, please contact my office at
304-342-5855. My staff and I are always ready to help
fellow West Virginians.

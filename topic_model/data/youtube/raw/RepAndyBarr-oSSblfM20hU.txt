about africa given your extensive experience on that continent and in the context of the threat from china i served on the house china task force this past summer and and we were confronted firsthand with china's soft power efforts through belton road in africa uh the united states obviously needs to leverage all of the tools in our foreign affairs toolbox to counter china and one area in particular that we were able to hone in on was a better utilization of the development finance corporation uh i know ms smith you commented on the build act and how dfc has been updated and now we have debt and equity tools available to us there but my question uh to uh ambassador brigitte is are there ways you think that this committee the congress could add to or enhance the build act to better support the work of the development finance corporation and perhaps the export-import bank as a way to counter uh chinese malign investment in africa well um congressman thank you very much for your question so first of all let me know for the record that gayle smith has forgotten more about africa than i've ever learned uh and so she is as his colleague of long-standing i'm sure she has many many thoughts on it i would offer one very specific policy proposal which i think could usually garner bipartisan support we need to have a structured diplomatic dialogue with the african union and also with other regional organizations for their purpose of identifying what are the structural impediments to american engagement on the continent in such a way that it actually improves both of our our respective outcomes i'll give you an example so part of the reason the chinese are there in such force is as i said previously um they can direct their companies to go there um they don't have the same human rights standards and they can finance them at uh at unbelievably little rates but there are also things that um in doing so the africans are at a loss for they often are given essentially predatory loans in order to do so they do not uh the chinese are not very good at treating african labor very well they don't get the same environmental standards as we do our companies for example just in infrastructure alone are world class but because we don't have a structured dialogue and a structured diplomatic engagement to say with our african partners say for example we will help you build a cairo to cape town railway or you have expressed the desire to have high-speed rail and spread connecting multiple uh african capitals we will help you do that here is what we need to be able to do that in terms of financing right away whatever and in return in addition to getting a railway you are going to get knowledge transfer you're going to get better access to um to uh to basic labor standards that the chinese don't don't adhere to you will be able to call upon our at our embassies to be able to work out these sorts of ways and those are great those are great uh great uh feedback for us i i appreciate that just because of limitations on time let me reclaim the time and and turn to dr slaughter very quickly on the issue of taiwan and and the ccp's threat that it poses we saw what happened with the hong kong basic law and uh the security law that happened in hong kong now we are turning our eyes to taiwan and the aggression of prc has shown towards this island especially i might add with the change in the administration and what that means uh while taiwan has a distinct geographical advantage uh obviously with the taiwan straight what steps can the new administration this congress take with allies and partners in the region to prevent a repeat of what happened in hong kong yes yeah so thank you representative that that is a hugely important question because that is one of the places where you really could see some kind of regional or even global conflagration if we're not careful we have to make it absolutely clear that we intend to abide by our obligations under the taiwan relations act with taiwan we are not going to be intimidated on arms sales we are not going to be intimidated in terms of engaging uh with the government of taiwan uh it's a it's a delicate um issue because we we also we obviously don't want to do anything that enables provocations that might serve people domestically in taiwan but don't serve us but overall uh as you say uh it's very different from hong kong uh there are things we can do with hong kong but they're much more to do with with our allies in the region with taiwan we need to make it very clear that neither we nor our allies will brook any kind of aggression vis-a-vis taiwan thank you gentlemen thank you expired

bring in congressman michael waltz republican from florida and a member of the house armed services committee the foreign minister of russia lavrov says that fighting in ukraine has entered a new phase and that they are going to fully liberate donetsk and lou hanks how do you analyze the situation as the update we just got from bill looks precarious for the ukrainians yeah thanks dana well i think it's worth reminding everyone that fighting trench style warfare fighting has been going on in the donbass since 2014 ukrainians have been dying every day uh since the first invasion and putin's goal always was uh in his words to liberate uh the east i think this new phase will prevent present several advantages uh militarily for the russians one they'll consolidate their command and control they've consolidated uh under the butcher of syria uh the russian general that led to the atrocities in syria too they're going to consolidate their supply lines that we've seen have been spread way too thin and and really presented uh them all kinds of issues on the ukrainian side though they have about three quarters of their military kind of stacked in the east so i think we could expect to see the russians stage a number of frontal attacks that's what you're seeing going on right now to pin those forces down and then as bill pointed out they will seek that north-south axis to surround them and cut them off i think that's the that's the plan at the end of the day president zielinski is right this is a race against time and the united states and nato needs to stop incrementally pushing arms uh ammunition and supplies in and unleash the arsenal of democracy and help ukraine win not help them get to the negotiating table well on that point here's john kirby just yesterday the pentagon about u.s military aid trying to reach those ukrainian fighters today it is certainly within the realm of the possible that the that the ukrainians will want additional artillery systems and additional artillery rounds and we will have those conversations with them and we will if that is if that's the need we'll do everything we can to meet it this is administration you can argue whether or not they acted too late or whether or not they're 30 days behind every decision however on screen now we found that more than 2.5 billion dollars now have been pledged to the ukrainians to fight and there are two more packages being prepped already that number is going to go significantly higher than it is today sir yeah bill you you're right in that the number sounds impressive but i stand firmly in the camp that the white house has moved too little and too late uh the ukrainians when i visited last year were asking for artillery systems and importantly we're asking for the types of radar called counter battery radar that helps them detect russian artillery coming in and destroy it and as you know that's what they're using to pound these cities uh into submission they were asking for that last year bill here we are two months into the war uh and now we're going to start flowing that in uh and again the numbers sound uh impressive but it's 18 howitzers uh that that's really a drop in the bucket compared to what the russians are bringing to the fight 40 000 rounds that's about what the ukrainians are estimated to be going through in a week so that's basically a week's worth of ammunition we we have got to unload uh the full amount of arms and weaponry that we can and i would like to see our eastern european allies pushing their russian made systems in so that the ukrainians can use them and utilize them more quickly without training and then we backfill our eastern european allies with our systems to me that's a that's a double win that makes sense in terms of upgrading uh our nato allies and getting the ukrainians something they can use very quickly with little training congressman michael waltz we're going to be on top of this story all day and the rest of the week we'll stay in touch with you thank you okay thanks dana

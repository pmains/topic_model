welcome back protection uh protecting election integrity president biden is pushing the senate to pass the sweeping h.r one election reform bill but republicans are taking steps to protect the electoral systems in other ways a new bill is being introduced that would halt election security grants until a state-by-state review of 2020 procedures from the comptroller general is finished this would also prohibit states from receiving grants if they used unconstitutional protocols joining me right now is the author of that bill tennessee senator and member of the senate foreign relations and appropriations committee's bill hagerty it is great to have you this morning sir thanks very much for being here this is such an important topic and i think one of the reasons that we are seeing so much upset around hr1 and what nancy pelosi's priorities are in terms of changing the way we vote talk to us about first this movement and what you're hoping to accomplish well i think it's very telling maria that the very first bill they pass after this coveted relief package which that's a different story but the very first bill that they seek to pass is this hr one so-called for the people act which like so many bills in washington is a misnomer it's anything but for the people it's for the politicians what it is is a democrat attempt to basically lock in the power that they've just taken they want to grab it forever and turn us into a single party type of jurisdiction here in america we've got to stand up against that so tell us how this hr one does this do you expect this to pass the senate because we know that it has already passed the house and ins in it are are things like no vote no id at all to vote uh mail and ballots to be the standard uh voting for uh potentially inmates and as people as young as 16 years old what is most egregious in your view about this so-called for the people act which is not for the people at all because they're federalizing elections they're taking out the state sense they would have taxpayers in tennessee my home state subsidizing the elections of politicians in new york do tennesseans want to be subsidizing aoc's election they would federalize elections in america and force taxpayers to pay for them rather than forcing politicians to earn the support of folks in their own state they would allow for ballot harvesting to take place unlimited ballot harvesting these are all the wrong incentives and in fact it loosens things even further and it's going to so further damage america's confidence in our election system that's why i put forward legislation to address this so do you have confidence that h.r 1 will not pass the senate well i'm going to fight every step of the way and that's why i've offered a very practical alternative again to restore america's confidence in the system we need not be loosening the rules right now we need to be making certain that the constitution is followed and i think hr one is an unconstitutional provision because it takes away the power from the state legislatures that that's what article two section one of the constitution clearly enumerates that the authority for elections lies with elected state legislators who are responsible and accountable to people in their states not with federal government yeah i understand that but if you don't get democrats to agree with you this could this could pass the senate i mean do you feel you have democrat support in in that regard or is this headed to the supreme court it's very hard to say right now but it depends on whether the filibuster is is abided by or not i certainly don't think that you'll see ten republicans move over to the side of hr one i don't think you'll see a single republican move in that direction again this is clearly a power grab by the democrats yeah i understand that but do you think you'll have democrat support to go against it i certainly hope so maria i think that you have democrats from states like mine in tennessee that don't want to see this federalized that don't want to put all of the authority and the the outcome frankly of the elections in the hands of several you know several very high popular populist states that's what this will this that's what it's eventually lending itself to this is going to damage the electoral college so senator you're also co-sponsoring legislation with south carolina senator tim scott to establish a bipartisan committee to review any procedural changes that happened in the 2020 election if found in what exactly would you expect the committee to find well i think what they're going to find is that in several instances the laws were changed to midterm you know as the elections were underway unconstitutional actors stepped in violated the united states constitution and took away the constitutionally granted authority that solely lies within the realm of state legislators you had actors in the judiciary you had actors in the executive branch who had unelected commissions that basically stepped in and changed the rules midstream and they've shaken america's confidence in our election system to the very core well i i agree with you senator and and and the question is what do you do about it i mean now you can't even question if there were irregularities in the 2020 election you'll get cancelled or destroyed by social media and there was never an investigation why weren't any of these issues truly looked at well that's what this that's what our legislation would do it would force an examination of what took place in 2020 and to the extent the constitution was violated and i'm certain that we're going to find this in several states to the extent there were constitutional violations those violations would have to be corrected before a single federal dollar would ever go back to those states to support elections and back in 2020 congress sent some 825 million dollars to the states to support elections at that point this will create an incentive to behave according to the constitution that's what this aims to do is put the right incentives in place to clean up what happened in 2020 and restore confidence in the american electoral system i i think it's very smart i'm glad you're doing it let me bring in steve forbes see we know how many questions there are around some of the practices around 2020. oh absolutely and uh surprised that we didn't get more uh real data on what actually happened in terms of uh shenanigans going on but i want to ask the senator in terms of the filibuster joe manchin has been making noises about maybe changing some of the procedures around the filibuster or softening it a little bit are the democrats can you really preserve the filibuster or is joe manchin going to cave or are there other democrats like your colleague senate cinema from arizona who will stand by and not let that happen because if you lose the filibuster you're going to get h.r one you're right steve but you know senator senator cinema senator manchin have both been clear that they do not want to see the filibuster taken apart i'm concerned about some of the comments that senator manchin has made recently but we've got to maintain the filibuster if we want to have any sense of bipartisanship here in america and do you think some of the democrats quietly are in favor of the filibuster exactly i got to believe that's a good question steve marie maria steve i think you're right you you've got to believe that democrats realize that at some point the table is going to turn do they want to be on the other end of this i i think not so they're going to have to think long and hard before they do any further damage to the process here and i think the filibuster will stand so tell us about your proposed legislation and and where it goes from here well we're working we're working our way through right now we're getting a lot more support uh what we've got to do though is draw a clear focus on the fact that there were severe issues that arose in 2020 again what the senate needs to do is talk to their constituents that's democrats and republicans to understand and appreciate the grave concerns and this legislation would fix that and again make certain that the incentives are properly aligned so that no federal dollars go to states that violate the united states constitution with respect to election laws can you tell us what the uh new uh dealings in georgia mean because i think georgia is trying uh to do a similar move in that it is coming up with uh fixes for what took place in 2020 what's your take on on the uh on on the reliability and what we're seeing coming out of georgia here i think georgia is an example and a very clear example of states that are trying to go back and repair the damage that was done in 2020. again article 2 section 1 of the constitution clearly puts constitutional responsibility on state legislatures to set forth the rules for elections in their state that's what has to happen and i'm glad to see states beginning to go back and repair the damage that was done in 2020 again under the guise of a crisis under the guise of a pandemic but they went around the constitution and that's got to be repaired and you think we'll see more states do what georgia did i do think so i certainly hope so and if my legislation passes all the incentives will be in place to do that because they'll be required to do that if they want to receive any federal support for their elections it's a very smart move senator it's good to have you we're going to keep following this legislation to see where it goes senator bill hagerty joining us this morning in

thank you madam chairwoman uh my first question is for mr noderf um in the wake of the disclosure of the log 4j vulnerability the director of scissors cited it as another reason for agencies to gather and utilize software bills and materials s-bombs which was a new term for me as part of their cyber security programs do you recommend we codify in law the requirement for agencies to collect these software bills and materials from their vendors for critical assets uh thank you for the question congressman i appreciate it i think that there's a lot of work right now going on in the administration in the wake of the cyber security executive order that that talks about what exactly is in an s-bomb so i think when the committee discusses what what it would look like to codify s bomb language it's important to to consider the availability of s-bombs what the extent of them looks like how those s-bombs are going to be utilized what the definition of what's incorporated inside those s-bombs looks like so to answer your question i think that it is a you have uh the committee would have to give if they were going to codify it they would have to give the flexibility to apply the use of s-bombs in targeted manners that make sense for the risk-based environments and i know that's a nuanced answer but you may not need an s-bomb for every piece of software everywhere across all the environments if they're not really risky assets so i think we need to be very conscious the committee should be very conscious about how if they were going to consider codifying how that would be applicable in the federal environment we don't want to we don't want to overburden the industry providers that are building this backbone for uh the departments and agencies great appreciate that um ms when speaking of and you talked about supply chain risk management and and the burden on our vendors this uh had me thinking there are um there are already a number of provisions that are codified there in law that require the vendors to use trusted sources and their components unfortunately though we know that many times vendors are accepting attestations of compliance from their subcontractors instead of doing the asset security training themselves to verify how do you recommend that we enforce the existing provisions are those necessary are they stringent enough are they over stringent on these vendors supplying assets to the federal agencies thank you for the question i personally believe that you need to take very strong action with regard to supply chain risk and cyber security this is uh we have seen in the classified world actual efforts to target various aspects of software by well resourced nation states and then they go after the software that the united states government and other government agencies use and so if if we take a strong stance and enforce against this and go further than attestation or accept attestation and when your attestation is proven to be false then maybe that's where you need to place your some of your enforcement um another thing and then i'll give you your time back is we also see that um businesses may not always be very responsible in terms of the software that they hand back to the united states government and how to use it and so we need to be able to ensure and set the stage that if you're going to provide services and software to the united states government we need you to give us the best that you've got possible and you've got to be responsible for the cyber threats that could come through that software and what sort of teach should we put in that in your view well you know having been uh penalized as an individual through my schooling uh quite a bit i uh preferred the lighter method first right let's have the discussion with the principal to talk about the behaviors that were not acceptable in terms of that and then a few times there needed to be some elevation both to parents and then only got to detention fortunately not suspension and i do believe that the elevation and layering the amount of enforcement matters first because sometimes people really do just make a mistake humans do make mistakes and so maybe making it on a tiered level so that the repeat offenders are actually called out a lot more harshly great thank you a little time we have left mr snyder i'm encouraged by that the bill has strong language around zero trust but concern that securing the federal agencies isn't enough considering our reliance on the outside industrial base what recommendations would you have for extending zero trust and other requirements beyond to the broader industrial base and i realize i'll give you ten seconds left to answer that so that may be unfair yeah i i mean i'll i'll try to be brief it's gonna be really important to to flow down you know the the key cyber security requirements um to vendors and contractors that are providing uh capabilities in we're very dependent on you know dod the defense industrial base but with industry writ large and we need industry uh to be providing and you know a protecting their tools and then delivering us tools that that are secure and resilient so i think there's a lot of work that we need to do and it's going to have to be a collaboration with industry great thank you madam chair you'll now

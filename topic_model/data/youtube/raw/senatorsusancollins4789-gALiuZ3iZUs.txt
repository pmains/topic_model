dr collins first of all i wish you really were my cousin and we joked about that every time i would welcome that if we could discover it with a little dna testing we probably know that's right you mentioned in your statement the tremendous progress that has resulted from the biomedical research into heart disease cancer hiv aids i'm concerned that we're not making that same kind of concerted investment when it comes to alzheimer's disease today 5.2 million americans are suffering from alzheimer's that's double the amount it was the number that it was in 1980 and if nothing is done to change the trajectory of the disease it's estimated that as many as 16 million americans will be living with alzheimer's by the year 2025 and in addition to the human suffering that is caused by alzheimer's the cost of caring for people with alzheimer's is absolutely enormous uh it's estimated that the cost this year will be 214 billion dollars and 150 billion comes from the federal medicaid and medicare programs so at a time when the cost is soaring we're spending less than a third of one percent of that 214 billion on alzheimer's research i know you're that that you're very familiar with the national plan to address alzheimer's which has as its primary goal to prevent or effectively treat alzheimer's by the year 2025 the chairman of the advisory council created by that law with whom i've talked extensively says we really should be devoting two billion dollars a year to alzheimer's research instead of just 600 million and we're falling so short of the amount that has been recommended by the experts what is your judgment it seems to me as i talk to researchers there are a lot of promising ideas out there so the problem's not a lack of ideas it's a lack of funding could you comment on whether you believe we should be doing more in this area yeah i would be happy to i put up on the screen the scary numbers that you just referred to the green line there projecting how many people will have alzheimer's disease if nothing is done and you'll see it goes up to a very frightening number close to 14 million people compared to the 5 million now and the blue bars are what we'll be spending on it over a trillion dollars predicted by 2050 if nothing is done so we have to find a solution to prevent and treat this disease and i am passionate about this as i know many of the members of this committee that i've spoken to about this over the years we are i think at a really exciting scientific time we have come up with new strategies to understand what happens early on in the alzheimer's brain to trigger this process and what we might do to intervene and i would not have been able to say that quite as confidently a few years ago new technologies including imaging including genomics are giving us insights into the fundamental process that we need to figure out how to prevent and reverse and on top of that new ideas about therapeutics are coming along and we are running now dozens of clinical trials most of them will fail one of the things that we are doing right now that becomes really important to assess whether something is working or not is to start clinical trials at the earliest moment even sometimes before people have any symptoms at all but who are at high risk of alzheimer's because if you wait until somebody already has substantial evidence of cognitive problem then you know you've already lost a substantial fraction of their brain cells with the ability now to make predictions about who's at risk though we can start those treatments early we can use biomarkers to assess if they're working a new project which i'm very excited about is a partnership with the pharmaceutical industry where they have agreed to put money on the table nih has put money on the table we're working together in an open access fashion to try to see could we identify every possible strategy that anybody can think of for alzheimer's disease this has not been tried before in quite this way with lots of milestones and deliverables put in there now your question are we spending enough well i would say it was wonderful that this congress came up with extra 100 million dollars in the current fiscal year and there are people on this committee who had a big role including madam chairwoman in making sure that that was there and that was a substantial increment that gave everybody a real push in my professional judgments do we need more if we were going to really push this at the level that it could be yes we do it is hard to say though over the course of this 20 to now to 2025 timetable for the alzheimer's plan exactly what's the funding trajectory necessary to get there but clearly if we're going to succeed at this we're going to need the best and brightest scientists taking risks and we at the present time are not really doing as much as we could thank you

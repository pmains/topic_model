there are lots of crises facing the American people starting a course with inflation the economy Energy prices the southern border but instead of dealing with those the Democrats have insisted upon prioritizing supersizing the IRS only Washington D.C would an agency that has mishandled sensitive information has an abysmal record when it comes to customer service and a track record I might add of targeting taxpayers be given enough resources to literally double in size and add 87 000 new employees during the tax year 2021 the IRS answered just 11 percent of the calls that it received in their office meaning that 250 million 250 million calls went unanswered in the past two years alone the IRS has inadvertently posted confidential information from 120 000 taxpayers and destroyed 30 million unprocessed tax documents despite this track record the Democrats recently passed 80 billion dollars for the IRS including that doesn't include any accountability for how that 80 billion dollars is going to be used and only four percent of it was actually allocated to improving taxpayer services it is clear that the IRS is ripe for reform I've introduced multiple bills to address this issue one of which is with Senator crapo that would protect taxpayers who make less than four hundred thousand dollars a year from being audited something the Democrats have said that they are for all this would simply do is make that clear Senator Collins and I have introduced legislation that would prevent the IRS from hiring new enforcement agents until customer service is reached a more acceptable level and Senator grassy and I have introduced a bill that would give Congress a direct say in how those new IRS funds are spent by freezing that funding until the IRS submits a plan to Congress for approval we can protect taxpayers in this country and we can improve the IRS but it certainly isn't by handing them a blank check for 80 billion dollars and another 87 000 new employees there needs to be transparency there needs to be accountability to the American people and we're going to insist that we get it

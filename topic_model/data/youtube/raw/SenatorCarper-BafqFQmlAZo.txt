mr. president I'd like to begin my remarks this afternoon and really good to congratulate several of our colleagues who worked long and hard on this legislation and their staffs who've worked equally a long and hard Senator Schumer and Senator Alexander see senator Collins is on the floor of Senator Lieberman our leaders Democrat and Republican leader Senator Reid and Senator McConnell anyone watching this debate from across America on c-span might be wondering why is this important why are they doing this why are we spending several days literally session here in the United States Senate to focus on a nominations bill why and for those folks who might be wondering why let me just offer these these thoughts this administration has been in office for roughly two and a half years now if you look throughout the the federal government the executive branch of the government most of the positions that require presidential nomination and Senate confirmation have now been filled but a number including a number that are in highly important ally critical positions of have not been but until fairly recently this administration looked like what I described is executive branch Swiss cheese people sometimes wonder why Washington wire federal government doesn't work better and maybe why doesn't it work as well as our state's and I want to take just a moment if I can to to compare the approach that we we use in Delaware and I know Center alexander's of former governor probably your approach that they use in Tennessee to fill key leadership positions in the executive branch of those state governments in my state for example the the governor nominates people to serve as cabinet secretaries in a dozen or so different departments those nominations have to be confirmed before the Senate they hold hearings and generally report those nominations favorably black might think my eight years as governor we never had the the Senate failed to report and to vote for one of our nominees for exactly ranch apartment for example Secretary of Transportation or Secretary of Education those kinds of appointments within those various departments of state government the division directors are appointed by the governor without without confirmation by the the Senate and the rest of our line items are line departments within state government in Delaware are not appointed by the governor their learning chosen through a merit system and report up the report or chain of commands through the director of the vision to the Secretary of the Department and that's the way it works I remember when I was about to be sporting the government I met with the state Senate was a majority Democrat at the time and they were interested in knowing how they're going to nominate for different positions and and I explain who we had in mind and he said you know we don't know some of those people someone from other states and we're not sure that we ought to be confirming them and I asked him I said look why don't we make a deal here give me the team that that I feel that as governor I'm entitled to have make sure that their honorable people smart people that sort of thing but the end of the day let us set let me have my team and go for it and try to govern in a partnership with the legislative branch and if Georgia send the end on on how we perform and to their credit that's what the state Senate decided to do and that's why we operate it for eight years there eight good years eight very good years i was fortunate to be governor same time the bill clinton was president and we managed to balance their budgets I think eight years in a row we actually cut taxes seven years in a row we pay down some of our debt got ourselves a triple-a credit rating for the first time in in state history still happened but that's the way that we operated it doesn't look that way or operate that way here and there's a there's a number of reasons why this administration in the last administration and I suspect the one before that a year or two years even into those administration's the executive branch we look through the senior ranks of the leadership of the various departments looked too much like executive branch Swiss cheese senator Alexander and Senator Schumer to their credit are trying to change that I commend them for their efforts it's I think enormously important if you're trying to be the president and leave this country you need your team you need your team and it's important that they be capable people honorable people at the end of the day a president of either party needs say a good team a strong team filled sooner rather than later but their number of reasons why it's were so difficult to get they get these many these vacancies fill one of them is a reluctance on the part of some people to go through the the the process the confirmation process it takes forever in some cases there's a nominees are asked it sorta like bear they're not their souls and largely bear their lives and to go through a process where they can be maybe not crucified but certainly expose anything they've ever done wrong in their lives none of us is perfect and I think that in itself deters people from wanting to to go through this process I was once nominated one as governor nominee to serve in the amtrak buoyed by President Clinton and I remember how long it took just to fill out the paperwork one set of paperwork for the executive branch a totally different set of paperwork for the legislative branch I remember saying to my wife after feeling like a weekend if you just fill out the paperwork I'm not sure it's really worth it doing all this I'm really not sure it's worth it and I'm sure for other folks who go through this process they probably reached the same conclusion somewhere at least once during the time that they go through the paperwork we need to have not separate question here's we need to synchronize homogenize the least of paperwork and hopefully put it on an electronic form and so that we can do it on a clear those enough nominees can do it electronically one time and be done with instant it off to the right folks to look at one of the reasons why it goes slowly here is that you know i'll just share with you is riding on Afghanistan your Afghanistan or Pakistan or those countries and a couple months ago and riding around with a doctor kodell and in a bus going from place to place and one of the folks in the bus said you know I I'm looking for somebody to put a hold on a nomination in order to get some leverage on something that senator was trying to get from the administration and that's what the Democratic president and Republican senator but I want to try that commerce asian could have happened with a four years ago with a Democratic senator and Republican president there's a lot of folks have used for years the ability to put a halt to stop a nomination from moving forward in order to gain some kind of political Ventures has nothing to do maybe with the the nominee or the nominees abilities to serve and the other the other point I want to make I share this with some of our colleagues in in our caucus at Senate Democratic caucus the other day and I I talked to my colleagues there about the general counter accountability office GAO zor work every year they publish as most of us know something called a high-risk list the high risk is just a whole lot of initiatives or problems that exist throughout the federal going they have either costing us a lot of money or are going to cost us a lot of money let's redo something differently and one of the top items on the jos high risk list for years now has been major weapons system cost overruns and in two thousand jo determined that major weapon system cost overrun at department of defense for 42 billion dollars that's a lot of money they updated the update that list every year the updated for 2010 not long ago and they concluded the major weapons systems cost overruns in 2010 had gone from 42 billion dollars ten years ago to 402 billion dollars in 2010 hi chehra a subcommittee called federal financial management portal homeland security government affairs and we've hauled the hell the number of hearings o in recent years to try to figure out how can we get better results for less money how do I get better results for taxpayers for less money or better results for maybe not much more money and as we drill down on major weapon system cost overrun here's one of the things we found out if you a testimony offered by a fellow from one atop I think three people in acquisition in the Department of Defense my name's Jim Fennelly who reported to John Young it's a top acquisition guy in the last administration who reported Bob gates the secretary we brought in a gem friendly fur for her testimony on major weapon system costs overland again this is like secretary gates John Young top acquisition guy and spent agon and then Jim Finland we asked mr. Finley asking of course I said how long have you been a new job and he told me how many months he served in his job and I asked him what kind of turnover he got from his predecessor and he said my predecessor had left 18 months before I was confirmed for this position so I said you mean for like 18 months there was no confirmed purpose person in your position for acquisition to oversee the the revolving major weapon since we said that's right he said I said how many direct reports did you have once you got into your job how many folks were directly reporting to you he said there's six direct reports to me in that job but only two of them were filled you just think about that here we are Department of Defense hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons system to oversee an acquisition and the arguably the the number two person in acquisition Department events that position was vacant for 18 months 18 months and when he finally got confirmed the of the six direct reports only two were filled no wonder we have these huge weapon system cost overrun and it's not just I'd like to say as an isolated incident we brought in Jim Finley's counterpart today in this administration fella named Frank Kendall very good man he came and testified earlier this year again it's Bob gates and secretary there's now ash Carter was the top acquisition person in DoD and then we have Frank Kendall and I said to mr. Kendall how long you been in the job and he told me how many ones and I said what kind of turn over to you get from your predecessor and he said my predecessor left 15 months before I got here 15 months and my friends I don't know how good we all are connecting the dots but when you have one of the top two people in the department of defense responsible for riding herd on the defense industry our contractors in these contracts was very expensive weapon system when you have a vacancy for 18 months in one administration the next administration pretty much like a vacancy for 15 that ain't no that is no good that is an invitation for printers a stir and when we see the major weapon system cost overruns go from 42 billion dollars in two thousand 24 hundred billion dollars ten years later I would suggest one of the reasons is because of this confirmation process the vetting process and really the biggest problem of all is the administration the administration take forever to identify people are going these positions to vet these positions and actually give us a name there are no silver bullets insurgent solving this little problem we need a lot of silver Vivi's and one of good things about the legislation before us is it provides a number of I think very very helpful tools to to expedite the consideration of nominees they better ensure that the next administration or even this administration a year or two from now presidents are elected that we don't end up with more and more of executive branch Swiss cheese which really translate into I think for the taxpayers enormous cost cost we can't afford with the budget deficit of over over a trillion dollars the last last thing i want to say if i may know our people are offering amendments i'm going to call up an amendment to this bill in just just a moment and it's an amendment that involves again our friends at jail the Government Accountability Office and our amendments pretty straightforward to require Gao to investigate and conduct a survey on the number of presidentially appointed positions that are not Senate confirmed in each agency and category of jobs that also routinely go unfilled for extended periods of time and the study would we provide the recommendations as to whether eliminating or converting certain appointees to career positions would be more efficient in addition the survey should evaluate whether it is beneficial to reduce and convert specialized categories of appointees such as inspector general's chief financial officers or acquisition officers to a career status not as appointed politically appointed and the purpose of the the amendment is that the the proposed we believe would would provide an analysis of what is an efficient amount of presidentially appointed positions government-wide it also provide recommendations on how to further reduce or convert these positions far as I can tell it's not a controversial proposal jo does a lot of good work for us to help us figure out how to great more efficiently also to use some some common sense in my hope is that my colleagues will see fit to to just supported and without having been said dumbest or president I want to ask unanimous consent to call up amendment number 5 17 which I filed earlier today is there objection clerk will report the senator from Delaware mr. Carper proposes an amendment numbered 517 Roger s 679 mr. president I ask unanimous consent to dispense with further reading of this amendment without objection and without a yield the floor thank you very much

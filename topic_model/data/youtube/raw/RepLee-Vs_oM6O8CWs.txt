Democratic Representative barbara Lee of Oakland casts the only vote against the war in Afghanistan in 2001 she believed that in the authorization for use of military force was a blank check for war there was such a broad authorization that I knew that and like I know now that this country could be in war in perpetuity unless we repeal that resolution come back for debate in Congress with escalating constants in the Middle East Lee is worried I'm concerned about you know our troops I'm concerned about civilian casualties you know refugees but I'm also concerned about the Congress not living up to his responsibilities and instead abdicating decisions on war to the president alone then nitrous was president not just President Bush but any president we have not authorized the use of force of Syria we did not do it in Libya according to lead that same resolution she voted against has now been used to conduct war in other parts of the world I Mary Liz court AZ kgo 810

now want to turn it over for an opportunity for Senator Caine to ask questions thank you thank you madam chair and I'd like to put in the record first we've talked about this New York Times piece mr. Bagley testified to it July 13 2015 title a new look at apprenticeships as a path to the middle class and it really focuses upon this apprenticeship program that was found in 1919 and others but if we could put that in the record I would appreciate it um I was struck mr. Bradley in your testimony about the investment that your company makes the new york times article said for somebody to go through the apprenticeship programs start to finish two hundred seventy thousand dollars of training that's what that program costs and if I if my staff correctly did the quick math you indicated about 80 million year in training in the company and you said thirty eight thousand employees I think that's about twenty one hundred dollars a year of training per employee so that's that's a big investment in training 20 270,000 to train an apprentice and then thereafter for as long as you're there twenty one hundred dollars year to train um do you think this is pretty common in the in the industry on the private sector side i'm sure you'll say you guys are the best at it but is this a pretty common thing to focus this much of resources on training senator Kaine most humble Liam I'm not going to refrain from saying that we're the best but i will say that i would say all industry under the pressure for calls and to reduce costs but for us it goes without saying we've had many conversations about how we spend our money and the apprenticeship program and amount of money we invest in our students it comes on a table but because of the passion that I have and being around or a member of the table or the staff that this conversation takes place it's one of those conversations where I stand if it's by myself standing and say that we have to do this I believe and this is what i tell my peers is that it is a return on the investment what I spend today I may not see that return till a couple three or four years down the road but I have to be so committed to that investment and instead of a product I'm investing in human capital so if i do that investment correctly and I like what Mr O'Connor say and bring along this employee as an engaged employee when this flowy come comes out of the apprenticeship program at a minimum of four years and this is what a 270 20 70,000 came up when you consider their wages and all of their benefits and the two you know the books and things that we purchased the only thing it costs them is just 2% just what we call association fees and that's a small price to pay with investment it was making some would say why would you put that much into a person when they could leave you because we don't put any restraints or there is no back-end say that you have to give us five years of employment after we make this investment in you but because we believe in the individual and we invest into intellect and inspiration of the heart of that person we're willing to take that risk and as such I can look back 10 years of apprentices graduating we are up in the eighty percent and if I will go even deeper say fifteen years back we still in the high 70 s % master at the shipyard master shipbuilders of those with 40 plus and there's a lot of master shipbuilders yes sir who've come out of the school and if well let's see you start a 1974 so you're getting pretty close I am one yeah the thing I think it's sintering the last point you make about the apprenticeship program apprentices are on the waterfront forty-four percent of your management is apprentices but because you don't have a requirement that you stay a lot of the apprentice graduates are working in the public shipyard over in Norfolk or working in private ship repairs all over the hampton roads area so this training program and the investment that the company is making is really populating the entire ship building industry which is a benefit to the Navy into the mission and so when you think about i think the earlier comment madam chair she talked about the cooperation between private and public sector so even this investment it's not say a whole lot but it helps us even in that area because when we dispatch people to these other just say a public shipyard there is some benefit because it comes back we have a face that we can relate to we have somebody when it stands out business they can help us with the dialogue to language and it's just a win-win last thing I'll ask real quickly is is the consistency point you talked about Newport News has been describing senator wicker and I were visiting early last week about sort of a work Valley that's coming up you know you're doing new construction you're doing refuel Zahn the carriers you kind of schedule them all in and try to have as you know minimal amount of downtime you know this is a preaching to the choir among everybody here but sequester and budgetary uncertainty makes that much more challenging the more certainty that we provide to our public and private shipyards the more you can then structure the work so that you're not peeking and vowing and hiring people and having to lay them off and it's so important and and I know that that is you're looking at that Valley the good news is a few years out you got another mountain that you're going to climb that's great but that does impose a challenge on this workforce and you hope that they don't just completely leave and move to another area or something when we're in this valley period we will do our best to provide as much certainty as we can thank you sir

comcast's national cyber issue one of the initiatives that are inherent within it is the system the name has changed over time but was originally called national cyber protection system it would leverage einstein technology to ultimately incrementally roll out solutions.gov and with dhs leading that and i think doing doing a fine job but there have been some delays in the program the technology behind einstein probably not appropriate to go into here although the earlier versions of it were based on a deep packet inspection high throughput minimal data latency cloud shield technology and that's open information but there's been other investment maybe because the ultimate goal of sensors is really really in relation to the comments i made earlier it's really important to migrate sensor technologies of this deployed to protect infrastructure to be able to prevent as opposed to just detect the threat and it is a different difficult challenge might there be new technologies that would need to be deployed in sensors for example artificial intelligence which the security industry has typically not been involved with in the past or even look at algorithm they based ai technology to better predict next generation threats so there are people talking about that um but clearly if a sensor like that is going to be used to protect a very very large integrated infrastructure it clearly would have viability in critical infrastructure protection and commercial space as well one thing that you know as a cyber defensive person you always have to be concerned about is if if you migrate to one common design with one common sensory technology and the thread appreciates how to exploit it then you know unless you're very resilient as roger suggested then you you do increase your exploitation risk associated with big enterprise so i'll conclude on the following point which is speaking about my firm blues allen is batting a thousand on this issue now i'm a baseball fan i'm from boston which means i'm a red sox fan which means by definition i have a torch and soul now if you get a 300 you're in the hall of fame three for ten the case who's out we're back in a thousand about a thousand following cadbury every network we have looked at government commercial international we've been asked to look at that network we have yet to find one that has not been penetrated that has not been penetrated by a sophisticated adversary and everybody that falls underneath that this is not an abstract issue this is an issue of everyday uh occurrence right now and we wanted to get to the point someday where we ended up with that hall of fame average maybe of 3 for 10 which means 7 out of every 10 networks are much more secure and are not suffering that level of breach and penetration so the message from the session today is it is urgent it is real we need to take not just technology steps but human capital steps and be the leadership and congressman langevin have demonstrated to continue if we're going to get our arms around this issue so we thank you congressman let me thank secretary church and we'll thank all the panelists uh for a great presentation great discussion today thank you all

I rise today to highlight the lawlessness happening at our Southern border to no one's surprise President Biden attempted to conceal the ongoing chaos chaos created by his disastrous policies at the southern border by releasing the latest CBP report on a Friday night news dump but these tactics can't hide the truth last month over a quarter of a million over 251 thousand illegal aliens were apprehended at the southern border making December the highest monthly total on record more than a quarter of a million in a single month if that doesn't pressure the Biden Administration to fix this crisis what will in a dangerous Edition 17 suspected terrorists were caught illegally crossing the border in December bringing the total number of individuals to 38 who are on the terrorist watch list and caught at the southern Border in just the first three months of fiscal year 2023. how many suspected terrorists have to cross the southern border before the Biden Administration will take this border crisis seriously to make matters worse see CBP has already seized over nine thousand pounds of fentanyl so far this fiscal year which is enough to kill more than 2 billion people over six times the population of the United States when will the Biden Administration finally put an end to the wide open Southern border that allows this deadly drug from China to devastate our communities while the White House willfully destroys our Southern border and subsequently demolishes our national security House Republicans are determined to secure the border and put Americans first part of that commitment is ensuring that every solitary individual responsible for this self-inflicted crisis will be held accountable starting with secretary mayorkas whose impeachment is long overdue without accountability Americans will not have the safe and secure Nation they deserve

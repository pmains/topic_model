i co-sponsored last year the waxman bill and co-sponsored the beginning of this bill i was disappointed in this bill because i thought it was eviscerated during the process it's going to be hard for me to vote for a bill that doesn't have the public health care plan option in it for two reasons i want to get your take on this precarious position now that the government finds itself in with a 60 ownership stake in general motors this is something that had to be done and i think president bush beginning it back in december did the right thing the stimulus bill that was passed roughly 800 million dollars is it too small we're going to come back in the summer and have another one it's the minimum amount needed i would have voted for one trillion dollars i really strongly felt this was the most consequential vote i have taken these two years and our nation my constituents who won't be able to get affordable loans whose savings are going to go down and small businesses aren't going to get loans unemployment rises this was a vote for them really tax

capitol complex which establishes a commission to investigate the insurrection at the capitol on january 6. this is bipartisan legislation i want to thank chairman thompson and ranking member catco for their leadership in announcing this bill and i hope that it will have broad bipartisan support next week with that i'll yield to the gentleman from georgia i want to thank uh thank the majority for those remarks in the schedule i also want to take a minute to uh to to thank the the the leader and others over there for helping pass h.r 2877 the behavioral intervention guidelines act it's a really good bill that you know they'll go a long way in supporting school safety i know there were many questions about it and everybody worked to get it to a good spot so i'd like to again extend my extend my appreciation for all of the help with my democratic colleagues turning to the the operations of the house this gentleman knows the cdc has now lifted all mask and social distancing requirements and both president biden and president biden has lifted the mass requirements for the white house staff but amazingly here in the house of representatives we still must wear the mask stagger the vote times have these long vote times we should be going back to a five minute and a two minute schedule so that we can do the work of the house when can we expect these restrictions to be lifted i want to thank the gentleman for the question and for acknowledging the extraordinary success of the biden harris administration in putting millions of shots in arms at a historic pace that success has been fueled reclaiming my time for just a minute yes sir we as americans should all celebrate in operation warp speed and the work that was done by the administration to be able to do that and to follow through we greatly appreciate the biden administration's following up on the really great work of operation walk speed in the pre in in the trump administration that success that the gentleman talked about it was fueled by this congress last year and this year and by a science-based investment approach that the american rescue plan offered as evidenced by this guidance we are building back but i want to call particular attention to the dear colleague letter that dr monahan sent out to everyone on the capitol complex campus and it says the present mask requirement and other guidelines remain unchanged until all members and floor staff are fully vaccinated so the centerpiece of this strategy is vaccination reclaiming my time that's in direct contradiction to cdc guidelines and on top of that would the gentleman explain how in the world you're going to get that information that every member of this body has been vaccinated without violating hipaa laws will the gentleman yield please i would love an answer the centerpiece of this strategy that the gentleman just acknowledged is vaccinations it's important that we continue to get as many members as we can vaccinated that is the strategy that dr monaghan rear admiral dr monahan a distinguished uh physician that's the strategy that he is laid out i'll reclaim my time of course we would like all americans to be vaccinated but again you will never be able to understand or know how many members are actually vaccinated unless you require them to give you that information if you require them to give you that information then the majority will be in violation of the hipaa privacy laws how in the world no no how in the world can you violate the hipaa privacy laws on this what does that mean for future pandemics and future diseases where there are laws in place that say that members do not have to disclose their health information and if the gentleman could please explain how you force a member of this body to disclose their personal health information and without violating hipaa laws i would love to hear that answer yeah with the gentleman yield please the cornerstone of this strategy is vaccinations and what the gentleman's asking is important is an important question and what the majority is saying is let's follow the guidance of the office of the attending physician we have no interest in knowing individually what members and what staff members are vaccinated our interest is in governing this house and the operations of this body and we will trust that dr monahan will work with both parties and both sides of the aisle and will give us a report when rick house is free vaccinating that becomes our guidance reclaiming my time from the gentleman so the president the leader of the democratic socialist movement right now here and he here in america has said that it's good enough for the white house and yet you are going to defer to the house physician over the president of the united states so is will so is but my my point is is that there's so much inconsistency here and you will never ever get to the point madam speaker that you will ever be able to get every member to show some sort of voting card without violating the hipaa privacy protections so again i know that i'm listening to the rhetoric it's a simple question how do you compel members of this body to disclose their private health information without violating hipaa laws not strategy not theoretical how are you going to do that what provision in the law in the hipaa protection of americans private information regarding their health care record are you going what what provision are you going to waive to compel members of the house to show that they have been vaccinated i i yield to my colleague from california i appreciate the gentleman from georgia yielding once again and i will i will just try to be as clear as i possibly can we will follow the guidance of the office of attending physician a decorated rear admiral who is helping with the sergeant-at-arms to govern the capital complex as the cdc guidelines mentions and i'm sure my colleague has read the full cdc guidance which specifically says government buildings and local governments and state governments may make separate i'll wrap this topic up with a couple of observations the uh our colleagues across on the other side of the building are certainly following different guidelines than we are here and i think it's important to note that you're undermining and what the majority is doing here is that they are undermining the vaccination program they're committing public health malpractice by saying if you get the vaccine it doesn't work what's the incentive to do this is the gentleman yield no i'm going to move on to the next topic i believe we have beat this dead horse enough and there is no answer to you the gentleman knows i'm happy to talk about hipaa and and your role with it please so what i would say is the cdc guidelines is my colleague in georgia understands specifically mentions workplaces can set their own guidelines we are following workplace guidance given by the office of the attending physician and the sergeant-at-arms those are the processes that govern this body whether democrats are in control or republicans are in control we should be guided by public health guidance so that's exactly what we're doing here and i just want to make sure that the public understands could the gentleman ask answer one question is president biden wrong or is dr moynihan wrong well i i appreciate the question because as the gentleman knows we're a co-equal branch of government here in the capitol and so i appreciate his love of the executive branch of government i really do however we are governed by different rules as a co-equal branch of government we should and i will say this before we move on to the next topic it does appear that many of us are governed by different rules along the way so let's move on to one final thing as you know this has been police reform week i was happy to see that president biden had set the deadline for may 25th to sign a police reform bill i was also extremely happy to see that democrat leadership has dropped its request to eliminate qualified immunity i thought that was a very strong statement a very positive and uh it's the is the majority whip set on may the ninth i know what the perfect bill will be we have proposed that and i want to see good legislation i know that sometimes you have to compromise and if we don't get quite a qualified immunity now we can come back and try to get it later but i don't want to see us throw out a good bill because we can't get a perfect bill good legislative action now in order to get this bill done by the 25th there's really that's a fairly short timeline i know that representative pete stalber has a bill ready to go a really good bill that addresses the things that in a very bipartisan way that i think we would like to see do you anticipate based on the schedule that you laid out do you anticipate that the majority would take up mr stauber's bill so that we can meet president biden's uh deadline of may the 25th the gentleman please i i appreciate the question and this is such a timely and important topic that the country needs to address and i'm incredibly pleased with the bipartisan success that the negotiations have led to today and as the gentleman knows those conversations continue to be ongoing but the majority believes that those conversations are progressing in a way that is that is helpful toward addressing this issue i think both sides realize and i hope the minority realizes the importance of making changes to protect our communities i know the gentleman is a former mayor as i am as well and so we've dealt with a lot of these issues at the local level and so what i would say is senator scott mr stauber congressman stauber and congresswoman karen bass have been engaged in this discussion we want to give them the latitude and the flexibility to continue those discussions i wouldn't agree with the characterization that the gentleman from georgia made uh about where the negotiations are but i can tell you that we are committed to seeing this done we are committed to getting this done and putting a bill on the floor that will have restrained by the party claiming my time that i implore the majority to put mr stauber and mr scott's bill onto the floor as soon as possible so that we can reach a bipartisan vote and consensus on this and i just want to make one other observation here now that it uh you know knowing that it is police week you know we've got men and women around this country you and i again both as mayors um you know we had the honor of being involved in that seeing the sacrifice that they make whether it's local police officers our deputies out patrolling our country roads in many parts of my district the men and women of the customs and border patrol agency that that are down there putting their lives on the line every single day to stop the the grossness of human trafficking and the horrors of narcotic trafficking looking around this very building that we're in right now looking at the men and women that have been here that will continue to be here to service and protect us and what i found very interesting about this week is the silence from the majority is deafening not bringing a resolution to honor our men and women in law enforcement says an awful lot about how you feel and i will say this i think the majority should come back in and i think we would all agree to do this next week to put a resolution on the floor to honor the men and women of law enforcement because i can't imagine which group is not worthy of that and i will yield i i thank the gentleman from yielding and as the gentleman knows there was a lengthy special order hour led by our colleague from florida former police chief herself uh talking about you know the importance of these issues the importance of honoring heroes the importance of honoring people who put themselves in harm's way each and every day and are behaving well and what i would what i would ask the gentleman from georgia is you know in that similar vein honoring police week honoring those folks who helped us who looked out for us january 6th i hope the gentleman will encourage the minority leader to meet with officer fanon from the metropolitan police department who has requested a meeting with a minority leader to talk about the events of january 6 and to talk about his experiences which were so impactful as he shared them on national television and as he talked about the role that he played and the role that his colleagues played in protecting this temple of democracy i hope that the that the minority leader has the time to meet with officer fanon i signed a letter to the minority leader from from my colleagues encouraging him to do so and i hope that the gentleman from georgia reiterates the importance to meet with law enforcement heroes but again i want to go back to it with the morale of the officers here in the capitol as low as it is right now the tremendous stresses that they're under the staffing problems that they have wondering whether or not this entire body at times has their back will the gentleman yield no not yet i think it is important that this body bring a resolution to the floor supporting the men and women in law enforcement around the nation but particularly right here in this capitol and i'll be the first one along with the rest of my colleagues to support that resolution and so again it's very simple a lot of words and i do appreciate our colleagues from florida miss demings for for leading the special order she certainly knows as a former law enforcement officer and leader of a department how just how tough that is but again the silence here is deafening and with that madam speaker i feel back

and we'll now recognize uh our colleague representative posey for five minutes uh thank you very much mr chairman the the thing that alarmed me the most about um kovind 19 the very beginning is when we got our first tv reports they said the damage to your lungs from from this virus is unlike any others that we've ever seen before and and it will not heal itself it's irreversible damage like neurological damage you know you might stop it from progressing but you can never reverse all the damage it's done of course we've heard an awful lot of people have have fully recovered i remember talking to nasa administrator jim bridenstine right after he got tested and he was sick of the time he got tested and he said the doctor called him said what do you want first the good news the bad news he said give me the good news he said well you don't have covet he said well then what's the bad news he said we've got the other virus that's already killed 80 000 people um but i guess that other virus didn't didn't kill anybody after covert came out i guess it was stopping its tracks i was wondering uh dr struffer if uh the answer to my question that i asked before uh you mentioned that uh you would expect to see this natural evolution yet no one has presented in the evidence of the evolution of coveting animals or humans prior to the december 2019 outbreak what do you make of that um i think there's a general understanding about uh the time that uh coveted 19 emerged as a disease in china as we've discussed previously i think there's still some details about its origin that we don't quite understand but i think the path of the virus appointed initial detection um and his propagation around the world has followed more or less what we would expect for a virus that at some level has hit that sweet spot of being just infectious enough to spread um dangerous enough that it's caught our attention but not so dangerous that it kills so many hosts it tamps itself down uh so uh again i would uh respectfully ask the member to perhaps uh call on dr rivers or dr kareem and dr grobat to add some additional uh perspective on this uh but i think we're seeing a progression in uh the genetic evolution of the virus uh under the pressures that we uh would expect from both uh non-pharmaceutical interventions and now the vaccine the vaccines that are uh taking hold uh that is within the uh the spectrum that we would anticipate as scientists you know i i've had a lot of uh and maybe i'll direct this uh dr krim i've had a lot of constituents uh question about um taking the vaccination i you know you mentioned a blanket statement absolutely everybody should there's no good reason for anybody not to but you know i've i've had people you know well you know what if my sister has a pneumonia i mean should she take it then well i i mean i wouldn't think good sense would dictate no but i'm not a doctor and and and there's people that have contact in my opposite you know we've had bad outcomes from vaccines before and uh i'm sure you're probably familiar with that uh and and i've just told people talk to your physician about it your physician knows uh best of all if you should get it and uh i've had some circle back and say hey my physician said not to do it well i'm not going to argue with your physician about that um you know i i'm aware of the vaccine vaccine entry trust fund i don't know if you all are familiar with it or not um but you know when people make these statements that you know vaccines are 100 safe for everybody without exception end of subject you're an idiot if you don't get vaccinated you know the public is in large part unaware that that vaccine entry trust fund which is very hard to access has a two-year statute of limitations on it most pediatricians tell people they're crazy if they think their kids are injured or whatever you know that vaccine injury trust fund has paid out four and a half billion dollars um and and hasn't paid for a lot of the common uh bad outcomes that that that people suffer so uh dr krum just your thoughts briefly on that yes thank you for that question so i think all vaccines carry some side effects and so that's part and parcel of what we live with it's a question of the benefits and risks in my own clinic i've had two severe reactions one of which was very severe patient hospitalized demyelinating disease and she happened to have lupus systemic leukocytomatosis so she has a history of this kind of problem and she didn't do well with the vaccine i'm not sure if she if she actually got covered you know she would probably also have quite a severe form of covalent but we can never say that vaccines are 100 safe there will always be those effects and we've seen with some of the vaccines clotting disorders we've seen a range of other i see them in my clinic but i also see all of the many patients with severe covert in my clinic and i've got you know several patients with long covert and i can't tell you how debilitating it is i'd rather you you put up with the side effects and the reactogenicity of the vaccine and have to deal with long covert i watch it and i shudder i see my time is up mr chairman thank you very much

for five minutes at this time i just wanted to express uh i represent northwest indiana gary indiana i'm 30 miles away out of the chicagoland area my past experience as an elected official is i distributed poor relief for over 180 000 people in a very diverse community day in and day out for 15 years i sat across the table who were from individuals who were desperate to make a wage that could pay for their utilities make a wage to be able to pay for their rent and we worked with other social services to provide assistance for those individuals who were working two to three jobs to provide for their families and we are all absolutely correct the black and brown communities are living on the margins but so are single mothers so are underemployed so are those who have been lost because of the manufacturing base erosion and so are those because of covet 19 and with that in my tours and my scope of work speaking to small businesses their number one goal is to make sure that their customers have the dollars and the revenue and the income to be able to provide and purchase goods and buy services in the community so my experience is over 15 years is that individuals if you raise their rate to fifteen dollars an hour and you go from fifteen thousand dollars per hour you go to thirty thousand dollars an hour you lift the tide of all boats that allow those individuals those 30 million individuals whose wages will be raid who now will have capital to spend in the business market and i agree with the individuals who say that if you want to compete and keep skilled workers you pay them a wage and that is a part of business the individuals and small businesses that i know are paying people 15 and 16 an hour because they want retention they want longevity they don't want to be constantly searching for individuals that need uh to have to fill those positions also there are other for people who are living in poverty transportation is an issue uh being able to sustain costs of transportation to get in out of economic uh development such as cities are important and my point is um we're talking about in it at the rose uh the city of chicago i'm 30 miles away a lot of individuals from the city of chicago end up in northwest indiana and we are seeking opportunity they are seeking an educational opportunity to be able to provide for the families and to be able to lift themselves out of poverty but most importantly what i want to emphasize is that as a committee then we have to also focus on when we bring up something like the apprenticeship act that gives opportunities for all individuals and access to labor unions that that's important and that we provide that type of legislation that creates opportunities so workforce development is important but also lifting the minimum wage to be able to provide for families and to uplift themselves is a priority i oppose this amendment and i thank you chairman thank you see anyone else

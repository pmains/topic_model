oligarchs congressman tom malinowski is a democrat representing the seventh district that is hunterdon and parts of essex morris somerset union and warren counties he is a member of the congressional caucus against foreign corruption and kleptocracy congressman thanks for being with us thanks walt great to be here well big story this week obviously the leaked draft decision on roe v wade so why don't we start with that thoughts on where we stand there where we stand is that multiple states across the country are banning abortion uh louisiana uh is considering a law that would that would ban abortion and imprison women and doctors if they uh if they conduct the procedure from the moment of conception even if the life of the mother is at risk multiple states if roe versus wade is in fact invalidated by the supreme court have triggered laws that would immediately put in place draconian bans on a woman's right to to choose and um this is something that the overwhelming majority of new jerseyans and the majority of americans don't want to see happen and uh so i i think it's it's a huge issue for for us we need to make sure we have a congress right that will do what new jersey did and that's to codify roe v wade in the law of the land and i know democrats are talking about putting it up to a vote but with the 50 50 split is there any chance of getting that passed uh it does i don't think we have 60 votes to overcome a filibuster uh i think we have a majority in in the senate for codifying roe v wade um but the the republicans are you know in the congress are very set on doing just the opposite if they win back the majority they're going to try to pass a law that would uh ban abortion nationwide and that's important because you know we think we're safe in new jersey we passed our own codification uh earlier this year but if congress were to pass a nationwide ban that would invalidate new jersey's law well let's talk about your ukraine legislation uh your bill is called asset seizure for ukraine reconstruction act how would it work so the basic idea is we want to rebuild ukraine and we want to make russia pay for it um the united states and our allies right now have frozen or blocked yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars villas private planes bank accounts uh most important about 300 billion dollars in russia central bank assets it's just going to be sitting there and i don't think we're going to return it to putin uh even if there's a ceasefire in ukraine so i want to put it to use to help the the wonderful brave people of this country rebuild uh when hopefully this war is uh is over so we passed this bill totally bipartisan in the house and uh we've convinced the administration now that this is a good idea they've embraced it i'm confident we're going to do it what do you think the odds are of this bill passing and could it pass quickly enough to provide military assistance or is it likely to be too far off in the future even if it does pass it has passed the house so we we passed uh the bill that basically tells the administration we need to come up with a way to do it they came back to us and said you know what we agree they didn't at first but they they do now and we're going to work with them to if they need new legal authority to do this we're going to figure out a way to do it potentially in the ukraine supplemental funding bill that we are going to pass in the next couple of weeks when we come back to washington the seizing of property probably sounds a bit heavy-handed to the ears of some maybe even many americans why do you think it's justified in this case first of all you know we look at these oligarchs around the world you know they own soccer teams and uh and and fancy properties and villas and yachts and we think oh my gosh they're private owners of this property they're not putin owns this property these guys are are managers in a corporation or mafia to be even more honest that's run by one one man in moscow and the money was stolen uh through corruption in russia and we to our shame have helped them protect it in our financial system in our real estate in our uh companies uh in in the united states and western europe uh so it's a pretty unique circumstance uh where uh where i think we've got an opportunity both to do some justice and to um help ukrainians rebuild the country that putin has destroyed and somebody's got to pay for that right and the united states will be generous will contribute but we should not be stuck with a bill for tens or hundreds of billions of dollars just because putin one day decided he's going to lay waste to ukraine i think he should pay for a good chunk of this you also have a manufacturing bill on the table talk about that so the house has passed a bill called the america competes act the senate has passed a different version of the bill so this is very viable and basically this is about bringing manufacturing of critical technologies like microchips back home to america big lesson of the pandemic and the ukraine war is that we just cannot afford to be as dependent as we have been on countries like china that are adversaries of the united states or or places that are just unstable for the critical technologies that we need to power our economy so whether it's microchips or batteries or solar panels or pharmaceutical ingredients this bill invests in loans and loan guarantees to help manufacturers bring those jobs and and that manufacturing back home to america going back to ukraine one of the things we're seeing with uh russia on the offensive wheel and having it stalled and we only have probably 10 15 seconds is there a possibility ukraine could win this and russia could actually be defeated ukraine is going to win this war at great cost of course to the ukrainian people but i'm absolutely confident with the assistance we have provided and their own bravery they are going to win all right that's it congressman tom malinowski from the 7th district of new jersey thank you so much for being with us this

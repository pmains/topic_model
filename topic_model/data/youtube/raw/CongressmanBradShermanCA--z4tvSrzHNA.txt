former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is leading a gun-control rally right now in Philadelphia just a few miles from the Democratic convention site tonight the issue will move to center stage as the mothers of the movement many of many of them women who've lost their sons to gun violence talk about why they're backing Hillary Clinton we know Secretary Clinton even as Senator Clinton has been dealing with these kinds of issues with gun violence gun violence prevention mass incarceration criminalization poverty she's been dealing with these kinds of systemic issues all along so her record speaks for itself so she didn't just join the game she's been doing the work already she's been in the trenches so she understands dynamically the way to move forward to be able to change this kind of climate that we see with gun violence joining me now to talk about this congressman brad Sherman from California welcome sir thanks for being here so gun control a central issue of tonight's convention and there's this big rally in Philadelphia going on right now with Gabby Giffords it is an important issue but but our voters passionate enough about it that that their passion will get them to the polls to vote their people passionate on both sides and there's an effort on the other side to paint us as against the culture of rural America against the idea of hunting against the idea of having a gun at home for self-protection where you may be 15 20 minutes away from law enforcement so the effort here is to show that with reasonable gun control laws that have it prospect of passing you don't need 30 bullets in a magazine to bring down a deer and if you do you shouldn't be hunting well I do think that the Republicans have have been successful in painting the Democrats as destroyers of the Second Amendment and I'll just give you one example your style Trump Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment you want to abolish it okay Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment she wants to take the bullets away she wants to take it you tell me that's something we can live with we're gonna cherish the Second Amendment all right so so Benny gun rights advocates absolutely believe that that Democrats the real intent is to destroy the Second Amendment I think that's ridiculous there are a lot of members of our caucus that that are hunters an awful lot who represent rural areas again this is about how many bullets you need in the magazine do you need a gun that will spray bullets around and in the answer to those questions is no just as even the gun advocates say you shouldn't have a bazooka at home nor do you need one so Trump will try to describe us as extremists he'll try to say we're for open borders and immigration he'll try to say we're for no trade deals at all just let everybody every good into the country and he'll try to say that we're for taking guns away from people but if you actually look at the positions there the reasonable kinds of common sense if I mean what we fought for in Congress was no fly no bye does anybody out there think that someone is so dangerous that we prevent them from you from their constitutional right to travel we won't let them get on a plane but we'll let them buy a gun of course we need a system for getting off that list in the due process but if due process says you're too dangerous to fly then you're too dangerous but those are the kinds of common-sense measures that I think people attend she will agree with that what I want to ask about too is you know Hillary Clinton said you know she's the usual unifying factor among Republicans it seemed last night the Donald Trump really was the unifying factor for Democrats uh yes look I think we'd be unified behind our positive agenda but Trump's certainly helps here is a man who has pandered to racism has proposed constitutional test see he says the most extreme thing then he backs down just a little bit but but wouldn't you rather the candidate being the being the unifying factor and not the guy who's running against that Canada we have both and as an American I'm a gas that one of our major political parties would nominate Trump but as a Democrat who would like to see some big wins I think they're doing all they can to help us congressman thanks for stopping by but you appreciate it still to come in the newsroom Bernie Sanders is preaching unity his delegate said to speak minutes from now is the party closer to coming together

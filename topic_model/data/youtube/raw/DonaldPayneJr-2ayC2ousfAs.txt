Thank You mr. Castro mr. Payne from New Jersey thank you for joining us this evening Thank You mr. Garamendi and let me once again thank you for you stepping out and giving members such as myself the opportunity to express our outrage of what is going on in this great nation of ours you have given me several opportunities to speak on issues pertaining to this country that are at the core of decisions and issues and that we need to address and your passion tonight is warranted let me say never in my life did I think that I would be on the floor of the United States House of Representatives calling for the President of the United States to stop tearing children away from their parents yet here I am perhaps it's fitting that today is June 10th a holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States Juneteenth is also a stark reminder that our country has a dark history of ripping children away from their parents african-americans know all too well that laws and policies can be twisted to evil ends we know all too well the pain of having our children torn away from us and our families separated it was a common event during slavery we know all too well that state-sponsored psychological terror can have lasting effects on generations what is going on at our South border is evil it is a deplorable policy by deplorable people and it's got to stop the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics has explained that the practice of ripping children away from their parents at the border is child abuse let me emphasize one of the country's leading pediatric pediatricians has said that the United States is engaging in are in the heart in horrible action that disrupt the synopsis and the neurological connections that are part of developing the developing brain of these immigrant babies who are we as a nation now I've heard pundits defending evil by saying that the Trump administration is just following the law just applying the law I've heard other pundits wrongly say the migrant parents are breaking the law and deserve to have their children taken away Attorney General Jeff's Beauregarde sessions even trotted out the Bible to defend the family separation policy quoting a passage that says to obey laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes that's the same Scripture that they use for slave owners against their slaves to defend their practice of holding human beings in bondage so let me answer attorney general Beauregard sessions and the Trump administration's goons legal does not mean moral slavery was legal but it was immoral Jim Crow was legal but it was immoral force sterilization was legal but it was immoral apartheid was legal but it was immoral tearing children away from their parents at the border may be legal but it is immoral the president could end this evil with one tweet Congress can end it with a vote let us hope that reasonable people steer the ship of the state onto the right course before the seeds of despair consume us all and mr. Garamendi let me just say that as I thought about this and you've been in this body much longer than I and I have seen people come and go great people on both sides of the aisle that you've worked with well let me just say that what has happened what has happened to that side of the aisle what is going on with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that they do not speak up they all have children I would die for my triplets getting here if I was in a position where I thought that my my life and my children's lives were in danger where I was I would you better believe I would come up here and try to get into this state into this commission we would all do that for our children so yet these people are criminals it rated baffles the mind sir and I will I know the time is fleeting I will yield back but I have seen the GOP come up with a new nonprofit through this whole endeavor they have created a new nonprofit sir it's called cage the children and I'll yield back

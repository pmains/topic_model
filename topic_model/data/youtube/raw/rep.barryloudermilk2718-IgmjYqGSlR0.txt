Caesar junk feeds they're unfair and they hit marginalized Americans the heart is especially low-income folks and people of color they Benefit Big corporations not consumers not working families I know it's been a tough few years but from day one my Administration was later focus on easing the burden facing working class families saying that surprise charges such as hotel resort fees or unfair banking penalties are hurting working-class families by and also claiming that more expensive and roomier Airline seats are also quote unfair and junk and they're unfair to people of color joining us right now is Georgia congressman and member of the House Financial Services committee Barry Loudermilk Congressman good to see you you're on the financial services committee you've obviously looked at this what's your reaction to Joe Biden's comments well good morning Maria this is it's absurdity I mean does he even know what he's talking about when he's talking about six inches on an airline seat I mean most Americans probably don't have a clue what he's talking about but this is something that's been they've been working on for quite a while the director of the cfpb I challenged him in a Committee hearing about junk fees they're creating this thing junk fees like it's something in law and it isn't and they're going after fees that are legal such as Bank overdraft fees they want to eliminate those and this is this is something it's an overreach it's overstretch this is just showing their desperation that they have right now in this election is to do anything to make the people think they actually care about them so so you think he's just doing this to make people think like he's doing something about inflation after all of the massive five trillion dollars plus in spending that actually uh took us to 40-year highs of inflation absolutely I mean the first way that you for Recovery is to admit you have a problem they will not admit that they are the reason that we're we're seeing this record inflation and so uh when you won't fix the actual problem you got to come up with something else and they're making these things up they're going after things that would make no difference and quite frankly most people don't care about at all Congressman stegan McDowell but the bigger picture is the greatest hardship on working Americans and particularly lower income Americans has come straight out of the Democrats with this Maria five trillion dollars in news spending and borrowing and do the American people know that this these junk fees are just well junk theater ahead of the election I think they do because one thing they're not defining junk fees other than this obscure uh six additional inches on airlines I mean I I listened to the quote several times I still didn't know what he's talking about I don't think he knows what he's talking about I would argue I would argue that if anybody actually listened to the Commander in chaos talking about the extra fees for more leg room they think well golly I really wish I had enough money to take a trip with my entire family and fly somewhere I'm running up my credit card bills just to pay for gasoline and food yeah unfortunately I'm paying 30 percent more just for a dozen eggs right now exactly I mean the the price of groceries is one thing a lot of people aren't talking about and that's what I'm hearing about from people throughout the community especially here in Georgia people are just frustrated they're he says he feels a frustration well he really doesn't they're not frustrated at uh six inches of Airline uh leg space they're frustrated with how much they're paying they're frustrated with the government uh try to dictate every aspect of their life they're frustrated with woke culture they're so they're frustrated with cancel culture this is what they're frustrating let's not forget he also threw into the mix concert fees I mean let's think about this today in the marina in Mark's Point your point people literally are starving right now because the cost of goods that you literally need to survive has gone through the roof they have such no plan to deal with this they're so desperate to try to tell the American people that they have some plan to deal with something that they're going for this most ridiculous I don't even want to call it low hanging fruit this is silliness Congressman yeah it absolutely is this absurd and the next thing is they will blame the American people for inflation just watch it will come yeah it can never be there to be the American people well let me ask you about the catalysts that is upon us will the midterms be a catalyst for all of this there's got 12 days until the election Georgia has seen a record amount of early voting one million ballots already cast the White House is still claiming that there's voter suppression in the peach state watch this the White House observing instances of voter suppression in Georgia and other states that adopted some of these laws over the last two years I'm not going to get into to fix on what Georgia voters are doing what I am saying is that you know generally speaking again more broadly speaking of course High turnout and voter suppression can take place at the same time we don't know what she's talking about either Congressman but uh this from the group that actually doesn't want anybody to have an ID when they go to the voting booth the word of the day is absurdity this is another one you know when you look at the record turnout that we're having what they're saying is they don't like who's turning out because traditionally Democrats tend to vote earlier more than Republicans do in Fortune right now it looks like Republicans are coming out stronger than Democrat and that's what they don't like but when you also the numbers blacks and elderly are coming out more than they did in 2018. so they can't claim voter suppression because minorities are coming out in drugs as well but keep this in mind those traditional groups of both Democrat they're frustrated about the same things that Republicans are so we'll see how that turns out in a couple of weeks

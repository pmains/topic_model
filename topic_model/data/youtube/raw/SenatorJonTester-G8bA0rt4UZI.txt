I think just about every Montana has experienced a drop call or text message that hasn't gone through because of poor wireless coverage we were able to get some grant dollars it's going to expand wireless coverage in Montana in a big big way it's going to be building more infrastructure more cell towers making sure that there's more wireless coverage across the state it's going to be a big project over the next 15 years and I think it's really going to help Montana move into the 21st century when it comes to wireless coverage so this is good news for Montana it's part of my connect Montana initiative and will continue to work to try to make sure that Montana has the same kind of wireless assets that they do in other parts of the country so that we can be a part of the worldwide economy that exists

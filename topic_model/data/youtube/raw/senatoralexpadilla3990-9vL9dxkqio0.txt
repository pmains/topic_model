so as i do begin to bring this hearing to a closure i want to thank my fellow subcommittee members and especially our witnesses for joining us today in this time of global economic uncertainty the united states cannot afford to fall behind immigration and higher education are essential engines for economic growth we heard from mr barola that almost half of the fortune 500 companies in the us were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants immigrants represent more than one-third of our nation's nobel prize winners including all three of last year's winners and daca recipients include valedictorians and road scholars and more like dr larios there are doctors teachers mothers and fathers who are home in america and contributing greatly to our country higher education plays a critical role in attracting and unlocking the talent of immigrant students immigrants make up about a fifth of all startup founders who have attracted venture capital in the last 30 years most of those entrepreneurs came to this country through student visas to earn a college or a graduate degree and international students and students with daca all frequently start companies in the same state where they went to school bringing economic benefits to the entire community the evidence is clear we should be eager to welcome immigrant students and make it easier for them to access higher education and we should listen to the economists and business leaders who are sounding the alarm on our labor shortage today and on our decline in the population growth rate but instead of maintaining our edge it seems like we risk falling behind filling stem jobs in particular is critical to maintaining our supply chains growing our economy and protecting our national security but at the current rate we risk losing our leadership position at the forefront of technology and innovation we cannot afford to let our colleges and universities fall behind in the global competition for talent our losses would be other countries gains so it's time to pass critically needed reforms to attract and retain more international students and it is time to pass permanent protections for dreamers ensuring that they have lawful status and a pathway to citizenship a pathway to citizenship that they have earned congressional inaction is threatening to push daca recipients like dr larios out of the workforce and back into the shadows a majority of undocumented students graduating from high school today aren't even eligible to benefit from daca and follow her path as we mark the 10th anniversary of daca tomorrow and as we work to restore our economy congress must act so let's follow the evidence that we heard today and passed long overdue laws to attract and retain immigrant students our country and our economy clearly depend on it and with that thank you all again for your participation today this hearing is adjourned

and joining us now congresswoman maxine waters democrat from california thank you so much it's a pleasure to have you on thank you good good good good let me get your reaction to uh what uh minority leader boehner said about this reset starting over we're hearing a lot of republicans utter that today well uh the republicans have been coming up with various scenarios as we have gone through this debate the fact of the matter is the president said the time is now let's stop bickering let's stop delaying let us move to have real reform in health care so that american citizens can stop paying too much for health care taking a disproportionate amount of their income for basic coverage he took the time last night to explain the facts of the bill he talked directly to seniors he talked about how we were going to pay for it i think he stepped up to the plate he even went into public option which has been you know a source of disagreement which is what makes me curious were you satisfied with his answer or where how he explained his position on public option well i would have preferred that he would said that he was supportive of it unequivocal there was no other thing that he would even entertain he didn't say that what he said was he supports it he would rather have it but he's open uh to listening to people who have better ideas i don't think there are any better ideas about how you can contain the cost but he did leave the door open congresswoman as you know the president is trying to sort of be above the but the partisanship but there it is a very partisan atmosphere as you know evidence for example by congressman joe wilson or even by the congressman we just had michael burgess who was unable to say that what the congressman wilson said last night and did was wrong i i describe the atmosphere as you see it and what do you make of this well first of all someone was speaking to congressman dingle last night who's been here for 50 years he said he had never ever experienced anything like that in the time that he's been a member of congress it was shocking uh you know we were all embarrassed we were shaken uh and we were surprised that a member of congress would uh treat the president of the united states that way and so about the second day story when a member of congress like congressman burgess is unwilling to say that it was wrong i mean that suggests that congressman wilson has his supporters who are not even willing to sort of condemn him well that is true and i think that tells the american people about what we're dealing with when they talk about bipartisanship if you can't even admit a mistake if you can't even admit that calling the president of the united states uh in a in a public forum like that a liar then you know how difficult it is for us to try and communicate with them and to work out things with them they are not prepared to be cooperative as a matter of fact they don't want a health care reform bill period and they will come up with everything they can think of to stop or kill this bill congresswoman maxine waters it's a pleasure thank you for joining us welcome thank you

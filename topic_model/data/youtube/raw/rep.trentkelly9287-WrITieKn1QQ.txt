welcome back to the show here on super talk Mississippi I'm Mandy gunasekra filling in for Paul gallaud this Friday morning and I'm super excited to be joined with our hometown Congressman up here in northern Mississippi Congressman Trent Kelly welcome great to be here Mandy glad you're here and we have another Congressman here with us Congressman Jeff Duncan who represents South Carolina's Third District that's correct and what areas does that cover that's the northwest corner of the State Clemson University may have heard of it they win a National Championship occasionally but it's great to be in Mississippi and great to be with you yeah well hotty toddy back to you but we are glad you are here I'll say hottie toddy I'm looking forward to the game look that was my most important question who are you rooting for tomorrow I'm pulling for Ole Miss so uh and I'm here for Trent Kelly and uh it's gonna be a great day I think the weather's going to be perfect and I'm ready to see them beat Auburn yeah I think um I you know I don't know if our Kentucky win was the upset I always feel like with Ole Miss we get one big upset here that isn't gonna happen tomorrow though no you don't think so I don't think so all right well we'll see we don't have to get into sports let's talk about something a little bit less divisive let's get into the politics of of uh what's going on in Washington oh yeah that's really less divisive I well let's uh how are y'all feeling about the midterms I know um I'm excited about the prospect of changing the direction of this country in less than two years we've seen this country go from um true true Prosperity setting aside covid but we had a strong economy we had a president that celebrated this country that put American interest first and that has totally been turned around and we've been dealing with all sorts of consequences so Congressman Kelly if we could start with you how are you feeling about the midterms and uh you know do you think we're going to take back the house oh I absolutely do and I feel really good you know it's like CNN who does not want to report anything positive Republicans but they're scared of being so wrong again they just did a poll uh basically a generic ballot in the 60 races that matter and it's like 49 40 43 for Republicans so in the areas that matter we're going to do well we're going to perform well we're going to win some seeds that we had one quite frankly in a long time yeah that'll be great um we'll have a formidable Republican presence back on Capitol Hill and can we can reinstitute some of these conservative principles that are going to be really important going forward at the root of that is energy policy and Congressman Duncan you are on the Energy and Commerce Committee um first of all are you will you have a gavel next Congress well we're trying to get the energy subcommittee gavel because I really believe in energy and energy policy you know under President Trump we are energy independent actually a net exporter of oil and we can be there we're blessed in this nation with uh abundant natural resources but unfortunately we're encouraged by liberal politicians who want to push us toward this liberal green agenda and um I like wind and solar I mean all the above God but I know what works and that is transportation fuels that are fossil fuels nuclear power Hydro um Advanced nuclear reactors but fossil fuels is what makes America great gives us the strength and we're not relying on foreign sources of energy so one thing I want to do man is bring the department of energy in and have them sit at that table and justify their existence because they were created in 1978-ish by Jimmy Carter to end our dependence on foreign sources of energy we're more dependent today than we ever have been so they failed in their mission so what's the future look like for the Department of energy and what's the future look like for energy here in America when Americans know that they were paying a lot less for gasoline and Diesel fuel at the pump under Donald Trump they know that Joe Biden Administration is directly responsible for increase in prices they can try to shift the blame to Vladimir Putin but when you cancel leases and you cancel future lease sales you cancel production on American soil whether that's offshore or onshore we know who's directly responsible and it's the Democrats and led by President Biden yeah absolutely and it's put it so real reason we used to not pay as much attention to what was going on with OPEC because it didn't impact us like it does today so here we are going into the midterms and OPEC just announced that they're going to be cutting production by 2 million barrels meanwhile President Biden has spent the entire summer draining our strategic petroleum Reserve using it for a political problem he himself is created but Congressman Kelly back to you really quick you're out you've been out in the district what are folks saying about gas prices oh they're sick about gas prices they're sick about what they're having to pay at the grocery store they're sick about what they're paying for their electric bills and and gas bills Heating and Cooling cooling right now but will soon be heat listen they can't afford to live I mean what is it eight thousand dollars a household that is causing us based on Biden's policies he has just been horrible for energy he's been horrible for the economy and uh it's kind of funny you know when Obama was here guess prices went up the economy got worse all those same things and they blamed that on Bush and now Biden's here and gas prices go up the economy's worse we're about to hit a recession if we're not already in one inflation is out of the run and and it's Trump's fault you know isn't it funny that they cause these problems when they're in office but it's the other person's home before them yeah I do remember um we had a lot to show for ourselves in a very short period of time during the Trump Administration and we would always get questions or push back from some of the mainstream media Democrat allies slash activists that well that's just that's just a hangover those are Ripple effects of the good policies that former president Obama had put into place so you're exactly right they're never going to get people who are thinking through what are the best policies for this country and thinking about it from the purview of the American family and the experience that they're having now something um leader McCarthy released not too long ago was this commitment to America um Congressman Duncan were you you were you a part of this were you part of the the energy dominance was a big piece of that um but but what is what is that message that is in the commitment to America and what can you say that gives the families like Congressman Kelly was just talking about that gives them hope that when Republicans take back over we're going to be able to to to to shift the country back in a much better Direction and provide some serious relief yeah so we were all involved in the commitment to America it's one thing Kevin McCarthy did is he created focus groups and subcommittees ad hoc committees within the conference to work on whether Environmental Policy crime the Border other issues that are important to Americans and let me just go back to one thing on on energy policy we do see the president right now draining the Strategic petroleum Reserve Trenton Homeland I'm on armed services and Intel and we can both tell you we just had hurricane Ian strategic petroleum Reserve is there for America during time of Crisis whether it's a time of War or threat of war or a national disaster is not for lowering gas prices not to be used as a political tool but we're seeing that in fact Donald Trump wanted to replenish and actually expand the spr the Strategic petroleum Reserve but yet we see President Biden travel 11 000 miles to beg the Saudis to increase oil production he should have gone to a fort Bouchon uh Fort fuchson or to uh the Permian Basin in Texas and in and talk to the energy producers there about increasing American production that's a winning strategy for the United States of America not going to bag a foreign country to help us so on the commitment to America energy policy is a big part of that energy security is National Security and so we're working hard on that the commitment talks about a safe and secure America prosperous America get our economy back on track Americans know especially here in Mississippi and South Carolina Americans go to the grocery store they have fewer choices they're paying more for the choices that are there that's directly responsible for the supply chain and the bad Administration not working on things like baby formula we're the United States of America we should uh easily be able to address the baby formula issue when it came up the inflation prices are direct related to energy and I'm going to keep talking about energy because that's my passion and something I'm working on but the diesel fuel that truckers use to deliver those goods to the store that you buy when they pay more for that diesel fuel that cost is passed on that increases the prices or inflation of prices that they deliver so Americans are paying more they're paying more to go get it because of their transportation fuel prices but they're also paying more at the store because the truckers and the industry The Producers the farmers that are paying more for input costs that's diesel fuel for the tractors to plant and harvest that's uh fertilizer assuming they can find it which a natural gas derivative derivative so all that's translating to higher prices less security food security energy Security National Security it all plays in yeah and it's um this plan that's come out this commitment to America is it's refreshing in the sense that Republicans are going to hit the ground running on day one um it's not just it's not just ideas which are important but there are substantive policies that everyone has been working on um we're gonna have to go to a break in just a little bit but Congressman Kelly really quick um obviously energy policy is a huge part of this but as Congressman Duncan mentioned so is security and so what I mean what are and we'll we'll be able to get more into this in the in the next segment but what are some of the elements that you're going to be working on to enhance National Security and restore National Security in ways we've seen a road under our President Biden well I think to sum it up real quickly is just uh we don't want awoke military we do not want our war we don't want an identity politics military we want oversight on uh FBI and CIA to make sure that they're doing the things that they're supposed to and not buying inward but spying outward and then border security and then as a former district attorney you know we've got to get after these DA's and federal prosecutors who will not prosecute crimes unless as Republicans who commit them in which case they'll get you for something small and send you to jail forever that's right well we uh we're gonna pick up on that as soon as we get back from the break for our listeners stay tuned we're going to take a quick break but I am here with Congressman trick Kelly our hometown Congressman here in northern Mississippi and Congressman Jeff Duncan from South Carolina we've got a lot more to talk about so stay tuned

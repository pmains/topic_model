Mr Speaker we are running out of patience last week the nation waited and hoped that justice would finally be served in the case of Michael Brown we waited to hear our country say loud and clear there are consequences for taking the lives of others we waited to hear some reassurance that black and brown boys lives do matter but again we were terribly disappointed and discouraged the Ferguson grand jury's decision not to indict former officer Darren Wilson was yet another slap in our face it was a painful reminder that just like with Trayvon Martin and Tamir rice and so many others that law enforcement officers killed our black and brown men and boys without repercussions while some may see the grand jury's decision as the system working as it should others witnessed what we believe was a blatant miscarriage of justice where is the closure for Michael Browns parents where is the understanding for the outrage and desperation of the black community the fact that our the greatest country in the world remains mired in race relations issues in the year 2014 is an embarrassment we really should consider taking a long look in the mirror before we go to other countries lecturing to them about the need for democracy and tolerance when here at home we are unable to fully address our own issues mr. speaker the house is not in order the gentlewoman is correct house will be in order please proceed if we are to learn anything from the tragic death of Michael Brown we must first acknowledge that we have a race issue that we are not addressing we must have open honest transparent conversations about prejudice racism and racial threat we must also lead conversations with law enforcement about transparency accountability and police and community policing and I want to thank the president today for once again putting a focus on the need for community policing in our country mr. speaker all lives have value as members of Congress it is our responsibility to clearly communicate this message to our voters our constituents in our neighbors mr. speaker enough is enough I yield back

as we've discussed already and as you know there were a handful five states to be exact including my state of Michigan where my governor ordered required through an executive order nursing homes to admit covin 19 and positive patients back in their facilities this proved to be a terrible policy as we found out with the consequences for our seniors with almost 2000 nursing home residents and in Michigan having died that's accounting for one-third of our state's covin 19 deaths dr. Redfield some officials in the five states that issue these executive orders have indicated they were following guidance from administration what guidance and used that term expressly earlier on and I appreciate that because I think that's what we do give at the federal level when we talk to States but what guidance did HHS and CDC release as it relates to admitting kovat patients in the nursing homes and secondly what obligations our state's under to follow that guidance thank you very much congressman for the question important question ceci did in fact and does in fact have guidance for nursing homes the guidance that you're referring to was guidance that was grounded in the fact that some situations were that nursing homes were refusing to take any kovat patients at the time so CDC did issue a series of important prerequisites that the nursing home had to have in place in order to accept these patients that they had admitted to the hospital back when they came back fundamental to that was that they had the appropriate facilities to isolate that individual they had the appropriate infection control capacity to maintain that so it really was not saying you have to take somebody back it's that you have to be open to taking care of Kovac patients provided that you have the capacity to do it correctly and directly as a key thing and correctly and so that that patient doesn't spread the infection to other individual and I think some of the speeches that we've heard in the press failed to understand that it's to do it correctly as you know over half of the nursing homes in this nation right now over 7,000 nursing home in this nations have a Kovac patient in them the question is how to do it correctly and safely and save the life share and save the lives well gets down to date as well so let me ask you what are the obstacles to collecting and reporting the data that you are now requiring and my governor's finally started to put out what are the obstacles to collecting and reporting this data particularly among seniors living in nursing homes and what steps as CDC already taken to improve data collection from the states CMS has now required as you know that nursing homes are reporting their data and they've reported to CDC and then CDC reports it on to CMS and CMS has it's actionable right as we sit here today a majority over ninety percent of nursing homes I think it's I think it's north of 80 I think we're almost at between 80 and 90 percent are actively reporting through our system already since that request was required a couple weeks ago and we're working to get all 100% of the nursing homes to be reporting as required by CMS and the data also is complemented I mentioned earlier about the ethnic groups and data that data actually comes in originally with now all testing you all have helped us in that now any tests it's done for kovat has to come and has a series of key data points to include ethnicity and race so that we can maintain that for all cases across the country and dependent if their nursing home or not thank you we hope it helps dr. Fauci three questions that I have for you relative to yesterday University of Michigan announced its plans for fall semester to consist of a mixture of in person and remote classes as schools prepare for the fall semester what factors should they be considering and I'm thinking of higher education here what do we know about the transmission kovat and young adults that would help inform the decision to reopen colleges and universities and thirdly should reopening look different for a school like University of Michigan versus the school like Hillsdale College my district with with 1,500 students in a rural community yeah all good points again the one answer could probably spill over into each of the questions you really have to consider what the state of the epidemic is in the particular place that you're at now if you have very very few cases like in a small college in a County I think you can be really very liberal in the opening what schools are doing and they're doing it in a very creative way is to try and make sure that there is separation enough that you have situations where first of all masks should be done at all times without exception you've got to protect the vulnerable you've got to allow both faculty as well as students who are in that category of underlying conditions to be able to have the capability of either teaching or learning online you have to have the capability of when you get an infected student which you invariably will no doubt to be able to remove that student to a safe comfortable place for the period of time until they can go back if you leave them in the community you're gonna wind up having a situation that could make the whole thing fall apart that's just a few of the things we need to do but importantly you've got to look at what the status is and your particular situation the other thing is people who work with the students namely people who feed them people who clean they need to be also paid attention to because often we get in a cruise ship being on a nursing home it's the staff who might bring in an infection and then infect the individuals who are in a much larger group thank you I yield back thank you

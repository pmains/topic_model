thank you madam chair and ranking member thank you mr johnson for your mark so thank you for being here today first off i would like to thank the men and women in your agency who do their best to maintain law and order when this administration has not made that an easy task you all have an incredibly difficult and complex duty to this country and i hope you are aware of the support that you have this invasion of foreign nationals at our southern border should be the top priority of this administration and congress as the acting director for ice i look forward to hearing how we can help you clean up this disaster the historic crisis at our southern border is set to worsen greatly due to the announced rescission of title 42 which will bring a tidal wave of illegal immigrants across our southern border and overwhelm and already overworked and understaffed agents of the u.s immigration and customs enforcement the well-resourced cartels gang members human traffickers and drug smugglers will exploit this crisis to further endanger american citizens last year you testified that the u.s was seeing record low number of deportations you stated that a contributing factor was being able to expel individuals that have not made it into the detention network and in a position to be removed via title 42. with the recent announcement of title 42's rescission could you tell me how this is going to affect isis ability to remove individuals and do you believe the number of deportations will begin to increase once this goes into effect so really really good questions i do think that the number of ice deportations will will increase once title 42 goes away because we are expending a good number of ice resources currently on the expulsion of of individuals uh via this title 42 authority over since title 42 has been in effect we have removed over 8 about 85 000 individuals with ice air resources um to to countries under the t42 authority so if if if and when t-42 goes away uh that that'll free up some of those uh airframes and and resources for us to increase our uh our our deeper our typical standard tighter weight removal slash deportations several weeks ago secretary marica sat in front of this committee and explained that he is preparing the agencies he is responsible for to be ready for this massive influx of immigrants hope is not a strategy and i believe we need to have a clear plan in place to deal with the influx that is to come could you please explain to me in this committee what will ice be ready to do differently as of may 24th very good question it's something we've been planning for the better part of a year for the uh the end of of title 42 um you know we'll we will continue to deploy resources down to the southern border as we have uh for the you know at least the last 12 or 16 months to assist with the orderly and humane processing of of individuals namely enrolling on on atd scheduling an appointment for them to show up in the interior to receive their charging documents etc we are continuing to beef up our our transportation networks whether it's ground transportation or or airframes uh in in preparation for the end of uh of of title 42 that work has been underway for for for quite a while and it's going to be really important that we have the the ground transportation and and airframes to move folks to where the uh where the beds are or where the where the support structures are as the head of ice what amount of advice in conversation have you given to the secretary marcus and the white house um concerning this the tidal wave of immigrants that are coming our way i mean again you you said you've been preparing uh for this for over a year and i'm assuming that is by building hospitality centers and medical centers and receiving centers when you you think we would have been you know sending up singles to where we wouldn't have this tidal wave of immigrants but to kind of more you know encourage people to stay at home and uh but instead of taking this dangerous journey to um to to the border just i'm always concerned it's like is the president even listening to his secretary and is the secretary listening to the people under his command such as yourself director so i i can only speak to my my conversations with the department and the secretary and absolutely they are taking our our input and and all the input from the the career uh professionals within the within the organization you know again where we're we're pushing the the resources and and trying to push the the border south we've you know devoting a lot of resources in mexico as well as the uh the northern triangle and and really trying to to stem the flow and target some of these transnational criminal organizations well before they make it to our uh our our southern border so that that work is underway it'll continue we continue to have discussions with mexico and guatemala about you know them doing their part to stop the flow but you know there there are certainly a lot of efforts underway to to to sort of reduce the the flow of of migrants to our southern border thank you director madam chair i yield back

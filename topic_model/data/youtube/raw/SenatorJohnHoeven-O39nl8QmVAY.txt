Thank You mr. chairman and it's good to see you again here today and thank you so much for stopping by my office appreciate it very much I'd like to start out with in order to build an energy plan for this country where we're truly energy secure we've got to have the infrastructure to do it talk to me for a few minutes if you would about what you see first role is in ensuring that we build the necessary infrastructure to have energy security for our country Thank You senator a few ways in particular that FERC can support the infrastructure development one is by ensuring that the markets are sending proper signals to investors and to others who want to support infrastructure upgrades build-outs to ensure that we're getting the power the in all of the resources where they need to be certainly I've spoken about perks role to ensure just and reasonable rates that's a key way another way that maybe you don't read specifically in what perks roles would include would be providing regulatory certainty hearing being consistent with the with honoring what the law says the rule of law and ensuring that we're issuing orders in a timely fashion those are a few ways how do you make sure that applicants can get through the process where we certainly make sure that they're doing things right and well but that they can get through the process and an expeditious manner so they're encouraged to make the investment in new transmission and and other infrastructure that we need indeed as a state regulator I'm very cognizant of this specific issue where investor owned utilities or others come to us with a request with a request to construct a transmission line or to offer a particular rate to a newcomer in a can economic development it's important that as I mentioned that we follow the law but that for instance with regard to a pipeline application there's a pre filing period which allows the parties to work with FERC and others to ensure that they work out the bumps in the road and the kinks to ensure that when the formal application process gets underway that it will be done as seamlessly and quickly as possible I understand that in particular with those applications FERC does by and large respond to them within the year however the law requires 42 for instance with regard to a project to and to make a determination regarding safety and environmental impacts in the locale where the project would take place this also requires FERC to get input from other federal agencies to comply with NEPA and other federal laws and so much of that timeline is constrained by what the law says and if confirmed I would be certainly I would be more than willing to uphold the law but more importantly I would be open to any suggestions that you may have or others for ways to streamline those processes so that we're not only providing regulatory certainty that we're responding in a timely fashion but that also sends a signal of confidence to the market into the the investors and also provide some degree of certainty about the process what's your view on LNG export I have certainly generally supported the notion I think and I've also noted that do II conducted a study sometime back that determined that within certain ranges that there would not be a significant impact on domestic prices that's very important and it would be prudent for dle to undertake that exercise we certainly don't want to harm domestic prices and our ability to harness this resource and participate in the global gas market do you think LNG will adversely impact the domestic market no not at this time how do you how do we expedite the siting of transmission lines electric transmission lines how do we expedite that sighting process certainly I can speak to this from a state regulatory perspective it's important for industry too much in the way that i described about this informal process that takes place ahead for the relevant entities to ensure that they've worked out some of those conflicts and so that when they present the various options to be considered by the regulatory authority the process can move seamlessly I would be committed to dotting the i's crossing the T's and by that I mean following the law ensuring that due process process is observed but moreover ensuring that we provide the applicant with a timely and certain response I think that's very important we need more electric transmission you know we need to build out the grid we need safety security but certainly more transmission and this will be an important role for you this honorable thank you I think you bring a outstanding track record and resume to this job great to have you here today Thank You senator thank

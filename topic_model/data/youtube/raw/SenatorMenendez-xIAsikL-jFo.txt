mr barr there's a serious diversity problem at the federal reserve latinos are the nation's largest minority they make up 20 of the united states population yet they have no representation in fed leadership i've raised this issue many times with nominees and sitting members of the federal reserve i've heard extensively about what the fur the fed is supposedly doing and i just can tell you right now that's just not sufficient 62 million hispanic americans in the united states with a 2 trillion domestic marketplace impact deserve a seat at the table where our nation's most important economic decisions are made it's the reason that i voted against chairman powell so i'm eager uh to hear how you uh would deal with this question if confirmed what steps would you take to improve minority representation particularly latino representation in leadership roles of the fed uh thank you senator for that question i agree with you that diversity and equity and inclusion are important goals for the federal reserve to pursue in my experience in in prior jobs at the treasury department uh and at the gerald r school of public policy uh those have been a really quite important goals of mine as well and what i've been doing in my own work is to try and build a pipeline of people who can then come in get increasingly senior jobs positions it starts in our work at the ford school for example we start in high schools now going out into high schools and educating students about the opportunities of public policy we run a summer program for juniors in college to get them engaged in a public policy and prepare them for graduate training we do a lot of work to build out the graduate pool we then work on the post doctoral pool the faculty pool and so really kind of a a holistic approach i appreciate that and preparing the pipeline obviously is is one element but the problem is is there are many qualified individuals now who could enter uh into the fed system there are qualified individuals who should be on their uh federal uh on the regional banks um so would you commit uh to working with my office to increase latino representation at the fed yes sir i would be delighted to your work and would your breakfast on these issues yeah we have you also have an important role to play in the selection process for presidents and members of the board of directors of the 12 federal reserve banks which in its 108 year history has never had a latino sitting on it would you commit to working to ensure that diverse candidates are considered for these positions yes senator i think that is a quite important goal for the federal reserve and i'd be delighted to work on that and it's not just to do the right thing study after study shows us that the more diverse boards the greater the profitability and the bottom line uh mr lisa congratulations on your nomination if confirmed you'd be the only latino currently serving on the sec commission or senate confirmed federal financial regulator for that matter um and mr ueda congratulations to you as well in your historic nomination the asset management and investment advisory industries are overwhelmingly white and male studies consistently show that greater diversity leads to greater profitability as i just suggested so in an effort to improve performance and thereby benefit retail investors the sec's asset management advisory committee unanimously recommended that the sec take concrete actions to improve diversity in these industries so i want to ask both mr ueda and mr elisa can you commit to bringing these recommendations before the commission for a vote so that we can bring transparency and diversity to the industry and ultimately deliver better outcomes for investors thank you senator for that question and um i embrace diversity and inclusion as fundamental values and i'm proud of the work that i've done in congress on that issue including in the setting up of the historic uh house diversity office that serves the entire house of representatives i'm also aware that this is an issue that has received a lot of attention uh in the shareholder proposals and it's something that if confirmed i i intend to stay very active on and all i'm looking for is a vote you guys can vote it down if you want to but the sec uh management advisory committee unanimously that's a very broad spectrum of individuals uh made this recommendation so all i'm looking for is a vote before the sec if you all don't think it's a good idea you can vote it down if you think it's a good idea you can support it so will you uh seek if you're confirmed to have a vote before the sec on this advisory committee's recommendations if confirmed i look forward to exploring that possibility recognizing that i would need to look into the details of that process but i i agree with the sentiment that's expressed by the advisory committee mr arena when i was on the scc staff i had the privilege of help standing up the asset management advisory committee i think i've seen the incredible amount of work they've put in on these recommendations and all of them not only just for amac but the other advising communities the recommendations need to be taken very very seriously by the commission if confirmed i will commit to considering any uh item that chair gensler uh who who oversees what items go under the agenda uh are put up uh on diversity and improving uh inclusion in the assets you're both learning your time in congress to be very uh uh cautious in your answers i'm gonna submit questions for the record i'd like to support both of your nominations but i just simply want to hear a yes or no if chairman gensler puts it up then you know you you can be advocates to chairman gensler to put it on right you're not just stoic figures there you you have a role to play if you're uh if you're ultimately confirmed senator rounds is next thank you

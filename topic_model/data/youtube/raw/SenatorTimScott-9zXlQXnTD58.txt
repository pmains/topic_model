join me in welcoming a great American a great friend of law enforcement the senator from South Carolina Senator Tim Scott thank you sir foreign has a flight to catch and so you may leave as soon after it's not because of anything anyone said that is true it's not because of anything anyone says although as a southern boy listening to you New Yorkers uh communicate it is quite a lesson in clarity sometimes brevity but always very very very sharp thank you very much for the introduction thank you all saying thank you for uh the lessons in clarity as well and certainly General thank you for your service to our country and to everyone else it is my pleasure to be here with you all and certainly as I was introduced I I had a tough tough start sometimes you have to thank God for a miserable beginning because in part one of the reasons why I became a fan of law enforcement so early in life was because of some of the challenges that I I've seen in my lifetime and I'll say that as a a 16 year old my mother and I were sharing one car it was a 1982 Toyota Corolla hatchback it was probably the ugliest Brown in American history that car it was terrible but I was driving my mother to work one morning and we would do that every day of the week and I was working about 65 hours a week in a summer job and I was playing football so I had two a day practices and so one morning I took my mom to work about 6 15 in the morning she woke me up just in time to get in the car and I dropped her off and I was driving back on the main Interstate in South Carolina which is I-26 and as I was driving down I-26 oh I started getting sleepy so I rolled the please no that's it rolled the windows down poor boy doesn't have any electricity in the car on the windows and I rolled the windows up and I turned the radio is loud as I could get it and I 1982 in August at 100 degrees I turned the heat on to see if that would work and then I turned the aces as wild as possible as high as possible the next thing I knew I heard the gravel underneath my tires on the side of the road as I woke up in a panic how many of you all know what happens with a 16 year old panics driving the car is 70 miles an hour down the interstate correct nothing good I slammed on the brakes that jerked the steering wheel the car does not spin when you jerk the steering wheel at 70 miles an hour it rolls back into traffic I believe in God in part because of that remarkable experience as I rolled back into the traffic I was going eastbound I missed this is 7 A.M in the morning I missed all the traffic going eastbound and I hit the median which took me in the air and brought me back going westbound on the interstate where a couple cars go underneath my car I come down and Nick a car on the front of the car glass everywhere blood everywhere I go through the windshield holding on to the steering wheel yelling for help it sounds like Jesus and miraculously I was back in the car I ended up in a ditch westbound I heard people running towards my car and some young lady was yelling he's dead he's dead me being the uninformed young man that I was I yelled back I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead well they pulled me up the car the emergency responders come I'm laying on the side of the highway glass in my back and my my back and Miss highway patrolman shows up at the scene he looks at me he looks at the car or the roof of the car is on top of the seat to the car he said Son your mom is going to be so happy you're alive and I looked up at him and said sir you don't know my mom you don't know my mom at all so but he was trying to tell me that there was something more important than life than the things you drive there is something more important in life than what it is the thing that's more important to your mama is who you are and whose you are this highway patrolman literally made me a fan of law enforcement at 16 years old because I understood then what I reinforced now that only the best should wear the badge and when we have the best wearing the badge we have a group of officers that we can be so incredibly proud of and for the last battle of 42 years almost I have been a raving fan of law enforcement and instead of that perspective I had as a Young Man in the midst of a really bad situation that I understood very quickly that those who are running into danger those who are showing up at the scenes are those people called to the mission of Public Safety and I'm a fan of every single man and every single woman who wears a badge who supports Public Safety I want to say thank you for the job that you do I want to say thank you for being the kind of person having the kind of Integrity that makes us all proud from coast to coast to have you all serving this great nation and as a lead Republican on police reform leading the negotiations on our side I will say that no time has resources been more important than the times in which we live in my lifetime when we've seen a 70 increase in violence against police officers we've seen over 380 officers shot in the line of duty 70 officers ambushed just trying to do their jobs and go home to their families I think about to those officers Wilbur Mora and Jason Revere and I think about the comments of Mrs Rivera during that painful scene suggesting and saying very clearly that the system has failed us because too often we see too many violent criminals back on the streets as soon as they are arrested because too many weak prosecutors continue to put the lives of the officers in Jeopardy and the lives of the community in Jeopardy by putting those violent criminals back on the streets of this country that is wrong and we should do something about it we either unelect them or the people who appoint them we have a response not only for Public Safety but for the safety of those doing the job keeping us safe it's one of the reasons why in my legislation we target another three billion dollars for Grants to local law enforcement what we don't need is a National Standard of law enforcement driven from Washington D.C because New York City is different than Charleston South Carolina we should respect the leadership in New York City to make the decisions in law enforcement in New York City but we should make sure that every single Department in this country has the resources necessary to do the work we should make sure that the resources and the training and the 21st century technology is yours so that you too come home to your families because the more everyday Americans understand that there's no such thing as an average traffic stop the safer our officers will be when we understand that there's no such thing as an average domestic call the safer our officers will be and when we understand as lawmakers on the local the state or the federal level that negotiating on important parts of your resources your equipment including your qualified immunity it has to be off the table if we want to make progress in developing strategies to keep you safe we cannot negotiate on your qualified immunity foreign let me just say I get a little passionate about this because we live in a world where people want there to be a simple binary choice that does not exist people want you to believe that you either are for law enforcement officers or you are for communities of color that is a false binary choice if you are for communities of color you must be for law enforcement officers if you are for law enforcement officers you've got to be four communities of color you've got to be for the communities where they serve and for the officers who serve in those communities that's the truth that's one of the reasons why 81 of African Americans across this country say we want the same level of policing or more but if you watch the news you walk away with a very different experience different View it's just in the way that my friends in New York talk it's just a lie it's that simple it's just not true and I want to bridge the gap I'll close with this a good friend of mine Trey Gowdy former Congress member in the United States House of Representative in a fellow South Carolinian he and I have gone through our state we brought together a law enforcement officers and law enforcement Leaders with leaders from the African-American community and we found that when you start with rapport and credibility it gives you permission to solve problems together and we found very quickly after three or four of those meetings across the state of South Carolina that most people have most things in common and that most people haven't done a ride-along with an officer to understand and appreciate the Split Second decisions being made and too often too few offices too few officers have had the experience of being embedded in the community long enough to get to know the difference between a scene where there's a mental health episode happening and a scene when there's not one happening we believe in the officers taught us about community policing and the necessity of developing strategies around that and so when we as Americans and specifically As Leaders elected Leaders with the power of the purse listen to the officers first to come up with the strategies at work we find the solutions they're easier to find but when we as elected officials think that we know best by some study we've read some book we've written or some place we've got but not on the streets but the officers that we can make a decision on what's best for you and your life that won't happen with conservative principles undergirding the next iteration of law enforcement on the federal level that will not happen as long as I have breath to breathe and I'm a member of the United States Senate and the good news for those who are on my side if I just got elected to another six years so I'll just say I'm here to stay and our approach will work because it hasn't worked thank you all for this tremendous award thank you all for letting the southern fella come up to New York for just a few minutes to understand how it said and how it's done I'll take this experience with me and I look forward to coming back God bless you and God please continue to bless our men and women in blue wow

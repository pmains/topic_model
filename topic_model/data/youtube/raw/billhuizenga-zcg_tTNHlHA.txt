years and the jobs which were expected to be done by this government where we divided things out between things that would be known as inherently governmental and as I said at the time and things that could be found in the yellow pages the discussion at the time became a very broad and deep conversation not just to run around the a76 circular but around all parts of the government where there was competition when the federal government was competing for jobs that actually could be done better by the free enterprise system the new group of freshmen that we have have recreated this idea are very excited about making sure that opportunities for taxpayer money that would be spent would be spent in a way where the taxpayer would not only win but the best value would be achieved on behalf the taxpayer for whatever the product might be today we have two members of this new caucus their outstanding new freshmen break the best ideas just what ideas about how we can make this government not only where it is more effective and efficient but also the cost component that can be so much better we do not throw government jobs but grow the prenup rise system if the free enterprise system that Nets out not only pain of taxes but also making sure that the benefits and the benefits package to come on marketplace very pleased and proud today to have bill Huizenga and died in black not like for Diane please grab this yellow pages Thank You mr. Chairman I appreciate you being here and your leadership in this first of all let me say that too many times here at the on the hill we don't use common sense this is really a common-sense idea with the federal government running the annual deficit of a trillion dollars and we have a national debt of 15 trillion dollars it is past time that we look everywhere that we can to save money and stop spending their money that we don't have this is a way to do that is ideal this caucus is simple our federal government is too big and that the federal government is doing something that the private sector is the chairman said the private sector can give you cheaper then let's have some competition that's really what this is about is to make sure that we have our private enterprise providing as much service of a competitive rate as we possibly can let's have some common sense so we can spend our dollars wisely and I can't want to thank congressman sessions for bringing about this talk isn't renewing the spirit Thank You Diane we also have a young man who sees firsthand of the competition and how things in his congressional district and across this country can be handled better by the printer price system bill Huizenga bill wait wait docket you can't you get caught even here yeah we get we get two of them this is uh no this is one generation this is this is the next generation where there where where they're sitting there they're saying hey where do I go where do I actually find the yellow pages everybody's hitting the internet and using their iPad or their smartphone or whatever it is so maybe a slight new variation is if you can find it on the internet and you can find someone who's going to ship it to you and send it to you and build it and pay for it all online that's as good as finding it in the yellow pages and guess what that's something that the federal government shouldn't necessarily be doing it as chairman sessions with saying there's a specific example that we've had back here in in West Michigan dealing with office furniture in my area we've got the three largest office furniture makers Herman Miller hey were at the steel case we've got a number of other smaller ones in fact we have 27 manufacturers and wholesalers in our area and back a number of years ago my former my former bosses who I had worked for my predecessor Peter hoekstra who had worked with chairman sessions actually did a press conference out in front of the local Social Security office that was opening a brand new office with what office furniture that was made by the federal government not by the private sector literally within within eyesight of one of those office furniture makers and we know that does this make sense and the answer that is no how many jobs is it how many dollars is that that is being taken out of the private sector we know there's a about a million jobs that we think would be created if we flirted that back to the private sector up to 27 billion dollar a year 27 billion dollars a year that is significant money at any time but especially in the economy that we're dealing with and the summer I had the opportunity to do something that we dubbed the Entrepreneurship and innovation tour we were going around and talking to these small innovators these small business people that were literally building things out of their garage now what happens whether they're they're going to come along and think that they just built a better mousetrap yet they find out that federal government's actually doing it and to take that opportunity away and that's absolutely the wrong direction to go so so glad that we were able to revive this and continue this this great yellowpages caucus and looking forward to working out of that and if anybody has any questions encourage you to go to the website Hezekiah house gov about regarding him yeah thanks we also joined today by Kevin Yoder and kevin is a brand new member of this body he served as an esteemed legislature in Kansas was a committee chairman knows firsthand of not just the power of government but also the awesome power of the free enterprise system and why we need to defer not just the prenup right system but the attributes of its effectiveness and efficiency Kevin you will probably be chastised with the older version do margin but there's the elevator spoken for you links well I think we're all looking for common-sense ways to make the federal government run more efficiently and more effectively one simple way to do that is to find ways to limit the amount of federal programs that are competing with things that are actually done more efficiently by the private sector we all know that the throne government doesn't create jobs doesn't create well when it creates programs that compete directly with the private sector tool including Americans out of work it's driving up the cost of producing goods in the federal so this is a great is a great comic says way Congress to come together find ways to reduce the size that there are government find ways to make more effective lost performance and also do but they call me do what it does best which is a lot of private sector to create jobs and not have a situation when the federal government is competing directly to this company so if it's in here it's something that the small businesses are doing summer in this country then it ought to be something the federal government should should limited success involvement in and allow these small businesses to to engage and further reduce the cost of producing the goods and its way to create more jobs so I'm happy to be part of this and I appreciate the Chairman a twisting colleagues for including these markets today we want to make ourselves a little any questions that you might have thank you very much for joining us you can look for us to be not only active and involved but of a mind that what we've got to do is bring back the efficiency of the free enterprise system when there's a competitive bid against our enterprise system by the government that's what we're dedicated to do it thank you very much wish oh there's one yes sir the large part of the federal government appropriations is outsourced is outsourced of when there are competitive bids the federal government does do certain things and they do certain things that are inherently governmental and then they do other things if we're talking about shipbuilding and plain building which is the majority of this money comes from that's that's a natural question you to understand it can be done better and would be done by someone else but the federal government also provides a lot of jobs that are janitorial jobs that are about automotive not only take care of leads of all sorts of activities that is position better by someone who is local who can do that from the for enterprise system so it is these types of opportunities that we look at where there can be a competitive nature where there would be and there's a process but the a76 circular we're simply saying we're going to make sure that there is not any legislation that's written that precludes the opportunity for the taxpayer to have a chance or competitive bid and that's really what we're here by the way it's good to see you and thank you for all that you do every day I think I try and say thank you but I mean that and this is what an independent looks like thank you very much for joining us today

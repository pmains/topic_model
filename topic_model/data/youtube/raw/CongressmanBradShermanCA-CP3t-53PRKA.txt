thank you the gentleman from Wisconsin talked to you about number of pages of regulations I practice tax law advised a lot of small businesses and this idea of number of pages of regulations is a great sound bite but has nothing to do with actually making it easier for businesses to transact business if you look at tax law thank god we've got long pages of regulations so we can find out what the answer is in the area of antitrust law the regulations are basically non-existent and so you go to a law library and you read hundreds of pages of court decisions and you still don't know what the answer is so the idea that more pages of business regulations means more problems for business is a great political sound bite but it's actually government agencies clarifying what the law means as to the tax rate I would point out that we don't have a value-added tax in this country which all those comparative countries do that there is no one who's put forth a plan to replace the revenue from a decline in the corporate income tax and that uh the one thing the majority party is suggested is eliminating the Earned Income Tax Credit to really sock it to families trying to make it on twenty and twenty-five thousand dollars a year there is of course a loss of manufacturing jobs that's not because we have regulations that clarify what congressional statutes mean that's because we've got really bad trade deals that Congress is ratified and or approved and I will point out that Congress is now geared up to use the chicane ur e of a lame duck session to approve a TPP deal that is terrible for America so terrible that you can't find a presidential candidate who doesn't who is willing to support it uh chairman Yellen you're going to be told you've been told in this room by many that rates are too low your balance sheet is too big people who say that are wrong America is underperforming our inflation rate is lower than your target and our labor participation rate is lower than everyone's target as to the size of your balance sheet I know that you focus on the effect it has on the economy as a whole but there's also the tens of billions of dollars that you turn over to the Treasury do you and your fellow fmoc members ever spend any time wondering whether Congress is going to have the money to provide a school lunch program a school breakfast program when you factor in how big your balance sheet should be do you envision hungry kids here in America and how the money you turn over to this Congress could be used to feed them so we are very focused on the dual mandate that Congress has given us namely full employment and price stability and the size of our balance sheet in the stance of monetary policy is all designed to promote those objectives I'm rather I would say the prodding but we're pleased to be able to turn over a hundred billion dollar checks but that is not what drives policy but I'm glad to be able peaking on behalf of being Congress that would otherwise have to cut cancer research or cut school lunches thank you for the hundred billion dollar checks well glee's do factor that the world's focus on brexit and it may be good or bad long term for the world we don't know that's a decision for Britain to make there uh there are some at the extreme or painting this is some immediate world calamity just want to ask a question about your schedule have you scheduled some sort of emergency meeting on Friday because you envision some great calamity happening the world on Thursday or is the British vote just one of the many things that you'll consider at the next regularly scheduled meeting well it is a risk that we're monitoring I've said that we will be watching closely to see what the vote is and what possible repercussions it might have and but you you haven't blocked off friday and saturday on your personal schedule for emergency meetings as if the hurricane is coming to envelop the entire world i know i haven't thank you time the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes the gentleman from California mr. Royce chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Jerry Yellin welcome I'm worried that the Federal Reserve has created a third pillar of monetary policy that of a stable and rising stock market and I I say that because then Chairman Bernanke

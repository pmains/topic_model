the senate battle over spending heating up democratic senator joe manchin says he prefers a plan closer to 1.5 trillion dollars not the 3.5 trillion dollar figure that his party is pushing so where is it all heading uh well let's ask republican senator roger marshall senator uh 1.5 trillion still not still not the proverbial drop in a bucket is it no no charles kill the bill right you know i'm just here at a town hall finishing up a town hall in olathe kansas and these people are fired up to kill this bill they realize it for what it is it's really five and a half trillion dollars plus another one or two on top of it charles this is going to be seven trillion dollars before it's all over with it's reckless spending it's going to lead to reckless taxing reckless inflation it's going to kill jobs and kill our economy this is a thriving economical community and they are against this legislation yeah i think uh most americans are intuitively because it's it's it goes against the ethos of the nation right there to pull yourself up by the bootstraps this effectively will turn us into a giant wall for a state like many of these lumbering giants in europe that look back on their glory days without any hope of ever resurrecting it and i think that's the decision people have to make now the question is do you have enough colleagues in the senate that maybe can stop this it seems like joe manchin's got a number okay so he's off uh maybe uh you know senator cinema maybe she'll stand her ground and also i'm reading more recently about the blue dog coalition which i thought was gone but apparently there's still three democrats in that as well yeah you're right charles i i do have hope uh in senator manchin and senator cinema they're both very uh strong people uh you wait and see and senator sinema is going to stand up and make a loud statement here she has a reputation as being a maverick i think a good maverick and she's going to speak her piece she realizes the people of arizona don't want their taxes raised like it's like it could happen and then over the house side it looks like they formed a circular firing squad and we just to make sure we stay out of their way let them keep shooting each other every day we slow this down there's a better chance it fails as we go back into our states and do these town halls and make sure america knows what's exactly in this legislation that it is the end of free enterprise capitalism it is a move towards socialism government-controlled socialism and nobody wants that economy yeah yeah and and we've heard senator cinema also uh speak out against just this the reconciliation process which it started it's getting a little bit lost but it goes against again you know the structure you know the checks and balances that the american public rely on so that there's never any tyranny of the majority uh particularly a very slim majority is that where you think she'll take her stand because i don't think it's just dollars and cents for her no i think it's way more than that i i think that she understands the importance of the filibuster as a senator mansion and really that's what this is the purpose of the filibuster is to protect the minority and make both parties work together so i think long term that they are that they need to to stand tall now they do represent their people i do think that they're listening in my private conversations with both of them they understand that stepped up bases would kill the family farm they understand that treating dividend income as ordinary income would kill so many businesses as well and increasing corporate taxes they understand is actually a tax on middle america so they get it and now like you're saying we need them both to stand tall before i let you go let me switch to the debt ceiling the white house released a memo yesterday saying if we hit that debt ceiling it's going to be armageddon uh we'll have a recession businesses slow down millions of people will lose their jobs they went on to say in this memo that it was it's been raised 80 times since 1960 and i thought i thought i started laughing i mean why have a ceiling if it's going to be raised 80 times isn't that isn't that doesn't that point to the problem here we've got the ceiling for a reason wasn't it put there so we control our impulses to overspend and to get into too much debt yeah you know charles what keeps me up late at night is our national debt i'm the proud grandfather of three and a half children right three grand grandchildren right now and when we're pushing our responsibilities on to them as well so i'm a hell no on raising the debt limit you can write that down i'm a hell no and any republican that crosses that line i i really i feel sorry for them i think the the message has been sent real loud and clear the democrats owned this they owned the the two trillion dollars they did on a partisan basis that now you want to add five seven trillion dollars more they own the debt ceiling it's all on them they've got the votes to do it through budget reconciliation this is on them senator i've got five grandchildren so i know exactly how you feel thank you so much it's always a pleasure talking with you yep the jewels in our crown thanks charles absolutely new storm system

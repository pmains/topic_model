hi i'm congressman donald payne jr and i'm proud to represent new jersey's 10th congressional district this february for the 39th year we come together as a nation to celebrate black history month throughout the month we honor the vast contributions of african americans we recognize the bravery of those who champion justice and equality in the face of tremendous adversity and we reflect on our triumphant past as we celebrate black history month and the important progress we made we also pledge to keep striving for the future of full justice and equality i will continue to safeguard and carry on the inspiring legacy of those before us including by fighting to uphold the fundamental right to vote although congress passed the voting rights act in 1965 50 years later african americans are still disproportionately victims of discriminatory voting laws 50 years after thousands marched from selma to montgomery for access to the ballot we pledge to carry on their work by strengthening voter rights so that all voices are heard as a nation we will grow when we accept that voter suppression is not just a racial or political problem but an american crisis we owe that to our nation and our future with that in mind join me in celebrating black history month by pledging to continue to fight for voting rights for all

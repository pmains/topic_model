congresswoman cat kamek the Republican from Florida joins me this morning congresswoman good morning to you listen we've we've heard from speaker McCarthy that cuts to Social Services are off the table so what is the White House doing good morning and happy Friday to you too you know I tell you that press office they are on Perpetual cleanup Duty I've said it before they almost need to hire Mr Clean as their press secretary because they seem to always go after the president and say oh no he never really meant to say that or that doesn't matter anymore listen we know that Republicans have been vocal about saying that cuts are off the table when it comes to Social Security and Medicare we've been very very vocal about that instead what we have is the president continually coming after Republicans and pushing this narrative that we're going to be going after seniors that couldn't be further from the truth and so not only did we call that out on uh the house floor during the state of confusion but we will continue to put that clip of him from 1975 where he proposed cuts to Social Security Medicare and veterans benefits and then reiterated in double tripled quadruple tripled down on it in 1995. now do I expect him to remember this no but I also don't expect him to remember what he had for breakfast this morning all right we're going to move on to the next one for you congresswoman State lawmakers in Florida voting overwhelmingly to give Governor Ron DeSantis new power over Disney's theme parks in the district around it are you in favor of this Crackdown by the governor on Disney yeah absolutely you know the issue of Special Districts has been a bit of a contentious one when you look at Disney having their own Police Department their own fire department they they essentially were running their own little fiefdom in in a lot of ways and exempt from that oversight that is really required so this is a way for us to come together uh move past it but with the certain safeguards that they need in place and I think if anything the last few years has shown us it's that Disney has taken a hard left turn and a lot of times they haven't really played by the rules so I think that the legislature is right in pushing forward with this and I think this is going to be good in the end for all parties involved all right we'll have to leave it there congresswoman thank you so much for joining us cat kamik uh republican from Florida thank you very much

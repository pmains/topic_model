where uh my friend and colleague from michigan was left off and i appreciate his his comments about being careful and making distinctions between the ccp and the people of china i think it was an excellent point and i appreciate the sentiments um uh the very decent sentiments of my of my friend i do want to just though point out that moral clarity is required in this discussion and sharp criticism of the ccp is not racist it is about policy and it is about foreign policy and i think clarity is really important and so miss shriver yesterday during the the meeting in alaska the chinese delegation attempted to paint the united states as as hypocritical for our directly raising a number of international concerns regarding the ccp and while i know the united states has gone through a very rough year and we have our own issues i did want to ask a series of questions that may highlight the differences uh the moral differences between the united states and china is the united states currently participating in an ethnic cleansing of its own population in state-run internment camps yes or no no no uh is the united states currently stealing intellectual property from companies doing business here and then giving that technology to our military yes or no certainly not government federal government sponsored is the united states jailing those speaking out in favor of democracy and human rights yes or no no no and and thank you and i want to highlight these differences for when we're talking about our way forward in the indo-pacific we must be clear to our partners and allies uh and and this must be a moral clarity of who china is and what behavior they engage in and uh and the moral superiority frankly of the the western uh the western approach and the the approach of an open free and democratic society versus a closed communist police state that is the ccp and i do not believe that that is racist rhetoric that is that is a rhetoric about um the challenges that we confront and it's it's about being clear-eyed let me um ask mr mr mr haas a question about emerging technologies 5g 6g and protecting american technology the u.s china economic security review commission is a great resource for the congress uh and for policymakers and uh in speaking to some of these just outstanding experts on our uh on our complicated relationship with china it's been said that um we need to be putting uh higher walls around fewer things um and especially when when it comes to protecting american technology in the face of decoupling how can congress partner with industry in the united states and in allied and partner countries to protect necessary critical technologies uh that's exactly right by the way congressman we higher walls around fewer things scalpel not not not sledgehammer uh i think we ought to the first thing is to identify where what those what those technologies are what are the things most likely to be drivers and make a difference in the commercial economy in the intelligence business in the military and those are the ones we have to think about funding not just domestically but one of the things congress do could also is facilitate joint projects with the partners and allies that we that we spend so much time talking about in the course of this uh in the course of this hearing um let me quickly uh talk about belton road encountering belton road follow up on mr burchett's line of questioning to any of our witnesses um how can we more effectively use the development finance corporation and the export-import bank in countering belton road sir i think this is a very important tool that is available to the to the u.s i wouldn't i wouldn't believe necessarily that what the americans have to offer is necessarily what the developing world wants because those those loans and grants come with condition political conditionalities that many of those countries don't want to accept in terms of transparency rule of law etc and this is where the chinese way of doing things the train the the chinese government's way of doing things is a challenge because they do not offer any political conditionality to those countries in terms of democratization or anything else so this is really the crux of the matter because there are two offers there that are very different and provided alternative is very important at the same time i think there's other ways in addition to money and funding that can be helpful like skills and some sort of expertise in demonstrating that perhaps chinese projects are not going to be sustainable in the long run i think this is also an efficient way of coping with the bri thank you dr barbara obviously my time has expired i hope someone on the panel will ask about taiwan accession to the united nations as a deterrent to prc aggression and i obviously can't ask that question now but i invite someone else to and i yield back great thanks let me now recognize

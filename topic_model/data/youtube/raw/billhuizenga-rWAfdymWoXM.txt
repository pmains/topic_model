have we're seeing your life expectancy go up dramatically you know i'm talking to my dentist he says look we're trying we're trying to get kids to eat the last 100 years why because that's the life expectancy for these kids you know 78.2 years uh 78.2 years now uh and it's going nowhere but uh we're getting we are going up with that so we are we're having these converging lines here and so we've got to start talking about retirement ages and we've got to start talking about whether uh you know warren buffett really needs to collect a social security check we need to have some of those honest conversations and i'm prepared to do that i think the vast majority of my certainly my freshman colleagues that are prepared to do that uh what's getting in the way of a lot of the sort of the dc rhetoric uh of what we're dealing with so that that is sort of the the table as we are as we're being set and uh um i thought i'd at least give you some grain of hope somebody was asking about hope uh here so let me yeah and it's it's uh we'll see what uh we'll see what's going to come out of this but this is from eric cantor it was that about not quite an hour ago i got this i want to take a minute and update you on my ongoing discussions with the vice president in the senate regarding deficit reduction measures that must be passed if congress has to raise the deadline uh as the announcement boehner has indicated that any increase in the debt limit ought to be accompanied by at least a company that commensurate reduction in the deficit while discussions are still ongoing i'm cautiously optimistic we can find sufficient common ground with the administration to enhance spending cuts that need the goal outlined by the speaker president speaker and harry reid all expressed their support for the work of the bible and their optimism for the cuts and reforms we hope to produce i don't know if they're going to come up with something that that i'm going to ultimately be able to support i had some of you may have heard again npr saturday with scott simon uh you know he he asked me um could you see yourself voting uh to not raise the debt ceiling and my answer was yes um and my concern is and i even talked to holland sentinel editorial board this morning they had sort of a similar question is my concern is why would we just continue to feed a system at a higher level but not change how we're doing the spending not change how we are how we're not changing how we are curbing and and and rotating this trajectory spending but yeah we we are on the ss badger we are not on a boston whaler here yeah it's not like you turn the wheel and you're going to flip it around we can't get into this overnight we're not going to get out of this overnight the most conservative budget that has been proposed which i voted for the republican study committee budget was a very aggressive budget uh it brought balance i think it was nine years john you remember rsc budget yeah it was nine or ten years all right and it was i mean it was it was pretty dramatic all right i thought i needed to put my vote where my mouth was and and vote for them um but even even that budget sees an increase in that ceiling for a while and some deficit spending um because again we're we're paying for some of the sins of the past uh and we're we're going to have to take some time to work out at this thing so so that that's kind of where we're at i know you're issuing um and i'm sure you've had people from wall street people who are not democrats tell you that especially who here trusts wall street right i mean you're so scared yeah i mean okay you guys are trying to water down all this stuff the debt limit is not something to mess around with your baby you're essentially holding the economy in the united states hostage i mean you may as well just add on everything else so those are failures but have president will often resign here's here's how i view that here's how i do that all right because you're right it's that teenager that took mom's credit card opened up here's the thing though why why would we then take a slap on the wrist and say johnny don't do that again you can keep the credit card by the way and oh we're not going to be monitoring what you're spending it oh you're not changing how you are spending that's the problem here we are not fundamentally changing how we are spending that so so again i am i am all for i am all for making sure that we that we take care of our obligations for the sins of the past i'm trying to make sure that we are not committing sins in the future as well and that is that is going to be our problem so are we going to be able to find a way to get there we we can't there's a possibility i'm not i'm not the debt limit the debt limit is the debt limit is absolutely significant however you know he's he's he's just saying that we need to raise the debt limit and that that you know we need to do that no that's not quite what he's saying i i think that's the logical conclusion but that's not what he's saying and but but okay but you look at you look at if we don't get our spending under control all right i'm i sit on the financial services committee i'm on the international monetary policy committee uh you look at what's happening in portugal and portugal they had a couple of months ago they had a prime minister resigned why because they couldn't get an austerity budget through over the weekend they elected a a government that finally said that they're going to do that why because there's been a tremendous pressure put on by the european central bank bank ecb all right who's driving that bus or the germans and the french i never thought i'd be listening to the french and saying yeah you're right but they are actually driving that home you look at what's happening in greece all right they have simply not been able to get get their fiscal spending under control has not happened a two-year bond in germany any guesses to what that interest rate is two percent two-year bond in greece oh twenty percent that could be outrageous try twenty-five percent right but they're not going to have the money to pay it back because they can't get their fiscal house in work right so so i i i am saying with that there's a there are days of reckoning and that we need to make sure that we are changing our behavior and i'm not i'm not just interested in saying here you go we're not going to change behavior we're just going to go ahead so we've got a number of other people that want to move on to some some other things that uh that that we've got to have uh that we gotta deal with um but i'll leave with this this wasn't this wasn't a wall street type this is a this was a guy here locally uh who also follows this very very closely and he said he said bill you guys have got to take care of this because it and it's not it's not going to be easy it's going to be painful you have to take care of this because if you don't the marketplace will and the marketplace will impose far more painful uh parameters than anything you guys are going to need and that's that is part of what they're seeing with greece because they don't believe because their debt to in their debt to gdp ratio has grown so out of whack they aren't going to be able to service that debt we have that we have cash that comes in that could cover our debts the question is would you would be we would be willing to then make the types of cuts in the programs that we need to have to service that debt and that's and as well and that's what we're showing here right now so okay um we've got uh i know tom on specifics so we'll get to tom's on a lot of what we're proposing and what we're talking about but i talked a little bit about short term medium term long term right we touched on the long term we're going to have to deal with medicare medicaid uh and social security as as it's moving forward and again that's going to be significant for my generation military is uh huge and it's not off the table i will tell you that some of the leading proponents within my caucus of the 87 of us freshmen and republicans 22 including one guy who's still flying for the air force as a reserve uh there's 22 uh former military people most of them were either lieutenant colonel or above these are the guys that make it happen i mean lieutenant colonel's colonels they're the ones that are you know running the brigades running the battalions they're they're running in companies um and they are some of the first ones at the microphone saying we've got to do better we've got to be more efficient i voted against the second engine for the f-35 some of you at the first meeting they've heard me talk a little bit about this this was uh uh it was a challenging one because there's a there's a company in muskegon that's making parts for it uh ge is a johnson genie there's about 300 people that have jobs and i had to call the which i did before i voted against them i called the uh the president of the brand and told him what i was going to be doing uh it was a rather short and robust described conversation that we had um but we've got to look at everything we have to look at everything and and and that's it we're going to talk about the spending side and i want to i'll talk about i'll talk about the uh the tax increase side as well

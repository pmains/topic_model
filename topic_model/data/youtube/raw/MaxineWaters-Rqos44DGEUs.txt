waters i'm joined this morning by my guest co-host carrie elleveld the chief washington correspondent for the advocate magazine she's got a question yeah representative waters i'm just wondering there's reports out of the senate finance committee today that they may be dropping the public option in their negotiations do you think that's going to sell in the house no as a matter of fact that's a kill for sure for the progressives uh for the majority i think of our members a public option is a compromise uh we wanted single-payer as you know and we backed off because they said that that was going to be impossible to do again they brought up the more conservative elements etc etc and so we will not support any bill that does not have public option in it congresswoman waters

thank you for coming we appreciate appreciate your time and what you are doing here today is something that's very important I got to tell you it's been a long time since I've been in here but this is not my first time here my dad who is a disabled world war two veteran so the 460 first bond group this is his home post as DAV post and it's good to be here I was hoping oh there he is hi dad dad mom made it I'm glad that glad they did and let's uh I want tell mama how much time did you hang out in here enough yeah yeah yeah but what what we are doing here today is I think utmost importance this is this is a series of generations that are slipping away from us and we need to make sure that we preserve those stories and to make sure that we're setting the precedent to save those stories moving forward not just for World War Two and from Korea now we need to make sure it's Vietnam we need to make sure it's the first Gulf conflict this current conflict as we know that in many ways that's a way for our veterans to also deal with the experiences that they went through being able to ship and we're we're thrilled we've got some friends right here that that are here because they love history and seeing the kids it seems officer family come out and experience this is it's very important and we've got to make sure that we do that for those future generations so that they can learn as well so with that appreciate this we're going to have a little line or pass along to mr. Jim smither who's from grand valley who's going to give us a little bit about introduction about the visitors history project and how we kind of I kind of backed into this in a way a number of years ago i sat on the board of film school in Grand Rapids called couple Academy and decided to take to cruise to a reunion that Dad had washington d.c DC shortly after the world war two memorial opened up and it was it was a great experience not only for me and for my family to capture dad's story but to also offer this up to a number of other veterans who had never done anything like this and so often the colonel sickle I'm talking about this little earlier you've got families and including in my own family I have some cousins who really know very little about my uncle who served in the Philip in Southeast Asia this is uncle Bernie mom I Chris and Dave they they know all they got us a couple of photographs they don't know where he served they don't know what he did and in talking to my cousin back a while ago it was like that's my biggest regret uncle Bernie's gone they don't have the the documentation they're the stories that what had happened and so thrilled that we were able to get dad's stories and then offer it up to two i think it was 17 other guys we gave him an hour to sit down with a professional crew and it was was a great experience and we're wanting to make sure that we can do anything that we can from my office to to help veterans history project help Grand Valley and I know there's some other schools that are doing this as well but grand Valley's really taken lead on on this and to work with the Library of Congress so with that excellent alright thank you it's pleasure to be here today i noticed a few familiar faces out here there are some people in the room who have already been interviewed for the project and thank you for that explain a little bit about how the project works the basic idea of it is just to record the stories of as many individual veterans as possible in part simply to create a more complete record that we would ever have otherwise it does but beyond that it does a lot of things for the veterans for their families that's a lot to broaden our understanding of the history and it also gives a certain kind of affirmation back to the veterans of people actually care about what they experienced and went through on behalf of all the rest of us then you think about it today most people don't go in the military certainly people of my generation that was born 1961 maybe Vietnam was over army was downsized and military is pretty darn unpopular after Vietnam so you didn't go there so you didn't really know anything at all about what it was like to be a soldier or much of anything else and so by recording these stories you get a much in seeing people tell story of what it was like to be in boot camp in 1942 or and you know Afghanistan a year ago it does a lot to promote understanding of things uh the library Congress started the veterans history project on national basis basically 10 years ago the idea initially catch up with a world war two guys while we fill it but the project covers everything since then at Rand valid you talked to people you know from the different Wars and we're in the military in between Wars we also talked to civilians with stories to tell that help us better understand the wartime experience one of our side projects right now is interviewing professional image baseball players so the limit of a league of their own moving so forth because that need was created when minor league baseball shut down during World War Two and mr. Wrigley people like that wanted to make sure that maintains of interest and the leap took off in total 1954 and there were times teams Kalamazoo in Muskegon and certainly in Grand Rapids where he had the chicks and so we've the whole string of interviews with them I have talked to people who were in the South Vietnamese Army some of their experiences were like so we cover a lot of things a few basic things to be aware of here with the interview process and the first one is it's not any kind of the third degree no one's going afternoon trying to move out all the dirty facts they can and so forth in fact we tell people go ahead if the other stuff you don't want to talk about or cannot talk about and I've interviewed people to blacked out all their dominant experiences that's fine whatever you can't is better than we had when you started that pretty much is up to you I have guys who really don't want to talk about what they did it on leave in one place or another and authorities for fear than 60 years later their mother might find out yeah so yeah but that's pretty much open as far as vacuums we do interviews a variety of ways we can come to your home and just do the interview right there but you can bring people into a TV studio and do shoots there either way you'll get a copy of the interview when you're done you can share the family and then copy for yourselves the interview is once they're conducted then go into our archive at Grand Valley and right now you can go on to our website and few hundreds of interviews I have my students make the tail outlines and full transcripts of each interview so researchers can search those databases and find whatever they want to buy so it means that people anywhere in the world who want to research a unit you served in or actions of a place that you went to they can find you they can find your story and see you telling about it so it's really not a remarkable thing that we have been doing but ultimately it depends upon the willingness of individual veterans to come forward and to tell their stories so those of you who've done it already thank you and for the rest of you where veterans here please think seriously about signing up and doing this we make it as easy for you as possible and it costs you by the way no money and in a room that probably has some judgment in it i think i should say that up front that sort of the basics of how the project works and now all kind of it gives the floor back filter and we can proceed great thank you Jimin come into my office as we were starting to talk about this and and we kind of started this notion okay we got to spread this work somehow or another we got to get this out and I appreciate your time your interest in really wanting to make this happen that we're hoping to do this not just down here but kind of throughout the district capture that so

thank you director abazad director ray we spoke march 2nd in the judiciary committee about the extent of violence in communities across the country the alarming increase in violent crime particularly from 2019 to 2020 also from 2020 until this year city of atlanta 113 homicides this year that's a 16 increase from last year a 64 increase from 2019 georgians are deeply concerned by the intensity of violence in our communities when we spoke in march you said you were going to work to refine your assessments of the factors driving this increase in violent crime and violence across the united states what are your conclusions so i do think uh as much as it's a phenomenon in in our home state of georgia it is also in other parts of the country as well and while there might be variations from city to city i think there's a number of factors that contribute to it i think the the impact of covid cannot be uh underestimated whether it's trial backlogs early inmate releases unemployment etc you have more juveniles committing violent crime you have certain prosecution practices and decreased sentences which put recidivists back out on the street more readily and that adds to its challenge you also have the prevalence of firearms including interstate trafficking by that i mean firearms in the hands of those who are prohibited legally prohibited from from having them so all those factors together create a combustible mix i would add into that a number of police departments our close partners that we work with every day who have an incredibly challenging job are experiencing recruiting challenges and attrition that is in early retirement uh and that in turn uh adds to it so you put no one factor by itself but you put all those things together and that's part of why you're seeing i think the increase in homicides you're also seeing increases in carjackings and other violent crimes not just in atlanta not just in georgia but in cities all over the country and it's something that i suspect every member of this committee hears about from its constituents with increasing frequency for good reason thank you director ray

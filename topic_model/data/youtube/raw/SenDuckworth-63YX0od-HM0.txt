while I do appreciate this committee's consideration of issues at the intersection of extremism and social media many I think would agree that today's hearing is another data point in a long history of congressional hand-wringing on gun violence according to the gun violence archive since 2019 began 260 days ago we have witnessed 318 mass shootings in the u.s. more than one per day mass shootings are those in which at least four people are shot excluding the shooter after 20 children six adults and the shooter lost their lives at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012 many elected officials including myself declared an end to congressional inaction no more we said but since that day our nation has endured 2226 mass shootings think about that number for a minute but here we are not focused on ways to stop gun violence but rather the scourge of social media I'm not going to say that there's no connection but every other country on the planet has social media video games online harassment hate groups crime and mental health issues but they don't have mass shootings like we do nothing highlights the absurdity of Congress's inability to solve the gun violence crisis then seeing 318 mass shootings in 260 days and then holding out hearing on extremism in social media miss Baker to mr. pickels this is a chart from the Digital Marketing Institute that according to their website highlights to average number of hours that social media users spend on platforms like Facebook and Twitter as you will see the United States in the u.s. our users are relatively middle of the pack when it comes to time spent online my question to you both is this do you agree that Americans use of social media is not especially unique on a per capita basis in other words are you aware specific trends on your platforms to explain the amount of gun violence in the United States introductory and this won't come out of your time I do sort of explain to us because some of us can't see the detail this is how much time average number of hours that social media users spend using social media each day via any device and the arrow points to the United States the highest is the Philippines the lowest is Japan the US is right in the middle so American users and look I've got a four and a half year old and I have an 18 month old when I get home says iPhone iPhone and she's on it she knows how to select YouTube kids on my phone and she knows how to go right to which she wants to watch okay so I'm just as concerned but the United States in terms of social media usage would you both agree is somewhere in the middle of the pack compared to the rest of the world yes senator according to the study which I'm not more familiar with yes in other words are you aware either one of you aware of specific trends on your platforms to explain the amount of gun violence in the United States no I think your study reflects our view about 80 percent of our users are outside the United States and so I think I think you all right your image speaks for itself thank you mr. Selim you brought up the road that video games can play an online hate and harassment I agree with you that any dissemination of hate must be addressed regardless of the platform used but if a meaningful connection between video games and gun violence exists you think that the widespread use of video games in Japan and South Korea would reflect that connection correct if you look at this chart I think there's something to be said for the availability of guns in the u.s. if you look in the amount of the amount of time that the folks in Japan and South Korea spend on on video games is far greater than anywhere else where we're third and yet if you look at the number instance of gun violence and gun deaths for every 100,000 people 2017 here's the u.s. but we're not the biggest users of video games would this be accurate senator thank you for your question I have not read this specific study but I do have one day at a point if I made it to share with you for just a moment according to an ADL report looking at extremist related murders and homicides over the past decade our research shows that seven three percent of extremists related murders and homicides were in fact committed with firearms so to the extent that that you're making the point that extremists with weapons results in violence and homicide we have the data that backs that point out thank you as we're reminded daily the world is full of individuals who use social media platforms to disparage others cast false equivalencies and question facts some will use the unanimity of online platforms to spread hate but our use of social media video games and other variables does little to explain the two hundred and 2226 mass shootings since Sandy Hook the Internet has emboldened and empowered hate by allowing individuals to develop online communities and share their warped ideas but it is our weak gun laws here in the US that allows that hate to become lethal there's a clear and undeniable connection between the number of guns in the United States and the number of gun deaths in our community look at this platform this is the number of guns for 400 people and this is a number of gun related deaths for 100,000 people we are up here here's the rest of the world some of whom use more social media than we do some whom actually engage in more video games than we do we are saturated in weaponry that was designed for war but is made available to nearly edit anyone who attends a local gun show the Dayton shooter had a hundred round drum I didn't have a hundred round round drum when I served in Iraq we didn't send Marines into Fallujah 100 round drums but yet you can buy them at gun shows look 90% of Americans agree that Congress should expand background checks and red flag laws 60% of Americans agree that banning high-capacity ammunition clips is what we need to do this is not controversial it is well past time that leader McConnell brings HR 8 to the house the House passed bipartisan background checks Act to the Senate floor for a vote I hope leader McConnell will also allow votes on to keep Americans safe act the extreme risk Protection Act that is armed hate act and a domestic terrorism Prevention Act each of these bills will keep our children and our neighbors safer I hope my Republican colleagues will join in these bipartisan efforts thank you and I yield back and

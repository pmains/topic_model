you've been doing the vx90 is that right you've got a great face from radio that's that that's me well you know what greg welcome back well thanks it's good beer and you look you look healthy and that's that's good all right well let's let's get right to it let's talk about uh the drone strikes that have taken place about 55 people in southern yemen uh apparently killed and maybe one of them uh al-qaeda's top bomb maker which would be used but huge but you haven't confirmed that yet it's not confirmed but why is this so important aqap uh al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula is probably the biggest excuse me external threat to the homeland that exists this is the group that did inspire magazine and inspired boston bombers it's the same group that is building bombs to get through metal detectors in our airports the bomb maker al assyri the premier al-qaeda bomb maker in the world so if we were able to take him out that would be hugely significant in terms of protecting the homeland i'd rather take the threat out there than have that threat come into the united states and part of my mission is to keep these threats outside the united states and so i think this could be a big win for both the united states uh in the free world when would we know i mean we thought uh you know osama bin laden was that for a long time it turns out he wasn't um but will we ever know i mean is there a way to determine whether yeah i think i think if we um it will come out eventually if we in fact got him uh initial reporting was it was mainly recruits that were taken out but if top leadership was taken out remember the guy that heads up this group uh why he she's his name is a number two in the organization next to zawahiri so he's he was bin laden's lieutenant he's number two in al-qaeda uh again aqap the arabian peninsula is the biggest threat to western europe and the united states and he saw that video where they came out very brazenly right kind of like how bin laden did a decade ago and so we're very concerned every time i get these threat briefings one of the first topics we talk about is what is aqap doing what is the threat coming out of there what is a bomb maker what kind of bombs is he trying to develop and syria and there's a nexus between aqap and syria and the fighter rebel forces in syria and al-qaeda factions training in syria both of those together as chairman of homeland security they say what keeps you up at night uh it's really these two scenarios in terms of any of these guys getting into the united states and um and and you know lighting bombs right we are talking with texas congressman mike mccall uh he is also of course chairman of the house committee on homeland security i got to do a quick traffic and weather check and i'm going to come back and i want to talk about the inspector general uh that was just uh kind of kicked to the curb here what he may have been doing i noticed before uh you became chairman and also the bill that you have sponsored as it has to do with exporting crude and natural gas let's take a look at traffic at weather

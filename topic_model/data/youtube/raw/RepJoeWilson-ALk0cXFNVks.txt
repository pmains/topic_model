NEXT. WELL, MY NEXT GUEST IS WATCHING  THE SITUATION IN TUNISIA VERY  CLOSELY. U.S. REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JOE  WILSON IS URGING THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION TO PUBLICLY  CONDEMN WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A  POWER GRAB. WILSON WROTE A LETTER, WHICH I  HAVE HERE IN MY HAND, TO  SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY  BLINKEN, SAYING WHILE THE WHITE  HOUSE HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN,  UNFORTUNATELY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS YET TO ISSUE A CLEAR  STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT'S SIDE,  REFUSING TO ACT IN TUNISIA WILL  LEAD TO DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES WHICH WILL NOT ONLY DESTABILIZE  TUNISIA BUT ALSO LEAD TO FURTHER DESTABILIZATION OF NORTH AFRICA. REPRESENTATIVE WILSON JOINS ME  NOW FROM WASHINGTON. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. JOE BIDEN DID GIVE A MUTED  RESPONSE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN  TUNISIA. SECRETARY BLINKEN DID USE  STRONGER WORDS IN A PHONE CALL  WITH PRESIDENT SAEED SAYING HE  URGED HIM TO TAKE ACTION THAT  WOULD RETURN TO THE COUNTRY TO A DEMOCRATIC PART. YOU WENT ON TO SAY, TUNISIA'S  SUCCESS HAS BEEN A BEACON OF  HOPE, EXEMPLIFYING THAT  DEMOCRACY RULE OF LAW AND OPEN  MARKETS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE  REGION. BUT, SIR, ACTUALLY IT HASN'T. THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY HAS BEEN  SUFFERING FOR YEARS. MANY TUNISIANS LIVE IN POVERTY,  CALLED A DEMOCRATIC BEACON OF  HOPE. YOU MUST CONCEDE THIS IS MORE A  MIRAGE THAN A REALITY. >> NO, NO, HEY. AND YOU WERE THERE FOR THE ARAB  SPRING, 2011. TO SEE THE INSPIRATION OF THE  PEOPLE OF TUNISIA TO PROMOTE  DEMOCRACY. AND WE KNOW THAT IT WILL TAKE  TIME. AND THEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. BUT I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THERE TWO YEARS AGO. IT WAS SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO ME TO SEE THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE OF  TUNISIA, TO SEE THE DEMOCRATIC  PROCESSES OF SO MANY POLITICAL  PARTIES, MAYBE TOO MANY. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE WAS PEOPLE  ARE INVOLVED. SO, IT'S SO DISAPOINTING. AND THIS IS BIPARTISAN, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, ALSO BICAMERAL. U.S. HOUSE, U.S. SENATE. WE ARE APPALLED AT THE COUP  D'ETAT ON SUNDAY. WE WANT THE BEST FOR THE PEOPLE  OF TUNISIA, AND IT'S NOT THROUGH AN AUTHORITARIAN RULE. SO, THEY NEED TO RETURN TO THE  PRESIDENCY, THE PRIME MINISTER,  THE PARLIAMENT. AND SADLY, SAEED, THE  DETERIORATION IS EVEN CLEARER  NOW. HE HAD INDICATED 30 DAYS. THEN HE CHANGED AND SAID, WELL,  MULTIPLE 30 DAYS. WE'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE FROM  DICTATORS. ADDITIONALLY THE ARREST OF A  PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE ARREST OF  NEWS MEDIA, THE CLOSING OF NEWS  MEDIA TO DENY THE PEOPLE OF  TUNISIA TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. SO, MEMBER OF CONGRESS ARE VERY  CONCERNED, AND WE LOOK FORWARD  TO WORKING WITH SECRETARY  BLI BLINKEN, WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. AND HEY, THINGS CAN BE DONE. WITH THE MILLENNIAL CHALLENGE  FUNDING, THIS SHOULD BE IN  QUESTION BECAUSE IT WAS INTENDED TO PROMOTE FREEDOM AND  DEMOCRACY, NOT AN AUTHORITARIAN  RULE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE CAN BE  SANCTIONS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS. >> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, YOU  GAVE SECRETARY BLINKEN UNTIL  FRIDAY AUGUST 13th TO RESPOND TO YOUR LETTER. YOU HAVE SEEN HIS SLIGHTLY MORE  ROBUST RESPONSE THAN THE  PRESIDENT'S TO WHAT IS GOING ON. WHAT MORE IS IT SPECIFICALLY  THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR AND SEE  FROM ANTONY BLINKEN? >> WELL, I'D LIKE TO, AGAIN, TO  SEE THE ADMINISTRATION TAKE A  FIRM STAND BECAUSE WE SEE  DEMOCRACY UNDER THREAT. PRESIDENT BIDEN PROMISED IN HIS  INAUGURAL ADDRESS TO PROMOTE  DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD. AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S  BENEFICIAL TO THE PEOPLE OF  COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND THEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S  BENEFICIAL TO AMERICA AND  AMERICAN FAMILIES AND REDUCES  THREATS TO AMERICAN FAMILIES. BUT, HEY, WE WANT THE BEST FOR  THE PEOPLE OF TUNISIA. AND IT'S NOT BEING DONE BY AN  AUTHORITARIAN RULE. IN FACT, THIS IS FOLLOWING THE  PATTERN OF VENEZUELA, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES IN THE  HEMISPHERE. BUT WITH SOCIALIST POLICIES,  WITH AUTHORITARIAN RULE, NOW  THERE ARE SHORTAGES, OBVIOUSLY,  OF ITEMS. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAD TO FLEE  THE COUNTRY. AND THAT MODEL SHOULD NOT BE  REPEATED IN TUNISIA. >> THE LAST TIME THE U.S. GOT  INVOLVED IN A MIDDLE EASTERN  COUNTRY'S POLITICAL INNER  WORKINGS LIKE THIS WAS THE VERY  CON CONFUSED RESPONSE BY THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION. THE AFTERMATH WAS BRUTAL AS WAS  THE AFTERMATH OF 2011 IN LIBYA  WHEN THE U.S. ASSISTED IN -- GOT INVOLVED IN THE NATO COALITION'S ACTIVITIES THERE. JOE BIDEN HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WISHES TO REDUCE THE U.S.  FOOTPRINT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND WIDER REGIONS DURING HIS  PRESIDENCY. THE U.S.'S LEGACY IS TAINTED, IS IT NOT, BY ITS OFTEN CHAOTIC  INVOLVEMENT IN THIS REGION? >> WELL, I WOULD DISAGREE. I HAVE VISITED ALL THE PERSIAN  GULF STATES TO SEE THESE  COUNTRIES OF EXTRAORDINARY  DEVELOPMENT. MY VISIT TO JORDAN, TO MOROCCO,  TO -- I'VE HAD WONDERFUL -- TO  SEE PERSONALLY. BUT TO SEE THE POSITIVE  INFLUENCE THE UNITED STATES HAS  HAD -- THE LIBERATION OF KUWAIT, THE LIBERATION OF IRAQ. WE HAD THE PRIME MINISTER OF  IRAQ IN WASHINGTON YESTERDAY. TOTALLY UNIMAGINABLE TO GO FROM  A SADISTIC TOTALITARIAN TO THE  LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT TODAY. >> HANG ON A MINUTE, SIR. LET ME JUST STOP YOU THERE FOR  ONE SECOND BECAUSE THERE ARE  MANY CRITICISMS AND CONCERNS  ABOUT THE LEAK TOWARDS  AUTHORITARIANISM IN IRAQ AGAIN. BUT THIS IS A SHOW THAT'S BASED  IN THE GULF. IT'S BASED IN ABU DHABI, IN THE  UAE, WHICH IS FORECASTING FROM  LONDON TODAY. SO, THIS SHOWS BETTER THAN MOST  WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT REGION  AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING AROUND  THE MIDDLE EAST, NORTH AFRICA  AND THE GULF, WHICH I THINK IS  CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT SITUATION. FOLLOWING PRESIDENT SAEED'S  ACTIONS, SIR, THERE HAVE BEEN  PROTESTS BOTH IN SUPPORT AND  OPPOSITION TO HIS ACTIONS. AND HIS SUPPORTERS SAY THAT  ACTUALLY THE WESTERN TERM FOR  DEMOCRACY DOESN'T REALLY WORK  FOR THEM. AND THEY ARE QUITE HAPPY  SUPPORTING A LEADER WHO THEY  BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING EVEN  IF THAT MEANS DOING SOMETHING  UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO GET THERE. THOSE ARE THE SUPPORTERS OF THE  PRESIDENT --  >> NO, NO. >> HANG ON. NO, NO, WE KNOW THOSE SUPPORTERS EXIST. I'M JUST PUTTING THAT TO YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? >> I THINK OF MARGARET THATCHER. SHE SAID SOCIALISM WILL WORK  UNTIL YOU'RE OUT OF PEOPLE'S  MONEY. BACK TO THE MIDDLE EAST, ABU  DHABI, UAE, HOW INCREDIBLE,  BAHRAIN, SUDAN. WE'VE HAD A LEVEL OF STABILITY  UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,  AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT RETURN  TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. AND PARTICULARLY, HEY, THINK OF  THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  VICTIMIZED IN SYRIA, THE  MILLIONS WHO HAVE HAD TO FLEE TO TURKEY, TO JORDAN. AND HEY, THE INSTABILITY OF  LEBANON. >> WITH RESPECT, SIR, I THINK  WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE  SITUATION IN TUNISIA AND YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT, AS MANY DO, THE  SORT OF BEACON OF DEMOCRACY AND  YOU TALK ABOUT THE GULF STATES  WHERE THERE IS NOBODY THERE IN  LEADERSHIP SUGGESTING THEY ARE  RUNNING DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. I THINK THERE'S A DISCONNECT  HERE. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS. I'VE READ YOUR LETTER. I CAN SEE YOUR APPEAL TO THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. HOW INVOLVED DO YOU WANT TO SEE  THE U.S. IN THE MIDDLE EAST,  NORTH AFRICA AND WIDER REGION  GOING FORWARD? ARE YOU AN ADVOCATE OF  SIGNIFICANT ACTION BY THE U.S.  IN THAT REGION? >> HEY, LET'S -- HEY, PUT IT  HISTORICALLY. WE'VE HAD A GREAT INTEREST IN  NORTH AFRICA SINCE THE LATE  1700s. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY DURING WORLD  WAR II TO LIBERATE NORTH AFRICA  FROM GERMAN-ITALIAN OCCUPATION. SO, THIS IS NOT NEW. BUT EVEN BETTER, THERE SHOULD BE HOPE FOR THE PEOPLE OF TUNISIA. AND WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT. AND IF IT REQUIRES STRONG ACTION OF LIMITING, OF FUNDING, OF  PROVIDING FOR ITS SANCTIONS  AGAINST PERSONS WHO ARE  COMPLICIT IN OVERTURNING A  CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, AND  THEN BACK TO THE PERSIAN GULF  STATES. THESE ARE MONARCHIES --  CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHIES AND  PERPETUAL EVOLUTION IN A VERY  POSITIVE WAY. THE LEADERSHIP OF ALL THE  COUNTRIES I VISITED FROM QATAR  TO KUWAIT, BAHRAIN, GOLLY, THESE ARE POSITIVE PERSO

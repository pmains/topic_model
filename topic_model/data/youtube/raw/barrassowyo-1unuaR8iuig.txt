[Music] all right Joe Biden's got all kinds of plants to refill the Strategic petroleum Reserve which she has decimated killed our national security but Republicans are calling it highway robbery here to talk about it nobody knows this story better than Senator John barrasso of Wyoming Senate GOP conference chair head of the energy committee uh Miss Russo as always Center welcome back highway robbery you all are calling it well all right I mean take a look at this situation I was in a high school the other day first kid asking a question Cody Wyoming why are gas prices so high and every American could ask that question because we're all suffering under high gas prices High grocery prices of trying to afford to heat our homes and we know the reason behind it and it's the policies of this Administration day number one Joe Biden surrendered our energy Independence to the the radical left wing of his party the American people have been paying the price ever since every Democrat signed on in the house and in the Senate to those Reckless policies and that's why they all need to be thrown out come November 8th so this here we are this is what the president is doing now because he knows Republicans are soaring and the Democrats are hemorrhaging he's looking for a Band-Aid that he can put on this big gaping wound the Democrats have so he turns to the Strategic petroleum Reserve which Larry that's there for a national energy crisis not for Democrat election crisis but that's how he's using it the American people don't want to see this is an emergency supply what happens in a true emergency when it's drawn down to next to nothing by the way San Andreas I let the record show I have been to Cody Wyoming on two separate occasions I have been there and so is my wife Judy but I won't go deep into it but I have been there I've even walked down the Main Street anyway what I was wondering was here's uh here's um President Biden talking about buying back this Pro refilling it at roughly 70 a barrel first of all he doesn't know he can get 70 a barrel because OPEC plus wants a hundred dollars a barrel but memories are short wasn't there a time a few years ago when President Trump wanted to buy back strategic petroleum at about 20 or 24 dollars a barrel and the Democratic party stopped him huh what's up with that well you're absolutely right that this president has released more oil from the Strategic petroleum Reserve in less than a year than all the previous presidents of the United States combined and the problem with this desperate measure is it's temporary it's not going to work you might be a little decrease in price for a while but you're ultimately going to have to refill it we wanted to top it off during the Trump Administration between 20 and 30 dollars a barrel Chuck Schumer and the Democrats said no that's the time to refill the Strategic petroleum Reserve when energy costs and prices are low now Joe Biden wants to do it when Energy prices are high no wonder this guy isn't people don't have any confidence in him as the president he's in way over his head doesn't understand the economics of the matter the American people are suffering people understand what we want affordable energy available reliable energy we need to unleash American Energy the way to to refill this strategic preserve Reserve is to produce more American Energy but remember Democrats love these high energy prices because they think it's going to force people to buy electric vehicles it is a religion for them Larry that's why all these Democrats who continue to prop up this president have to be removed come November 8th you know just the last thought Senator Ambassador I mean it's really something the way Chuck Schumer a couple years ago said twenty dollars a barrel to to refills fro was a giveaway to all companies but now Biden is going to do it at 70. but you know what epox on both thoughts because the Arabs if we don't produce more as you have suggested your whole career and now if we don't produce more it'll be a hundred or it'll go back to 120 and then we'll be even worse National Security and energy security uh shape I mean that's the tragedy of this story so I don't know the cavalry's coming you just had you just you just had Ted Cruz on he'll be chairman of the Commerce Committee we take this the Senate I'll be chairman of the energy committee my goal is to lower energy prices for American families restore America's energy economy we know how to do it we're going to use legislation we're going to use oversight vigorous oversight as Ted Cruz was just talking with you about onset and in terms of the confirmation process this President is not going to be able to put into place in the in the cabinet into different areas people of the same kind of radical agenda that he was able to do when Chuck Schumer was the majority leader thank you sir appreciate it Senator John brazo as always we appreciate your time

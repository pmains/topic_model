by florida congressman michael waltz congressman great to see you thank you for being here it sounds it sounds uh like like just hyperbole to say that but in fact there is a u.s code 18 section 1507 that bans any protest outside a judge's home quote with the intent of influencing his or her decision so it is a legal code that that makes these protests even if they're non-violent in front of a justice's home illegal but the white house seems to be encouraging it yeah that's right it is illegal and someone needs to inform the white house of the law i suppose especially uh president biden's spokeswoman jensaki uh this kind of messaging coming from uh the white house is incredibly dangerous it green lights uh i think this type of activity it's actually been happening uh for quite some time uh outside of mitch mcconnell's home uh it's been happening uh in front of some lawmakers uh it is also a felony to to lay a hand on any type of elected official or a judge but look i mean we all remember uh what happened to representative giffords who was literally shot at a rally this could get out of hand very quickly and i would like to see some responsible messaging from this white house to say knock this stuff off but it's it's already gotten out of hand i mean as as bad as the violence is and that's that's absolutely unacceptable so are these protests in front of a judge's home is who's making a an attempt to adjudicate issues facing the court i mean that is all it's already gotten out of control and it is obstruction of justice but apparently obstruction of justice isn't a crime in the minds of the administration if it's on their side well and what i think you're hitting on there is even though this wasn't classified material per se and then therefore not necessarily at least in my understanding illegal to leak it it is illegal to obstruct justice uh and i think that's this what this should be investigated under and under those statutes in terms of getting to the bottom of who did it and sending a very clear uh message that the institution of the supreme court cannot and will not operate this way now by the way you continue to hear from democrats saying that that what this the supreme court is about to decide if in fact that that uh the preliminary report that we saw out of the supremes holds that it's anti-democratic but as as we heard justice scalia's son just mentioned uh the fact that now you're taking it out of the hands of the courts and putting it in the hands of the people who can vote on it isn't voting on it by the public more democratic than letting a bunch of judges decide yeah that's right i think it's worth continuing to remind people we do not have a national abortion law uh either for or against uh congress has never acted on it that's why the supreme court overstepped its bounds in uh 1973 and overrode uh the elected uh actions of the state legislatures so but i do think you're going to see a huge push from the democrats to do just that at the end of the day they'll have to kill the filibuster and tear down the institutions of the senate in order to do it so let's hope that both senators mansion and cinema stand strong because when we flip the congress all of those democrats talking about tearing down the filibuster are going to wish they had it by the way we only have about 20 seconds but it's there's a strange split among the public on abortion about 63 percent an overwhelming majority say that roe v wade should stand as it is but then when you ask whether abortion should be legal or illegal it's very close to a to a split decision 52 say legal 47 say it should be illegal how do you think it's all going to turn out very quickly only 10 15 seconds yeah look at the end of the day uh there most people are against it you're taking the life of an unborn child but a lot of people want to reserve the right for women to do that what this is going to boil down to is when does life begin science has changed since the 70s uh and most states are moving to heartbeat and pain laws we have to protect those children it's just when you know the debate is when you become a child and we have to be able to have that debate congressman walsh great to see you thank you very much for being here appreciate it

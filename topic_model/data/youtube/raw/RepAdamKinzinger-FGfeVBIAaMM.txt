here with me now is the republican congressman adam kenzinger of illinois he's a member of the house select committee investigating the january 6 insurrection and he's also a lieutenant colonel in the air national guard and the founder of the country first caucus adam it is such a real pleasure seeing you my friend um welcome uh we got this report this week uh that mick mulvaney and steve mnuchin have both recently sat down for interviews with the january 6 committee and that other former trump administration officials are negotiating in negotiations to do the same uh so what's the line of inquiry that you're pursuing with these former trump officials and and what have you learned from them and and or hope to learn from them yeah i mean a lot of that i can't go into unfortunately i wish but look we are continuing the investigation that's that's what i can say is you know we had our our set of hearings which i think was very important for laying in front of the american people a lot of the story that they i realized later they've never heard you know there's a lot of times when you're in the middle of this investigation there's stuff that we knew that we kind of look around and say well maybe not everybody knew this and so what we're doing now is completing some of those i guess crossing some of those t's we're looking in other areas of interest obviously we have an interest in you know was the 25th amendment close to being invoked in my hearing frankly last thursday we put out a letter by uh secretary scalia eugene scalia where he had mentioned talking about the president needing to meet with the cabinet which i think was kind of a kind of a way of threatening the 25th amendment so there's a lot more to go yeah so you know it's it's interesting um and because you've now seen this sort of flood gate open for a lot of folks to come forward and want to speak to the committee it's been about a year since the committee started its investigation and and a lot of those trump officials that you recently met with um or are negotiations to meet with uh were any of them previously reluctant uh to sit for an interview and could you attribute their their how shall we say recent willingness uh to come and cooperate with the committee um as a sign of that the committee is opening up some some cans that they want to make sure they have a bit of control or at least some say in i think it's a good way to put it i mean i think it's that i think it's now the committee is actually being taken seriously because for the last whatever nine or ten months it was really developing the investigation it didn't have much of a public face and so you know it was written off by a lot of people and now obviously it's made a difference obviously this is quite important i think you do have people now that say i want to put my side in look without going into any more details you know there are people that have given us answers that maybe don't really square now uh as we have had more people that came in and talked to us and so we'll want to revisit with some of those folks see if their memory clears up a little bit and you look about you know somebody like cassidy hutchison by the way and i've got to tell you michael you know i mean you know the republican caucus as well as i do cassidy hodgeson 25 26 years old sarah matthews about the same age caroline edwards the capitol police officer have more courage combined than probably every republican man in the u.s house of representatives and senate and i think the story that's going to be written about this committee is the courage of young staffers particularly young women but young staffers to come forward and tell the truth is going to be like the basic equivalent of the whistleblowers for nixon now i couldn't agree with you more on that it is amazing to see these young women stand on behalf of their country as opposed to what the elected officials on the republican caucus are doing we've also gotten word that donald trump is the subject of the doj's ongoing investigation so what do you think about that and the doj and will there or should there should they move forward with the criminal investigation of the former president at this point i think absolutely look i think we have to understand as a country that no matter what happens there's going to be blow back this isn't our fault it's not the doj's fault it's one person's fault donald trump that put the country in a position where we have to make a decision are we going to prosecute or not we be in the department of justice i think this look we never want to get in a position where all you know the new administration prosecutes the last administration ever because that is you know a banana republic but it's very different when there's an attempted coup and i think if we say basically look you know bygones be bygones the coup didn't succeed and as long as the coup doesn't succeed you can get away with it i mean i guarantee you somebody's going to try this again and maybe even trump himself if he runs again this has to be pursued yes it's going to be a bit unsteady for the country but i think the biggest thing that would be unsteady for the country is saying the president's above the law and and covering up justice and obstructing justice is actually the way to go to be safe we have to do this this has gotten also very personal for you adam your work with the committee has made you a target uh of threats from uh trump loyalists and his supporters that the maga crazy crowd and trying to impact and influence the investigation but you've stood steady you posted some of those messages on twitter earlier this month uh let's take a listen to some of the messages that you've received uh recently gonna come protest in front of your house this you know who your family is and we're gonna get you wrath of the lord god almighty come upon you your health your family your home your livelihood and may i pray if it be god's will that you suffer [Applause] these are these are vowel threats to you and your family man i mean these these people i i just i i cannot imagine what what motivates you at this point uh to to stay true to the cause and and to to move forward uh despite receiving this this ignorant vile stupid responses from people uh in support of donald trump how do you do it man how do you make this work every day for you some of it my friend is anchor honestly some of it is look you're gonna make that threat and think i'm gonna back down look you you may you may somehow think that donald trump is a symbol of manliness that's fine whatever if you believe that but i gotta tell you if you think you can intimidate me you can't when i hear that one i mean by the way that woman talking about the lord god she truly believes she truly believes that jesus christ the guy i follow wants her to pray against me and my family for telling the truth she truly believes that she's not being misled even by political leaders her pastor is failing her so religious leaders are failing their their flock at large numbers that keeps me motivated too look i'm just going to tell the truth because i know this my kid that by the way even since we put that out we've had dozens of threats against him he's six months old michael people that have threatened to kill him i mean it's it's the the depth of evil i look at that and say not only is that not going to intimidate me i know that someday he's going to be proud to be a kenzinger because his dad will have stood for something right and i know that these people will be ashamed of what they said it's just pure evil that's all it is well his dad has stood for something right and is doing right on behalf of the country we thank you republican representative adam kinzinger of illinois real pleasure thank you so much my friend turn

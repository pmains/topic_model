well thank you everyone for joining us uh it's great to see uh some good friends here and this is an important conversation given the point in time in the year that we're at uh it's the beginning of taxis and uh and we know that there's some great expertise across new hampshire in folks who do this work and assist others in making sure that they know how to file their taxes and also what opportunities there are available to them through the tax code so maybe we can just go around the horn and have folks introduce themselves and then get into a little bit of conversation um about this particular tax year and barbara i see you first on my screen so why don't you introduce yourself hi congressman pappas thank you so much for for having us on here my name is barbara heggy and i'm a staff attorney at 603 legal aid which you can see behind me and i run the low income taxpayer project there which is a legal aid tax clinic for people who have problems with the irs terrific and vanessa why don't i turn to you next thank you congressman yes my name is vanessa valdez and i work under barbara hege at 603 legal aid i'm the community educator and the litc assistant so basically my job is to make sure the good world word gets out of all the different possibilities that people can have to really increase economic justice and economic wellness in our state terrific and kerry i'll turn to you thank you congressman good to see you again my name is carrie gladstone with granite united way where we run a program to provide free income tax preparation that helps folks as part of efforts to allow people and give people the resources to become more financially stable terrific thanks for being with us again and so tax filing season is upon us and it's really important that folks in new hampshire are able to complete their taxes and receive their returns in a timely fashion we know that's particularly true for low-income individuals or individuals who may be navigating this process for the first time and so this event is really twofold we're highlighting resources that are available for tax preparation purposes and also marking today which happens to be earned income tax credit awareness day which is organized by the irs and its partners and helps educate the public about eitc and the requirements that are needed to claim the credit so the goal here is to raise awareness about eitc and ensure that every qualified worker claims and receives their earned income tax credit this could provide up to sixty seven hundred dollars to eligible taxpayers that really can go a long way to help make ends meet and allow individuals to afford those day-to-day expenses and to start to save as well um so to qualify you must file a tax return and claim the credit to receive it which is a key point we should get across today um but that's why it's important that we've got experts here who can help shed additional light on this so um why don't i just throw it open to the group uh maybe we can start off with the earned income tax credit uh since we are uh marking uh today as their income tax credit awareness day and then move into some other concerns and considerations people might have as they approach this tax season so any advice about earned income tax credit and how folks can go about claiming that credit my biggest piece of advice which i think carrie was just about to say too is if you have any doubt whether you might qualify just go and get your tax return done if your income household income is below 57 000 you can get your tax return done for free by irs certified volunteers and the statistics show that one out of every five persons who is eligible for the ernikon tax credit doesn't claim it there there's so much misconception out there about who qualifies and who doesn't if you have a child in your household or if you have any earned income you're very likely eligible for some kind of a tax credit just go and get your tax return done and i think kerry can provide you a lot of good details about how to do that well thank you barb and yes the earned income tax credit just to be clear for folks who don't understand tax language it's like getting a gift card to help you pay your taxes so there are several different cards you know different tax credits that people may qualify for the earned income credit is a benefit for people who are working either for themselves or working for someone else but who don't make a lot of money and congressman thank you for your uh successful efforts that led to an expansion of the earned income credit to include for 2021 people who do not have a child to claim but had certain age restrictions previously a lot of people think they must have a child to claim or there are other factors that as barbara said leads people to not claim the earned income credit one being they have very low income well the earned income credit starts with the very first dollar of earnings and so people need to file a return even if they're not required by federal law to file a return and it can help as you stated congressman get people thousands of dollars and the uh ways that people can do that are filing their own return if they've prepared the return themselves united way supports a platform called myfreetaxes.com that allows people to go online get not only a return filed free of charge with an income up to seventy three thousand dollars but also to make sure that they have some way of checking to make sure that their return is accurate uh assisting online that can help them understand you know what is this tax credit i heard about and do i qualify for it and how do i enter in my free taxes so that's something we want to make sure people are aware of for the rest of the folks and barb alluded to the fact that many people don't claim it i did the math based on irs data for new hampshire and figured an estimated 49 million dollars is left on the table by many of your constituents congressmen and throughout new hampshire and you know millions more billions more state nationwide and that's part of our mission why granting united way not a an accounting firm is in the business of trying to help people claim this credit for those folks who need some assistance in person or with some support irs certified volunteers are literally at the ready right now and people can either go to nhtaxhelp.org or call two one one our statewide information referral line to connect with either a vita volunteer income tax assistance site or our partners in prep at aarp taxi well thanks for that carrie that and that's a pretty remarkable number 49 million dollars that new hampshire residents left on the table and that's um money that folks earned that they paid into uh you know the system through taxes and that they should be getting back but just aren't claiming that credit and so that's why it's important that folks take advantage of resources that are out there and available um one other you know tax credit that's gotten a great deal of attention of late is the child tax credit um we know that um it was expanded uh as part of the american rescue plan and that advanced payments were made to families throughout last year can you talk a little bit about for folks who might not have either known about the child tax credit or weren't receiving those payments last year what they can do is they look forward to this year's tax season and what other considerations people might have around the child tax credit thank you congressman there there is so much to say about that i'll go over a couple of things and give others a chance to to continue so the the first thing to keep in mind is that if you got all the advanced child tax credit payments you were supposed to um that would have been 1500 total if your children were over five or or more eighteen hundred dollars if your children were under six that's only half that's only half of the total child tax credit for 2021 and the only way to get the rest of it is to file a tax return that's that's the only way to get it and if you didn't get what you are eligible to get then there are a whole lot of reasons why you might not have gotten advanced payments that you should have gotten if you didn't get them don't worry you can still get them but you have to file a 20 21 tax returns just go and get that tax return filed one other worry that i've been hearing about it is that there are a number of people who actually got advanced child tax credit payments who weren't eligible for it there weren't eligible for 2021 tax credit for for children because the children weren't living with them the irs was basing their their determination of who should get the advance payments on 2020 tax returns or 2019 tax returns because 2021 wasn't over yet so they just did what they could and so there are a lot of times when they got it wrong so if you got advanced payments of the child tax credit that you shouldn't have gotten because you're you're just not eligible for it if your income was low you're not going to have to pay it back which is pretty remarkable and very helpful so if you're filing a single and your income is forty thousand dollars or below you're not going to have to pay it back so don't worry about that carrie you want to continue well yes and i just don't want to get too into the weeds because that's where it can get confusing for people and what we are hearing is folks are going to these commercial preparers i spoke with one person this week who's living on disability and taking care of his child and said a commercial preparer he talked to wanted 125 to file simply to help him get that child tax credit back so that that's one of the cautions uh yes these credits are uh plentiful uh they've made some nuanced changes and again congressman we want to thank you for supporting the the american rescue plan which brought about changes to uh actually three tax credits as well as that additional round of stimulus payments that can all be claimed by people who missed if they file a tax return and filing them for free not so you know being subject to those predatory practices of high fees and what i've heard is upselling offering things like uh audit protection where you know if you qualify we have audit protection sitting on the screen and that you know bar for the same low low price of free if you qualify can help uh deal with some of those things that have come up so uh the earned income credit the child tax credit the child and dependent care credit and reminding people that if they did not get the stimulus payment the third round that came out during 2021 they can make that up last year there were the two rounds of stimulus payments and our vita program statewide in new hampshire alone last year helped people claim more than six hundred thousand dollars in stimulus payments that they might have otherwise missed so there's a lot of money out there our role working together is to make sure that people get everything every single dollar that they're eligible for and what kind of um if folks are seeking tax assistance and and seeking guidance what kind of information do folks need to have at their fingertips um and are there any um mistakes that are just common for people to make in filing their taxes that people might want to think twice about a couple of common ones are simply making sure that when you enter everything go go be careful you know transposing a couple of numbers can cause a major snafu so making sure you're looking closely at your w-2 or other documents and entering box by box everything that should be in there our irs certified volunteers are trained to do that and every return done at a vita or tax aid aarp site is reviewed by a second person with the same or higher level of certification this year in particular congressman there are two letters that are coming out to help people who got either the stimulus payment or the child tax credit payment advanced credits uh the advance payments or both and so they should be looking for those right around now just as they get if they were working for someone that their employer should be mailing out a w-2 form the wage statement by the end of january they're similarly looking for a couple of letters from the irs that will uh make sure that they have the accurate amount of what they already received and that we can help them get the balance due because as barb said those child tax credit payments added up to half the total payment and in fact uh thanks to again the changes made during the american rescue plan act more than double the refundable amount the amount that people get on that gift card refunded to them once their taxes are paid so just be very careful enter the data accurately if in doubt call 211 or go to nhtaxhelp.org connect with a free site with irs certified volunteers yeah i want to reiterate how important it is to to enter all those numbers right especially the social security numbers for yourself spouse if you're claiming jointly and filing jointly and and children but i want to say something about the the letter that's coming out from the irs to people who got advanced payments of the child tax credit for some people they'll look at that the the number on the the letter you know how much the irs says that you got and they'll think wait a minute i didn't i didn't get that amount i got i got less than that well um if you put on your tax return the amount that you actually received according to your your bank statements or whatever um and it's different than what the irs says you've got please be aware that you will spend months and months waiting for the irs to to work this out the delay will be horrendous um and that also reminds me file electronically if you possibly can don't file by mail unless you have no other choice because the irs is still horribly horribly behind paper files returns you know returns that you put in an envelope and send in the mail those will take months to process so again if you if you write down on your tax return how much you've got in advance payments and it's not the same amount that is on that letter from the irs here's one solution to it that has been recommended by by people who spend a lot of time on these issues file the tax return with the amount on the letter electronically then immediately afterwards file a second return on paper with the correct amount right on the top of the the tax return you know the the first form is for 1040 at the very top right superseding return and if you file that before the the deadline for filing your taxes the irs will then look at that as your actual tax return and it will take months for the irs to figure out what to do with the superseding return and whether it's correct but that will be long after the irs has already processed the electronically filed return the one with the number of the advanced payments that the irs said is correct and you'll get a refund that is based on that so maybe you won't line up with the total amount of refund that you're supposed to get but you'll get some of it probably a big chunk of it and then later months later after the irs works through your superseding return eventually it'll all get worked out i can help if you if you want my help um then the irs might send you some additional money the money that you didn't get you might have to do it jump through a few hoops but please keep that in mind well i think that's such an important point to stress about filing electronically i know our office continues to assist folks who might have filed a paper return in a past year and things continue to be very challenging at the irs we know they are understaffed and under resourced to be doing what they're doing add on top of that all the layers of pandemic relief and tax changes that have been made over the last couple years and you've got an environment that has really slowed things down there so filing electronically certainly helps we're doing all we can to urge irs and the administration to take additional steps to streamline processes and uh to uh you know allow people to file and get uh refunds in a timely fashion um we hope they're gonna heed that um that advice and that warning uh as we approach uh april of this year uh what other uh changes um from the last tax year should people be mindful of of this time around uh carrie gave us a few of the tax credits um barb is there anything else here that um you know we should focus on yeah yeah one thing i want to highlight again about the eitc that kerry might have mentioned but i want to make sure people understand is that if you don't have a child to claim but you did earn some income then you're probably eligible for earned income tax credit dollars and it used to be that if you were over age 65 you couldn't get any eitc if you were filing without a child that has changed for 2021. for 2021 there's no upper age limit so let's say you're 72 and you have a job at market basket and you have some some dollars of earned income no children in the house you can get the eitc now also for for people ages 19 through 24 it used to be that you couldn't get the eitc as a childless worker now it's possible just so long as nobody's claiming you as a dependent on their tax return then then you can't get the eitc only if you can claim yourself if you happen to be coming out of foster care and you're 18 years old then as an 18 year old just out of foster care you also can claim the the eitc as a childless worker if you have some some earned income now i know kerry has been very vocal about the the child and dependent care credit which has not gotten as much air airplay as the other goodies that we have so maybe carrie can give us some information about that yeah and it's got an unfortunately similar name to the child tax credit but this is for people with children younger than 13 if they're paying for child care or paying for home care for a parent or grandparent that allows them to work or look for work they may qualify for up to eight thousand dollars to help pay for that care and yeah we've heard so many stories congressman during the pandemic of people who were struggling to go to work because they couldn't find or afford child care and so to say there have been changes to the child and dependent care credit that can provide additional money uh up to half of the cost of that child care for up to two dependents and can be a huge boost again they'll need to file a tax return to uh claim that money and this credit was made refundable so that they can get back any unused money that's on that that tax credit thanks um could speak a little bit about the outreach work that she's been doing because her her goal has been to try to make sure that everyone who's eligible for these goodies um can get it thanks barb yeah that's basically my one mission right now is to make sure that everyone who is eligible knows and we've been working very closely with other nonprofits throughout the state the river center and peterborough is a big one the family resource center up in gorham and so many more to really work with people who are in the trench right they're working with these people every day and they're trusted and taxes are scary and you know they're hard to understand i don't come from a tax background and this has been a crash course in learning about these taxes so we don't expect anyone else to be experts we have experts available for free to help you do this and we're just getting the good word out to make sure that people know this is about really helping people stay independent stay stable it's a crazy world we live in anything extra helps especially if you got kiddos if you've got dependents you're worrying about and if you're working hard no matter what your age i love that you know a 70 year old who works part time at storyland can go and get the earned income tax credit now that's amazing that keeps the heat and the lights on that's what we want so i hope that everyone out there just knows you're not facing this alone there are experts out there who will help you and ask for that help that's what we're here for and we want you to get these tax credits you've earned them now go against it vanessa is also coordinating efforts to tie in with rental assistance through the new hampshire emergency rental assistance program because there are so many people who've had additional financial difficulties and it's a lot of the same people who qualify for these tax credits qualify for uh rental assistance and that can be used for you until leaving food uh difficulties and you know putting food on the table so it there's a lot there and congressman i i want to make sure that we also point out to people here's something very positive in all of this many people are going to be seeing very large tax refunds compared to the year before and what a great opportunity for them to put some money in savings you know so many people have been struggling the federal reserve has done studies that found that about half of people of all income levels in this country couldn't withstand a 400 unexpected expense without having to borrow or sell something and for lower income people i mean the car breaking down for lack of 400 to put the car back on the road could cost them their job and a real spiral so to say you know if you come to one of our free sites and you're getting a substantial refund and you've got a savings account you can split your refund into up to three different accounts if you've got a checking savings if you've got just savings and no checking account you can put a couple two three four hundred dollars into that savings account and get the rest issued as a paper check for folks thinking long term someone had the force site to connect with the treasury department which runs the irs and also provides savings bonds and with the same one piece of paper one form that's attached to the tax return can buy u.s savings bond for something at least a year out currently paying a little over seven percent so that's you know some real money for folks who are thinking about getting the college fund started or maybe thinking about uh first-time home ownership but that's a little bit down the road as low as 50 dollars putting this longer well thanks for highlighting that that's terrific to know and just maybe one more time we could we highlight uh how people can get in touch with you uh how people can seek assistance um you know what resources are out there uh whether you're calling in by phone or going online um and we'll help communicate this to our constituents thank you i'll i'll i'll go ahead because i also want to give a shout out to the the organization that are funding vanessa's excellent work new hampshire charitable foundation and new hampshire housing finance authority they are they're paying for all the work that's doing so my name again is barbara hegge i'm a staff attorney at 603 legal aid at its low income taxpayer project and

thank you very much I do want to ask you about the scene we saw in the United States Capitol behind you yesterday with the group of republican congressmen forcing their way into that skiff where a deposition was set to take place what did you make of what you saw yesterday and what's your assessment of the way Democrats are handling this investigation well I think that thank you so much well then thanks for your condolences a euro item there was a great person who made me bleed Who I am today but look yesterday what we saw was a just misrepresentation of what's taking place up here we got a hundred and nine members of these three committees okay under the nine forty seven of them in the room every day of Republicans with their counsel they are participating they get equal time to ask questions and to follow up with questions so this notion that we're doing something in secret it's just absolutely not true it is in private and that's where you do fact find it because we are supposed to not just pursue the guilty but we ought to protect the innocent and you cannot do that in public view and so it's the same for that they would be misrepresenting this process this way we don't know what goes on in the grand jury room because the grand jury is supposed to find out the facts pursue the truth make sure that the guilty is brought to justice but also in the process to protect all those innocent people who may got may get miss Virgie spurts along the way so that's all that's going on here is shameful that they misrepresent in this but I guess that's the climate within you

. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA IS RECOGNIZED FOR THREE MINUTES.  MR. MCHENRY: I WANT TO THANK THE BILL SPONSOR.  THANK YOU TO LYNN JENKINS OF TH  GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA IS RECOGNIZED FOR THREE   KANSAS, FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN  PUTTING THIS PACKAGE TOGETHER. .  I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS A  SENSE OF HUMOR.  AND GOD EVEN HAS A SENSE OF  HUMOR IN THE COLLECTION OF OUR   TAXES. BECAUSE OF AN ELECTRONIC FILING  SYSTEM GLITCH AT THE I.R.S.,   BECAUSE OF A TECHNOLOGY  FAILURE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE   GOT A REPRIEVE FOR 24 HOURS ON   FILING THEIR TAXES.  AND MIRACLE OF MIRACLES, WE DID  NOT EXPECT THIS, BUT A   BIPARTISAN BILL COMES TO THE   FLOOR TO ADDRESS THE TECHNOLOGY  NEEDS OF THE I.R.S.  GOD INDEED HAS A SENSE OF  HUMOR. OR A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF   PUBLIC POLICY. BUT I THINK GOD IS IN ALL  THINGS SO HE'S CERTAINLY IN  THIS.  NOW, THAT GLITCH AT THE I.R.S.   IS JUST THE PUBLIC   ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE DESPERATE  NEED THIS AGENCY HAS TO BE   MODERNIZED.  WE'VE MODERNIZED THE TAX CODE. NOW WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THE   COLLECTION OF OUR TAXES. THE 21ST CENTURY I.R.S. ACT IS   THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE  BIPARTISAN STEP TO ADDRESS THIS  PROBLEM. SIGNIFICANT REFORMS ARE  CONTAINED IN THIS BILL.  NOW, TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, MY  PROVISION IN THE BILL, FOR   EXAMPLE. IT'S A BICAMERAL, BIPARTISAN   PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT  CONGRESSMAN BLUMENAUER AND I   INTRODUCED HERE IN THE HOUSE   AND SENATORS BOOKER AND CRAPO  INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE.  THAT SECTION OF THE BILL,  SECTION 301, SIMPLY SAYS THE   I.R.S. HAS TO STOP USING A   MANUAL PROCESS INVOLVING FAX   MACHINES TO VERIFY INCOME. NOW, FAX MACHINE WAS A   FANTASTIC BUSINESS PRODUCT THAT  BECAME A CONSUMER PRODUCT IN   THE 1980'S.  IT'S GREAT TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S   NOT MODERN TECHNOLOGY, NOT THE   BEST TECHNOLOGY. AND SO WHILE IT MAY SEEM   LAUGHABLE THAT I.R.S. EMPLOYEES  ARE STILL SITTING AROUND USING   FAX MACHINES TO PROCESS THINGS   THAT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR   WOULD BE DONE IN AN INSTANT, IN  A SECOND, LESS THAN A SECOND TO  VERIFY USING COMPUTER  TECHNOLOGY, THE NOT SO FUNNY   PART IS THE IMPACT IT HAS HAD  ON THE HARDWORKING AMERICAN  PEOPLE THAT ARE DELAYED IN   GETTING LENDING NEEDS OR   GETTING THEIR FAMILY NEEDS MET   FOR FINANCIAL DECISIONS. MORTGAGES, SMALL BUSINESS  LOANS, STUDENT DEBT,   REFINANCING, CONSUMER DEBT,  GENERALLY, THOSE LOANS HAVE TO   GET A VERIFIED -- A  VERIFICATION FROM THE I.R.S. ON  HOW MUCH INCOME THEY MADE LAST   YEAR.  NOW, ALL WE'RE SAYING IS,  MODERNIZE IT, MAKE IT THE  STANDARD OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR   AND DELIVER BETTER FOR THE   TAXPAYERS. IT'S BIPARTISAN. I AM GRATEFUL WE HAVE  INITIATIVES LIKE THAT IN THIS  BROADER PACKAGE THAT WE'LL SEE   ACROSS THE HOUSE FLOOR AND   HOPEFULLY SEE INTO LAW.  I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE   YES AND I THANK THE LEADERSHIP   ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO  MAKE THIS DAY POSSIBLE AND

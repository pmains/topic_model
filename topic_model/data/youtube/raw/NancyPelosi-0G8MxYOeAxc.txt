hi I'm Joaquin Castro congressman from Texas and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus this term we have much to celebrate and reflect upon this Hispanic Heritage Month Latinos are a part of the soul of this country from the strength and the diversity of our communities to the history culture and contributions of Latinos we're the laborers in the fields growing the food that feeds America where the soldiers who answered the call to serve in Vietnam and the Gulf Wars and never came home were the marchers who took to the streets and demanded the rights and dignities of workers were the educators did instill in young children the values of dignity respect and hard work that had defied our own communities for generations were the entrepreneurs innovators and leaders that make our communities prosperous and our businesses competitive every day I see the role that Latinos play in building our country Latinos come from all walks of life and different backgrounds we come from Texas California Florida and Puerto Rico the rural communities in Iowa Minnesota Georgia South Carolina and across this country some are immigrants and proud of their heritage but no matter our diverse backgrounds were all proud to be part of the American family but the Latino community in the last few years has been something else we've been a target a target of a president's prejudice the target of smears and scolding when we speak Spanish in public and sadly the target of a madman in Texas who killed 22 in El Paso historically scapegoating is dangerous during the Great Depression over a million Mexican Americans many of whom were already US citizens were deported because people blame them for taking jobs during tough economic times as echoes of that era resound today I implore all of us as Americans to not repeat the mistakes of the past mr. president no one has to choose between the country and Hispanics Hispanics are the country just like every other American no matter where their family came from that's why I'm deeply concerned about this administration's discriminatory policies which have threatened the legal status of 800,000 dreamers and hundreds of thousands of TPS recipients who know the United States is home the Trump administration has violated human rights and caused suffering of thousands at our southern border tearing apart families caging children turning away asylum seekers who came here fleeing the most dire circumstances and this is personal to me my own grandmother came here as an immigrant a seven-year-old orphan who came to Texas from Mexico she worked as a housekeeper a maid a babysitter and raised my mom Rosie who in turn became a community organizer in Texas as we faced adversity we're not without hope nothing can diminish this deep enduring perseverance that defines us as Latinos I know that our Hispanic communities are strong and proud part of this country and I'll stand with you and fight for you in Congress were hard at work for the people on so many issues that impact all Americans everyday from prescription drug prices to ensuring that all are counted in the 2020 census thank you and I hope you your family and all in our community have a wonderful Hispanic Heritage Month

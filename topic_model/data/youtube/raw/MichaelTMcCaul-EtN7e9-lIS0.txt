7 30 on the voice of texas ed hindi on the morning show special guests join us this morning from the u.s texas mexico border congressman michael mccall is leading a congressional delegation to tucson and then to texas also to verify border security or actually the lack thereof congressman michael mccall welcomed the voice of texas sir hey good morning yeah thanks for having me thank you sir where have you been and who are you doing it with well i'm traveling with the chief of border patrol mike fisher the admiral the coast guard uh in a delegation the members really from all over the country uh places like new jersey kansas these guys have never been down here and it's a good opportunity for them to see it because as you know you really have to see it to understand the problem uh in the magnitude and what we found in we've been doing the security assessment is that you know san diego they've got something they've got some aviation assets and what they're doing now they're going around and around those the cartels are in these ponga boats and they're delivering their loads that way so they're going by sea then we went to the tucson sector where you'd see a lot of fortification with fencing but also a lot of technology assets including some dod assets that they brought back uavs equipped with these vader systems which can see from the air on the ground and telegraph it to these these stations located on the ground and that's been highly effective to see in the air what's happening on the ground and to stop it so what's happened is we plugged up san diego to some extent tucson has gone way down in terms of crossings but guess who is the victim of all this uh somewhere near us or where right where you are i'm at the rio grande valley which is where i am right now and uh i'll be meeting with steve mccraw the dps we're going to go out on that i don't know if you've been down to see that apocalypse now boat that they have the 450 caliber weapons on it but it's a pretty intimidating vessel uh but then we'll be meeting with the sheriffs down here who have endorsed my uh legislation uh the board of sheriffs and uh we've got we had dinner with the ranchers last night which was a real eye opener i'll tell you something eyes and ears on the ground these guys have really seen a lot of interesting things over the last couple of years and the fact is this is the area in the southwest border where all the activity is really increasing we've known about the the activity of course whenever you shut off you know one area of access to the country you're just gonna force these people the others unless you shut it off you simultaneously unilaterally across the border and of course they pushed into texas the problem that i find is that we've known about these issues in texas for years and that's why you're bringing these guys down there what does the border patrol have to say about this and then these other congressmen when they've you know first time they've been to the border even though they they've been actively involved in trying to solve the border problem without seeing them what are they saying well i think the number one thing is we've been dealing with this problem over the last two decades on an ad hoc basis we plugged up polls and then they've popped up elsewhere we've never had a national strategy and we've never had a plan to deal with this which is what my build bill calls for that they we have the stakeholders being the border governors the the sheriff's the coast guard work troll they all come together and present a strategy uh which we've never had and if you don't deal with it in that context you're just gonna deal with this piecemeal you know and that we spent over 75 billion dollars already on this problem and arguably the success rate in the best sector that we have tucson we're only apprehending probably 44 so we want to get to 90 for operation control that's the definition in the in the bill um and to get there you've got to have a strategy deals with the whole border you know comprehensively but not not just piecemeal and so that's what um that's what we're looking at and you know what we have to put more resources down here and that it's tough budgetary times i'm trying to get assets from afghanistan and overseas dod assets that are surplus to come back and redeploy on the southwest border which is smart in these tough economic times but we're going to have to deal with this uh in a way where we have aviation assets and then we have these fixed towers on the ground sensor surveillance technology and and boots on the ground too continuing with the national guard a little bit later today to talk about their operations congressman michael mccall joins the season brownsville texas he's leading the congressional delegation along with the admiral for the coast guard and the chief of border patrol to review not only the the border lack of security there but also to support a plan to demand or require a 90 of effectiveness to close the border before we begin to extend immigration legal status to the people who are here illegally why is that important you know ed if you can't control the flow of immigrant immigration and immigrants into this country how can you possibly have any reform that makes any sense and so that's my argument is that you know our bill in two you know nine months to come up with a strategy in the plan then two years to get cool operational control chief fischer believes he can do that if given the right uh resources so um that that's our goal and you know i've been dealing with this issue as you know for even before congress and it's it's something that i just want it's time to get it done and i'm tired of dealing with this we want to get this thing accomplished and i think now is the opportunity now the time well as the chairman of the home house uh uh homeland security committee this is what you should be doing i'm assuming and we thank you for doing that and sharing it with us i'm assuming that there were other people that you invited on this trip that said well they just weren't capable of getting down there other elected officials and where does that leave us i mean you've got some people that have seen it now for the first time and hopefully their eyes are open can you go back to dc in september and and push this requirement or this this amendment through on this bill yeah well i mean it's you know the bill itself will probably be up in october is my guess and i i've supposed to talk to our conference many times on um on this issue uh to educate them there's a lot of education to be done with these members who really don't understand the problem what needs to be done so it's really gonna be a strategy of a lot of different assets put down here uh to get to get this operation control done that you know we uh you know the nine percent standard is it's a uh ambitious one but i think it's achievable um and we can't yes you can go back to immigration reform i you know i'm just not going to entertain or go down that road so i know that we've got operation control um and i think that's a common sense uh position i think that's where conservatives are um you know and then i i think it's the right course you know the analogy has been made uh congressman recall that if you've got a leak in your home you don't start repaying and putting new carpet leaks fixed you know and you've got to shut down the leak at the border before you can even talk about you know permanent resident status in some cases people want to talk about you know right their path of citizenship yet on the senate side with marco rubio he in his in an interview he gave the univision he clearly said that they're going to give legal status first before they close the before any border security is ever measured or you know or or are required how do you answer that i think that's a serious mistake and uh you know it's why you mentioned the senate bill i'll get ready to talk about that i think that bill is seriously flawed because first of all my bill doesn't have a trigger in it it's not part of the immigration reform it's a pure border security piece uh having said that i think what the senate has done is you know they they put together i mean schumer's the architect of the border security plan which he knows nothing about he's from new york i think he's going down one time to the southwest border is he down there with you right now and that's a good thing that's probably a good thing i probably have a lot of fights but you know they threw 46 billion dollars at this deal without any uh justification just arbitrary you know let's just do this and that throw a bunch of stuff down there uh without a strategy or a plan and it's physically irresponsible to do that you know i mean we're fiscal you know fiscally conservative i'm not gonna throw any more money so i know they've got a strategy plan can you imagine being a manager gun your ceo and say hey i need that 50 billion dollars and then he says where's your strategy and the responses i don't really have one and i don't have a plan either i mean leave it up on the fly yeah yeah just just throw it all down there and what that's they they didn't this this is the most disgusting thing politically they did it to buy votes i mean they they threw a bunch of these toys out there to get votes on the republican side which unfortunately they did and then they passed a bill that doesn't have they have a 90 number but it's an aspiration it's not a requirement so in other words otherwise it's sort of like you know 90 is what we would love to achieve in an ideal world but we're not going to require it my bill demands it and then that's really the difference but it's also more fiscally responsible uh and they're triggers they throw these triggers in that the minute they plan is submitted that uh immigration reform kicks in and you know that's way before we have operation control of the border and i think that's a serious flaw in senate bill well yeah they don't really care about operational control that is obvious when when uh when this bill came out by the way i understand the bills never made it to the house they still haven't released it to you guys to even look at correct um we've seen it but um you know i would but my views that that bill was dead on arrival in the house we're going through our committees you know this senate the senate likes to do comprehensive bills and they throw it together in a week's time without any thoughtful uh look at the issue what we've done in the house is going through the committee process the chairman good luck on judiciary he's going through his you know internal enforcement legislation i've done my border security bill and a very thoughtful approach with hearings the way you're supposed to do it you know we don't you shouldn't throw a comprehensive bill that eight only eight members have access to behind closed doors in secret telling obamacare and just throw it out there i mean that's not the way the congress was designed to work we have committees for a reason as to go through the legitimate process and that's what we're doing in the house and i think you're going to see a better product come out of the house it's going to be more enforcement geared and if there is any reform down the road it's going to be after we get the the control the plan that will come up your your bill requires a plan and the plan will have certain components to it there could be aviation assets could be you know boots on the ground also fencing technology and such who will actually formulate that plan well this is the beauty of it the strategy will be uh we have all the stakeholders will have them put into that that will be the border sheriff's so that's why they endorse my bill because they have a voice and i'm meeting with them right after this call by the way uh they have a voice the ranchers who know this issue better than anybody as well the ranchers the sheriffs the border governors or stakeholders and also obviously the you know border patrol and coast guard they all have a voice in the communities in terms of what the strategy should be then then the plan is put into place with ways to measure results with metrics and these are all done independent verification by the government accountability office in the national labs look at the metrics they'll be presented to congress at that point we can look responsibly where are the capability gaps that need to be filled you know i know what the assets are i know that grade fixed towers i know it's uh aviation assets uavs you know we know boots on the ground but the question is how many and where to put them i can we can't i you know i'm at least i'm humble enough compared to schumer to know that even though i know the border well i don't know all those answers until we've had this plan put together and then at that point we can plug those holes up we can fill those capability gaps in a responsible way to the taxpayer without just me our keynote just me arbitrarily saying yeah this is where everything needs to go without any you know expert consultation it's that would be really hugely irresponsible but that's been the process in washington dc up to this point and and that's why your your bill is refreshing again we're talking to congressman michael mccauley he's down at brownsville right now with a congressional delegation including admiral the head of the coast guard and the chief of the border patrol and the last question for you sir your plan that you know gets the local authorities the local sheriffs the local landowners the the governors these border states involved doesn't that also ensure that any measurement is going to have to be verified with the local people washington dc can't come down and do some quick you know slap bang study and say oh we're 90 efficient therefore let the immigration conf reform begin yeah this takes the politics out of it yeah the administration you know sort of out of it as well because the ultimate verification comes from the independent investigative arm of the congress that's the government accountability office but like last night we have dinner with the ranchers and they said you know what we want to have a say not washington in terms of is the border under control and i think and you know my response was absolutely that's absolutely right that's that's a refreshing and sensible approach and i thank you for doing it uh congress michael mccall know you've got to run the busy day we appreciate you carving out a few minutes to give us the update and report from the border well thanks for having me again and i appreciate it okay tell the uh tell those border sheriffs we said hello those are true american heroes down there they love you well likewise congressman michael mccall up on the voice of texas thank you sir my call is uh they've got the northwestern part of harris county all the way over to austin congressional district 10. he's chairman of the house uh homes homeland security committee and so he's the guy that gets he gets a lot of say so in this is leading the congressional delegation to the texas border he's also been to arizona and to san diego by the way the only one i've heard about this is there's considering immigration reform without ever going down the border and talking to these people that's been the insanity of this the great news is mccall is sticking up for us and sticking up for texas he's doing a good job of that thank you sir god bless you and hopefully the senate bill is dead on arrival and they can formulate a different bill for the house and ensure a closed border before you start throwing out the freebies like citizenship and voting rights 7 45 and handy on the voice of texas 281-558-5738 we'll take your phone calls next on the voice of texas

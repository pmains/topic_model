carolina is now recognized thank you very much madam speaker and i thank the gentleman from maryland for the elime this time madam speaker i rise today in support of hr 264 which will designate the post office located on charlotte street in georgetown south carolina as the joseph hayne rainey post office building i'm proud to join with the bill's lead sponsor congressman tom rice and the other members of the south carolina congressional delegation in co-sponsoring this important legislation this action builds on our efforts in the last congress to honor the life and legacy of joseph rainey by naming h150 the former house committee on indian affairs room in the capitol in his honor they are just two of the long overdue actions needed to amplify the historical significance of the first african-american to serve in the united states house of representatives congressman raymond was a trailblazer whose story and place in history has been overlooked as a former history teacher who believes knowing our history is instructive so that we won't repeat the mistakes of our past i would like to share with you my fellow south carolinians legacy joseph rainey that you heard was born enslaved in 1832 in georgetown south carolina his father was able to buy his family's freedom with earnings he made as a barber as a friedman living in charleston reigning was constricted conscripted by the confederacy in 1862 rather than fighting to preserve slavery he and his family fled to bermuda where he worked as a baba until the end of the war randy returned to south carolina after the civil war and served as you heard as a delegate to the 1868 south carolina con constitutional convention he was elected to the state senate in 1870 later that year he was elected to congress in his special election and was sworn into congress on december 12 150 years ago becoming the first black to serve in the house of representatives he was the first of several african-american members of this body during reconstruction from the 13th 14th and 15th amendments were enforced however and perfectly by the power of the federal government but reconstruction was short-lived jim crow laws and white supremacists dismantled multi-racist democracy with voter suppression nullifications and violent insurrection federal troops were withdrawn from the south following while a lot of widespread white supremacist violence during the 1876 election and the subsequent election of rutherford b hayes as president joseph rennie spoke out against the removal of federal protection of voting rights in 1878 he lost re-election to former confederate officer john smythe richardson in a district that was like south carolina majority black severe gerrymandering reduced the number of black south carolinians in congress to one in the 1890s and when george washington mary lost his bid for re-election in 1897 south carolina's representation in congress was again all white and remained all white for the next 95 years segregation and black disenfranchisement were the law of the land until the 1960s but thanks to the voting rights act of 1965 and its 1982 amendment i was elected to this august body in 1992. today congress is still grappling with racial issues voter suppression and as we witnessed last month domestic terrorism it is fitting and proper that we are taking this step as we are celebrating black history month i believe we will do well to learn some of the lessons of american history through joseph rainey's experiences and i hope today's action will help illuminate his story and cause us all to reflect on this legacy we must not allow the progress we have made to our racial equity since the 1960s retrogress that it did after the 1860s to truly honor the contributions of joseph reigning and all african-americans we must build on his progress by working together to address our country's long inequities and fulfill the promise of liberty and justice for all i'll hear back lieutenant

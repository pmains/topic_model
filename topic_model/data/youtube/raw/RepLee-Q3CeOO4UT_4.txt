thank you very much first let me thank the gentleman from New York for those very kind remarks but also i want to thank yourself and congresswoman Beatty for organizing this very important special order and for Europe this leadership congressman Jeffries and Beatty uninsured safety you know your leadership both congresswoman Beatty and Jeffries it has been bold it's been visionary not just as a result of the very recent tragedies but for many many years even before both of you came to Congress so it's an honor serving with both of you in this body thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to this evening also I want to just thank congresswoman Robin Kelly who is vice chair about gun violence task force but also chairs the CBC's health brain trust well thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem which it is madam Speaker I rise this evening with my colleagues and the Congressional Black Caucus to call on Congress to do something to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that's harming our communities since the start of the year just 11 days ago nine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just as weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victim's family at this very terrible difficult time we have to do something enough is enough Congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it's Charleston Oak Creek sandy hook or the streets of Oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence madam Speaker now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action I've received the calls and emails from my constituents and I know other members are also hearing from their constituents they're calling for action as well earlier today in my own district Oakland City Council President Lynette Gibson mcelhaney she buried her grandson 17 year old Torian Hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before Christmas this has been a very difficult period for councilmember mcelhaney and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something at all of their memories let me be clear now Congress can no longer ignore the massive told that this epidemic is having in our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of Americans in applauding President Obama's actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the president's leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30,000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year Congress must pass common-sense gun reform by closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of Americans and gun owners Congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety but we've got to provide the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nation's gun laws as a member of the Appropriations Committee I have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe so in the extreme data restrictions that restrict 14 Smith's ability to protect public safety and prevent policy makers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that's why I introduced last year its HR 14 49 is the tea heart restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tea heart restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyed mind you destroyed within 24 hours prohibiting the ATF from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we've got to restrict restrict and repeal these Tiahrt amendments right away they will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals festa mated that just five percent of sellers supply the weapons and used a nearly ninety percent of gun crimes the tea heart restrictions block access to vital data the lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman Kelly's bill which would allow the Surgeon General to study gun violence is a public health issue and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate firearms madam Speaker the time for action is now let's start listening to the American people and insist that Congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing common-sense gun safety measures when we have been trying here's in this body for years to get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that Congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman Thompson's proposal to establish the Select Committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now and so we can't continue to really allow the the misinformation to get out about Congress we need to do our job we've been trying many of us the Congressional Black Caucus and others especially Democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor and so what did the president do he had to do something but no more excuses Congress needs to act so I thank congresswoman Beatty and Jeffries for this very important special hour and for your tremendous leadership thank you

the supreme court's recent decision on president obama's health care law is one of the hottest topics right now on capitol hill but there are a lot of other big issues going on in washington that affect us here in west michigan that's right joining us this morning with more is congressman bill heisiger bill great to see you once again hey good seeing you mike and sarah thanks for coming back well this happened since we last saw you the supreme court ruled on obamacare or the affordable care act i just want to get your initial thoughts on yeah well in fact here it is this is the supreme court ruling uh i've been reading and studying and i think a lot of people have been just been trying to dissect it and figure out what it all means uh obviously a little bit of a surprise everybody had been watching justice kennedy they thought that he would be sort of that swing vote uh turns out he's the guy that writes the dissenting opinion uh and uh justice roberts is the one that uh that that swings it and there's a very crucial part of it though was interesting they took the the obama administration's argument that this is all about not about taxes but about fines and penalties and he said well that in fact isn't the case if that's going to be the definition under the commerce clause meaning federal government gets to regulate anything that goes across state lines and international lines and and has the ability to regulate those actions that in fact is what they said nope that that is not legal but if it's a tax it is legal so it's uh interesting the the whole premise of why this was passed uh and one of the arguments uh that it that it isn't a tax and that's just a a a fine uh really turned its self on its head so this is going to be fascinating i think it does nothing but fuel uh the uh the upcoming election the debate uh uh between uh president uh obama and and uh governor romney and uh this isn't uh this isn't an issue that we're done with as a country for sure obviously something that i've heard bill and maybe you can weigh in on this as well is you know people say well we everybody has to have auto insurance you know why why can't this be the same way yeah well two things first and foremost actually auto insurance or the the whole notion of driving is a state's issue it's not the federal government that comes in and issues a federal driver's license nor does the federal government come in and say hey we're going to tell you how much uh you're going to pay your bump shop to go and have your your fender repaired uh which bump shop you have to go to uh all of these different things that are all part of the whole notion of what we're all pretty comfortable with as far as our auto insurance this is very different though when it comes to health care so you you joined congressman fred upton at a town hall with alvin county farmers in hamilton a lot of topics obviously discussed how do you think the affordable care act affects small business owners around west michigan because they're now going to have to provide some sort of insurance for their employees depending on how many they have on staff right tremendous number of question marks that are out there and i can tell you the overwhelming response that that we get here in west michigan is uh is is cautiousness um with all these questions that are out there but people are very very nervous and whether it's ag or manufacturing or whatever it might be and there are some thresholds that are in there but it's still really unclear exactly how it's going to affect you i have three employees at my little gravel company you know what are we going to be doing how are we going to be handling that uh and uh and some some of these guys in fact i talked to a farmer on saturday a guy who runs country dairy up in new era they do a big huge ice cream social every year and uh and he was saying you know we're sitting there trying to figure out what do we do do we just pay the penalty uh which is actually cheaper frankly than than having the insurance be purchased uh and the type of insurance is out there that are that are available as a question mark what are they going to have to provide are they going to have to provide something that they don't particularly want or their employees don't particularly want so that was one of the one big issue we talked about uh the weather we talked about the farm bill number of other issues at this uh ag town hall meeting and and uh it was good allegiant county is in the currently in the second district part of it and uh all of it will be reverting to the uh to the sixth district which is uh which fred upton's district right now so how how serious are the republicans about repealing this thing yeah well it was one of the first votes that i took when i got to washington was to outright repeal we've had a number of steps along the way we're going back this week after the supreme court ruling we know that there's some some things that the supreme court said that we can't do in there one of those forcing states to pay medicaid and penalizing or pulling that money back if they don't uh so we're going to be having another vote uh this week uh to repeal the rest of it uh again and and i think it's important to do that and we've had some people say well well if the senate's not gonna do this why you guys bothering well the senate hasn't passed a budget either but that doesn't mean the house shouldn't go through the budget process we still need to lay out what our priorities are and what we believe constitutionally we should be doing and whether it's inaction on the senate part or whether it's you know the president not willing to go along we still have to do what we believe is the right thing and obviously in 2010 there was a huge huge reaction to this health care issue when we saw a massive class of 89 freshmen come in uh and uh it is uh it's not an issue that we're done dealing with obviously okay headed to washington after this we will be yes yep headed back to the atlanta oz that'll keep us up to date you got it we will thank you bye-bye

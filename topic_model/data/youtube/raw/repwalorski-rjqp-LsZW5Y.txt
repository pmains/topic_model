Mr Speaker I rise today alongside my colleagues to speak out against the radical and dangerous policies being pursued by Democratic leadership and state legislators across the country in New York a new law legalizes what amounts to infanticide allowing abortions up to and even after birth for almost any reason and ends the safeguards that protect babies born alive after an abortion attempt in Virginia a similar bill is under consideration that could lead to babies being denied life-saving medical care as governor Ralph North whom put it quote the infant would be kept comfortable and then a discussion would ensue close quote I think this is sickening that's why my colleagues and I have called for the House vote on HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act a common-sense bill to require that medical care just medical care be provided to children who survived a failed abortion sadly Democratic leadership in the House is standing in the way refusing even to allow an up-or-down vote on this issue this is not a partisan issue simply what's right what's right we've got to stand together against this radical in a humane agenda we must act to protect the rights of all infants I'm grateful to be joined in this call by so many of my colleagues

thank you mr chairman you know what we're seeing here from the democrats is just trying to a distraction just trying to distract the american people from what's really happening what's what what is it the american people are are upset about what is it that they're concerned about how about what their pain we can talk about the groceries we can talk about what they're paying at the at the gas pump so let's talk about that real quick if we're really serious about doing something that's important to the american people let's talk about hr 6235 to address the high energy prices our country is seeing right now gas prices are a seven year high on november 23rd the binding administration announced the department of energy will sell 50 million barrels out of the strategic petroleum reserve and attempt to bring down gases prices what a joke what a joke we consume roughly 20 billion dollars a day or 20 billion gallons a day barrels sorry i'll get that right 20 billion barrels a day in the united states and say we're going to release 50 billion out of strategic petroleum supply to bring down gas prices that's nothing but another game like this bill that we're talking about today debating nothing but a smoke and mirrors just trying to distract the american people to say hey look we're fighting we're trying to do something h.r 6235 would require the secretary of energy to develop a plan to increase oil and gas production on federal lands in conjunction with drawing down the oil from strategic petroleum reserves if any president attempts to tap into the spr for political reasons the strategic petro uh strategic production response act would require a plan to increase u.s energy production at the same time the spr would establish by congress to respond to an emergency not to manipulate gasoline prices the administration's anti-fossil fuel agenda is contributing to the record high energy prices which is driving up inflation and household bills it's projected to cost some families up to 54 percent more to heathrow homes this winter if president biden and the democrats want to be serious about bringing down costs to the families they would stop the attack on american petroleum i urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and i take up this bill and take up this bill i yield back

INFORMATION THAT WAS SENSITIVE AND YOU DID NOT DO THAT IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. >> JOINING ME NOW IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRESS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME -- HOST HIM ACROSS TOP INVESTIGATOR COMMITTEE CHAIRS -- AND SHARON MALONEY ASK THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO CONDUCT AN IMMEDIATE DAVID DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TO THE FILES REMOVED FROM MAR-A-LAGO. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS WOULD BE NECESSARY AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY DANGER THAT IS POSED BY THESE DOCUMENTS? >> WELL, AS YOU KNOW ALEX,, THERE ARE THESE 11 SETS OF DOCUMENTS THAT WERE CLASSIFIED. -- WERE RETRIEVED. AMONG THOSE WERE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT WERE EVEN TSS SIHAI DOCUMENTS, PERHAPS THE MOST SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE MARKED AS CLASSIFIED. IF THEY WERE TO FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE WARRANT SPECIFICALLY SETS UP THAT THE ESPIONAGE ACT MIGHT BE AT PLAY IN WOVEN DEFENSE RELATED INFORMATION THAT IS EXTREMELY DISTURBING AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHO IF ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THOSE DOCUMENTS AND WHAT IS THE DAMAGE TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY POTENTIALLY. >> TO THAT ANSWER WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY DONALD TRUMP TOOK THE SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS AND, THEN BY THE, WAY FEEL TO RETURN THEM AFTER BEING SUBPOENAED IN THE SPRING. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO AMERICANS WHY IT SHOULD MATTER THAT TRUMP KEPT THIS MATERIAL AND WHY ANY OF HIS A HOLLIS'S OR HIMSELF SHOULD FACE CRIMINAL LIBRARY LIABILITY IF THEY BROKE FEDERAL LAWS. I THINK FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE HAD VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION AND FAMILY HANDLING THIS CLASSIFIED MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY AFTER HE LEFT THE PRESIDENCY. AS YOU KNOW, HE HAS SERIOUS TIES WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. OFTENTIMES THOSE DON'T EVEN GET DISCLOSED ON THE SPF 86 FORMS. THOSE ARE THE APPLICATIONS FOR ACCESS TO TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS THAT HIS FAMILY AND MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD FILED. ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE OFTEN IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. THE NATURAL QUESTION IS, WHAT COUNTER INTELLIGENCE RISK CANNED THAT ALL POSE? THAT'S WHY AMERICANS SHOULD BE CONCERNED, GOD FORBID ANY OF THIS INFORMATION WAS LEVERAGED FOR ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL GAIN. NOT NECESSARILY BY PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT EVEN BY OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION OR HIS FAMILY. AND NOW, REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, WE JUST NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHO MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND HOW DO WE PREVENT THAT FROM HARPING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY? >> CONGRESSMAN, TO DO THAT DO YOU NEED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT? DO YOU NEED TO GET THE ANSWERS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR? ALSO, POTENTIALLY, DO YOU NEED TO SILENCE THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE CLAMBERING ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF ALL OF THIS AND TO GET DONALD TRUMP'S SIDE AND FEELING LIKE HE WAS TREATED POORLY WITH ALL OF THIS AND HE HADN'T HAD THESE DOCUMENTS TAKEN FROM HIM? >> FIRST OF ALL WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE DNI, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, AND HER FOLKS WHO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF THESE DOCUMENTS IS, AND WHAT IS BEING DONE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE FROM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO THESE VERY SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS. >> WHAT ABOUT THE REPORT BY NBC NEWS WHICH TALKED ABOUT THE CHAOTIC DEPARTURE AT BEST FROM DONALD TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE, AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT HE TOOK A VERY CAVALIER APPROACH TO THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS WHILE HE WAS IN OFFICE. FORMER AIDES, STEPHANIE GROSSMAN, WHO WAS JUST ON THE SHOW, SAID THAT HE OFTEN RIPPED UP RECORDS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETRIEVED. THERE'S AN EXPERT SAYING THAT THE SEARCH WARRANT FOR HIS HOME RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HE KNEW HE HAD SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS AND WAS KEEPING THEM FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT IN YOUR MIND, SIR, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER OR NOT HE KNOWINGLY REMOVE THEM? >> OBVIOUSLY KNOWINGLY REMOVING THEM IS VERY DISTURBING. BUT EVEN IF HE RECKLESSLY REMOVED THEM, THAT IS STILL DISTURBING. I THINK THAT THE -- WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT ONCE THE PRESIDENTIAL ARCHIVES OR THE ARCHIVES -- THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES RECOGNIZES THAT THE DOCUMENTS WERE REMOVED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY ASKED FOR THOSE EVIDENCE BACK. WHEN THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM THEY SENT A SUBPOENA THROUGH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. WHEN THOSE DOCUMENTS WEREN'T FORTHCOMING, THEN THEY ACTUALLY VISITED MEMBERS OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS BACK. WHEN THAT WASN'T FORTHCOMING, THEN THESE AGENTS WENT AND FOUND THESE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RETRIEVED. THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP WERE, WELL, WHAT DOCUMENTS WERE POTENTIALLY DESTROYED? WERE ANY DOCUMENTS MOVE TO OTHER LOCATIONS? WE DON'T KNOW THIS. ALL THESE QUESTIONS ALONG WITH THE STATUTES THAT WERE INVOKED WITHIN THE WARRANT RAISED SOME DISTURBING QUESTIONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. ONE LAST THING I WILL POINT OUT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATUTE OF SELF-WORTH WORKERS GUARDS TO THE ESPIONAGE ACT, IT DOESN'T REALLY EVEN BRING UP WHETHER DONALD TRUMP MISHANDLED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. THAT PARTICULAR STATUTE IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER SECRETS WERE ACTUALLY EXPOSED OR GIVEN TO OUR ADVERSARIES. IT'S RELATED TO DEFENSE INFORMATION. >> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION ABOUT THAT. I'M ASKING YOU TO COME BACK AS SOON AS YOU START HEARING WHAT WAS ALL SQUARED AWAY FROM MAR-A-LAGO, I WOULD LOVE TO

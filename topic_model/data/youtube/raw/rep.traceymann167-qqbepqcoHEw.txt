great uh thank you mr chairman uh first let me say i'm honored to serve with you on this committee and as the ranking member of the oversight investigation subcommittee i enjoyed getting to know you better when we met at your office the other day and look forward to working with you together in this important endeavor i spent the last 20 years as a commercial real estate broker and focused on industrial properties which got me involved in transportation logistics and supply chains i'm glad we're doing a hearing on this important topic today thank you for your leadership my grandfather served in the european theater during world war ii and i'm passionate about taking care of our veterans to that end i appreciate the women and men working at the department of veterans affairs to provide health care benefits and dignified burials to our great veterans living after the promises made to our service members is part of our constitutional obligation and our duty to care for our nation's heroes our responsibility here is to make sure the va as an institution is efficient responsive and accountable the programs must work too often we let organizational charts and political rhetoric stop progress this does not take care of our veterans people do that is why my goal will always be to foster an environment of the va where dedicated people can succeed i want to thank our witnesses for participating in this hearing to discuss va's medical supply chain i look forward to your testimony i believe as a country our brightest days are yet to come and we need to begin recovering from this pandemic by opening the economy now is the time to begin taking stock of how va's medical supply chain is performed and whether it has been strengthened enough for the future a year ago the unexpected happened and the pandemic decimated every supply chain there was no choice but to improvise the va adopted a contingency posture in ration supplies the news reports we saw of nurses and orderlies reusing personal protective equipment day after day was distressing va also started several new initiatives few of which have been completed all we know for sure about the next challenge is that there will be one and it will be different i want to explore what va has learned over the past year specifically which innovation should be adopted permanently and how can the new initiative support the ongoing covert response while also strengthening the supply chain to withstand the next challenge mr chairman i was alarmed to learn from the hearing that you ought last congress that an end-to-end medical supply chain still does not exist in the department as we discuss the major ongoing initiatives i think we must emphasize unity of effort first there is demos va clearly needs a more modern inventory and supply chain management i.t system and the department of defense is reasonable as a reasonable place to look i appreciate va attempting to accelerate demos from an eight-year implementation to five years but this is still too slow bringing the system up to full capability at its first and only site took almost two years i did not see how this program can successfully be implemented unless something fundamentally changes i also understand there's a new version of the software called logical set to be available in a year this seems to put va between a rock and a hard place the options are to continue installing demos now only to replace it with logical later and duplicate costs or defer immediate improvements and wait to implement logical turning to the regional readiness centers i understand the decision to hold greater physical inventories tabling the fact that the centers cannot be fully operational until 2023 i'm struggling with how va can be signing agreements for warehouses without answering some basic questions for instance what items will be held in these warehouses unless the plan is to restore massive quantities of every medical supply how can anyone predict which items will be needed in future emergencies and how will physical inventories be integrated with the just-in-time inventory model used by the rest of the department va has already committed to two regional readiness centers and two more in the process however before va sinks one billion dollars of taxpayer money into startup costs not to mention ongoing operational costs i think we need a lot more answers and to potentially explore other options the va does not need to start from scratch one option is the defense department's war stopper program which you referenced earlier which pays suppliers to hold emergency inventories on the government's behalf last friday ranking member boss you chairman mr chairman i introduced hr 2082 the va supply chain resiliency act which would require va to partner with dod to gain access to the horse opera program at the very least war stoppers should make their regional readiness centers less risky i believe va sees the value in this approach and i look forward to working together to get it done quickly i want to thank our witnesses again for sharing their time this afternoon and i look forward to exploring these issues in greater depth mr chairman i yield back

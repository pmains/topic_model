  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THAT COOPERATION, BUT SHE'S AN  IMPORTANT WITNESS. >> THANKS SO MUCH. >> JOINING US TO DISCUSS,  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS. WE'RE LEARNING THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION INTO  WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6th IN  THE MONTHS BEFORE IT AS WELL,  THEY'RE NOW LOOKING AT CONDUCT  RELATED TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS  CLOSEST ALLIES. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL. I THINK THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE, THOUGH WE'RE NOT OUT  TO PURSUE CRIMINAL CHARGES,  WE'RE SIMPLY OUT TO MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS, TELL THE TRUTH  TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SHOWN IS  THAT AT LEAST THERE'S ENOUGH  EVIDENCE THAT'S WORTHY OF THE  INVESTIGATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL  MAKE THE DECISION OF WHAT  THRESHOLD THAT REACHES. BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU, JAKE,  THERE THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT, YES, I THINK THERE IS SOME  SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT  STABILITY, IF A FORMER PRESIDENT IS INDICTED, BUT WHERE MY BIGGER CONCERN IS ON STABILITY IS WHAT  HAPPENS TO A COUNTRY THAT SAYS A FORMER PRESIDENT CAN ATTEMPT A  COUP AND AS LONG AS HE'S  UNSUCCESSFUL, WE LET BYGONES BE  BYGONES. OF COURSE, IF THAT PRESIDENT IS  SUCCESSFUL, THEN HE CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LEVERS OF  GOVERNMENT. SO WHILE THIS IS A NO-WIN  SITUATION, I CERTAINLY THINK  THIS COUNTRY CANNOT SET A  STANDARD THAT YOU CAN COVER UP  THE LAW AND YOU CAN ATTEMPT TO  OVERCOME THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. >> YOUR FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBER  TOLD CNN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  HAS GIVEN A LIST OF TRANSCRIPTS  THAT THEY WANT YOUR COMMITTEE TO PRIORITIZE HANDING OVER TO THEM. ARE YOU ABLE TO GAIN ANY INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE DOJ IS FOCUSING ON BASED ON WHICH TRANSCRIPTS  THEY'RE ASKING YOU TO HAND OVER? >> YEAH, WE CAN. I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO MUCH INTO THE REVELATION OF THAT. THE COMMITTEE IS CERTAINLY FINE, OBVIOUSLY, WORKING WITH DOJ. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE RUNNING TWO  SEPARATE INVESTIGATIONS, WE WANT TO INSURE OUR INVESTIGATION IS  COMPLETE AND WE CAN DO WHAT WE  WANT, BUT WE WILL COOPERATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AGAIN, THEY HAVE DECISIONS TO  MAKE. THEY HAVE A LOT OF  INVESTIGATING, I'M SURE, STILL  LEFT. BUT I THINK FOR THE SAKE OF THIS COUNTRY AND FOR STABILITY, IT'S  REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO  PURSUE THIS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT  THE OUTCOME OF THIS IS. >> LISTEN TO WHAT ATTORNEY  GENERAL GARLAND TOLD NBC NEWS  YESTERDAY ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP  BECOMING A CANDIDATE OR EVEN THE NOMINEE FOR THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY, FOR PRESIDENT, WOULD  CHANGE THEIR INVESTIGATION. >> WE WILL HOLD ACCOUNTABLE  ANYONE WHO IS CRIMINALLY  RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTEMPTING TO  INTERFERE WITH THE TRANSFER,  LEGITIMATE, LAWFUL TRANSFER OF  POWER FROM ONE ADMINISTRATION TO THE NEXT. >> IN YOUR VIEW, WHO ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO YOU THINK  DEFINITIVELY TRIED TO INTERFERE  WITH THE TRANSFER OF POWER? >> WELL, I PERSONALLY THINK  CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT. I MEAN, WE HAVE LAID OUT  MULTIPLE PRONGED APPROACHES THAT HE STARTED ON FROM JUST CALLING  OUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE  ELECTION AND CONSPIRACIES,  PRESSURING THE VICE PRESIDENT,  TO ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, ANY  NUMBER OF THINGS, TO FINALLY ON  JANUARY 6th, REALLY NOT DOING  NOTHING, SITTING BACK AND  PROACTIVELY RESISTING PEER  PRESSURE, WHICH HE'S ACTUALLY  NOT VERY GOOD AT DOING USUALLY,  RESISTING THAT PRESSURE TO ACT,  TO KIND OF LET'S SEE WHAT  HAPPENS HERE AT THE CAPITOL. LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL. I CERTAINLY THINK HIM. I THINK WE PRESENTED A STRONG  CASE FOR ATTORNEY EASTMAN, THAT  WAS IN MY HEARING ABOUT THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SO I THINK THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COULD BE ALONG THAT  LINE, BUT LOOK, I THINK ANYBODY  THAT BELIEVES, AND MAYBE I EVEN  HAD THIS THOUGHT KIND OF AT THE  BEGINNING, THAT THE PRESIDENT  WAS KIND OF ALONG FOR THE RIDE  AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CONVINCING  HIM. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. AS LIZ CHENEY SAID, HE'S NOT A  TODDLER. HE CAN THINK FOR HIMSELF. IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS  DETERMINED TO STAY IN POWER AND  TRIED MULTIPLE PRONGS AND  AVENUES TO DO THAT. >> TAKE A LOOK AT THE HOUSE  CALENDAR. MEMBERS ARE HOME IN YOUR  DISTRICTS FOR MOST OF AUGUST. YOU'RE BACK IN SESSION AFTER  LABOR DAY. BUT THEN BACK HOME FOR THE  OPPORTUNITY TO CAMPAIGN FOR  RE-ELECTION FOR MOST OF OCTOBER  AHEAD OF THE MIDTERMS. THE COMMITTEE MUST BE UNDER A  LOT OF PRESSURE TO RELEASE YOUR  INTERIM REPORT DURING SEPTEMBER  BEFORE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GO HOME FOR OCTOBER. >> YEAH, LOOK, I HAVE LEARNED ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT THERE REALLY IS NO BREAK OR RECESS. EVEN WHEN WE'RE HOME, WE'RE  WORKING REMOTELY. THE STAFF, I THINK, IS REALLY  THE UNSUNG HEROES IN ALL THIS. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING GOD'S WORK  TO GET ALL THE DETAILS TOGETHER. YEAH, I THINK WE INTEND TO PUT  OUT AS MENTIONED AN INTERIM  REPORT, THE INVESTIGATION  CONTINUES. AND WE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM,  AND I THINK EVERY DAY THAT GOES  BY, WE GET CLOSER TO MORE  ANSWERS, SECRET SERVICE, FOR  INSTANCE, AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T GET  TOO MUCH OF AN AUGUST WHEN IT  COMES TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WORK FOR THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT. >> WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE  SECRET SERVICE. THERE WERE A WHOLE BUNCH OF  WHISPERS FROM PEOPLE NEAR THE  SECRET SERVICE SAYING THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO TESTIFY ABOUT THAT STORY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEN  DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TONY  ORNOTO TOLD CASSIDY HUTCHINSON  THAT STORY ABOUT TRUMP LUNGING  IN THE SUV, BUT YOU TOLD CNN  TALKS HAVE COMPLETELY BROKEN  DOWN AND THEY WEREN'T  COOPERATING ANYMORE, THOSE THREE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, THE  GENTLEMAN THAT WAS THE SECRET  SERVANT AGENT, ORNOTO, AND THE  GUY WHO DROVE THE SUVERB. WHAT'S THE STATUS? >> IT'S A PATTERN WE SEE WHICH  IS THROUGH ANONYMOUS SOURCES  THINGS ARE QUESTIONED AT THE  COMMITTEE. THROUGH ANONYMOUS SOURCES THEY  SAY THEY'RE WILLING TO COME IN  AND GIVE COUNTER EVIDENCE AND  THEY NEVER DO BECAUSE WE REQUIRE THEM TO BE UNDER OATH. AS OF NOW, WE HAVE NOT TALKED TO THESE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. THEY HAVE LAWYERED UP, WHICH IS  THEIR RIGHT TO DO, AND WE'LL GO  FROM THERE. THE ATTORNEYS ARE ENGAGING TO  FIGURE OUT WHAT'S NEXT. BUT YEAH, THAT'S, AGAIN, THE  STANDARD KIND OF TRUMP OPERATION PATTERNS THROUGH ANONYMOUS  SOURCES OR THROUGH WHISPER  CAMPAIGNS TRY TO DISCREDIT  PEOPLE AND NOT BE WILLING TO DO  IT UNDER OATH, AND CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON HAS SHOWN SHE'S A  BRAVE AMERICAN WOMAN, AND I  THINK PEOPLE LIKE HER, SARAH  MATTHEWS, CAROLINE EDWARDS WILL  GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS HAVING  MORE COURAGE THAN FRANKLY ALMOST EVERY MAN IN THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY COMBINED. >> YOUR VICE CHAIR OF THE  COMMITTEE LIZ CHENEY TOLD ME ON  SUNDAY THE COMMITTEE IS PREPARED TO CONSIDER SUBPOENAING GINNI  THOMAS, THE WIFE OF CHAIRCLAREN  THOMAS IF SHE DOES NOT APPEAR  BEFORE THE COMMITTEE  VOLUNTARILY. WHEN WOULD THAT DECISION BE  MADE? >> SO THAT'S -- SO THE LAWYERS  ARE REALLY GOOD AT KIND OF  KNOWING WHEN THEY'RE IN  LEGITIMATE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH IS ALL STANDARD OR WHEN THEY'RE  BEING STALLED. AND TYPICALLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN  IS THEY'LL COME TO US AND SAY,  THEY'RE JUST STALLING RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHEN WE ISSUE A SUBPOENA. I THINK WHEN WE GET TO THAT  THRESHOLD, WE WILL. RER RR NOT TREATING HER  DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF HER LAST  NAME. WE HAVE DISCOVERED MORE AND MORE INVOLVEMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAS  BEEN REPORTED OPENLY ABOUT HER  INVOLVEMENT WITH EASTMAN OR  TRYING TO CONVINCE STATE  ELECTORS. WE WANT TO TALK TO HER. SHE SAID THROUGH THE MEDIA THAT  SHE'S EAGER TO TALK TO US. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE. IF NOT, WE'LL DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. >> LASTLY ON A SEPARATE TOPIC,  WE'RE SEEING THE DEMOCRATIC  PARTY IS FUNDING MAGA  REPUBLICANS IN THESE REPUBLICAN  PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN THE HOPES  THAT THOSE MAGA REPUBLICANS WHO  ARE MORE EXTREME WIN THE PRIMARY AND THEN IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR  DEMOCRATS TO BEAT THEM IN THE  GENERAL ELECTION. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW DOING THIS TO  PETER MEYER, REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN FROM MICHIGAN. HE'S ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICANS, AS I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU  BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TEN OF  YOU, WHO VOTED TO IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP FOR THE INSURRECTION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? >> YEAH, WE ARE A SMALL CREW. GOVERNOR PRITZKER SPENT $30  MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY TO  PROMOTE AN ELECTION DENIER  CANDIDATE WHO IS NOW OUR  REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. IT'S RIDICULOUS. I HAVE DEMOCRATS ALL THE TIME,  AND I'M GLAD THEY'RE SPEAKING  OUT ON THIS, WHO SAY WHERE ARE  ALL THE GOOD REPUBLICANS. COUNTRY FIRST, WHICH I HAVE,  WE'RE TRYING TO GET DEMOCRATS TO VOTE IN THESE PRIMARIES FOR GOOD PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION AND SO I WOULD  ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHERE YOUR EFFORT IS  SPENT, BECAUSE DEMOCRACY IS AT  STAKE. WHEN YOU SPEND MONEY PROMOTING  THESE BAD ELECTION DENYING  CANDIDATES, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU  FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW AT RISK WE  ARE. >> THERE'S A LOT OF SMART  DEMOCRATS I KNOW THINK THERE'S A BIG RED WAVE COMING. A LOT OF THESE FRINGE FOLKS  COULD END UP SWEPT INTO STATE  HOUSES AND THE U.S. CAPITOL. >> I'LL GO ONE FURTHER. THERE WILL BE SOME OF THESE  CANDIDATES THAT WERE PROMOTED  THAT END UP IN OFFICE AND DO  REAL DAMAGE. YOU KNOW, JUST LOOK AT THE  GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA. THAT'S A COMPETITIVE RACE. LOOK AT ILLINOIS, ET CETERA. YOU WILL SEE THAT AFTER  NOVEMBER. IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS GAME TO  PLAY

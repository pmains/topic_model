T OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE TO THANK MY DEFENSE FELLOW, JAY HURST, FOR A YEAR OF EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE TO OUR OFFICE AND TO OUR NATION. JAY JOINED US IN JANUARY AND HE'S ENRICHED OUR OFFICE WITH HIS INVALUABLE INSIGHTS AND GREAT COMPANY. HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE NDAA PROCESS AND MEETING WITH MEMBERS AND STAFFERS FROM OFFICES ACROSS CAPITOL HILL IN ACHIEVING GREAT WINS FOR OUR STATE, LOUISIANA, AND OUR COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH HE WAS ONLY WITH US FOR A YEAR, JAY INSTANTLY BECAME LIKE FAMILY TO US, MENTORING OUR INTERNS AND MAKING COMPLEX MILITARY ISSUES UNDERSTANDABLE FOR STAFF. IN HIS SPARE TIME, HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH, HE PUBLISHED SCHOLARLY ARTICLES ON MILITARY MATTERS ON A NUMBER OF PRESSING POLICY QUESTIONS. JAY IS LEAVING US FOR THE PENTAGON WHERE HE WILL CARRY ON THE HIGH STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE THAT HE BROUGHT TO OUR OFFICE. MR. JOHNSON: KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE MISSED AND PRAYED FOR MY FRIEND.

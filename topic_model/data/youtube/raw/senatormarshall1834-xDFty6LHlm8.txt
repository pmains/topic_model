today Mr Speaker I rise today to highlight the work of the House and Senate Agriculture committees this afternoon will be considering the conference report of the 2018 farm bill I'm proud to had the chance to work along the side two of my great mentor Senator Pat Roberts and my house colleague colleague chairman Mike Conway on this bill while the national media might not spend much time reporting on this one I want to take a moment and recognize both the importance of this bill and the work done by farmers and the ranches it protects mr. speaker Kansas sent us to Congress to get a farm bill done and I'm honored to be here today to say we delivered for Kansans I can't hold a town hall or listing session in my district without hearing about the importance of this bill our farmers need certainty and a responsible safety net that can protect them from the whims of nature and markets that are far out of control crop prices have dropped 50% since the last farm bill and that impact is showing up in the bottom lines of producers across the country in Kansas farm Baker farm bankruptcies are up six times in just three years I'm not here to fear monger but to share the seriousness of the state of the agriculture economy mr. speaker as I vote here today I'll be thinking of and honoring my parents and grandparents knowing this legislation well preserved the rural way of life from which I was raised and the work ethic that was taught to me on those family farms Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

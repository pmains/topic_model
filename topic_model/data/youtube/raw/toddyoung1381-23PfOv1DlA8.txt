[Music] internships provide an invaluable experience to young professionals young adults who want to have a front row seat and learn about the workings of Congress and get some real-world experience I'm interning for senator young this summer and I had a great time it was a super awesome experience I met a lot of good friends from my intern class it's a wonderful experience you learned so much about the professional environment here and just about the legislative process in general I really enjoyed this internship it taught me so much about politics about the legislative process and really and I've met some great mentors here we've had the opportunity to help introduce a bill in the Senate floor which is an incredible opportunity that I can't imagine other interns have the opportunity to do I've read through the memo and this is just fantastic work and I think it'll be good for losers if you're somebody who's looking to help out fellow hoosiers in Indiana give back to your community and you want to participate in some meaningful work I highly recommend going out for this type of internship at senator Young's office and this internship has really helped me get out and try new experiences with meeting people but it's really helped me grow as a person over the course of this internship each of you have been serving the people of Indiana and we all have the capacity whether it's through an internship you're a u.s. senator or by helping out in your local community or running for office yourself someday you all have the opportunity to give back and I actually think we have a duty and obligation in this country to do so it's not only fun but the feedback I receive is that people regard this as an incredibly meaningful experience and you step away with a lot of great contacts and relationships to learn more about our internship experience visit our website at Young senate.gov slash help or you can just give us a call at two zero two two two four five six two three we'd love to consider your application it is a highly competitive program but I'm sure you have what it takes to be a contender thanks so much [Music]

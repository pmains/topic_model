uh thank you i'm i thank you chairwoman johnson for holding this meeting and uh dr ocholini thank you so much for your years of dedicated service wonderful wonderful service as it stands now noaa's ocean service in the national centers for coastal ocean science are the de facto leaders for harmful algal bloons forecasting now they've developed the algae bloom monitoring system for locating monitoring and quantifying algae looms in coastal and lake regions across the country our question is what role does the national weather service play in harmful algebras forecasting especially when it comes to the effect that severe storms like hurricanes have on algebra's conditions and movement so one of the things we do is we partner with the national ocean service that actually runs the forecast models for the bays the coastal areas and the harmful algae bloom we work with them in terms of providing the computing capacity for example they run those models on what is are been looked at as the weather operational models and the reason is is that they need weather parameters from our own models to actually drive components of their prediction system after the forecasts are made we have positioned uh the relevant forecast offices and this has been um you know embraced by the the law is especially in the local offices embraced by the workforce uh in those offices uh to serve as um uh service outlets uh in a sense and work very um uh very uh diligently with the partners in nos um and with the um uh the people receiving uh the information that make decisions like along the gulf coast um in florida and also in lake erie so we there are quote unquote operational systems that we work with our partners in nos and deliver those forecasts and work with the decision makers accordingly well thank you can you think of the national weather service ability to do more for humber algebrooms forecasting can you think of whales we might be able to do well the the science and and the uh and the abilities actually lie in the national ocean service and in the oceanic and atmospheric research group oar there for example the great lakes environmental research lab we work with them as they're developing these new advances and i could say that we learned from them it's really been one of the learning experiences as uh for me and recognizing that the harmful algae bloom in in freshwater lakes for example like lake erie can actually be more toxic than what happens along the coast and i know in florida you have that that combination of lake okeechobee water and in the gulf water coming together and providing these blooms over a two three month period so um but we from a science perspective we rely on those other components from a service perspective we are working with them to um to make sure that we can get the connectivity with the local decision makers that that need this information whether it's the water whether it's the fish the shellfish folks whatever so it's a it's really a true partnership within noaa that's bringing this um expertise and this ability uh through the service pipelines into the communities and how important is it to understand coupled ocean atmosphere interactions for weather forecasting oh it's very it's one of the main main factors we have to work towards to improve ourselves in the future it's not just the atmosphere for us it's the entire earth system it's earth system science and the ocean atmospheric coupling is an incredible component of that my colleague my leader in oar craig mclean handed me a bumper sticker that says if you like your seven-day weather the forecast thank an oceanographer i have that in my office um that i've not been in for about uh uh i would say now 80 82 weeks so um but it is true and i've been the co-chair for in the world meteorological organization uh for the effort to bring the ocean and atmospheric communities together uh as organizations uh to address these issues into the future so it's not just in the united states it really is a truly a global issue we've got to bring a coupled approach uh in the entire earth system forward to advance our forecast capabilities uh thank you very much i see my time is expired and i yield back thank you

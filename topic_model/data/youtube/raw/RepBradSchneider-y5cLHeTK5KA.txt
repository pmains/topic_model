uh thank you um i very much appreciate the the opportunity to speak with you i want to thank chairman mcgovern ranking member cole and members of the committee for hosting um today's hearing solicit ideas uh from members uh on rules for our next the 117th congress i'd like to discuss my views on the motion to recommit as outlined in rule 19. as a majoritarian institution the mtr represents one of the last opportunities in the house for those in the minority to influence legislation being considered on the floor in principle i support the mtr as a procedure that keeps debate alive and retains minority rights within the house in practice however the minority party both democrats and republicans use the mtr as a partisan cudgel or just as often an attempt to artificially create a wedge issue using the mtr's wedge along partisan fault lines is certainly the prerogative of minority party and again both democrats and republicans have used the mtr toward that end over the decades but what has been different this congress and what i find not just reprehensible but in fact dangerous is the republican use of american jews jewish heritage and the long-fought battle against the scourge of anti-semitism to divide us the great seal of the united states bears the motto e pluribus unum out of many one it reflects the national ethos that has long given strength to our nation it should be a principle that unites us so it is concerning when any group of americans is used as a prop to sow division using american jews who have long faced bigotry and very real threats of violence is something altogether different the alt-right unite the right rally in charlottesville in 2017 and subsequent attacks in pittsburgh pennsylvania and poet california are examples that dominate the news but they are just the tip of the iceberg according to the anti-defamation league or adl anti-semitic incidents increased by 12 percent in the united states in 2019 and marked the highest number in ad adl's four decades of record keeping i have no doubt that all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle oppose bigotry and hatred in any form including anti-semitism and so no party should ever assert that there is anything but unanimous opposition within the house against anti-semitism to do otherwise raises the risk of empowering those who traffic and hate and who would like nothing more than to believe that they have allies within the us congress who support their anti-semitic views i want to repeat myself the mtr provides a venue for debate on worthy issues of divergent opinions but when action on the floor of the u.s house of representatives dehumanizes any group in this case american jews facing anti-semitism it diminishes the institution and does a disservice to our nation the cynical ploy of weaponizing anti-semitism for political game game is as offensive as it is dangerous again mtr should be a tool to insert healthy debate within the legislative process and parties may choose to use it to push their agenda or put the majority party on the record my minority parties should not however cynically use any of our citizens or group of citizens as a wedge or a we don't know who will be in the majority in the next congress i believe therefore that we can now take this opportunity to prohibit the use of mtr's in the next congress until there is a bipartisan agreement that while we can and often shouldn't vote controversial issues on policy disagreements we must never use the mtr to subvert our common goal of condemning anti-semitism i support the mtr as a way to retain the minorities voice in the legislative process but i refuse to condone how it has been used by republicans this congress to infer democrats or any member of this body are not sufficiently opposed to anti-semitism i also support proposals to require a higher bar for passage of an mtr such as requiring two-thirds of votes for passage similar to suspension bills when we're legislating on the fly as is the case with mtr's it's important that we get the details right thank you for providing me the opportunity to speak on how mtr has been used in this congress without a yield back thank you very much mr lou

  DISTINGUISHED THE GENTLEMAN FROM VERMONT, MR. WELCH, AS MUCH TIME AS HE MAY CONSUME. -I THE GENTLEMAN FROM VERMONT IS RECOGNIZED.  MR. WELCH: I WANT TO THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FROM THE ISLANDS AND   MY CO-SPONSOR, MR. NOLAN.  ALSO WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN  BISHOP.  CHAIRMAN BISHOP, I WANT TO THANK YOU AS WELL. YOU DID SOMETHING FOR US IN  VERMONT WITH THE RIVER AND   EVERYTHING'S WORKING OUT AND YOU HAD SKEPTICISM OF CERTAIN  AGENCIES BUT VERMONTERS ARE VERY GRATEFUL.  I WILL TAKE ISSUE WITH A LITTLE  THING YOU SAID.  YOU PRESENTED THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING TO GO INTO VERMONT. I HEARD IT AS AN AFTER THOUGHT.  I MAY BE A LITTLE SENSITIVE. THE WHOLE POINT OF WALKING 4,600 MILES IS TO GET TO VERMONT.  THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.  THIS IS COVERING ALL THESE   STATES, STARTING UP IN THE   PLAINS AND COMING AROUND THAT  BOG HOPEFULLY AND GOING TO   CONNECT UP TO THE APPALACHIAN  TRAIL THAT NOT ONLY RUNS THROUGH VERMONT, MR. NOLAN, BUT RUNS BY  MY HOUSE.  I'M GOING TO WAVE TO YOU NEXT  YEAR WHEN YOU HAVE THE TIME  BEING A RETIRED MEMBER OF  CONGRESS AND YOU ARE MARCHING  ACROSS THAT TRAIL, WHEN YOU GET  TO VERMONT, WE ARE GOING TO SAY  HELLO AND INVITE YOU IN. BUT THE POINTS YOU MADE ARE  REALLY TRUE. THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF THIS IS  REALLY SUBSTANTIAL.  IT GETS PEOPLE OUT AND AROUND  AND INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND THE SPINOFF ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS VERY SUBSTANTIAL. AND IN VERMONT, JUST OUR WHOLE   TRAIL SYSTEM WHICH WE ARE PROUD  OF WHICH I KNOW OF IN THE  MINNESOTA, ONE IN SEVEN VERMONT  JOBS DEPENDS ON OUTDOOR  RECREATION.  5.5 BILLION IN CONSUMER  SPENDING.  AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL. BUT THE OTHER POINT YOU ALLUDED  TO THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT.  IT'S GOOD FOR THE BOTTOM LINE  AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE SOUL.  THE FRIENDSHIP, THE FAMILY   PARTICIPATION, THE CONNECTION  THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO WHERE THEY   LIVE AND THE BEAUTY OF WHERE IT  IS THEY LIVE.  IT'S INTERESTING YOU HAVE  SPONSORS FROM ALL OF THE STATES  THROUGH WHICH THIS TRAIL GOES  AND DOESN'T MATTER IF IT IS  REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT BECAUSE   WE HAVE SO MUCH ENGAGEMENT WITH  OUR CITIZENS AND OURSELVES WHERE THEY HAVE A SENSE OF PLACE IN  THAT LOCATION WHERE THE TRAIL  GOES THROUGH THEIR LAND. AND THEY GET OUT THERE WITH THE  CHAINSAWS AND THE AMOUNT OF  VOLUNTR WORK THAT GOES INTO  MAKING THESE TRAILS PASSABLE IN  WINTER AND SUMMER IS   EXTRAORDINARY. SO THIS WHOLE EFFORT ON THIS   TRAIL AND ALL OF OUR TRAILS IS   SOMETHING THAT I THINK CONGRESS  SHOULD BE DOING AS MUCH OF AS IT CAN. IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY, IT'S  GOOD FOR THE HEART, IT'S GOOD  FOR THE SOUL.  THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO  US IN VERMONT. THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL GOES   THROUGH PART OF VERMONT, GREEN   MOUNTAIN CORRIDOR AND WE HAVE A  NUMBER OF OTHER TRAILS THAT  SOMETIMES LINK UP WITH SNOW  MOBIL BYWAYS, SOME OF WHICH   GOES ACROSS THE LAND MY WIFE AND I OWN. AND YOUR LEGISLATION I THINK IS  BUILDING ON A VERY, VERY   AMBIOUS AND WONDERFUL TRAIL,   THE NORTH COUNTRY NATIONAL   SCENIC TRAIL.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, A   PERSON YOU SHOWED IT ON THE MAP, CAN WALK ALL THAT WAY -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT? AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE   GOING TO DO IT.  THEY ARE DOING THE APPALACHIAN   TRAIL AND PACIFIC COAST TRAIL  AND BECOMES A LIFETIME EFFORT  FOR THEM.  AND THEY PLAN IT.  AND THEY ARRANGE WITH FRIENDS TO MEET AND DO IT.  AND WHETHER YOU CAN DO ALL OF IT LIKE MR. BISHOP PROBABLY COULD   OR YOU COULD OR SOME OF IT WHICH I COULD DO, IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT AWAITS US, OUR KIDS, OUR  GRAND KIDS AND FUTURE  GENERATIONS. MR. NOLAN, I'VE GOT TO SAY IT  HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS PLEASURE TO SERVE WITH YOU IN CONGRESS.  YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST DIRECT   AND FORTHRIGHT PEOPLE THAT I   HAVE SEEN HERE.  BUT I THINK AS A PIECE OF  LEGISLATION TO PASS THE SOON   DEPARTURE OF YOUR SECOND ROUND   HERE IN CONGRESS, THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT GENERATIONS OF  AMERICANS AND GENERATIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF VERMONT AND MINNESOTA  ARE GOING TO HAVE VERY FOND  FEELINGS AND LOOK BACK AT YOU  FOR TAKING UP THE LEADERSHIP ON  THIS TRIBUTE TO OUR LAND AND TO  OUR PEOPLE.  I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THANK  YOU FOR LETTING ME BE PART OF

once a year I walk across the state of Connecticut from Danielson to Danbury I'm walking into small businesses diners book stores most of the people that I meet on the walk they have real things going on in their life but they need help with and this is an opportunities that make sure that they have a senator who's fighting for them I have an obligation to you know not just wait for people to call my office or write my office I've got to be out there in Connecticut talking to people that's why I do this walk that's why I decided to be a United States Senator I'm Chris Murphy and I approve this message

well i've um i've listened last night to the president's uh address with great uh great interest and he was uh i think right in pointing out we spend more money for health care in america than any other country by far we don't get better uh results we have about 14 000 people in this country they're going to lose their health insurance today we've got 47 million americans who don't have any health care coverage at all and what the president said yesterday is is the uh while we try to extend coverage a lot of folks who need that coverage we're going to do that uh by probably two-thirds of the cost of doing that will come from savings uh we uh we probably went to a place today called cleveland clinic up in cleveland ohio and it's a it's it's uh cleveland clinic is a lot like a place called geisinger and uh uh hershey pennsylvania like mayo clinic in minnesota and florida a lot like intermountain health then utah a lot like kaiser permanente and northern california a lot like puget sound up in washington state what they've done they figured out how to provide better health care better healthcare outcomes at lower cost and it's what they've done is that you've gotten rid of the fee for service conundrum where just uh do more more visits more procedures more tasks mris more x-rays sometimes not for a very good purpose and all those uh non-profit clinics around the country big operations among the things that that they do is they focus on primary health care they focus on coordinating care that's focused on the patient not on how do we make the patient better not necessarily how do we reward the uh the the doctors hospitals and nurses they make sure that other patients have electronic health records which help save lives save money save costs provide better outcomes the uh they focus on managing chronic diseases about 80 75 80 of the cost of chronic diseases can be attributed to four factors they include the diet exercise obesity smoking and uh one of the things that these plate like cleveland clinic for the president is today uh they've done a very good job of going after managing chronic diseases so those are some lessons that we can take and need to take to uh to here in the senate as we craft our legislation we'll pass health care legislation not just in my lifetime i think in this year and i know some people are saying we're going too slow what's taking so long it's probably toughest thing that we'll try to do during the time that i have served we're likely to serve in the united states senate it affects most directly six of our gdp and their democrat republican ideas and some of our our uh republican friends are determined to make sure we don't pass a legislative legislation some democrats that are insisting on their uh their things that they have to have so it's just hard to to get 60 votes to get anything done i think in the end though uh what what the president said in his address less than that i especially agreed with you said number one i'm not going to sign legislation this president talk i'm not going to sign legislation that increases the budget deficit we're going to pay for this second he said that uh i'm not going to sign legislation that doesn't reduce the growth reign and the growth of health care costs in this country the idea that healthcare costs are growing at two to three times the rate of inflation and for that to continue that's just unacceptable because eventually we'll run out of money and even if we do extend healthcare coverage to the uninsured right now we're not going to be able to sustain that in the long haul

joining me now is a woman who has denounced the president's recent behaviors behavior democratic representative Karen bass of California she is also be chair of the Congressional Black Caucus madam chair lady of let me ask you first how do you and the Congressional Black Caucus are intend to protect cause lead this is very dangerous and and protect politically and otherwise these four women two of whom are members of the Congressional Black Caucus absolutely two of whom are our freshmen members and we're deeply concerned about the security for all four women so one of the things that we have done and we're going to actually step it up is calling for these women to have more protection they need to have individual security it is a shame that our president actually puts four members of Congress life in danger Ilhan Omar there's already been three people who have been arrested for threatening to kill her arrest arrested Wow now how do you hear from your Republican colleagues we're only fought them voted to denounce the remarks how did the rest of them even explain how they could shrink in this very critical moment to go on the record and say this was racist and say nothing let me just tell you that over these last couple of years my Republican colleagues when they're talking to us privately will admit their concern their shame their embarrassment over what the president says but I have to tell you that this week it's been dead silence absolutely no response from them and I think some of them at this point don't know what to say they're fearful of this guy but you would think at some point you would have to say my integrity means something to me absolutely let me ask you before I want to talk to you about the census that I know you're gonna be enjoying this week the initiative that you Dukakis and and you're leading but I want to ask you about mr. mullahs coming to testify this week yes what are you expecting and how do you think the committee will handle it well first of all I think that we on the Democratic side will be very organized on the Republican side I expect a lot of theatrics this is on the at the committee here yes on judiciary where I serve you serve on the committee yeah I do and I think that you know our focus on judiciary is looking at volume 2 of the report which is obstruction of justice I know a lot of people are intimidated 488 pages that's too much to read but let me just tell your listeners if you just read the executive summary on volume 1 and volume 2 it's only about 20 pages it's really a devastating report for the president there are 10 examples of how the president broke the law and so we said we expect that Muller is going to stay true to the report which means he's not going to give us any additional information but just hearing him talk about what is in the report I think will be more than sufficient report itself reported the report where the president broke the law Muller report lays out ten at least ten examples of how the president broke the law but Muller's rationale is you can't indict a sitting president so I'm not going to say he broke the law I'm just going to give you all of the information and the examples of how he did for example telling McCann his lawyer to get to get my mother fired I mean you know there are just a number telling Lewandowski to go in and fire sessions Louie Kowski wasn't even on the president's staff so there are all of these incidences where he was trying to get the special counsel fired but he wanted people to live for him he wanted other people to do it the only thing that actually saved the president a little bit is that all of those people that he tried to get to break the law for him refused to Wow and if he was any other person he would have ten indictments for the ten examples of obstructing justice we'll be watching you and your committee members let me ask you before I get to senses you and Senator Booker yes have initiated a criminal justice reform move explained its criminal justice has been a lot of my life's work exactly and mine too we share that in common so what senator Booker and I introduced is called a second look it's an opportunity for people who have served longer than 10 years to have their sentences re-evaluated but let me just share something with you Rev because I'm also the acting chair of the Subcommittee on crime so we are looking at criminal justice but I believe that in the criminal justice reform movement women and children have really not received the attention that they deserve right so this week in the committee we had a whole hearing looking at women in the criminal justice system as a matter of fact the woman that created orange is the new black right was one of the witnesses but women have very specific needs number one why women get arrested is different what happens to them while they're incarcerated is different and what happens to them afterwards is different so the majority of women are mothers and the majority of women are the primary caretakers their children's get sent into foster care they're not able to visit their children and a lot of the war on drugs some of the the laws that were used to snare a man who was a drug trafficker actually ensnared women so the conspiracy laws a lot of women but are in prison because of their relationships with men we even had a hearing in Los Angeles with the Congressional Black Caucus and the subcommittee where we looked at reforms that California has passed ballot initiatives that California has passed and we're looking at how they're working and what more is needed another big focus of mine this year is going to be developing programs to help people return and be reintegrated back into their community senses on Tuesday you have a big announcement I don't want you to preempt your announcement but give them ideally well on Tuesday the Congressional Black Caucus is going to launch Congressional Black Caucus census 2020 now all of us have been rightfully focused on the citizenship question in terms of the census but to me an even bigger question is how the census is going to be administered this time it's be administered online so can you imagine households in our communities receiving a postcard telling them to go online and fill out your census form who's going to do that and so we know the census is next spring but we want to begin the work now and so on Tuesday the Congressional Black Caucus is convening African American leaders from around the country and then we will be launching this new task force we're going to get to work now and people don't understand that because that will lead to an undercount if you don't go to work now an undercount regional of resources you know one of the criminal justice issues we need to work on is where you are counted when you're incarcerated so if you are encountered if you are counted in an area that you're not going to return to a rural area then it actually penalize --is our communities where the people come back - all right congresswoman from California Karen bass and when I visit you - Hill they say no the chairlady will see you there thank you for being with us thanks for having me on

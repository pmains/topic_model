THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I WANT -- WANTED TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO TALK ABOUT CHARLOTTE SWEENEY, WHO IS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NOMINEE FOR THE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO. EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW ISN'T AN ABSTRACTION. IT IS HER LIFE'S WORK. A NATIVE OF LITTLETON, COLORADO, CHARLOTTE GREW UP HIKING AND SKIING WITH HER FAMILY ON THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN TRAILS WITHIN AN HOUR OF THEIR HOME. AND TODAY SHE HITS THE SAME TRAILS FOR THE TWO MOST -- WITH THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN HER LIFE, HER CHILDREN. AS MUCH AS SHE LOVES OUR STATE, SHE HAS REMEMBERS A TIME WHEN IT WASN'T EASY FOR LGBTQ COLORADANS LIKE HERSELF TO BE OPEN ABOUT WHO THEY WERE, ESPECIALLY AT WORK. IT WAS A TIME WHEN INSTEAD OF LEADING THE NATION ON EQUALITY, AS WE ARE TODAY, COLORADO ACTUALLY PASSED AN AMENDMENT THAT BLOCKED LAWS TO PROTECT LGBTQ PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATION. I JUST WANT TO PAUSE BY SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY, WELL, YOU CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT DEMOCRACY IS BROKEN. YOU CAN'T MAKE PROGRESS. BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE WAY COLORADO HAS MADE EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS, IT REMINDS ME THAT WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP, THAT CHANGE IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE COLORADO SUPREME COURT DECLARED THAT AMENDMENT UNCONSTITUTIONAL THAT WE HAD PASSED, CHARLOTTE SAW THE POWER OF THE LAW TO TIP THE SCALES, FOR AND AGAINST, FOR OR AGAINST EQUALITY. AFTER GRADUATING SUMMA CUM LAUDE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DENVER SCHOOL OF LAW, SHE JOINED A SMALL FIRM THAT FOCUSED ON REPRESENTING PLAINTIFFS. SHE ROSE TO BECOME A PARTNER IN JUST TWO YEARS. AND JUST TWO YEARS AFTER THAT, SHE BECAME A NAME PARTNER OF THE FIRM. MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT WITH THAT ACHIEVEMENT, BUT CHARLOTTE BEING CHARLOTTE KEPT ON GOING. IN 2008, SHE STARTED HER OWN FIRM TO REPRESENT PEOPLE IN EMPLOYMENT LAW CASES. AND OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, CHARLOTTE HAS BECOME ONE OF COLORADO'S TOP EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEYS, REPRESENTING FEDERAL, STATE, AND PRIVATE-SECTOR WORKERS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY AREA OF -- ASPECT OF EMPLOYMENT LAW. IN ONE CASE, SHE REPRESENTED HER FORMER LAW PROFESSORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DENVER WHO'D BEEN PAID LESS THAN THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES FOR DECADES. SHE OBTAINED $2.6 MILLION IN RELIEF FOR HER CLIENTS ON TOP OF THEIR OVERDUE PAY RAISES. SADLY, THAT OUTCOME ISN'T THE NORM IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM TOO OFTEN SIDES AGAINST WORKERS, EVEN WHEN THE FACTS OF THE CASE ARE ACTUALLY ON THEIR SIDE. THAT IS CORROSIVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW AND IT'S WHY WE NEED MORE JUDGES WITH CHARLOTTE'S PERSPECTIVE. CHARLOTTE'S OBVIOUS CREDENTIALS, HER INTEGRITY AND HER MUCH-NEEDED EXPERIENCE MORE THAN QUALIFY HER FOR HAD ROLE, AND THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT HER NOMINATION. MR. PRESIDENT, IF CONFIRMED, CHARLOTTE WOULD ALSO BECOME THE FIRST OPENLY GAY WOMAN TO SERVE AS A FEDERAL JUDGE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI, A POWERFUL AFFIRMATION OF AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY FOR ALL AND SOMETHING THAT IS JUST LONG OVERDUE. SO I WANT TO THANK THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR SENDING CHARLOTTE, THIS EXCEPTIONAL NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR. AND I URGE MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES TO GIVE HER A STRONG, BIPARTISAN VOTE OF CONFIRMATION. WITH THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE

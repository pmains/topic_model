madam Speaker in advance of the fifth annual missing and murdered indigenous women memorial march that is taking place in my hometown of Duluth Minnesota tomorrow I rise to bring attention to the violence facing our Native American communities everyone has a right to live safely in their communities but the murder rate of Native American women is currently 10 times the national average more than half of Native American women have been sexually assaulted and thousands of Native American women and girls have gone missing this national crisis has been ignored for far too long and it is time that Congress acts that's why I co-sponsored savannahs Act legislation that would better prepare tribal law enforcement to respond to these crimes I believe that this should be one of the easiest bills that we passed this year and call for its quick passage madam Speaker I will be proud to March with our Native American communities this Friday and honor those we have lost I believe that together we can bring justice to the missing and murdered in didn't indigenous with Native American women and hold the individuals who commit these acts of violence accountable madam Speaker I yield back

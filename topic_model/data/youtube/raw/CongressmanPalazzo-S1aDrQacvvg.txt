mr. chairman this is a simple amendment that would increase funding for Community Development financial institutions otherwise known as CDFIs unfortunately the committee mark proposed a fifty nine million dollar reduction in funding from fiscal year 18 levels but with the help of the chairman of the subcommittee and his wonderful staff we've been able to find a path forward my amendment would take the first step towards returning these essential funds by reallocating 25 million dollars to make up part of the shortfall for those of you who aren't familiar CDFI banks take a small amount of public money to leverage private investment in communities that are traditionally underserved with historically high poverty rates for every $1 of public investment since CDF is over $12 a private investment are used to support small businesses create jobs and revitalize the most impoverished communities in America in addition they help put millions on the road to buying homes and establishing personal financial security they also provide essential financial literacy education to their customers I know many of you on this committee represent areas with high poverty rates CDFIs are active in your communities on our and our essential sources of banking for many of our most underserved I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield back the Battlement I'll - of the Chairman mr. Rogers I'd like to identify myself with the gentleman's remarks it's a great amendment the CDF eyes are vitally important in in poor areas like mine and perhaps yours and I would urge that we passed the gentleman's amendment I yield thanks

today on on tax day when American families are filing for the final time under the old code we are here to talk about the economy driven by the tax cuts and Jobs Act it is an economy it's experiencing the lowest unemployment rate since the turn of the century and yet we still have record numbers of individuals on the sidelines and out of the labor force it has created this jobs gap that we've discussed a growing difference between employers demand for workers and the number of individuals in the workforce this is relevant to the committee because we know when individuals and parents work full time the poverty rate drops to just 3% we also know how work supports such as child care case management and transportation when combined with work can can help make the American dream a reality for more Americans mr. secretary what is your view on the jobs gap in the role your department plays as we prepare to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program or TANF how important is cross agency collaboration and coordination mr. chairman thanks for the question and and first let me begin by acknowledging what you made clear which is the the job cap is significant it is real more than six million open jobs in the United States right now as we look at how to fill that cross agency cooperation and collaboration is critical not only with respect to TANF which you referenced but also with respect to workforce education there are currently over 40 different workforce education programs across agencies that that that is a number of programs that often overlap we've requested for now for two years in a row flexibility so that governors can redirect funds within their state from one workforce education program to another education program on the theory that I think is absolutely correct which is all the states are different and Nebraska is going to be very different than California which is very different from Florida and so I would point out it's not just cooperation between the agencies but also flexibility to allow the governor's to focus workforce education funds where they best serve the needs of their states Nebraska I will point out is a great place to do business and even at the height of the Great Recession that rural Nebraska communities were going to high unemployment states and to recruit workers and to fill numerous unfilled jobs and we know that having having too few people to fill a job to fill the jobs will actually draw down economic growth unless the entire region can attract more workers would you have some insight for rural states or even remote areas of the country to address this issue mr. chairman as you point out you know Nebraska's unemployment rate is below the national average and and so the skills gap is particularly acute something that I think is important is if we look at our educational system is their educational system doing everything that it can to address what what is really a skills deficit coming at it in a different way we have traditional education and we have workforce education and we have siloed the two without much communication between them and so my question is this as we think of the universities in each of our state's we're often familiar with how many students they enroll but do we ask how many students do they graduate what jobs those students acquire upon graduation how do those jobs pay and are we really working to to inform those educational systems of the in-demand skills so that they can focus students and just give them the options and so for example study you know there are many people that engage in study Abroad's that my question is if you can do a study abroad why can't you do a semester at a police academy or if you're studying pre-law why can't you do a semester at a law firm all for credit but some professions do that well but many many do not

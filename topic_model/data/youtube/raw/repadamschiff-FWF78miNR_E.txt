now is house intelligence chair adam schiff a member of the january 6 select committee good morning congressman schiff i want to ask you did we hear your strongest evidence in this first hearing or are there new revelations in the upcoming hearings that could offer hard proof that donald trump was responsible for what happened on january 6th i think you heard a good sampling of what you're going to see in the hearings to come the evidence is very powerful that donald trump began telling this big lie even before the election uh that he was saying that any ballots counted after election day were going to be inherently suspect uh that lie continued uh after the election and ultimately uh led to this mob assembling and attacking the capital um and and i think you heard just a few uh examples of what those witnesses have said behind closed doors there's a lot more testimony where that came from and i think most important is that we're weaving together how each line of effort to overturn the election led to another led to another and then ultimately culminated in that violence attack on january 6th would you like to see former president trump criminally prosecuted would that be good for the country i would like to see the justice department investigate any credible allegation of criminal activity on the part of donald trump or anyone else the rule of law needs to apply equally to everyone and there are certain actions parts of these different lines of effort to overturn the election that i don't see evidence the justice department is investigating and of course we have now a federal judge saying that he believes based on the limited set of evidence that he has seen which is far smaller than the body that we've accumulated that the president and others may have committed multiple federal crimes so that should be investigated then ultimately once the evidence is accumulated by the justice department it needs to make a decision about whether it can prove to a jury be on a reasonable doubt the president's guilt or anyone else's but they need to be investigated if there's credible evidence which i think there is chairman benny thompson said the committee will directly link those two extremist groups the proud boys the oath keepers to those in trump's orbit that witnesses will describe actual conversations between them how close to trump how strong do you see that particular evidence you know this has been of course a clear focus of our investigative efforts that is the president's connection to the violence of that day and we'll be presenting what we've found i don't want to predetermine or prejudge the strength of what we will show you we'll show you what we've been able to determine and we'll also talk about the questions that remain unanswered uh but i think when you look at the whole uh the course of the plot to overturn the election the president's knowledge that the big lie that he was articulating was in fact a big lie that is willing to willingness to continue to use that big lie to pressure state legislators to pressure the vice president and ultimately to incite that mob tells you a lot about the president's responsibility and perhaps most powerful is the fact that while this attack was going on he did nothing to stop it to tell people to leave and to protect the vice president or members of congress or our democracy itself but let me ask you again actions let me ask you again is there an actual conversation between people in trump's orbit and and proud boys oath keepers well you know as i think the committees are disclosed uh and has been publicly reported of course there are connections between these white nationalist groups and some in trump's orbit again i don't want to get into specifics of the evidence you'll just have to wait until we get to that point of our hearings but i think what's what's important again is the broad context of all of this uh the the knowledge prior to january 6 that there were going to be violent white nationalist groups assembling along with others on that mall and the decision by the president none the less to incite that mob and do nothing while that attack was taking place you know that dereliction of duty i think is a pa is as powerful as the president's actions his inactions on that day republican vice chair cheney said the committee's investigation found that multiple house republicans sought pardons from the trump white house for trying to overturn the election including representative scott perry pennsylvania a spokesperson for perry called the allegation a soulless lie do you have proof we will show the evidence that we have that members of congress were seeking pardons to me i think that is some of the most compelling evidence of a consciousness of guilt why would members do that if they felt that their involvement in this plot to overturn the election was somehow appropriate so we'll present the evidence that we have as the vice chair outlined along with the evidence of other actions that were taken by members of congress but again i don't want to get too far ahead of the committee and and we'll be presenting that in the days and weeks to come and congressman just quickly if you will as john pointed out cheney also said that writers chanted hang mike pence she said trump responded with this sentiment maybe our supporters have the right idea mike pence deserved that is that an actual quote or just sentiment and who said it why didn't you reveal that um you know we will i think be demonstrating the proof behind that comment everything that the chair and vice chair said during our hearing was you know well documented and analyzed and dotted every eye across every t in in vetting what our committee would say so we'll be presenting the evidence of that and at this point we're not prepared to say who or when but you know tragically as those events were going on and the president was watching from the safety of the white house his aides were trying to implore him to do something and others outside the white house were calling and texting white house staff and mark meadows to try to get them to do something to disperse the crowd to tell them to go home and of course it fell on deaf ears as the president watched this and that's perfectly tragically consistent with donald trump's character which is he doesn't care about anything but himself and so people who are attacking the capital on his behalf uh well you know they were for him and that's all that seemed to matter to donald trump okay thanks so much for joining us this morning congressman and

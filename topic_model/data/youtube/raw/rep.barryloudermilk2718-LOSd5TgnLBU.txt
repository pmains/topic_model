uh Congressman Barry Loudermilk joins me now Congressman you are not only a congressman you're also a member of the aircraft owners and Pilots Association so you know this story any idea what it will take to fix this problem well first of all uh Stuart you got to find out what happened not only am I A Private Pilot I'm I also have an I.T background so the the two are kind of going together here if you have a corrupt database a reboot sometimes will fix it but if it's corrupt that won't fix it that's why you have a redundant system not just a backup system but when it's a mission critical system you have a redundant system A system that is identical to your primary so when you do have to reboot you just kick in your redundant system and now I'm understanding that their backup system failed as well there's a problem of management here now if this happened when I was in the air force that Commander would have already expected to have issued his resignation because of a failure to complete the mission and now we find out this notice to Airmen which I relied on as a pilot as well they renamed it notice of air-to-air missions out of sensitivity look if you're spending that much time with your woke agenda you're not focusing on the safety and the security of the passengers or the pilots the other big story of the morning broke about an hour ago now we know what the the second tranche of secret doc documents we know they were found in Biden's home in Wilmington Delaware I need your judgment on this Congressman how big a story is this well Stuart let's see when the FBI raises home and looks for other documents then let's see how big of a story it is you know that's what I'm wondering where is the FBI why are they not raiding the uh the facility you know when they went to Mar-A-Lago they knew Trump had it they had already told them put them you know under lock and key and he put a padlock on the room he actually had authority to to declassify documents the vice president doesn't why is this not as big of an issue as they're making out of Mar-A-Lago uh the other question is who had access who could have looked at these papers they were in his garage sitting next to his Corvette I believe I mean hunter Biden could have had access to him surely look when I was in the Air Force I was in intelligence I would already be in handcuffs at this point if you found any classified document of any classification even that it was confidential in my private home I would have already been escorted to a Brig I would have been prosecuted pushed out of the Air Force why is not this man held to the same accountability and how long have those documents been packed in a box in his garage it's a republican House of Representatives you're going to investigate oh I'm sure we are and that's one of the things that I've been talking with the speaker about there are so many things that we need to look into on behalf of the American people we have got to root out any corruption that exists in this in in our departments in our agencies especially those that are of a partisan nature everyone should be held accountable we're all under the same Constitution we're all under the same laws but today's environment there's two different sets of laws those for the elitist and those for the rest of us Americans it's a big day in politics and we thank you for taking time out of a very busy day to come and spend some time with us we appreciate it Congress all right thank you sir

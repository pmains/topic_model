preserving the right to object the senator from vermont made a couple statements so i'd just like to repeat the words that were in a crisis this is emergency we can't turn our back on this suffering i agree i've agreed for months but he also said something was completely incorrect you might call it a lie he said republicans have done nothing that's not true i was on daily calls during the august recess after we had attempted and were debating internally a trillion dollar package in tail end of july before the august recess recognizing and i was one of the ones pointing out the fact that had we we'd already passed as a good senator from vermont said over three trillion dollars in different four different coveted relief financial packages early in the pandemic there was one at that point time there was 1.2 trillion of that unspent a big chunk of that wasn't even obligated today as we stand here debating this now we still have a little under 600 billion dollars unspent and unobligated so the point i was making to my republican colleagues that during that uh late the last few weeks in july in those conference calls in august is before we authorize any more money before we further mortgage our children's future why don't we first repurpose and redirect what we already passed because when we passed we passed very quickly because we had to we had to do something massively and we did something massively so that markets wouldn't cease so that the people the individuals are out of work through no fault of their own the businesses that were shut down through no fault of their own could get financial relief and so we came together unanimously we did that but doing it fast doing it massively i certainly knew it was going to be far from perfect well we found out the federal government actually has a hard time spending three trillion dollars because over the course of a number of months they didn't spend it all they couldn't even obligate it so what republicans did during the august recess because we couldn't come to agreement by the end of july we worked long and hard on a targeted bill more than six hundred billion dollars three hundred dollar plus up for people on unemployment 260 billion dollars for small businesses 100 billion dollars for education tens of billions of dollars for vaccines and testing and agriculture in child care and we offer that on the floor 52 republicans voted to proceed to that bill democrats just said no i felt it was a crisis an emergency and we shouldn't have been turning our backs on these people that are suffering in september democrats said no all they had to do was say yes they couldn't take yes for an answer madam president i often use the analogies if i go up to you because i know your generous purpose and say madam president give me 200 bucks kind of look at me a little shock i said well i won't give you 200 but i'll give you a hundred and then i go stomping off and say no it's 200 or nothing that's what the democrats did to over 600 billion dollars in needed and necessary relief for the crisis for the emergency for the people we don't want to turn our backs off toward because they're suffering if they're really serious if they actually wanted a result if they wanted to relieve the suffering when the logical thing had been to do to say yes take 600 billion dollars pocket it get that relief flowing in september then come back and argue for more but they said no they were cynical they played politics with it and that's we're doing here today you know i'm sure to paraphrase a widely known saying that the road to total national bankruptcy is paved with good intentions i'm sure that's true i don't question the good intentions of any member of this body we all want to provide the relief we all want to relieve suffering we all want to help fellow americans that are hurting through no fault of their own but we talk about suffering we use words we don't look at numbers very often because senator from vermont has spouted a few numbers let me quote a couple let me just kind of lay it out i didn't have enough time to do a chart so i'll try and go through this slowly but i think it's important to put this all in perspective prior to covert recession we had the record number of americans employed at the end of december 2019. just under 159 million americans were employed by april two months in the pandemic three months into the pandemic employment had dropped to 133 million that's a loss of over 25 million jobs 25 million which is why we acted why we acted in a bipartisan fashion to provide relief for those people 25 million who lost their jobs now the good news it's hard to keep the american economy down when you don't over tax when you don't over regulate so in november the latest figures we have they're now 150 just shy of 150 million americans employed again now i realize some are underemployed but still you have 150 million americans employed down about 9 million jobs from that record high when unemployment was only 3.5 percent we had a record economy because we stopped over regulating we had a competitive tax system now unemployment rate is 6.7 percent in the cares act which i supported because i want to help people part of that was the economic impact payments basically what the senator from vermont is proposing here in this bill he wants to pass by unanimous consent it spent 274 billion dollars it was paid to just under 160 sides 166 americans for an average check of about 1 673 dollars per person if you break that down into households because according to the federal reserve bank in new york the average check per household is 2400 that's 115 million households that got a check 115 million now remember at the low point 25 million americans had lost their job we sent checks to 115 million households four and a half times the number of people that lost their jobs my problem with the cares act was the first four first the first four packages is it was a shotgun approach we just spent money we just opened up the spigot and we just sent it all over the place we didn't have time to target to those that really need it as a result and we're seeing today businesses that needed it business owners small business owners had been wiped out in their life savings they didn't get relief it wasn't well designed it wasn't well targeted and we probably spent hundreds of billions of dollars and send it to people that didn't need it madam president we're 27.4 trillion dollars in debt today that's 128 size of last year's economy if this bipartisan deal goes through about a trillion dollars we'll be in 28.4 trillion dollars in debt 132 of our of gdp i remember the good old days when i first got here i ran because we were mortgaging our kids future relival for we were a little over 14 trillion dollars in debt and our economy is over 15 trillion we were under 100 debt to gdp ratio but the senator from vermont is proposing is basically duplicating without any reforms that i know of those economic impact payments from the cares act another 275 billion dollars for a total of 550 billion a half a trillion dollars sent out again to 115 million households when right now we've only not only this is tragedy every job loss is a tragedy we have nine million jobs less than we had when we had a record level of employment before the recession nine million jobs lost 115 million households that's 12.6 times the number of jobs that have been lost i think the question needs to be if we do this again is there any sense any information in terms of how the 275 billion dollars was spent well we have an answer from the federal reserve bank of new york they do a monthly internet based survey called the survey of consumer expectations they did two special surveys one in june one in august the june survey took a look at how those households spent the twenty four hundred dollar checks here's the results eighteen percent of those checks were spent on essential consumption essential eight percent was on non-essential the fun stuff i guess three percent donations americans are still generous for a total of 29 percent spent on consumption the marginal propensity to consume was 29 the remainder is 71 percent half of it was put to savings spent on increasing savings the other half was paying off debt they also studied how the unemployment plus up was spent pretty similar results 24 of those dollars went for essential consumer goods four percent non-essential one percent donations for again a total of 29 percent was consumed 71 was either saved or used debt product debt reduction did another special survey in august asking those same 1300 households that they that they survey how would you spend a fifteen hundred dollar check not twenty four hundred fifteen hundred the response was fourteen percent would be spent on essential items seven percent on non-essential three percent on donations for only twenty four percent of a new check would actually be spent on consumption seventy six percent would either be saved or pay off debt that's not very good economic stimulus and again the numbers are without any reforms without trying to target the dollars to people who really need it i would want to do that i would like to work with anybody to try and get that relief flowing as quickly as possible to the individuals that need it and i'm sure the need is still great it's greater than 9 million i understand that but let's look at some figures i do want to point out a past stimulus in terms of its effectiveness in 2009 we had the great recession let me quote some employment figures from that in january 2008 we had 146 million americans employed remember right today we have 149 million our record was 159 million but 146 before the great recession by december 2009 that had dropped hit the low point of 138 million people working 8 million people lost their jobs in january 2009 president obama was inaugurated had total control of government a filibuster-proof senate controlled the house he could pass anything he wanted and they did they passed the 787 billion american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009. they did that in february 2009. at that point there were 141.6 million americans working 141.6 million americans and the unemployment rate was 8.3 percent again throughout 2009 that stimulus didn't work too good because employment fell to 138 million americans it took three years three years till january 2012 because of over regulation and over taxation to return to february 2009 levels of 141.6 million americans working three years that's what we call a slow non-existent recovery oh a quick aside senator sanders is sen the senator from vermont is talking about we need the 600 dollar plus up for the unemployed because the suffering president obama was speaker pelosi and majority leader reed with filibuster proof senate they provided a 25 per week plus up to state unemployment when they had total control now they're demanding 600. i know that's not part of what the center for vermont is asking for in terms of a unanimous consent request i thought it's just somewhat noteworthy so again madam president i'm not heartless i want to help people i voted to help people i voted for the 2.2 trillion dollar cares act but i also am concerned about our children's future and the fact that we are mortgaging it we do not have an unlimited checking account we have to be concerned about these things so my complaint about the center for for from vermont's bill and quite honestly the bipartisan effort we have six hundred billion dollars unspent unobligated let's work long and hard let's look at economic data let's target it properly let's not just shotgun it out to the economy again wasting tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars let's focus on that let's pretend it's like real money like it's our money and spend it well we don't need to mortgage our children's future by another three or four hundred billion dollars we don't need to do that we can alleviate suffering we can help our fellow americans we could have done it in september but the good center for vermont and all of his colleagues on the democrat side simply won't take yes for an answer and my guess is they're taking that same stance today so madam president i object

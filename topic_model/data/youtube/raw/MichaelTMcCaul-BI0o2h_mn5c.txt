upon us showers Heather's era says should clear away by the time the kids at the street maybe a scattered shower here and there but you should have ample opportunity to get your hands in some candy wine welcome to the program our guest this morning congressman Michael McCaul from the 10th district here in the great state of Texas congressman McCaul is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security congressman welcome back to the cells 80 show Thank You morning Chris thanks for getting me okay let's let's start off with some politics first and then I want to get into some foreign policy discussion here number number one I know you probably saw the debate I have called on the RNC rights Priebus to stop subjecting our candidates to clearly biased individuals in the what I call the Brian Williams press and start getting into debate situations where conservative principles can actually be debated as we prep our candidates to face the Democrat in the election cycle what do you think about that well you know I agree i think you know rights rights previously RNC chair his job is to negotiate the rules in the structure of these debates this was the most unbalanced line questioning and i think is one of the candidates said it's like the media is a super panic for the liberals I think it was just outrageous that questioning rights needs to step up to the plate or step down from this office because and I think you're going to see all the care that's kind of coming together and raising this issue with it laughing it was just a you know it just shows you how biased media is out there indeed let's move on to something that had just happened as we have been treated to two votes which conservatives are and you know what anybody that has an a mind on the debilitating crippling debt that we have in this in this country we have a two year budget a Boehner Obama deal and i can throw mcconnell in there as well and the export-import bank which is the resurrecting of crony capitalism at its worst how did you vote on both of those measures I thought it against both of these measures that's yeah you vote your district and then you vote the right thing to do I thought it gets both of these measures number one Christie gives away the way it was done you know in the XM date case they went around the committee structure they went along regular order and they threw this thing on the floor it is corporate welfare it's chronic applause I'm you're not hard against bailout back in the day for the same reason I don't think the federal government no bailing out payday companies and corporations and picking winners and losers and so I could not in good conscience support that and of course the debt ceiling didn't as you mentioned I mean leadership at a deal with Obama in a matter of days and then completely bypass the Budget Committee as a chairman of the full committee I don't like it when they do that and then I get through it on the floor it raises the debt ceiling for two years with really little in return there's not a dollar for dollar offset it doesn't fully support our military which i think is very important right now and it's like you know it's like to use your credit card saying yeah I'm going to make a payment but about to give me just unlimited you know unlimited credit for the next two years and we'll just we'll talk in two years about their hey this is highly irresponsible to the taxpayer young Mike Mullen Admiral Motti blowin in former chair of the Joint Chiefs so that our debt is really the biggest national security risk that we have and the reasoning said that is because this writing debt squeezes out our domestic spending which goes towards our national defense and you know I'm congressman let me interrupt you by the way congressman Michael McCaul 10th district here in the great state of Texas this very subject was brought up in the Fox News Channel last night I have a listen to Bret Baier the anchor of special report and George will as they make an analysis on the debt what you and I are talking about listen to this George I said in that national debt piece and we stand at eighteen point two trillion dollars national debt tonight that were always it seems one election away from getting the big is done this is going to happen this next session in a presidential election and someday they're going to have something other than zero interest rates that's made big government cheap by making the borrowing cheap once we go back to anything like the post-war norm for the cost of borrowing say five percent the deficit itself becomes the driver of the deficit and the budget explodes in congressman when that happens it's goodbye america when and you can't pay for everything else because you're financing the the interest payments on your massive debt it all goes to pot and and it seems those who teamed up congressman with all democrats because you know this is what Democrats do they like bankrupting the country this is what they do so those Republicans in my view who any establishment and those others who cast their votes with Democrats have no claim to the mantle of conservatism have no claim to the mantle of being a Republican and are contributing to the ultimate demise of the country tell me where I'm going wrong well I bet you ride the interest alone on the debt is crushing and if you look at the trajectory of the pie chart as the you know the interest is going to take up a lot of the pie we're not going to have any money left to fund our military because it's all going to be entitlement spending which is a key to this think we can't reform in town this mannequin can't reform the tax code a gift this debt down we're on a path to destruction which is why I couldn't support this chris i thought it was again you're responsible i do think it's a defining vote i had a lot of pressure obviously put on me by leadership being a chairman and you know i'm i'm not going to bow down to that i'm going to do the right dates my constituents and i think I did the right thing for my constituents here all right let's turn to what's in the news lately congressman Michael McCall he is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security China and Russia's aggression let's deal with the Russian aggression first as it was highlighted yesterday Russian bombers came within a mile of the USS Ronald Reagan and the official story coming out the administration in some of the military brass has added no big deal that this was no big deal yes we scrambled for f-18 Hornets to intercept them we were doing joint operations with the South Koreans but hey no no big deal uh I don't believe that sir am I am I am i right in having skepticism about how big a deal this is that's a big deal I mean this is the biggest act of aggression by Russia and in quite some time probably since the Afghan war and they are filling the vacuum when I talk to retired generals and admirals they they tell me this is what you get when you have a president that can't make a decision and you SAT around for years not coming up with a strategy and a plan to deal with Isis and now we have Russia in there and when I look at their target packages or strike secrets they're they're not hitting Isis with their military strikes there's hitting these anti-assad forces in Syria and they're just doing that to be reinforced the regime and prop up Assad who's there proxy in Syria and they they have these ports there there are strategic interests now we have Iranian in Iraq and Syria in Cuba doing this is a way out of balance now and this is like the old adage weakness and bites aggression this is what happens we don't have a strong commander-in-chief and early had it for too long now and this world has become a far more dangerous place and I think you look at the iraq-syria problem the growth of Isis and the inability to deal with it now the with the Russians in there it's getting very very difficult yeah perfect segue into talking about the next challenge which is a Chinese government which by the way just reversed their one-child policy because now they sense a gear up they're going to need human capital number one but here the administration to its credit sends a US destroyer to sail within 12 miles of this illegal basis these illegal bases on these man-made islands the Chinese are setting up in the South China Sea then when asked about it the administration tries to hide the fact that we did this I just don't understand where it seems that mr. Obama's audience is the foreign adversaries that we have rather than the American people well this isn't this is a false narrative that was president he constantly downplays the threat whether it's the threat of Islamist terrorism you know when it goes back to Fort Hood the workplace violence Benghazi video and winning you know Isis not a problem JV team and now you know units and make it aggression by Russia but that's that seems to be okay and then now this advanced with like China I think they smell weakness they're taking advantage of that weakness and now they're expanding into these islands in the Pacific and not to mention cresta fact that China breached our our federal government and install it enacted espionage 20 million security clearances national security clearances from 20 million Americans that they are using out to exploit for like two compromised individuals in espionage so the neck down is completely unchecked is in no response no consequence to that you know whatsoever I think we just really need a commander chief that can leave the world with post-war tues as a superpower leave this world as a superpower and not let these other countries to get away with this stuff nah question really quickly congressman's I'm up against the clock here if the Chinese are allowed to set up military bases and illegally in the South China Sea will that be a threat to not only commerce but also a threat to the United States interests abroad it is is a threatening a threat to Taiwan and in other countries in the region because it's an act of aggression that's going unchecked and I'm afraid this administration's just going to let it happen without any consequence I would respond like Reagan did he would not like aggression staying in the world and and made that clear policy problem is there's no clear policy foreign policy throughout the world and there's a lot of uncertainty and this is what you get with a good foreign policy and so you know if I just we gotta win the White House back that's absolutely I can say the consequence of electing liberals folks you get a weaker and diminished America congressman Michael McCaul from the 10th district here in the great state of Texas sir appreciate your carving out time for the cells 80 show I really thanks for having Chris I appreciate it all right

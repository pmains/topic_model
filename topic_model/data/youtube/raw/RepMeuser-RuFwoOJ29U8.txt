chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania mr muser for five minutes thank you very much mr chairman and thank you to our ranking member as well thank you to all of you a very important subject i can i can see in your eyes you're you're living this and it's uh very essential to your your business uh livelihood um so the the questioning that's taking place here is specific and boy that's what we need to do and as the chairman stated earlier that he's been dealing with such uh bureaucracy and uh less than business efficiencies in these uh in these requirements for for many many years and i'm and i'm hearing all that so my first question would be to miss robinson burnett and i i think i already know the answer but do you have a a white paper outlining some strong suggestions of what would be in the interests of of the contracting uh that we could have and and we could work on to actually try to implement do you have such a such a plan already written um thank you congressman for the question i don't have a white paper but my uh written testimony is 15 pages long that goes in depth about the recommendations that i've offered today beautiful i i summarized it i'm sorry i didn't read the whole thing but but that that will suffice um okay so so next the administrative burdens of the government places on small businesses um that everybody's agreeing uh we want to reduce uh the fraud end of it you said that's one to two percent and i agree with that i i think a little bit of a phone call and a little bit of data analysis and today's information age shouldn't be all that difficult to determine whether it's a real company or a phony baloney company now in the same note we just came off of idle and we had some really rush initiatives which are very familiar with that that did have some significant fraud in them so it's got to be a concern um quickly uh uh miss lee let me go to you if you would what is what what can be eliminated from that so as we can have integrity and efficiency thank you from my own experience the individual ada program seems to be administered better than the 8 a mentor project joint venture program so leo has been in that jv program for six years now there is a lot of opportunity for the sba to really exert oversight and improve its uh its oversight to stop the abuse from the mentors to its small business proteges that's where my personal experience has been okay has been focused so you all must be aware of some companies and you've experienced in yourself that engage in the in the contracting for your eligibility for for the contract itself and just run into um barriers that are don't make a lot of sense to you but you need to overcome anyway because it's a very important contract um does this happen does that happen regularly and do you know other companies that just give up because it seems too burdensome yes i think thank you for the question sir absolutely through through the nine-year journey the first three years i almost gave up hope uh this is after surviving two recessions surviving in commercial for 14 for 14 years and still facing the challenges of the first i mean i thought 80 would be to the rescue but i of course in the third year i got blessed with the first u.s air force contract then i started to foresee a few other challenges which are the roadblocks which are clearly distinguishing on why they they're there so what i started to notice is the consolidation efforts bundling efforts scope creeps on the existing requirements just to make them above the direct award threshold by the agencies so that they could make it competitive or be awarded to the super radios and that was a big loss of the development dollars which are much essentially needed for the development firms like myself uh another common one uh seen is the the category management and once we are graduating those area requirements are being removed from the ada to small business or some other category which i believe strengthening the pcrs at the sba which are procurement representatives they are are you know safeguards protecting the program and the requirements within the ada program they need to be empowered should have the influence to the agencies and the additional scorecard mechanisms and i've highlighted a few in my 10-page testimony lastly in a very limited time um do you find that ineligible companies are gaining are gaining gaming the system and gaining the contracts more in an unfair manner uh sure within the ada program i believe that's very well vetted uh at least the area part the other social economic i'm not too preview about but there may be some yeah okay and is payment as are there any reasons that peop that businesses don't apply because the payment's not there the uh requirements are are too costly and i know i'm over my time chairman but a quick answer to that is that do some small businesses not apply because it's simply not worth it please miss robinson bernard um as i said over 2 300 firms apply every year they're applying um only 300 are being brought in firms are paying advisors four to ten thousand dollars to do applications for them um so they're interested it's just very difficult to get through the cumbersome process at the sba not relative to eligibility but mistakes or in the application that has nothing to do with are they eligible see we'll certainly work on this and thank you and thanks for your indulgence mr chairman for being over gentlemen

I GOVERNMENT GROUPS THAT ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE FORMER PRESIDENT BY FORCE. JOINING US NOW, IS CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRATIC CALIFORNIA, MEMBER OF THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT ON A REALLY IMPORTANT NIGHT FROM AN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. I WONDER IF YOU THINK WE ARE FINALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO REFRAME JANUARY 6TH FOR WHAT IT WAS, COURTESY OF THESE GUILTY VERDICTS THIS EVENING? >> -- I THINK THAT UP TO THIS POINT JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE ALSO PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT HOLE IN ESTABLISHING WHAT TOOK PLACE, THAT THIS WAS A CONCERTED PLOT TO INTERFERE WITH THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. BUT TONIGHT, A DRAMATIC EXCLAMATION POINT, A BIG VICTORY FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, A BIG VICTORY FOR JUSTICE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO BE CONVICTED OF USING FORCE TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE WITH A LAWFUL FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT IS VERY RARE, IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE, AND WE WILL HAVE OTHER RECUR PERCUSSION'S BEYOND THE PUBLIC IMPRESSION. AS YOU POINT OUT, THERE'S ANOTHER TRIAL COMING UP A, COUPLE OF TRIALS ONES THAT INCLUDES DIFFERENT WHITE NATIONALIST AND VIOLENT GROUP AND THE DEFENDANTS IN THAT CASE MAY BE THINKING, PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO PLEAD GUILTY CONSIDERING HOW THIS TRIAL WENT. SO BIG IMPACTS HERE. AND MAYBE MORE PEOPLE WILLING TO COOPERATE AND LIGHT OF THIS JURY DECISION. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS POTENTIAL CULPABILITY FOR JANUARY 6TH GIVEN THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE INTACT WITH HIS ADVERSARIES IF YOU WILL HAVE NOW BEEN CHARGED AND FOUND GUILTY OF SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY? >> -- [INAUDIBLE] IT SHOWS THE DEPARTMENTS NOT AFRAID TO BRING SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGES. NOW HAVE TO LOOK AT OKAY WHO WAS, INVOLVED IN INCITING, GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO THOSE INVOLVING CAN SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY. I THINK IT HAS CONSEQUENCES GOING UP THE LADDER OF RESPONSIBILITY. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S GOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER STATUTES THAT APPLY TO THESE DEFENSES, LIKE OBSTRUCTING A LAWFUL FUNCTIONS OF THE CONGRESS, WHICH THESE DEFENDANTS WERE ALSO CONVICTED OF. WHICH THE JUDGES ALREADY SAID THERE'S EVIDENCE AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT. FINALLY, THESE ARE PEOPLE, THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT PARDONING SHOULD HE EVER HOLD OFFICE AGAIN. AND THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE DINING WITH WHITE NATIONALISTS, BUT ALSO TALKING ABOUT PARDONING THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOW BEEN CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT BY FORCE. THAT OUGHT TO BE DISQUALIFYING FOR ANYONE INCLUDING HIM. >> CONGRESSMAN, WHAT ABOUT THE COMMITTEE WORK IN TERMS OF JANUARY SIX? SOME SUGGESTING THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE SOME INFORMATION THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR CALCULUS. DO YOU HAVE NEW INFORMATION? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT EMERGED FROM ALL OF THIS, THIS TOUR ROSE TO OFFICE ADDITIONS CONSPIRACY AS WELL AS HIS CODEFENDANTS THAT HAS CHANGED YOUR CALCULUS OR THAT YOU CAN FORESEE CHANGING YOUR CALCULUS? >> WE HAVE CERTAINLY LEARNED BY WHAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS DOING IN THE SENSE THAT WE WATCH WHAT THEY CHARGE IN INDICTMENTS, WE WATCH WHAT THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY GIVE PER CHILD. IT HELPS FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE, AND I THINK CONVERSELY, THE HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE HELD, THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE PRODUCED AND WHEN WE SUBMIT OUR REPORT AND WHEN WE RELEASE TRANSCRIPTS AND OTHER MATERIALS IT WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE. SO -- IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE JURY VERDICT ITSELF CHANGES OUR THINKING, IT REALLY DOESN'T CHANGE OUR THINKING SO MUCH AS VALIDATE EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN PRESENTING TO THE COUNTRY WHICH WAS, THIS WASN'T SOME SORT OF SPONTANEOUS RIDE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL OR PEOPLE BEING SWEPT AWAY BY A MOTION. NOW, THIS WAS A PLOT CONDUCTED IN ADVANCE TO USE FORCE TO TRY TO STOP THE PEACEFUL PANT TRANSFER OF POWER. I THINK THIS JUST HIGHLIGHTS HOW PREMEDITATED IT WAS AND WHEN YOU ADD THE EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE SUBMITTED TO THE PUBLIC OF THE PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE ARMED AND DANGEROUS AND AS YOU SAID ON JANUARY SIX, HE WANTED THE EFFING MAGS TAKEN DOWN BECAUSE HE WAS FINE WITH THOSE PEOPLE MARCHING TO THE CAPITAL WITH WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T THERE TO HURT HIM. >> I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME REPORTING ABOUT WHAT THE ACTUAL PUBLIC'S GOING TO SEE IN TERMS OF REPORTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHEN YOUR WORK IS DONE. THERE'S BEEN SOME REPORTING THAT IT'S GONNA BE SHOWCASE IS GONNA BE LARGELY ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY WITH THE OATH KEEPERS, THEIR ROLE AT ALL THIS, GIVEN THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING ABOUT THE SECURITY APPARATUS, AND WE'LL BE TALKING LATER IN THE SHOW BUT THE SECRET SERVICE, AND THE SORT OF SYSTEMWIDE FAILURES THAT LED TO JANUARY SIX, WHAT SHOULD THE PUBLIC EXPECT FROM THE COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE TOTALITY OF THE FINDINGS THAT WILL BE RELEASED ONCE THE WORK IS DONE? >> OUR CHARTER WAS A BROAD CHARTER. TO SET OUT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE VIOLENCE, THE REASONS WHY THE CAPITAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE NOT BETTER PREPARED FOR WHAT TOOK PLACE. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE, WHO WAS CULPABLE? I THINK OUR REPORT OUGHT TO REFLECT WHAT OUR MISSION WAS. WE ALSO SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THE FUNCTION OF OUR COMMITTEE, WHICH IS NOT JUST TO INFORM THE COUNTRY BUT TO PRESCRIBE REMEDIES TO PROTECT US GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S A BROAD CHARTER. SO I'M CERTAINLY URGING THAT THE REPORT BE AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE I'M SURE WILL REACH A CONSENSUS ON THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED, THAT EVERYTHING IS FACTUAL AND I THINK PART OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE PAST IS MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS NAILED OUT AND WE WANT TO DO THAT IN THE REPORT, IT'S APPENDICES AND WHATEVER ACCOMPANIES IT AS WELL. >> I'D HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR YOU AS WELL. I KNOW THE COMMISSION WAS TALKING WITH TONY ORNATO, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE PRESIDENT SECRET SERVICE DETAIL, IT'S ALSO THE TWO AIDE TO THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING IS TESTIFIED TODAY THAT CONFLICTED WITH THE ACCOUNT WE GOT FROM CASSIDY HUTCHINSON OVER THE FIGHTING WHETHER THE SECRET SERVICE WOULD TAKE THE PRESIDENT BACK TO THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6TH? >> AS YOU IMAGINE, I CAN'T REALLY GO INTO THE CONTENTS OF HIS TESTIMONY. WE DID INTERVIEW HIM. IT WAS A LENGTHY INTERVIEW. -- WE HAVE COME TO THAT OPINION. I'M GONNA LET THE REPORT SPEAK FOR ITSELF WHEN THAT COMES OUT. BUT AGAIN, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WHAT KIND OF REFERRALS TO MAKE AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WITH REFER BACK TO MR. ORNADO. BUT WE WILL BE REPORTING TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO POTENTIALLY THAT'S ALSO A MATTER OF OUR DISCUSSION, WILL BE WRAPPING THAT UP VERY SOON. WE HOPE TO PUT OUR PEN DOWN, CEMENT THE REPORT TO THE PRINTERS IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO WE CAN GET THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> WHILE, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GREATLY AWAIT THAT REPORT.

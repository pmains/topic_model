you nowhere but in South Mississippi will you find some of the kindest most compassionate people Evers where neighbors know their neighbors and they help each other out that's the basic thing of being a good citizen being a good neighbor is is helping others one of the rewards of being in Congress it comes down to the ability to serve others whether I'm fighting for our shipyard and angles to make sure that our men and women and the Marine Corps Navy have the equipment the tools that they need to go be able to do their job and do it well and come back home to their loved ones to trying to balance the budget that's what I believe is the greater purpose of being here it's to protect the things that have made this country great and also preserving the American dream for future generations so that we will have job opportunities that we won't be a nation drowning in debt that people actually have an opportunity to pursue the American dream that many of us have grown up with I was fortunate enough I grew up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast my front yard is the Gulf of Mexico in my backyard is the Pine Belt the stretches all the way up to my alma mater and university of southern mississippi and my family grew up is golden eagles my kind of rebelled against the college my parents wanted me to go to so i decided to go to Mississippi State and I went there for my first semester thanksgiving break i decided i wanted to join the united states marine corps following the steps and my grandfather and my uncle and so i joined the marine corps and about a year or so later i made it back to Mississippi State for my second semester and during the Thanksgiving holiday again I was activated to go serving the Persian go for so what I felt like is my destiny was USM so eventually i migrated to Hattiesburg and have no regrets I thought becoming vice president of the Student Government Association was was a big thing but I think my biggest accomplishment was convincing my wife who I met for the first time out in front of the student union you know to marry me at first she thought I was a nerd and I thought she was beautiful but I definitely I got the better end of the deal after college I did a lot you know I first went to work for a CPA firm in hattiesburg mississippi a very very good CPA firm but also still had a desire to join the United States Marine Corps as a commissioned officer so I left there and anticipation of working out and getting mentally and physically in shape to go become a United States Marine Corps officer somewhere along the way i forgot that i actually have to pay rent and pay bills so i took a job working offshore in the gulf of mexico and next thing you know I didn't pursue my dreams of being a Marine officer but I ended up in Houston Texas for a big company and next thing you know I'm working in Hungary working in Bosnia working in used becca Stan then eventually coming back to the Mississippi Gulf Coast I set up and establish my very own CPA firm I think family is absolutely important in fact if you ever asked me you know what's most important to you Steven I'd say it's the 4 f's I'd say it's my faith it's my family is my friends and it's my flag I've been truly blessed I've got a great family great wife three great kids and in the end if anybody asked me why I do what I do is I do it for them I feel like one of my larger purposes of being in Congress is to continue to fight them make America you know the exceptional country it is you know 400,000 Americans sacrifice to make sure that we are the freest nation on earth we owe them everything for their courage their commitment and bravery their loss and their sacrifices as I work through my committees and as I'm will representing the families of South Mississippi I'm focused on how am I assuring that America remains exceptional I believe in bringing south Mississippi values to Washington DC and bring in Washington DC inside the beltway values back in Mississippi

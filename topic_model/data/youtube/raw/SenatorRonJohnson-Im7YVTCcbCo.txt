joining me right now is wisconsin senator chairman of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee the one who first released the report on all of these dealings uh a while ago ron johnson is here senator it's good to see you this morning thanks very much for being here good morning maria so i want to ask you really where are we in this but first give me your reaction to tony babalinsky last night in that interview what struck you well you played two of the most important words that he spoke yesterday the other one was you know some plausible deniability and of course we have one email back on may 20th 2017 where somebody's writing this is actually james gillier writing to tony boblinski don't mention joe being involved it's only when you are face to face i know you know that but they are paranoid so yeah they were definitely trying to set this thing up where there's plausible deniability but i think the other important word is compromised you know if if there is a biden presidency i don't think anybody working in the white house with these types of connections uh would he actually get a security clearance because because those individuals be would be compromised and you know the other question i'd ask maria you know this is a statement out of joe biden he said he not one single solitary thing was out of line not a single thing well if that's the truth why was you why was vice president biden lying why is he lied repeatedly about never talking to a hunter about his overseas business which now we know there are multiple cases that have proven that that is one big fat lie what do you mean you've done all the research and you've been studying this now for a couple of years what do you think was going on here senator i mean we have a list of these deals that we're going to show and you know one deal is the five million dollars that went through a hunter biden company from cefc that is the chinese company another deal was the three and a half million dollar wire transfer that hunter biden accepted from the former mayor's wife of moscow uh elena batarina and then he creates a one billion dollar investment fund bhr with the state-owned bank of china just weeks after traveling on air force two with joe biden then sitting vice president to meet these guys from the bank of china and they give him one and a half billion dollars total and then of course he's received all this money by being on the board of barisma 83 000 a month totaling 4.3 million dollars what were they doing deals like this before joe biden was vice president yeah absolutely there's plenty of evidence on the public record and back when the news media actually might have been more in favor of let's say elizabeth warren or bernie sanders back in august of 2019 political actually kind of wrote about a 20-page story about biden inc and basically documenting how james biden and hunter biden had been trying to profit off the by name for four years while joe biden was senator uh they really seemed to crack the code about 2013 2014 though with the breeze mcdeal obviously you talked about the transfer from from the widow of the former mayor of russia and then you know all the entanglements within china so they really figured out exactly how to make money off the by name and and basically knew how to use his influence uh to hoover up that money so you know this is obvious what was happening it's just another scandal the way that the news media is completely ignoring this story and the story's not going waymarie it's not going away well is it i mean that i mean it shouldn't go away and now a growing number of republican senators are calling for attorney general bill barr to appoint a special counsel to investigate hunter biden i've got that story that you mentioned from politico right here it's biden inc from politico and you're right it was august 2019 over his decades in office political rights middle class joe's family fortunes have closely tracked his political career do you want to see a special counsel yeah i'm not a big fan of special counsels but if joe biden wins the presidency i don't see how you avoid one otherwise this is going to be you know tucked away we will we will never know what happened all this evidence is going to be buried so i think we'd have to have a special election joe biden wins but here's another question maria you know john solomon has a great article uh taking a look at joe biden's tax returns where he reports 16 million dollars of income since he left office but his financial disclosure only shows 3.2 million dollars in assets uh you know john talked to a tax advisor said that his net worth ought to be at least nine million dollars where'd the other six million dollars go now i'm hoping people are starting to take a look in uh you know the caribbean the the cayman islands that type of thing to find out you know where might that six million dollars be tucked away inquiring mines want to know do you believe the bidens have an account in the cayman islands i have no idea but again i'm just questioning if you make 60 million income you've only got 3.2 million dollars to show for it you know either you are one enormous big spender or something's happened and again there's just so many financial entanglements there's just so much buried you know our report it just scratched the surface it just raised troubling questions it didn't answer it you know didn't answer all the questions by a long shot but again we need the investigative press to start looking into this thing i simply don't have the resources it took us months under a great deal of resistance from all these agencies trying to get some information but we just we just laid out you know really the questions and quite honestly people like tony babalinsky when he saw a report i think one of the things that really prompted him to come forward is he saw that five million dollars should have gone into sign a hawk went directly to the biden's i i think that kind of upset him together with the fact that adam schiff lied again i think that really came across like you know in last night's interview that really was sort of the straw that broke tony's back there when when you had not only adam schiff then you have these 50 former intelligence officials writing a cover letter for joe biden no evidence whatsoever but but they used the the russian interference canard one more time to divert america's attention from all this potential wrongdoing say oh it was just russian disinformation nothing could be further from the truth in this case well we've heard from john ratcliffe the sitting director of national intelligence and he told us that weeks ago that this is not in fact any russian disinformation real quick i just asked you they didn't do deals before the vice president was in his position you say they cracked the code in 2014 so in other words they were not doing deals with foreign companies before joe biden was vice president is that right well i i don't know i don't have evidence of it but we really started finding evidence of it 2013 2014 the barista the russia deal all the entanglements with china it sure seemed like that was a point in time it was it was a famous trip with that hunter took a joe biden in december 2013 a couple weeks later uh what is a bhr uh finally got the license to do business and that was that uh you know billion dollar plus investment fund that joe biden shook the hands of jonathan lee the the main the main investor of that fund and again claims that i never talked to to hunter about his overseas business deals i mean just a bold face lie unbelievable what really bothers me is the fact that they rush through approvals so chinese companies can acquire american companies that's all we talk about on this program how china is eating our lunch and here you have uh this partnership because they're lining their pockets with millions just saying oh get the get the approval for china to acquire our intellectual property senator it's good to see you thank you we'll keep following it and uh certainly we are here following this story uh and will not suppress it senator thank you we'll be right back

in investigations mr. McHenry gentleman from North Carolina is recognized for two minutes a mr. speaker and I want to thank the committee chairman as well mr. hensel link for recognizing me and my colleague and Wagner from Missouri for putting together this very wise bill I would say to my Democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle they're speaking out with loud voices that the only ripoff here is when as retail investors in the American people have two different government agencies writing rules they're not coordinating with each other they're not talking to one another they're not writing rules that work together in fact you could be a retail investor and be complying with the Department of Labor's rules but running counter to the skewers and Exchange Commission rules if this coordination is not done as required by this legislation so the retail investor Protection Act is just that it protects retail investors it reconciles uncoordinated efforts between the securities exchange commission and US Department of Labor and it says that they have to work together and also use a cost-benefit analysis when they're writing these rules I think that's a very wise thing and in fact the court system has agreed it's a wise thing 44 members of the House Financial Services Committee thought it was a wise thing while only 13 opposed passing this out and also we have ten Democrat United States senators have written to the office of management and budget making an identical request is this bill to the SEC that the SEC act first in writing these rules before they come together so today it's not only a bipartisan vote but it's also bicameral both the House and the Senate and I would ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill coming out of financial services to make sure that our government agencies actually coordinate when they write rules and let's actually and protect retail investors and do that first and I yield back gentlelady from California

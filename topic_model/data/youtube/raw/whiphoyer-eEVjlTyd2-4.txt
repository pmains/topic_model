cretak whip mr. Hoyer from Maryland is recognized for three minutes I was here in 1981 they said the 1981 bill would pay for itself David Stockman a former colleague from Michigan was here and he was at OMB then and a few years later he wrote a book and he said I said it would pay for itself and I knew that was not true the same could be said of this bill mr. speaker history will indeed remember this vote future generation of Americans will remember who cast their votes to raise taxes on 86 million middle-class households and heap another 1.5 trillion in deficits on to our children and to our grandchildren they will remember who cares their votes for a plan that gives 83 percent of its benefits to 1% of the American people they will remember that President Trump promised that the middle class would give a tax cut and the wealthy individuals like him would not before turning his back on that promise they will remember those who cast their votes to kick 13 million Americans off their health insurance coverage and they will remember those who acted with the full knowledge that their votes would trigger a 25 billion dollar cut in Medicare I know you said you're gonna waive it which will simply add 25 billion more to the deficit but posterity will also remember those who stood up in the face of this dangerous and partisan bill and said no and those of us who vote against it are doing so not because we oppose tax reform on the country we recognize as most Americans do that this bill is not tax reform it is a tax giveaway to those who don't need our help paid for by those who do this is a reckless and dangerous deficit spending at its worst in 1986 Democrats and Republicans work together in good faith in over many months in an open transparent and regular order process to craft real bipartisan tax reform that helped the middle class without adding a dime to the deficit not a single dime this has not been an open process this has not been bipartisan this has not been transparent or through regular order this raises taxes as I said on 86 million Americans who will pay more taxes ten years from now than they do today this gives 83 percent of the tax cuts to the top one percent not the $59,000 family that Paul Ryan talked about but to those families making over $900,000 a year gentlemen in additional one minute gentleman is recognized for an additional bill adds 1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit this is not tax reform so Republicans may pat themselves on the back in the coming days for having finally passed something out of Congress unfortunately it's a bad thing I urge them to remember that this vote may be the most consequential in their careers not positively I say to my friends across the aisle stand up and say no with us and commit to start working on a product all members of the chamber can be proud of as was the case in 1986 that's what Ronald Reagan did in 1986 Reagan did not go down this reckless and irresponsible path stand up for the principles you used to espouse but are now about to abandon stand up for fiscal responsibility stand up for the middle class stand up for what the American people hope we would do this is not it gentleman from Texas mr. speaker I'm proud to yield two minutes the gentlelady from South Dakota Miss nomer gentlelady from South Dakota is recognized

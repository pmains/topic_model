thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you to both of you for your work on the bill I will say a bit more first let me just speak to Senator Paul's Association health plans amendment listen the free market doesn't work very well for a complicated cancer patient because the free market provides no incentive for an insurance company to cover someone who is expensive someone who is going to ultimately need millions of dollars of care and so we made a decision in the Affordable Care Act that we were going to guarantee that people weren't gonna have to pay more because of how sick they were how sick their child was and well Republicans spent a lot of time trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act there was some general agreement that that was probably a sound policy premise the problem with Association health plans is that is it is a creative way around the idea that we should all be paying the same thing no matter what our medical history is because Association health plans can be defined the group membership can be defined in a way that very specifically includes healthier people and excludes people that are not healthy you can create the definition of who's in your association who's in your group any way you want and there are lots of ways that very creative people will find to make sure that the healthy people are inside and the not so healthy people are on the outside and if you see this explosion in Association health care plans what you will see is an explosion and cost for sick people once again so I just speak against that amendment I am offering and asking for a vote on Murphy amendment two and I'm asking for this and I'll explain it in a moment because as grateful as I am for the important provisions that are in this bill I do feel a little bit as if we are applying as a government a bandage to a cut on one arm well we are sawing off the patient's other arm the reality is in two weeks this administration will go to court to ask for the entirety of the Affordable Care Act to be struck down that is a humanitarian catastrophe in this country if it occurs it means 20 million plus individuals lose health care overnight and everybody who Sic has to pay more kids who are on their parents health care plans no longer can be on them lifetime caps come back and I feel a little bit as if this committee is sometimes living in a fantasy world I would argue that we should be spending our time trying to protect the Affordable Care Act at least trying to convince this administration or or tying the hands of this administration through legislation that they can't just erase it all through a court process without something to come behind it and we've tried that on the floor we have tried to offer amendments to have a state say together that the administration should stop pursuing this lawsuit that may be successful that will leave this country in absolute crisis and so the amendment that I am offering and I have to but I'm gonna offer the one that I think is milder would simply ask for the administration to give us some information to tell us if this lawsuit is successful how many people are going to lose coverage how many people with pre-existing conditions are at risk of having their rates increased how many people may see lifetime limits come back because we have to start we have to start expecting that this lawsuit is going to be successful it succeeded at the district court level the administration and 22 Attorney General all Republican are arguing it before the appellate court in two weeks and if we all sit around assuming that we're gonna be saved by the court system and then come to find out that all of a sudden insurance has wiped out 420 million Americans with nothing to come behind it you know I think that's a fate that we don't want to have to endure and so this amendment that I'll ask for a vote on simply asks for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue a report in 30 days that gives us some information about how big a catastrophe we are gonna be dealing with if this lawsuit is successful and I would ask this committee again and ask the leadership of this committee Senator Alexander and others to try to spend some time at least protecting our constituents against the ramifications of an ill thought-out lawsuit I would love for us to try to find common ground to be able to push back against all of the way the switch in which this administration is trying to sabotage the Affordable Care Act but this attack in the court system is I think the most egregious and the most potentially catastrophic for our constituents and so I'd ask for a vote when the time comes on Murphy and memin to

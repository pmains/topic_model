now is the democratic congressman raja krishnamurti from illinois he's the member of the house intel oversight and reform committees uh congressman good morning to you thank you for being with us it's good to see you as always let's pick up exactly where i left off with with hugo it's not theoretical the the stuff that donald trump has been saying the dangling of pardons the encouragement of of the language he uses with his supporters the idea that we have uh five senatorial candidates uh republican candidates who are a little bit whack-a-doodle uh and states like arizona and pennsylvania which are on the line with gubernatorial candidates who are election deniers this isn't theoretical all of this stuff is is actually real and potentially dangerous in two months from now that's right um i think that with the dangling of the pardons one thing that we talked about repeatedly during the trump administration when he was president was that he often did this as a signaling tool to keep people quiet and i think that this might even be a signaling tool toward people who might cooperate with the january 6 committee with the justice department and any number of investigations of him or even the georgia or new york proceedings and and then secondly i think you're absolutely right he is trying to um he's gone full mega at this point he has decided that he's going to deny that he committed any wrongdoing or call whatever he did in terms of wrongdoing justified and he's going to get people so riled up in his corner uh that i fear that they're going to commit violence and this um uh kind of use of political violence potentially is even more dangerous to our republic right now let me ask you about the uh the search on mar-a-lago and the politicization of it there are a lot of people now saying that at the very least it's a it's a technical breaking of the law that should be pursued i think as an intel committee person you'd say it's much more serious than that it's not the technical breaking of the law it's the idea that there might be names and sources who are out there but there are others who say whatever it is that that gets donald trump prosecuted is going to lead to major deeper fissures in our political system how do you address that fear i think the justice department and the fbi have to do their jobs outside of any other considerations but going to your initial point this is not a case of an overdue library book this is not sloppy bookkeeping this is a staggering refusal and willful retention of hundreds of classified documents often containing exquisite information bearing on our national security i think the the biggest theme here ali is how do we guard our national security and how do we guard it when a former president willfully refuses to treat classified documents properly and then resists returning them when he's specifically asked to do so and so that is a huge problem and then of course we're conducting simultaneously a damage assessment with regard to how those documents may have damaged our national security and what we can do to mitigate that and prevent it from happening in the future uh congressman let me ask you about uh this this mystery around these files that were found empty files they had top secret or you know designations on it was fascinating to see the photographs that came out of the inventory that these are not there's no chance you could mistakenly have taken these things out of the white house thinking that maybe they uh contained other things that said um intelligence experts have said don't make too much of the fact that these files were found empty because it's quite likely that they were used for transportation and that the stuff therein or that was therein the the ten or eleven thousand documents that were found were just separate from the files i know that you're an intel committee guy so you can only tell me so much without killing me but what what what do you make of that analysis we're not going to kill you ali uh so the the issue here is um we just don't know the answer to the question of um you know what was in those empty file folders but there are dozens and dozens i think more than 40 uh that were that had the classified document banner on them we don't know what was supposed to be in those documents based on the published reports but there's also dozens and dozens i think more than 40 folders that said return to military aid so that obviously suggests that there were documents related to defense matters and i think that's what is connected to that statute that's invoked in the warrant with regard to the espionage act that's the willful retention concealment or destruction of documents related to defense matters and when you then say that many of these are top secret or ts sci the highest classification of intelligence that's what gets people's uh uh eyebrows raised and people very very concerned about the situation you've had to look have you had occasion to look at tss uh sc files like you you you that process is not this would not end up at your house accidentally no i've never reviewed any of these except in a secure facility underneath the bunker underneath the capitol in a bunker guard by armed police officers and also they take inventory of these documents they have people standing watching as you review these documents to make sure they retrieve them upon completion of the review they are often related to covert programs human intelligence sources the electronic monitoring of foreign communications and like so this is uh what what's called the most exquisite of intelligence that the intelligence community keeps congressman good to see you thank you for being with us especially on this labor day weekend congressman roger illinois

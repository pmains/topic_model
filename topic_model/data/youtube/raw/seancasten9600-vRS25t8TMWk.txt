when americans face prices at the gas pump they're now nearing a national average of five dollars a gallon and we probably aren't thinking about russian president vladimir putin at the time or how brutal his invasion of ukraine has been and that it really brought this on instead we may be thinking how am i going to pay to fill up this car to get to work while also covering higher gas prices higher grocery store prices to feed my actual family republicans will tell you the answer to high gas prices is more oil drilling but here's what democrats like congressman sean casten of illinois say about all of that when the fossil fuel industry and the conservative politicians they bankroll go on television claiming the solution to the pain you are feeling at the pump today is to drill more in the u.s they are lying to you they are lying in a cynical attempt to take advantage of a tragic situation to line their own pocketbooks they are lying to you cassin said because the only way to stabilize energy prices at home while also fighting both climate change and autocrats like vladimir putin is to boost production of renewable energy and now president biden is taking new steps in that direction aimed at boosting solar energy in the united states right now congressman cassin joins me now so congressman americans are really feeling the pain at the pub like i talked to representative roconna this morning on the radio and he said there's six dollar gas in his district right now that is insane especially in the state like california so so speak to the importance of renewable energy as a good investment but also an important investment right now uh because of the reason it's not like this problem is going to get any better just because we ignore ignore it so what why is this a good investment in terms of renewable energy and what more can the president do sure so so first i think it's worth us saying that like yes americans are feeling the pain of the pump you know who else is feeling the pain of the pump everybody on the planet gas prices are up all over the world this is a global phenomenon and the way that we fix gas prices for everybody is to use less gasoline now the reason why it's such a good idea to invest in renewable energy really shouldn't be that complicated if you don't burn fossil fuel you don't have to pay for fossil fuel right if you have a solar panel on your roof you don't spend a lot of time saying i wonder if the electricity price is too high right now it doesn't matter because for you it's free if you have an electric vehicle you don't spend a lot of time saying i wonder if the gasoline price is today you don't care because you don't pay for it now what we have to do is make sure that those technologies are widely deployed are available to everyone in the same way we did when we built out the electric grid in the 30s when we built out the nuclear fleet all that stuff we know how to do that and we've been pushing for that legislatively and in the meantime the i've been leading an effort to push the white house to use the defense production act to get those tools into americans hands and also to get rid of some of the some of the barriers that have been created by department of commerce recently that are slowing the deployment of solar in this country and i'm delighted to see the president using executive action to move on that we need to do more in the legislative branch as well but i'm delighted to see him in him following up unpack the solar energy piece for us and speak to some of the specific ideas the president uh is putting forward in the move to boost solar energy in the united states why is that so important um well look we can talk number one about the climate issues we are the planet is burning up that you know we know that sea levels in florida are going to be two feet higher by 2050. um that's a problem we need to move proactively to do it so from an environmental perspective we have to deploy zero technology zero carbon technologies yesterday but even if you deny the science what would you rather pay for electricity whatever you're paying now or zero i'll give you a second if that's a hard question for everybody but that's that's the advantage we get when we build not just solar but wind geothermal energy efficiency in our homes all of these technologies we have to spend the money to put them up but once that money is spent the electricity is free once you insulate your home you don't have to pay for natural gas anymore that's great for your pocketbook it's great for the air we breathe and it is a completely wonderful way to really stick it to vladimir putin i like free 99 all the time 3.99 is my favorite price on on any item um certainly i'm quicker than some of my colleagues yeah yeah 3.99 is pretty good i mean speak speak to some of your colleagues because the reason why there's obstruction on this issue is not you know by accident there are people that are profiting from the status quo who fund the campaigns of the people who are blocking changes to the status quo i mean help the viewers at home understand where to place the blame for the lack of action on this issue because i think often it gets sort of blanketed as like congress can't do anything when that's that's obscures really the the central truth here well so so so here's the challenge if we're sort of honest about this i mean i think we think about this through a partisan lens but i think it's better understood that there are countries the united kingdom generates twice as many dollars of economic activity per unit of energy as the united states switzerland generates three times as much the primary difference is because those countries don't subsidize their fossil fuel production the united states we currently subsidize our fossil fuel production by 650 billion with a b dollars a year i introduced legislation with don mckeachen to repeal the tax subsidies just the six billion of those that are in tax subsidies and give every american a 500 check that would make us all richer it would be wonderful for free market capitalism if you're into those things because why are we subsidizing these losing industries the challenge and the reason why that's hard is because if you think about what our country would be like if we were using one third as much energy number one we'd all be richer number two the air would be much cleaner but we would see a massive wealth transfer from energy producers to energy consumers and when you think about there are regions of the country like on the gulf coast like in west virginia where their economies are inextricably tied to the extraction of resources from under the ground and you know part of the reason why we really pushed in the you know in what you know was called the build back better the climate provisions we had we had significant resources there to try to take all of this wealth that we create with clean energy and make sure that the consumers benefit but that some portion of that goes back to help out these communities that are going to be left behind because the private sector is going to make that transition anyway the coal industry talk to a coal miner they know that their industry has utterly collapsed there's a reason why the west virginia economy is you know as a as a friend of mine from west virginia is fond of saying thank god for mississippi or else we'd be number one you know there's their economy is in the hole because they have failed to create jobs as private the private industry has said you know how we like to get labor out of our balance sheet we've done that you know how we like to get other costs out of our balance sheet like energy we're going to do that as well and move away from coal so the private sector is moving away and we have an obligation as legislators to look after those communities even as we make sure that people have access to cleaner energy and tragically some of the biggest opponents to that in congress are people who represent those communities it's a really really important point congressman sean caston of illinois thank you so much for being here as always climate is such an important issue and i never ever want to let a day go by or a week go by without really addressing it please stay safe

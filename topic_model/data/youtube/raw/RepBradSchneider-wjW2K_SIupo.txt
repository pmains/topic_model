hi this is a congressman Brad Schneider I want to welcome everyone to our call today and thank you for joining us for today's webinar my staff I have heard from hundreds of small businesses who are facing the current economic uncertainty we're looking and are looking to the federal government for help today's calls focused specifically on the Paycheck protection program PPP this is a loan program that allows for a hundred percent loan forgiveness if you keep your employees on the payroll if you have questions about the SBA disaster loan program I encourage you to watch the webinar we hosted two weeks ago on those resources there's more information on that webinar and other resources available to you on our website snyder house again just for reference our website is Schneider dot house gov so I'm moving to today's subject of PPP I'm keenly aware that the administration drawn the stimulus stimulus funds has been anything but smooth many of you have raised concerns about the paycheck protection program and how to access funding in addition to helping navigate this process my hope is that this call provides me and my staff with questions for the Trump administration to ensure a more smooth rollout of the stimulus going forward I believe it's accountable for an effective administration of these resources it is Congress's responsibility and we're doing as much as we can and doing it in a bipartisan way to establish the authorities and provide the resources as you know the cares Act that passed on March 27 in the house was signed thereafter by the president provides 2.2 trillion dollars including the 349 billion dollars for the PPP program so we will continue to do that but the implementation becomes critically important towards to have the intended effect I want to now introduce our panelists for this call as you know the federal government in Washington is establishing the guidelines the work the hard work is done here locally the folks in the field are working tirelessly day and night trying to make sure that the relief response the aid that Congress pass gets to the field working with the guidance they get from Washington today we're joined by beau Steiner the district director for the Illinois Small Business Administration office who was with us two weeks ago as well he presented at that webinar on the SBA disaster loans he is an excellent resource Bo and obvious based SBA staff in Illinois have literally been working around the clock to implement these programs and we are very very grateful B before I turn it over to ball I want to discuss some of the work Congress has done up till now I tell businesses like yours whether the current crisis that the first piece of legislation was in early March it was emergency legislation related to code 19 including significant funding focused on public health resources money for the National Institutes Institutes of Health to do research into treatments cures and vaccines but it also included the designation of the coronaviruses disaster disaster under the SBA's disaster loan program under this program Illinois small businesses and nonprofits are now eligible you can now apply for these loans which offer as much as two million dollars towards like payroll towards working capital for things like payroll rent and benefits including an advance of $10,000 emergency funding within just a couple of days and again we had that seminar a couple weeks ago and it's available tonight or House gov later in March in the middle of the month we passed the second emergency legislation the family first coronavirus responses act related to the virus included in this bill were provisions to provide paid medical and family leave for workers directly affected by Cobra 19 businesses and fewer than 500 employees would provide this emergency benefit to workers and would be able to recoup 100% of the costs or a refundable tax credit there is more guidance on our website on this program as well again that's Schneider dot house that cub finally on March 27th the House passed and the President signed into law the Cure's Act this is the two trillion dollar economic stimulus package I mentioned earlier within that is to almost train them 50 million dollars in direct funds for small businesses most significantly under the Paycheck protection program this is a program that can that provides a loan that it can be 100% forgiven if the business owners retain their employees this legislation includes funds to support state emergency operations as well and in addition is providing a hundred billion dollars in support for health care infrastructure in particularly trying to get the ventilators and the desperately needed PPE available as well it also provides increased food security and resources to promote remote learning any of you who have kids in school doing what learning to understand that the need for that technology I'm gonna turn it over now to Bo will give us his presentation on the SBA programs many of you sent in questions which will be the focus of the second half of our call you can also pose questions in the chat box and we can get back to you we have about 250 people on the call probably more since I started talking so we won't be able to answer every question but if you do have a question following the webinar you can call my office eight four seven three eight three four eight seven zero we're also submit questions on the website Schneider house.gov and please let others know who couldn't make this that this webinar will be saved online as a video so compete people can come and see it if they missed it or you can refer back to as a reference going forward and with that let me turn it over to Baal again thank you for joining us and thank you for all you're doing Thank You congressman I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and thanks to all of you out there who are joined to learn more about the the programs that are available if we go to the next slide that we create primarily today I'm going to cover the paycheck protection program although I would like to just talk briefly about the economic engineering injury disaster loans and loan advanced just to give a brief update as part of my conversation so both of both the Paycheck protection program in the economic injury disaster loan advanced we were part of the cares Act so there are some changes relative to that and there are a couple changes relative to the Eid L process so we'll talk about that in a second if we go to the next slide so as as congressman Schneider mentioned the Payette paycheck protection program is a loan program where you apply for the loan through a lender this is not a direct program through the SBA you apply with a lender and eligible recipients may qualify for a loan of up to ten million dollars as determined by average monthly prior year payroll I think one of the things to note is that again this is with a lender and number two is the criteria for this loan are focused specifically on payroll and payroll documentation there is this is not a credit analysis and a credit decision loan payments are deferred for six months but the the big thing on this program and a huge impact for small businesses and their employees is that this loan is 100 percent forgivable if at least 75 percent of the proceeds are used for payroll and I'll talk about what payroll expense means it's not just compensation there are other things that are included in that calculation now if you apply for the loan and you receive it forgiveness can be reduced if full-time headcount or if your headcount declines or if your payroll expenses decrease so just something to bear in mind in in this process so next slide so eligible businesses including small businesses with fewer than 500 employees as well as private nonprofits 501 C 3s or 501 C 19 veterans organization organizations that are affected by the corona virus or kharkova 19 certain industries have typically have a small business size standard that is employer related that may be higher than that 500 employee limit and if that's the case for your particular industry then you look at whatever the higher limit is so if it's a thousand employees is the small business limit for your industry then that's with what you would use second caveat here is that small businesses and the hospitality and food industry with more than one location could be eligible at the store and location level if the store employs less than 500 workers so just under normal SBA rules affiliation would prevent this kind of treatment however the statute and the rules allow for special treatment to these two industries and when when they apply next slide so how do you apply you're going to go to a so immediately you can use any existing 7a lender which is an SBA lender any federally insured depository institution federally insured credit union or a Farm Credit System institution in addition SBA is onboarding other lenders non-depository lenders non-bank lenders into the program so they can also support application and disbursement of of these loans loan has maturity of two years in an interest rate of 1% now obviously that would only apply if the loan was not forgiven lenders began making taking loan applications on Friday April 3rd for small businesses the PPP program as we call it the Paycheck protection program will open up for independent contractors sole proprietors on April 10th so coming soon and that's I think another key element of this program is it's not just small businesses with employees it's also the sole proprietors it's independent contractors 1099s are eligible to apply next leg I can go back to slide thank you so basically what's required application which is an SBA a form 2483 you will fill that out primarily covers your payroll expenses calculation your average monthly payroll expense calculation it takes that average monthly payroll expense in multiplies times 2.5 and that is the maximum about allowable loan under the program banks will work with you to collect appropriate documentation to demonstrate the payroll was what it was so that might be your w-2s for your employees or your or your payroll records those sorts of things to provide evidence for that you had payroll expense and what it was for independent contractors 1099s those businesses likewise if they don't have a payroll system that they use any it you'll you'll be looked at to demonstrate what your income was from the business in that evidence could include things like your bank records so lots of different ways that you can prove payroll and payroll expenses to help you go through that on this slide I do include example of our the methodology they used to calculate the loan amount just for your reference I'm not going to go through it step-by-step but bottom line is that you're gonna aggravate your payroll costs and we'll talk a little bit in a second about what can be included in that you're gonna subtract out any compensation in excess of an annual salary of $100,000 for those employees that make more than $100,000 in their salary and compensation line calculate the average monthly payroll cost and then multiply times 2.5 so it's a pretty simple calculation on what you're going to do now on the SBA Form 2483 you're also going to attest to certain conditions for your business are you in a legal business a federally legal business do you have any have you defaulted on an SBA loan in the past certain criteria that you have to attest to in order to qualify as eligible for the program I want to say that if you want to dive in deeper on the program the best place to go is the SBA's website and download download the interim final rule it's pretty straightforward read and talks you through every step of the program and is really the governing document for the program at this time next slide please proceeds of the payroll protection program loan can be used for payroll costs as well as benefits so think about things like healthcare benefits retirement contributions paid sick medical family leave insurance premiums those sorts of things are eligible use of PPP proceeds as our mortgage interest payments rent payments utility payments interest payments on any other debt obligations that were incurred before February 15 2020 and or refinancing an SBA Eid alone made between January 31st and April third so lots of different things that you can use you can use these funds for but again I want to reiterate that the key element of the forgiveness component is that at least 75% of those funds are used for payroll and payroll expenses so those other items their mortgage interests so on and so forth would need to be you need to be look you need to look at you need to look at how that will impact that overall 75% payroll expense and still make sure you hit that number in order to receive 100% forgiveness and just kind of for context for everyone so when you go to make the loan or you go to apply for the loan you're applying with the bank they're looking at all of the documentation that you provide in your application once approved they dispersed front funds from there from the bank so it's not federal funds at this point it's Bank funds the SBA and the federal government are guaranteeing that loan now a certain period into that loan it's about seven weeks as the minimum according to the final rule at that point the bank working with you will will collect documentation supporting your head count and your the amount of how you've just burped how you've used those funds from the loan they'll verify that at least 75% we're used for payroll and then they'll make application to the SBA for forgiveness once that happened once the SBA signs off on forgiveness then the Treasury will pay off that loan on your behalf which means that you're free and clear from that loan so that's kind of the process and what it looks like a couple other key things that I wanted to touch on the as I mentioned the program application started April 3rd you had to have been in business with employees as of February 15th so if you if you came into business after February 15th then you would be considered ineligible and then the program the last date of application for this program is June 30th of 2020 so that's a quick overview of the paycheck protection program I don't want to go too much longer because I know there are a lot of questions so you go next slide I'm not going to get too much into rehashing the economic injury disaster loan program however we do have a couple of changes that happen max amounts still 2 million dollars still a working capital line of credit with terms up to 30 years three and three-quarter percent for small business two and three-quarter percent for nonprofits next slide go ahead a next slide great area for approval again what we're doing we've just installed a new application system last Monday so basically this online application has you enter all your information it's probably four or five screens very much tells you which fields have to be entered and you provide that information there's no upload of documentation there's nothing else associated to that effort we'll review your credit will review other aspects of your application to make sure that you know you meet certain criteria including you know can you repay the loan can you can you support that debt service in the long term these loans payments deferred for twelve months so you've got some breathing room if you take the loan for a period of time collateral requirements have changed it was previously any loan over twenty five thousand dollars required collateral now that's five hundred thousand dollars personal guarantee was required for all the idea lungs now personal guarantee on Eid el is only on loans over $200,000 and I I should touch on this for the PPP program there is no collateral requirement there is no personal guarantee requirement next slide please again a IDL for those of you that didn't see it you come directly to the SBA to apply go to s be a G of E ford slash disaster there's no cost to apply there's no obligation to take the loan if offered and you can have an existing disaster loan and still qualify for a Eid L if you're looking on the screen right now that is an error maximum unsecured loan amount is $500,000 for the Eid al loan so I need to correct that next slide okay again apply at sba.gov ford slash disaster it didn't want to touch on the application process so as I mentioned we just launched a new application portal last Monday for those of you that applied previous to that if you that we had a initial online application for those of you applied through that initial online application where you went through a workflow online to submit your application and you were able to upload all your documents you're good on the Eid alone however if you want to apply for the Eid L advanced component and I'll talk about that in a second you need to go back into our new online portal and apply there we had so the first group the second group is we had an interim solution where you would enter all your information in PDF forms and then upload those securely through a box comm secure file transfer site what we're asking businesses to do there is if you applied that way please go back into the new online portal go through fill out all the information in there and what and then you can also at that same time apply for the Eid el advance now the big the reason we're asking this is this will expedite the review of your application it'll expedite getting you to the point of decision and get you to the point of disbursement on a loan if you are approved so really important to that folks that did the Box com upload go through and redo the electronic loan application again it should only take you 30 40 minutes to go through that process third group is those that entered in the most recent system and again you're good to go you shouldn't have to do anything else it should be going through the system if you have questions and you're like hey where's my loan application or I haven't heard a thing you could call SBA's customer service center at one 800 695 five next slide please next slide see next slide okay this is the last thing I'm gonna touch on for now so we get to all the questions because I know there's a lot the economic injury disaster and loan advance what that is is that an up to $10,000 advance when you apply through the economic injury disaster loan portal basically what it is is you apply once we have a complete application in our system I still need to get information on what comprises a complete application but whatever if you are approved for a advance on your IDL then that is supposed to be dispersed within three days of that complete application the even if you are declined for the loan you do not have to repay that advance so if you're declined you don't have you don't have to repay the advance if you are approved for an SBA loan that advance will be basically the amount of that that advance would be forgiven on your Eid el loans so as an example if you were approved for $100,000 a IDL loan and you had you were received a $5,000 advance then overall what they'll look at is that overall loan amount your principal will be ninety five thousand so just to give you an example and new applicants will automatically be considered for both the Eid L in Eid L advance so next slide okay so I think that's really all we wanted to cover right now congressman and I know there's loads of questions that we can get into you you you congressman Schneider I think you're on mute and your hear me now we can okay I'm sorry about that beau thank you for sharing that we appreciate the update on the idea CID l as well as the details of the PPP and let me now go to questions the first question is from Brian from Libertyville he says my credit union is not participating and I can't figure out how or where to submit my application and documents what do people do though if their bank or credit union is not participating in the PPP program and they have to go somewhere else sure so right now what we're advising that businesses go to the PPP lender finder which is online tool to identify lenders that are supporting the program that is our guidance as of now and as we have more will continue to update that site as we have more lenders join and look to participate in the PPP program so that's that's what we're recommending right now if you're looking for another lender to support it great thank you the next questions from Vernon Hills Rob asked our company has applied for a PPP loan when will they be funded can you provide a general timeline as to how these might be processed sure so we I would love to give everybody a timeline I don't have a specific timeline but I would basically work with your business banker to understand what their timeline is for processing I don't expect that it'll be a long turnaround from an SBA perspective but I don't have specific numbers to offer you right now and is it fair to say that each bank might be a little bit different because it is the bank who is effectively making a wall yes I would agree with that god all right thank you let's see from like bluff ass is the Paycheck protection program done on a first-come first-served basis is there a chance we'll get shut out if we can't get online or the website is overloaded so the oh go ahead I'm sorry I was I said we actually have a related question from online now can we submit PPP applications through multiple institutions and no but at least one being accepted or can we only submit one application per business got it so first question is it is first-come first-serve process when you talk about can't get online or website is overloaded this the PPP loan is done with the with a bank or a lending institution so so you'd want to reach out to the the lender that you're you plan to work with and get a feel for what their timelines are and how they're processing these things because each bank will be different in in their approach and the systems that they use as far as multiple institutions again you know on this in this case I can't really tell you what to do whether you apply to one or many although that may create some issues in the systems because the PPP loan is only one PPP per applicant and I don't know how the internal systems will look to deconflict that to make sure that people aren't able to access more than one so you know I can't tell you what to do I would just you know work with your business bank to figure out like what their how they're approaching it and you know what their timelines are gonna be and bones appear to say I know the intention of Congress was to make this a streamlined praat process with a simplified application form and and speedy underwriting so that I would assume that especially a bank that has an existing relationship with the customer to be able to get that response fairly quickly is that a fair statement I mean I think that that's fair for sure okay I can't speak to all of them but yeah it's its intent the intent of the program is certainly to make it really streamlined and fast right and I know from talking to a number of banks one of their concerns is people trying to take advantage of the system I'm not saying that's what John's doing but multiple applications may may indeed slow down the process if there's an existing relationship with the bank is that possible yeah I mean I think you know what happens is if you have if you start going in multiple pathways it slows it down for not just potentially for you but for everyone because then everybody's got to do a lot more work to try and prevent multiple people getting multiple loans in a program where they can only apply for really receive one right it's only one per business all right thanks the next question is from Dave online and just an example of how I've been impressive how closely people are studying the legislation the substance of questions I've been getting on an ongoing basis Dave's question is I have several independent contractors who work for me they're critical to my business if I understand the Treasury's rules correctly page 11 paragraph H I cannot include their wages my calculations for the PPP loan amount is that correct if so I'm in trouble the way I read the final rule that's correct independent contractors can apply for themselves so they said which you know to prevent duplication of benefits is why I'm sure they wrote the rule this way the business cannot also apply for benefit from independent contractors next question from Greg also an online question is a tree that one can apply for both an e IDL and a PPP loan it is true but there are certain qualifiers to that so in essence the key IDL is working capital loan is focused on payroll if your intent is to try and use both the Eid L and the PPP for payroll for the same expenses basically that's not a permissible use however if for example you use the Eid L for one purpose and then you use the PPP for payroll and payroll expenses then that would be a circumstance where you know as long as the Eid L uses were permissible that you could you could take benton you could use the benefit of both got it and this this is my question now but I think it's important and correct me if I'm wrong Bo the the critical need to keep really good records as everyone's going through this process records not just of what you're applying for but your expenses during this period and to the extent that you can any loss that you're incurring this period it's important to keep that tracked as closely as possible is that a fair point that's that's super critical and you know that's where your network your kind of key advisors come into place with your accountant and your attorney and others too in your bank or two they just help you navigate that and make sure that whatever you're doing you're staying within the lines of the program right and and that it's important now it's important later for these loans to be forgiven so on record kickin is important on the next questions from Jenny and Spring Grove she asked what date does payroll start qualifying for PPP the day we get funds the week of March 30th week of April 6th how many hours - how many hours of paid do my employees wait how many hours do I pay my employees for the average weekly from 2019 is that the is that the metric so basically the way the the final rule reads is kind of work backwards on this the the way the the rule reads is it's based on headcount and payroll expenses it doesn't say necessarily how many hours you pay them or whatever it's a financial number and then a headcount number so I can't tell you what that means for you in your particular business that's where you have to do the analysis on okay this was my payroll expense last year this is what I would be eligible for from a loan standpoint and then this is what I first see my payroll being going forward to you know so that you have a good idea of what that whether you're gonna meet that 75% benchmark or threshold for for the sorry let's measure it for the forgiveness as far as what gate does payroll start qualifying for PPP so in order to be eligible to apply you have to have been in business February 15th and had employees at that point now as far as the expenditures and what counts you know I guess what payroll expenses count towards this I don't I can't answer that right now I'd have to look back into the rules to to sort through that specifically but I think the intent and I can't I mean I think that from my reading of the rule the goal is to you know you want we want to start getting these funds out through the PPP to businesses so that not only business gets supported but also so that those employees also are able to stay on and you know maintain their their incomes and take care of what they need to take care of as well all right thank you and I just want sure we've been joined by more than 400 people on this call and the extent that you're able to take notes that's great but we will have this seminar our webinar on our website for future reference and if you know anyone who couldn't make it you can refer them to the website as well Schneider dot house gov the next question is online question how this from Kenneth how is forgiveness measured affected if majority of employees are part-time not full time to qualify forgiveness can salary be redistributed away from owned or full-time and shared with part-time workers actually this is a great question I've talked to a number of businesses owners who have taken their salaries to zero so they can pay their employees so I guess two-part question what if the majority of employees are part-time how does that affect a measurement for forgivness and what if as the owner if someone takes their salary down or all the way eliminates it to share with part-time workers how would that work right so my reading of the of the rule basically says that the the loan amount right what you're going to be eligible for is based on the historical and it's a dollar figure and it's a number of employees the forgiveness component is again going to be based on loan amount that is that you're a proof for and a number of employees the the rule does not specify how those funds are distributed other than that no employee for the purpose of forgiveness can make more than one hundred thousand dollars okay they can make more than one hundred thousand dollars I'm sorry but they can't that can't be counted anything above 100 thousand dollars can't be counted as a payroll expense right so as I understand I was talking to someone who has a lava and where the base salary for the lawyers are all above one hundred thousand it's just the first hundred thousand their salary is counted as well as their whether it's people serving in the lunchroom where their part-time workers but the cap for any one employees one hundred thousand dollars right right got it all right thank you carjacking Bannockburn asked two banks have discretion a discretionary power as to who to lend and who not to learn to uh so from my perspective I mean banks have a lot of latitude to implement the program according to their internal policies so they do have some discretion as long as it's not you know they obviously they can't be discriminatory or you know other things like that but yeah have they have a lot of latitude on how they implement programs for sure got it next questions from sherry an online question what about freelancers like hair stylists who just want to chair this along they have no tax ID now who could still pay taxes at the end of the year their sedan and don't qualify for unemployment let me just qualify freelancers in fact do qualify for unemployment under the the cares act as in the bill that passed last month and should be able to apply the state's unemployment insurance office we expanded the definition of that that expanded definition only applies during this national emergency but people who are freelancers independent contractors others do qualify there's more information on my website neither that house for that and you go on the website look for help for individuals under the köppen 19 tab so that's specific for unemployment insurance but what about freelancers how does the SBA programs affect them so from the standpoint of a canoe dependent contractor 1099 maybe doesn't have a yeah and you're also eligible for a loan if you were an individual operates under sole proprietorship or as an independent contractor or eligible self-employed individual and you were in operation at 50 February 15 2020 so but I think the key here is you can certainly submit documents to establish eligibility such as payroll process of records payroll tax filings or 1099 Mis CS or even income and expenses from a sole proprietorship but if you for borrowers that don't have that documentation you are able to provide other supporting documents such as bank records as long as they're sufficient to demonstrate the qualifying payroll amount so again as a 1099 independent contractor like you're referring to you are eligible for the PPP program no thanks next questions from Harlan in Glenview he says I'm unclear whether as a company in which I'm the only employee so essentially a sole proprietorship I guess well I qualify for forgivable loans so how does sole proprietors or single employ LLC's whatever it might be applied for a forgivable loan sure so so number one so proprietors and independent contractors are fully eligible assuming all everything else they qualify under for the PPP loan in order to apply they would work with their their bank of record or another bank that's a call you know as assuming their bank is a participant or another participating lender to go through the application process Jonathan has an online question does the 500 employee count include contract workers ie gig workers also a headcount in calculating the headcount is it number of people or number of full-time equivalent so if I have two part-timers sharing a job would that be two employees or one FTE those are some of the details that we're still waiting to have fleshed out from our policy folks so I can't answer that question right now got it and the next questions for me that's related just a chance to describe so what we have now is the interim guidance from SBA is is that correct yes so I think that's an important distinction this is not the final guidance so there's still a couple of details that are being ironed out like that specifically we just touched on whether it's a headcount Lefty's Cindy from Highland Park has the next question if I have already laid off some employees is my company not eligible for this program and I'll add an addendum can I this has made me ask the question related can people hire back their employees to qualify sure so I think the key kind of timelines that you're looking at is is basically that February 15th date as that's kind of the the look-back period basically what it what it says you were an operation on February 15th and add employees for whom you paid salaries and payroll taxes is kind of a key metric there so so if you were if you meet those true criteria you would be eligible and then the amount that you would be eligible for would be that 12-month look back on your payroll expenses as far as the I'm sorry could you remove it the second question was so the cyclist tonight do I have to hire people back or can I bring people back that I laid off so yeah so based on that again based on the loan amount that you receive to the extent that you can you know have people on staff to meet that 75% requirement is basically what the the rule requires right and the number of employees certainly if you were able to hire more than you had on staff you know at the point of hire even better but that's that's my understanding of how it works go ahead I'm sorry I was just gonna say I mean you're gonna want to work through your lender on that too and they'll help you walk through that all right so to walk through an example if I'm a restaurant and in February everything seemed fine I was fully staffed I'll make up a number of 25 people working for me on March 20th when the governor announced that I would have to close my in guy in restaurant dining I laid off half my staff if on April 6th I applied for and qualify for a loan I can bring those staff back under the payroll protection program and still being qualifying for loan forgiveness when everything's better and I reopen that full staff yeah okay great thanks to meet Paul with an online question we are literally at mom-and-pop store so our paycheck is based in each month's profit or loss how do we calculate the payroll plus we're closed to bailing my stay at home so we have no payroll since we have no income right now sure so again you're going to want to work with your and in each particular instance but the way the rule reads is that there is quite a lot of latitude to how you can provide information as far as your income from the business which you know would be kind of consistent with your payroll so you know what I would say is when you go to your when you work with the lender that you're going to work with is just going through what documentation they would like to see you know everything from your maybe it's your financial statements and your balance sheets and all those documents that you maintain for your business or even your bank records as I mentioned a moment ago may be appropriate and suitable to prove your your payroll expense great and the next questions and go back to my restaurant analogy or example rather Jason online asked if I have tipped employees do I pay them the average wages if they were currently still working they're receiving a tip wage and there are a tip wage and their cash tips right so I don't know the answer to that question right now certainly what qualifies as payroll costs is compensation employees in the form of salary wages Commission's or similar compensation cash tips are the equivalent based on employer records for past tips or in the absence of such records a reasonable good faith employer estimate of such tips so that's included in the payroll costs so but I can't say what you have to do or don't have to do I guess would be my point that's going to be the determination that you're gonna have to make and again you know I encourage people to reach out to their accountant and their other trusted advisors as they go through the decision-making process on how they implement they look to implement this great the next question is from Patty in Waukegan can you apply for more than the amount that is determined on the paycheck protection lungs and if so with whom so the PPP program calculate calculus for alone is pretty fixed its those payroll average monthly payroll expenses times two point five if you need other loan resources to address other issues that's where program like the economic injury disaster loan or even conventional SBA loans may come in as a resource for you to meet your working capital needs got it very good the next question is from Andrus in displaying x' is the $100,000 cap per employee salary or salary plus benefits total compensation sure so the when her percent cap only relates to the salary slash compensation component so you can have somebody who weighs in at $100,000 on the salary piece plus they have additional benefits like health care stuff like that that you pay that could also be included in the overall payroll costs got thank you another question Josh from this an online question does a final one seat 501 6c qualify for the program these would be trade associations businesses like that so our current guidance that we've received is that they do not but that's you know again what's called out specifically in the guidelines is 501 C 3 and 501 C 19 s right now but you know again stay tuned to that as we get you know so we have the interim role but normally we also have a standard operating procedure that governs actual tactical execution so I'm hoping for more information comes out on that soon that will clarify some of these things and let me add to that I know that the legislation did not identify 501 60s it was 501 C I think the 501 C 6 is but these trade associations its 501 C 3 s were included but the association's were not we have been talking extensively about trying to address that legislatively as well it will wait for the guidance from the SBA but we're trying to address it legislatively as well david online asked question our 12-month average 2019 payroll is not representative of today's payroll because of growth there's a great question companies that are growing I have more employees in 2020 than they had in 2019 what can you do what can we do for a business that grew quickly in 2018 yeah so that's another one of those questions that I can't really address in reading the rule it's pretty specific to how the calculation works and it doesn't necessarily encompass that particular situation I know we talked about it again in the legislation and this is at the end of the day is the SBA enclosure who were writing the guidelines and the rules but hopefully we'll follow the intent of Congress but we talked about what about businesses that had little or no payroll in 2019 they can use their payroll for the first two months of 2020 but left so with a specific guidance comes from the agency so thank you now Alice asked can churches with supports that participate in TPP again I believe that they can but actually let me we need to get back on this just to make sure that we're putting the proper information out there so yeah I can't answer that that the rules are still being developed on that and another good number of questions there so we'll come back to that one and the apart guests we are catered to lost income from our corporate clients at the beginning of February we have a mix of full and part-time staff w-2s and event servers and bartenders 1099 some different types of employees are both types of employees eligible under PPP so full and part-time staff are 1099s or not because they can apply on their own got it Marilyn limb you asked you need a copy of just the first page of our last three years tax return to get the Paycheck protection program long or the entire tax return it is several pages long the the final rule only apply addresses the the payroll expenses and documentation supporting that so I can't really answer that because I don't know what each specific lender what specific documentation around the employee payroll they'll I think that's also something they can ask their banker correct yep right now from Riverwoods what additional contracting and procurement opportunities with federal government will be created to support small businesses and I'll touch on that a little bit because it's not part of the payroll protection program but it's something that certain within a small business committee we're talking about already we're thinking just in general we're thinking of the response to the pandemic in three phases the emergency phase which is what we're in now trying to get people into a place where they can just get to the next point the ability to mitigate mitigation phase because the second phase just which will take us a of months to get to the place where we're standing up our business again people are going out in public again and then the recovery phase the legislation we've got with so far is almost exclusively dealing with the emergency crisis at the moment that's why you're seeing these programs like the PPP program where started we're talking about today kool-aid for also had three bills in March the next one has already been called covered for developing so main but they will be primarily emergency but we're going to start talking about mitigation as well as recovery and when we get into the full recovery responses we'll talk about these additional opportunities although I don't if you want to add anything to the question about opportunities the federal government for small businesses I don't have anything right now okay Eric Morton Grove asks one particular question I had was whether as an owner occupied space I would be applying for qualifying for loan forgiveness unmet versus mortgage interest my business is an S corp that pays rent an LLC that I also own so if I owned my own building second for my business but my business pays rent to the building so I'm the landlord and the tenant at the same time how would that work that's probably outside of the scope of my technical expertise to be honest with you I mean yeah I can't really answer that at this point that's a little bit more detailed I mean that would be because I don't know the rent forgiveness program aspects of this so the rent is that the forgiveness is really on the payroll but you have to apply so Erica I'm sorry we'll have to get more guidance than that as well returning the earthwork this questions from be are there any resources available to small commercial landlords one building who are foregoing collecting rent during this time so my perspective on that one would be probably looking at the economic injury disaster loan program because that is a working capital line so as you look at potential decrease in revenues due to rent forgiveness or or at least rent delay that you know that's the way that you can maybe meet your requirements in the interim while you do have that decreased revenue okay great and this is a clarifying question bow to you state that law firms you're not online for are not eligible for a PPP loan this is from Michael and online question I did not say that yeah my understanding is law firms professional service firms are eligible as well as restaurants and manufacturing firms etc Bill's question online if apply for a granted PPP loan and you ask your employees to come back to work and they are not comfortable returning tore through the situation and you do not use all the loan money due by the end of the eight-week period is the loan owed at the 1% interest rate or will the rate change with the bank or government's discretion my understanding is that the metric is the number of employees you had before the crisis started and then the number of employees you have afterwards doesn't necessarily have to be the same employees is that correct yes so it is is the number not not the names correct correct number or not the names and then yeah the loan is 1% interest rate with a 2-year term okay so if it's not forgiven and that those would be the terms that you would be responsible for all right great the next question is from a door it's an online question she says thank you for joining us on this webinar again I'll repeat that thank you for being with us today I am a small business owner of an S corp in court we monthly take capital distributions am i able to include my capital distributions on my PPP application within my payroll summary now that's a great question yeah again what I would do is I would work with your lender that you're working with to determine the distributions component if distributions are not specifically called out in the the final rules so again you know in these kinds of circumstances I would talk to your doctor your lender and work it through that with them because it may be included in that may be something that comes out as we just provide more guidance to lenders and borrowers on the program oh great thank you Thomas online says as a lyft driver that is not tagging now do I report just so I made in the last nine months and then extrapolate that amount to 12 months so how would a lyft driver I guess implicit diving's illimitable king nine months what would they do come up return average yeah I mean that would make sense to me but again I'd have to look at the we'd probably have to look at the rules and again I would just encourage you to work with your lender on that that totally makes logical logical sense I just don't want to make a commitment one way or the other because I don't have policy guidance on that all right and with that Thomas had the last question we're at four o'clock bow thank you

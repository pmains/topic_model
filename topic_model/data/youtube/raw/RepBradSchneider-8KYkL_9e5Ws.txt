Mr. Speaker, here we are again. Mourning the senseless loss of life from yet
another terrible mass shooting. Last Sunday at their church in Texas, 26 more
Americans were cut down by a gunman. The oldest was 77 years old. The youngest was 17-months old. This just a few weeks after Las Vegas endured
the deadliest shooting in our country’s history. And in the backdrop of ongoing violence in
cities, towns, and homes across the country that claims an average of 93 lives each and every day. The response from this chamber is deafening
silence. Mr. Speaker, how can we face this epidemic
without even a debate? I’m open to any common sense idea to make
progress on this issue, from universal background checks to limiting access to high-capacity
magazines and military-style assault weapons. I’ve introduced legislation to help prevent
theft from Federal Firearm Licensees, expand background checks, and close purchase monitoring
loopholes. I know there is no one solution, but we cannot
allow this epidemic to continue without even a discussion on what we can do. Together, we have the opportunity to save
lives. I urge my colleagues to act.

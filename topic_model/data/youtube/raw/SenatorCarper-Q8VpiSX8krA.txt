today i would urge the senate to pivot and begin focusing next on examining issues related to the pandemic and to ensuring that the assistance we provided in the legislation we passed so far four four pieces some bigger than others is getting to the families and the communities that badly need it if we are unable or unwilling to do so i'm not sure that the senate should be returning to to washington to act on non-urgent business and contravention of the recommendation of the office of the attending physician and while this entire region is still under stay-at-home orders i also want to make it clear that the environmental public works committee and which i serve and lead with the senator john barrasso of wyoming was willing to approve this particular nomination unanimously by voice vote but it is what it is and we're here today in the midst of a global pandemic mr president a majority leader says he's concerned with nominations and well then let's address positions that are actually more relevant to the crisis that we face today currently one third of the inspector general and inspector general's positions are confirmed by the senate that are confirmed by the senate either remain vacant or without permanent leadership the president has nominated individuals to fill some but not all of these positions the senate should work quickly to vet those nominees we have received especially those who would be involved with oversight or the coronavirus response my colleagues will require that this past march uh mr president congress passed an unprecedented two trillion dollar relief package the cares act to bring help to millions of americans who find themselves in dire straits through no fault of their own thankfully the karazhak created three new separate oversight bodies to monitor this emergency funding i was also proud to work with democrats and republican colleagues alike mr president to help secure an additional 20 million dollars to ensure that the government accountability office actually known as gao can conduct important oversight of this funding in fact i learned last week that gao has already notified congress that he has already either undertaken or begun invitations or investigations or uh has planned investigation uh to uh 150 150 audits that are related to this funding and i appreciate gao's diligence on this important matter not just i appreciate we appreciate it american taxpayers appreciate it as well more than ever it's critical that we have robust oversight to make sure that this money gets in the pockets of those who need it most and not into the pockets of those who would literally steal money from the needy and steal money from the taxpayers of this of this country if our majority leader wants to bring the senate back then if i could i'd like to suggest that our time would be well spent making sure that those oversight bodies created in the cares act are fully functional including the cares act congressional oversight commission which i'm told still lacks a chairperson this is a five-person panel uh one uh created by each of our leaders in the house and uh and the senate and uh that would be four i'll give us four and then another one would be really agreed to by the majority leader here and to speak for the house i'm told that as of today as of this moment we still lack a chairperson of that important panel and i hope that our leader here leader mcconnell and speaker pelosi will work with haste even today even today to jointly name a chair to the congressional oversight commission as required by law the cares act also create aid of the pandemic response accountability committee to me that's a committee composed of inspector inspectors general from relevant agencies to oversee all spending appropriated through the cares act that's a huge under undertaking unfortunately these ig those ig positions at key agencies including the treasury department and including the department of education still remain vacant and we've seen over the last month just how crucial it is that our igs remain independent since the senate was last in session the president has unceremoniously removed reassigned or undermined highly regarded inspectors general who apparently weren't loyal enough to him or who dared to criticize what they viewed as a failed or flawed response to the coronavirus for example at the beginning of april president trump removed glenn fein highly regarded acting inspector general for the pentagon who had only a week earlier been selected by his peers selected by his peers to chair the pandemic response accountability committee the third oversight body created by the cares act we've also seen the president look to replace the health and human services ig who in a detailed report pointed out the severe shortages that a number of our hospitals have been facing during corona virus outbreak i believe it's clear that congress needs to speak up when appropriate and do a better job supporting our inspectors general when this president or frankly any president takes retaliatory actions against the independent watchdogs responsible for identifying failures waste fraud and abuse across our federal government especially when this much money is at risk if the senate is going to be back in session it would seem to me that these critical oversight positions should be among our top priorities

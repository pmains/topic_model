democratic senator Tim Kaine member of the Senate Armed Services Committee good to see senator really appreciate it the word as repeatedly said look they don't want to do this in a piecemeal fashion but but obviously that is what's happening on some level is the president talking a little bit out of both sides of his mouth you know I don't think so Aaron look I think when we acted earlier and I can't remember my days are running together whether it was last week over the weekend to do the military pay a lot of us thought that this had been taken care of and when it became clear that it was at least ambiguous or that it wasn't you know wasn't clear i'm really glad secretary Hagel stepped in glad the house did what they did these benefits or benefits that should be paid but the bigger picture is this that I do think the White House is right that you can't let people shut down the whole government and then selectively decide what they want to reopen because if you do that you're going to have a shutdown every year people who can't get what they want who refuse a budget negotiation will shut the entire government down and then they'll decide who they want to let up off the mat and that's just no way to run the government of the greatest nation on earth and what about this this deal that was just reported on tonight our Danna bash was just saying one of the Democratic lawmakers who just met with the president this afternoon left and said they thought the president was more willing to give in terms of a temporary deal now this temporary deal will be on the debt ceiling unclear if the shutdown's involved but it's six weeks I hear this and I have to say I don't know I just get frustrated right because every time and I'm sure you do too right every time there's a little stall whether it's six weeks or 18 months or whatever we end up right where we are right now so y'all say this the Aaron I think we all know that at a minimum this is going to be a two step process so if you do a debt ceiling in CR as we want to do we acknowledge they're still we're still going to have to come back to do the budget deal for 2014 at a minimum maybe even a broader one to deal with the sequester so there's going to be two steps so that the first step might be six weeks or it might be eight weeks that's understood what we need to do is reopen government and affirm that America will honor its debts but then we need to get into this kind of a budget negotiation that the Senate has been trying to do since the 26th of March and let me ask you about that what Paul Ryan wrote today I'm sure you saw his wall street i did not bad you know saying look the stalemate can end because both parties can agree on the need for entitlement and tax reform and you know he noted the stunning statistic that you know well right and pat title meant spending is expected to grow seventy-nine percent over the next ten years he suggests that could be changed with things like increasing the retirement age and i know plenty of democrats who agree with that are you open to making a deal now that would include those kinds of things so i marinate problems aaron i mean i was when i saw that article by paul ryan i just kind of was you got to be kidding me we passed a budget in the senate in march that basically put a number in for entitlement reform that we want to find savings with entitlement reforms and we've been trying to go to a conference with the house since the 26 the march and they'd been blocking it every time we've tried we don't want a conference because we don't want to compromise what they wanted was a confrontation not a compromise and as you know less than three hours after they shut government down they then sent across ok now we're ready to sit down and have a conference but not about the budget we want to have a conference over what are the conditions under which we will allow the government of the united states to reopen but look at any point a compromise and a conference is a good idea if they finally come to it after six and a half months of course we want to sit down and do it but there's no reason to keep all these people laid off private contractors i met with a bunch of employees and private contractors in my office today they're all laid off furloughed they're all worried about their paychecks um why would we keep them laid off they can come back to work and we can and we can negotiate all right how much center can't appreciate your time

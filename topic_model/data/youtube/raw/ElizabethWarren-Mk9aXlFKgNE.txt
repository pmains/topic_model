you know there's an old saying justice delayed is justice denied the idea that you don't just need the right outcome you need it now and that's the problem we've got around being able to see Donald Trump's taxes so look I think that there's a good chance he'll be able to hold off hold off hold off until after November third on revealing his taxes but boy that should be a message loud and clear and big flashing neon lights that Donald Trump has got a lot to hide he is trying to cover up for his own corruption and for his corrupt government and once again that's where you see the kind of comparison jump is a man who's put his taxes out there for everyone to see he's also a man who wanted to have an Inspector General oversee the work he did in the last bailout with the obama-biden administration Donald Trump exactly in the opposite direction I'm telling you the contrasts in 20/20 could not be clearer and that's why I'm in this fight all the way for Joe by

odds and accomplished much who better to represent our great state in statuary hall than dwight d heisenhauer and now a native daughter of kansas amelia earhart i want to extend my gratitude to our congressional leaders and our kansas delegation for the opportunity to honor one of kansas most iconic figures a woman who showed all of us what it means to reach for the stars amelia earhart was born and raised in atchison kansas a small town overlooking the missouri river from a very early age amelia was a dreamer her dreams went far beyond the banks of that river and far beyond the prescribed gender roles of her time kansans have long celebrated our women trailblader lasers like susanna salter the first woman elected mayor in the united states in 1887 long before women had the right to vote like georgia niece gray who during the truman administration became the first woman to serve as united states treasurer and lucinda todd who actually lit the flame that resulted in the 1954 decision brown versus board of education a ruling that changed the world as we know it so it is fitting today we're dedicating a statue in honor of one of the most notable of our pioneering women let it be an inspiration for all particularly our young girls for generations to come let them stare up at this work of art and think that they like amelia can dream the impossible dream that they can beat the unbeatable foe that they will run where the brave dare not go that they will have the power to right the unrightable wrong and that they will reach their unreachable star again on behalf of the state of kansas i want to express my deepest appreciation for this immortalization of an extraordinary individual who truly represents the best of the kansas spirit ladies and gentlemen the honorable cherise davids united states representative from the third district of kansas good afternoon good afternoon everybody well for folks who i have not had the chance to meet yet i'm sharice

much um you know when i got to congress one of the first questions that our team asked was how can we help make this a reality and actually senator roberts was one of the folks who helped helped us figure out how we could be helpful and i know folks have been working on this for at least 20 years and amelia earhart has landed in washington d.c [Applause] it has been 90 years since amelia earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic ocean and while that might be what she is best known for she was also a military nurse a social worker an author a wife an activist for gender equality and a woman who really was breaking the glass ceiling on a field that was dominated by men at the time you know female pilots used to be called ladybirds sweethearts of the air and because of amelia earhart back then now and into the future uh women who fly planes are now called pilots uh so you know amelia earhart had that that rare gift of the ability to see without limitation what a better future for herself and for others could look like and throughout her life she turned setbacks and failures into into challenges a challenge to do better a challenge to fly higher to to change the way the game is played and i know tens of thousands of people come through this this very spot every year and now i'm really excited that so many people are going to get the chance to be inspired by amelia earhart as i have been she is a true kansas hero an icon and i appreciate all the work that went into making sure that that that we were able to have this unveiling today thank you to the earhart family thank you to so many of you who made this day possible it is really an honor to continue kansas's legacy of aviation and that is a legacy that is filled with amelia earhart's spirit her tenacity her grit and her courage thank you all so much i hope you enjoy the rest of the ceremony today ladies and gentlemen the honorable jerry morin united states senator from kansas three years after kansas became a state statuary hall where we are today was established in 1864 and each state was granted two statutes of citizens who were quote illustrious for their historic renown or for st for distinguished civic or military service as each state may deem worthy of this national commemoration over in the rotunda stands one bronze statue of the kansan dwight d eisenhower general and former president of the united states and for more than a century standing in this location has been a kansas statement statesman john ingles who proudly represented our state as our second statute today we have a new kansan to represent our state in the u.s capitol someone recognized for her historic renown as an aviator but also someone who broke barriers created opportunities for others and captivated the attention of the world with her adventuresome spirit kansas's amelia earhart with dwight d eisenhower and now amelia earhart kansas officially has two of the most iconic and recognizable american heroes representing any state in the united states capital i thank just a few people in the room who made this happen jackie pray john karen seberg and reid berger with the atchison amelia earhart foundation thank you for never giving up thank you for never giving up perhaps amelia was your role model emilia's ambition and spirit of adventure that took her around the world was built on a foundational upbringing in atchison it is fitting today that the foundation on which she stands is from limestone from the flint hills of kansas between two and three million people from around the world will visit the u s capital every year and it's our hope that with this statute of amelia earhart it will encourage other girls and boys from small towns across the country to dream to dream big and to work hard to achieve those dreams as for those who can't travel to the us capital they can visit the amelia earhart hangar museum in atchison where a replica of the statue will be on display a statue of a determined young woman with short cut hair a curious smile a bomber hat in hand and a sunflower on her belt buckle amia earhart's first flight across the atlantic she was a passenger she clearly lamented that that she was a passenger because when she landed she was asked about the flight and her response was there's more to life than just being a passenger greatness comes through action our country's greatest achievements and those around the world have depended upon those who were more than just a passenger who cast aside the fears of failure and pushed to expand boundaries of what they thought was then possible from the wright brothers to amelia earhart from alan shepard to sally ride it is true in the history of flight and it's true in the history of the united states of america and it's no less true today in the lives of every american dream and accomplish the ordinary becomes extraordinary through action as editorialized today in the atchison globe earhart was a dreamer who refused to conform to the roles assigned to women instead blazed her own trail and we are reminded today here in statuary hall god created each of us each of us to be more than just a passenger thank you [Applause] ladies and gentlemen susan graham white accompanied by john carroll erin murphy snatacore and andreya vacco [Music] in 1921 when skyward meant a new frontier in aviation's time was young her parents said what can we do but they could not deny that emilia was a woman who was not afraid to fly in 1932 she put her flying to the test a transatlantic flight those days was hazardous at best had his day but legend in the sky and emilia was a woman who was not afraid to try and i'm just this side of heaven i didn't know the sky could sing now my heart is [Music] in june of 37 amelia made her final flight she tried to fly around the world to prove a woman might in search of howling she got lost in sea and sky but amelia was a woman who was not afraid to die [Music] the milieu was a woman who was not afraid to fly [Music] bye [Music] [Applause] ladies and gentlemen the honorable kevin mccarthy republican leader of the united states house of representatives [Applause] what a beautiful song thank you for that you know on may 20th 1932 amelia earhart took off from canada for europe determined to conquer the atlantic ocean by air and show the world what she could do fifteen hours one engine fire some storms and a leaky fuel gauge later she landed safely in ireland leaping into the history books as the first woman pilot defy slow solo across the atlantic she was a pilot a journalist and a nurse earhart won the hearts of the american people with her daring adventures her exploits encouraged the development of commercial aviation set many aviation records and paved the way for women to take to the skies but earhart was more than a flyer and a trailblazer she was a leader she took responsibility and led with decisive action one of her greatest access has been said was her humility she always praised her peers and mentored other pilots many of whom she inspired through her bravery she gave many americans hope at the moment they needed it on the other hand she certainly wasn't timid like all pioneers she hungered to push the boundaries of human achievement and she accomplished so many incredible feats because she was daring determined and mission oriented 85 years after she vanished amelia earhart still inspires us her legacy encourages us to pursue our dreams and shoot for the stars and i'm proud to say that americans are still exploring new frontiers i believe if amelia earhart was alive today she would not be just in the sky she'd probably be up in space maybe from mojave or maybe from florida or maybe leading spacex you know we get thousands of visitors in this capital every year this is always my favorite place to go and i look and i watch just as yesterday people taking pictures it's usually grandparents or parents with their grandchildren and they take them by different statues i look forward to looking over to this corner i'm sure we'll watch a lot of young women taking a picture and i wonder what new frontiers will be inspired by amelia earhart and much more boundaries will be broken what new balance will come out of the world from a little corner in a capital of her dreams still living and boundaries unfold of what could be broken i want to thank kansas for never giving up and i want to thank kansas for continuing the aviation they've been known to have with a beautiful statue honoring an amazing woman an amazing american that continues to inspire us thank you [Applause] ladies and gentlemen the honorable mitch mcconnell republican leader of the united states senate [Applause] 90 years ago this coming friday the first civilian ever and the first woman ever was presented with the distinguished flying cross a history-making moment but of course by the time congress authorized that medal for mia earhart in 1932 she had already made history many times over she'd taken on altitude records and smashed them speed records she shattered them among a long list of female firsts she'd become the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic about a year after that medal ceremony she'd be helping to stand up a new daily commercial airline as an executive both literally and figuratively amelia earhart blazed a trail into the sky in every sense she occupied rarified air but she did not just soar over as one person she also focused on putting down new ladders of opportunity so that others could follow amelia earhart helped inspire and shepherd whole generations of aviators both women and men a friend and competitor of amelia's name ruth nichols brought the aviation craze to my hometown of louisville kentucky with her own record-setting flight all the way from oakland california together they were charter members and leaders of the 99s an organization that supports women in aviation to this day all of these heroics all of this leadership took place thousands of feet up toward the heavens but her character was first formed in the rich heartland of kansas those were the roots that helped launch emilia where the open plains frame a wide open sky i could not imagine a more fitting american to stand honored in this place [Applause]

earhart's name is synonymous with courage her brave renew no boundaries or borders soaring from coast to coast continent to continent island to shore as we all know amelia earhart's towering legacy as an aviator is to be rivaled by few she was the first woman as we know and the only the second person to fly solo across the atlantic as senator moran discussed and in doing so she also set new records for speed and time elapsed between two continents for the barrier she broke the congress awarded her the distinguished flying cross the first woman in american history to receive this prestigious honor for her extraordinary feats reporters in the at the time called her the queen of the air but not only was she an outstanding aviator but she had a strong moral compass as an outspoken champion for gender equality amelia envisioned aviation as a great equalizer and she fought valiantly to close the gender gap in a 1935 radio address she offered words that continue to inspire us today and these are her words aviation this young modern giant exemplifies the possible relationship of women and the creation of science while still greatly outnumbered they are finding more and more opportunities for employment in the ranks of this latest transportation medium i hope this movement will spread through all branches of science and industry and that women may come to share with men

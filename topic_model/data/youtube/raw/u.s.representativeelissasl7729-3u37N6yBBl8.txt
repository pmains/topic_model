mr speaker i rise to recognize an organization that brings together fierce rivals in the name of shared community an organization that bridges the sometimes impossible differences between us an organization helping to bring arch rivals together for the betterment of the community and most specifically an organization that literally bridges the 64 miles between michigan state university in east lansing and the university of michigan in ann arbor most days any spartan or wolverine will tell you that those miles are still too close for comfort but on this on the friday before the big game between both schools a new tradition has emerged in the name of charity community spirit and expanding access to all it's called alex's great state race named after alex powell a young man accepted to michigan state as he underwent treatment for a rare and aggressive cancer alex had always dreamed of attending msu but the surgeries chemo and radiation treatment left him unable to carry out his studies with the normal vigor of a freshman student thankfully alex turned msu's resource center for persons with disabilities or rcpd devoted to inclusivity on campus for students employees and visitors alike the rcpd provided alex with a dorm room near his classes offered support to him and his family and accommodated his needs as they became more complex they made arrangements to provide alex the same msu experience as any other student even when he was being treated at a cancer center at the university of michigan 64 miles away despite his valiant fight alex lost his battle with cancer in 2011. those around him remember his vibrant spirit and easy sense of humor even in the midst of a debilitating illness more than anything alex wanted to leave a legacy that would inspire others which is how his mother juliana got in touch with the folks at the resource center who played such an important role in his life together they created the great state race in alex's name a charity organization dedicated to raising money for the rcpd as well as its counterpart at university of michigan the office of services for students with disabilities now celebrating its seventh year alex's great state race is an example of what can unite us each year no matter how intense the rivalry between the two schools rotc cadets from both michigan and michigan state come together to run the game ball the 64 miles separating the two campuses supported by police that line the route gracious donations that make it possible and a community united by the spirit of charity alex's great uh state race proves that despite our split allegiances we absolutely have a common humanity today i'm proud to honor the powell family the rotc cadets and all the folks involved at both schools who raise money for such a worthy cause as the jewish prayer of remembrance says so long as we live they too shall live for they are now a part of us as we remember them mr speaker we all remember alex as long as these words will exist in the congressional record which is to say we remember alex forever

this problem we don't need to conflate the two issues Todd Linton school safety second Amendment restrictions hit Dan when it comes to school safety when comes to our kids in America we can both do good and feel good we've got to find a way to do that my kids attended the school they're in elementary school here in Houston ISD when Sandy Hook happened and I'll never forget going up to their school the week after that happened in the doors locked you know we started locking our doors I've campaigned all over this district I've enjoyed meeting with people learning from them about their challenges learned about their hopes and dreams the worst day campaigning was a day when a bunch of Republican members of Congress were shot playing baseball some before last year and you know I'll never forget going home and making a sandwich and sitting down and turn on the TV and my son Jack came and sat next to me and after about a minute or so he just looked at me said dad somebody try to shoot you there's nobody that's that's not gonna happen I mean but that is where our kids are right now our kids are walking out of the schools of Santa Fe they're walking at schools of parkland with their hands up because we've trained our kids that when as active shooter comes in you need to get out that building your hands up so you're not shot by a law enforcement officer - first responder that is that's horrific that is what our kids are dealing with just like I grew up doing fire drills they're doing active shooter drills at our schools learning cannot occur education cannot occur for our kids for our teachers or anybody else we've got to find a way forward I'll look at universal background checks and get in an area just like dreamers where a lot of people agree on 94% of Texans want universal background checks 97% of Americans these aren't gonna prevent people from transferring their their weapons to their child I mean this is a way to stop people with felonies this is a way to stop people with domestic violence convictions from purchasing guns people who are dangerous to themselves that's how we increase public safety we can do good and feel good at not infringe on the Second Amendment I don't want to take in guys guns away that's not what this is about but it's trying to keep guns out of hands there's an easy way to do with universal background check I believe every almost every Texan wants to make that happen I will work hard to make sure that happens I look to an assault weapon bans we've got to figure out a way on assault weapons to move forward or to you know if not ban them as we did for ten years I'll look at raising the age as well I'm gonna leave it there gonna leave it there real quick response Dan well most of that I don't disagree with but it didn't actually offer any solutions to help our schools okay he said universal background checks and he said that would keep hands the guns out of the hands of felons felons already can't buy guns so I'm really not sure I think you're misinforming people on what universal background checks actually are I'm banning a are is they're responsible for less than two percent of gun deaths all right that's just the facts so again I do want to do good and feel good right but but the do good part has to actually happen and it's really not clear that that an assault what an assault rifle ban would actually do any good next issue let's turn to healthcare your point eight million Texans have no health insurance roughly seventeen percent of the population we although Texas did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act but does maintain locally funded health care safety nets like the Harris health system which serves many of the uninsured some argue that while this system is far from perfect it ultimately gets the job done others mostly Democrats insist Texas and the nation must invest in Medicare for all at taxpayer expense I'm gonna go with Dan first it's an incredibly complex issue what kind of leadership will you bring to it well they healthcare absolutely is it is a credibly important issue I mean I know firsthand all right I used the VA I know what socialized medicine actually looks like I'm very glad that the VA is there for our veterans it's also very clear to me that it can't be extrapolated to the broader population okay so we tried Obamacare all right Obamacare has resulted in higher premiums reduced access doctors are getting tired of being in the practice and it's it's overall not working well I understand the good intentions but overall it's not working well okay so we have to look at two things I think with respect to health care that that mattered in people's sustainability and Trust all right is it sustainable and financial level obviously Medicare for all is it I know Todd agrees with that and is it sustainable from a management perspective can a group of experts in Washington actually manage an entire country's healthcare system or should it be done at the local level which brings us to trust do we trust people to self-govern do we trust harris county to figure out what works for harris county and actually Hera's health doing pretty well do we trust doctors to be in charge of our health care we all agree with all the third party insurers in charge of a health care Democrats would prefer the government bureaucracy be in charge of the health care well let's but doctors in charge of your health care so incremental ways to do that I like the direct primary care model where you look at doctors across the country right now having membership programs where a patient can pay $100 a month have direct access to a primary care doctor get the preventive care they need that's the best way to start and we need to incentivize that kind of thing it's great health care yeah health care is the biggest is your hair bell on the trail no matter what corner of the district mi I hear people a concern about health care access and health care costs we have got to drive health care costs down I actually did not support Medicare for all it stood up to my party on that and the primary and everything but we've got to find a way to get every person access to health care and it can't be through the emergency rooms it clogs up the emergency rooms and it costs way too much my mom my wife was a ER doc had been taught for a while and she saw way too many people delaying care and coming in when their their quality of life going way down and it cost a lot more to get them healthy this is again where we can do good and feel good at the same time it's more effective for people to lead healthy lives and be able to be productive for their families in our community as a whole drug price is another huge issue in our in our district all around my son has a nut allergy and so we never forget buying his epi pens about two years ago the price is going through the roof that doesn't make any sense it has a huge impact on people we spend about 60% more on drug costs in the United States of America than most other developed countries we've gotta let Medicare negotiate those prices down and provide lower cost rate buy that have a big impact every week every month for people in our district finally look at Medicaid for all it makes no sense to me that we have not expanded access to Medicare we've got about a million people in Texas who would qualify for expanded Medicaid they would have high quality care leave better lives it would cost a lot less for us to work we're paying here in Texas to expand Medicaid to California to Massachusetts to New York we're not paying for it here because what we pay for it at the Harris County hospital system when people come in and they're uninsured care we're paying twice and we're getting less care less health for our people that makes no sense okay it's time for our closing remarks we're gonna have to cut it down to 30 seconds each Dan Crenshaw you go first well first of all thanks for letting us do this Greg this has been a phenomenal opportunity I would say why am i running okay well I'm running to continue service and I'm ready to make an impact that matters on the issues that matter to houstonians you know six years ago I didn't think I'd ever bill to make an impact again it was so badly wounded in Afghanistan but I knew I had to but I knew I had to to further the vision that we have for this country that this vision where we believe that you know best what to do with your money you know best what to do with your freedom you know best what to do with your time and I promise you one thing which is to give you a representative in Washington that you can be proud of okay Todd Lydon 30 seconds yeah my wife and I saw more than a year ago to get in this race for Congress the US House of Representatives because we have big concerns for the future for our kids and for our country Washington is just broken nothing is getting done it's so hyper partisan so divisive so chaotic we've got to work together like we do in Houston like I've done in the community and my work and also my service the community we look to find solutions and get things done that's what I do in Washington I'll work with Republicans Democrats independents to find how we tackle those find solutions for healthcare for flooding and infrastruc

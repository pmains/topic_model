on America tonight me as the president honors victims of a racially motivated mass shooting we look at a long legacy of slavery I found fingerprints right here I find these things you'd never know these are the fingerprints off the slave that believes made that particular break also tonight Love Wins meet two dads behind a landmark decision by the US Supreme Court in favor of same-sex marriage look at your dance right now what do you want to say to them everything out of you for doing this for everyone and good evening thanks for joining us i'm adam a sitting in for Joey Chen tonight what a day at the US Supreme Court think of this just one decade ago states were passing constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage and now it's the law of the land few social issues have seen such a dramatic fast switch so many people are asking why this one a lot say it's the children of gay and lesbian parents that turned this debate on its heels for the last few months I've been following the story of two Kentucky dads that have been leading the charge for equality and today we witness their family win at the Supreme Court history made at the Supreme Court same-sex marriage legalized in all 50 states celebration joy at a sense of awe took center stage after a legal fight that's been decades in the making Greg Bourke and Michael DeLeon were plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case the Kentucky couple said they were fighting for their kids there was an emotional and for daughter Bella look at your dancer right now what do you want to say to them I'm really proud of you for doing this for everyone their case was called Bork V Bashir legal analysts predicted their appeal would be the roe v wade of same-sex marriage the case that would go to the US Supreme Court it did we certainly didn't think that we would be a case going to Supreme Court we thought that that would be played out long before us there were so many other states in the queue before us and we really thought well this is going to get settled before Kentucky makes it to the Supreme Court and sure enough all the other circuits have favor of marriage equality except for the Sixth Circuit obviously so we're shocked the Sixth Circuit is often called unpredictable and it was here that day Lyon and Bork lost their appeal the federal appeals court had upheld the same-sex marriage bans in four states Kentucky Michigan Ohio and Tennessee in the only appeals court ruling that upheld bands Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote by creating a status marriage the state's created an incentive for two people who procreate together for purposes of rearing offspring couples are the same sex do not have children in the same way as couples of opposite sexes that's obvious to Michael and Greg they adopted their two children Bella and Isaiah they've had to jump through numerous legal hoops to try and duplicate the legal protections automatically granted heterosexual parents complicated by Kentucky adoption laws that don't treat same-sex couples equally it's been a challenge over the years even before we had children we had to go to extraordinary means to kind of a marriage in terms of legal rights but with children it goes to a whole different level we've had to set one of us up as a legal guardian so that that Michaels the adoptive parent of our two children and the legal guardian there are many things that have had to be taken into account because we don't have that legal status as being married spend all the work that you've done drop all these Leo agreements are you still lacking the same rights as heterosexual couples here very much so but the big thing for us is to be able to put both of our names on the certificates as their parents because you don't have that we can't we're still prohibited from doing that that's really what's motivating us this is why we wanted to sue for marriage equality because you know we've been parenting these children together for 16 years and still as far as state of Kentucky is concerned I have no legal claim no legal status I am a legal guardian but you know in terms of other verses on a birth certificate and they wouldn't well they would tell you that yes so you know these are things that are important to us in typical teenage fashion Isaiah backed up his father's you want to jump in here for a minute how their you want to talk about what whatever the sky was to ask this is adam i say what's it like to have two dads in the city turkey kind of awesome two awesome dudes have been parenting me since I was three years old and everything that I am and the reason why I am the man today is because of these two beautiful and some young gentleman he really lays out some money or something yes if something were to happen to Michael Pam and greg has no legal rights to his children and that doesn't make sense for anyone these people raise these children when I look at them I see a family doesn't matter Shannon father is part of the legal team representing reg and a handful of other Kentucky couples who also sued many of the couples are already married in other jurisdictions for example Greg and Michael actually tied the knot in Ontario on the canadian side of niagara falls back in 2004 but that marriage meant nothing in the state of Kentucky our class referred to is Kentucky married and federally married you're not Kentucky married you were just federally married what's the real impact on that for clients that you represent our clients can't both be the legal parents of the children they've adopted or that they have together it is a perfectly reasonable position to think that a child grows up best in a home with a mother and a father it's reasonable for government to encourage that Martin Katherine a conservative Christian writer helped lead the campaign ten years ago to ban same-sex marriage in Kentucky the 2004 constitutional amendment passed with seventy-four percent of the boat what are the highest votes against marriage equality in the nation his group the Family Foundation of Kentucky filed an amicus brief in berkeley Beshear there's no reason why Kentuckians should have to rely on California to make our marriage policy for 37 other states or 30 37 other states which could conceivably be struck down you want the supreme court to strike down all the marriages no I just want I just want the supreme court to allow states to set their own marriage policy but now a majority of the Supreme Court and the president see this change differently this morning the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality in doing so they've reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law that all people should be treated equally regardless of who they or who they love so you go back to Kentucky how does life change I'm not sure that it will I mean I'm supposed to work on Monday so we'll see how that goes i have to work you have to parent you got to bring these kids around garlic than i need to dig up and some onions and after all fighting for marriage was really about fighting for normalcy in everyday life i feel like now people don't have to hide the fact that that's who they are joining us now is california congressman mark Takano openly gay member of Congress from California thanks so much for joining us you're out there on the steps of the courthouse early this morning you watch that decision to come down what was going through your mind when you saw what it was actually happening there oh gosh know that i was thinking very much but just absorbed in the moment i was standing in front of a gay men's chorus and as the interns from the Supreme Court these young people run copies of the decision down to the press corps they started singing the star-spangled banner did you anticipate this result from the Supreme Court I think there was any question I there was a little tiny bit of a question my mind of what would happen and they could have ruled in slightly different ways but I think as soon as the crowd heard that Justice Kennedy was reading the decision that was enough of a signal to the crowd on to those of us to know that that that you that this decision was going to be good so as a member of Congress does this once and for all put gay lesbian members of our country on an equal footing with everyone else well now that marriage rights have been granted well the Supreme Court threw a huge big wedding bouquet out to same-sex couples the gay couples all over the country but i have to say they're going to they're going to rightly want to get married some are getting there and as soon as they post pictures of their weddings on Facebook many of these people in many parts but country are going to face the prospect of being fired from their jobs being evicted by their landlords and possibly in some states and there's governors so much that you're threatening this that they may not be treated fairly in stores we're talking about discrimination that still exists in some parts of the country what and we do about that on the Congressional level progressed level is that we can act on as soon as we introduce it in this session the comprehensive LGBT civil rights act and this Act would be what we used to call in Des and the plus and OH was threat was what this address the issues of housing would this address the issues of discrimination and the work Paul of the above all of the above that's where we're try we call it the comprehensive doesn't have the support to get through a republican-led Congress well procedurally know procedurally just as with say the immigration bill that passed the Senate bipartisan basis the majority of majority of the house the Republicans in the House can procedurally stop that legislation from being considered on the floor even though there's possibly called a coalition of House members that would probably voted into law we have a a pro equality LGBT equality majority in the house if we can input the airship allows them to be leadership level Megan's for all right well that sounds like the next battleground and the gay rights movement congressman thanks for joining us my pleasure thank you Adam

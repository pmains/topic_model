bayern donald's sweeping florida 19th congressional district 61-38 becoming the third ever black republican from the sunshine state to be elected to the house of representatives and he joins us now fresh off his big win it's congressman like byron donalds good morning congratulations congressman elect if i had to if you had to pin it down i asked you what's the one thing that resonated that clearly got people to vote you in overwhelming martins in a record amount of time with uh results coming in what would be the one message that resonated uh it's really two messages the first is that southwest florida has always believed in conservative principles i'm a conservative and that's very clear not just my time in florida's legislature but my time as a conservative activist here for the last 10 years the second thing is is that our supervisor of elections in league county and collier county are some of the best not just in florida but in the country they know how to count ballots they do it efficiently and effectively and that's why the results come so quickly yeah i saw former governor jeb bush say we learned our lesson in 2000 we made the appropriate corrections to our ballot counting process you know byron um the people of your district in fact for that matter the people of america must have not gotten the memo because we have been told for four plus five years that republicans are racist in fact here is the memo in audio and video form over the last five years there is a great amount of racism anti-blackness anti-wokeness this idea that political correctness is some sort of scheme to destroy white america this president has shown us that he is a misogynist that he is homophobic that he is uh racist donald trump probably personifies the most racist xenophobic sexist administration we've seen in our lifetime and that's just over the last couple of days i say that message must not have gotten across the nation because donald trump doubled his vote with black women increased his vote with black men increased his vote with lgbt in fact doubled that vote increased his vote with latinos and byron you in a let me make sure i get this right 85 percent white and 51 female district also won by an overwhelming margin did they not get the memo they don't believe in that memo because that memo is stupid that memo is idiotic what voters care about in america whether you're a white black hispanic it's about principles it's about policy and it's about the things you're going to push forward for the future of our country this divisive uh racist rhetoric from the left is the very thing that so many voters including hispanic voters and black voters are beginning to reject beginning to reject i'm glad they're doing it because it's high time we get back to the business of the american people and not this divisive rhetoric from the left imagine that seeing the world through character action and principles happy to see that south florida southwest florida was ready to do just that congratulations on your win byron donalds thank you so much

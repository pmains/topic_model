we'll talk about two topics today one i was reminded of when i was in saint joseph missouri in kansas city missouri and springfield and joplin over the weekend talking to health care providers and volunteers frankly of all kinds who are trying to do what they can to help us emerge from this pandemic stronger than we were to start with certainly the first comes to mind are the health care workers themselves and medical workers themselves the doctors the nurses the support staff who we've relied on from the very first moments that we began to realize that this virus was bigger than any health issue we've dealt with in a long time we're still depending on them today and you know at some point you you run out of some of the capacity and steam that you have to do the job that needs to be done but we see these heroes continue to step up some giving their lives billy birmingham in kansas city was an emergency medical technician he was with the kansas city fire department and he died of coronavirus in april his son also his son described billy as selfless he said billy had decided he wanted to find new ways to help people and so he reinvented himself as an emt when he was in his 40s so he could help others and then he was an emt for about 22 years we see the emergency medical technicians the first responders out there saving lives bringing people in a desperate situation to the hospital as infectious as many of them can be it's sort of the height of of the suffering that they've had and unable to do much to help you help them but we see that happening lots of sacrifice in the community that we are benefited by people like heather black at the truman harry s truman memorial hospital in columbia she donated 623 mask for her colleagues and the veterans at the facility the veterans they take care of she brought her sewing machine to work so then her free time she could make mass before her shift and after her shift and during her breaks one of her colleagues said you have to be just literally awed by somebody that dedicated to helping people who remember in between the breaks where she's making masks she's helping care for the patients at the veterans hospital we see people finding different ways to be heroes in their community dozens of people in cape girardeau missouri in may helped put it decide they put a parade together for residents of the veterans home who weren't able to have visitors so the veterans got to the windows and the dozens of people came by doing what they could to present maybe a memorial day kind of parade or the groups in st louis and other places but particularly the one i was thinking about in st louis where they went around and collected food and personal care items and they took those to people who had lost their jobs who were suffering from the pandemic who were isolated in their efforts i talked today to a number of people in the behavioral health area who understand that at moments like this people who have behavioral health issues have logical reasons for those issues to begin to pile up on them you're isolated you're sick or somebody in your family's sick you've lost a job or somebody you know has lost a job and those issues get bigger and then we see businesses who figure out how to use their unique set of resources whatever that might be to make things happen when we have it hard find it hard to get hand sanitizers a number of distilleries went into the hand sanitizer business anheuser-busch not a distillery but a brewery used its brewery facilities to produce more than a half a million bottles of hand sanitizer and then they look use their distribution system to get those half a million bottles in the communities and places around the country where they would do the most good the bass pro shops in my hometown springfield missouri donated 1 million face masks to health care workers on the front lines from delivering truckloads of critical supplies to simply checking on our neighbors there are thousands of stories to tell in towns across missouri and mr president and towns in georgia where you live every people doing all they can to make this terrible situation less terrible this challenging situation less challenging and we are grateful to them i know a number of people have come to the floor today to talk about those heroes and how they serve us mr president the second topic i wanted to talk about is we spend lots of time discussing what to do in this next phase of dealing with the coronavirus legislation i want to talk about something we did earlier and the results that it's produced in april senator alexander and i proposed that the national institutes of health create a shark tank a shark tank program for scientists to develop new technologies for coven 19 testing nih set that up very quickly we gave them the authority and the money to do it but they in a week did what they normally would have done in six months they've been working overtime ever since with the private sector and with the barda the biomedical advanced research and development authority to meet the tremendous needs for quicker and earlier tests mr president you and i talked about this just the other day that the president's right in his view that some of these tests only tell us information that gives us more data we need tests that are quicker and have an immediate response if you get a test and you don't have a response for five days that really doesn't do anybody a whole lot of good you've been moving around for five days maybe without symptoms but you don't know that you're continuing to spread the virus but you are if you'd known in five in five minutes or 15 minutes what it took you five days to find out how many less people would have gotten the disease if you'd have known what you needed to know when you need to know it we need tests that give you an accurate results in minutes that are easy to take and inexpensive tests that cost from a dollar to five or six dollars that give you an immediate response so this is a program that we've asked nih the national institute of health to work on to put together scientists and researchers and engineers to come up with their boldest ideas and so forth since april 29th 650 applications have been submitted of ideas from single individuals or businesses deciding i think this would work would be sort of the starting point and then 650 and by the way a lot more people than 650 had and i think this will work idea but when they sat down to think about it you had 650 people units of some kind make a proposal that they thought needed a careful look 31 of those projects have already gone into phase one testing where they go through a process of validation of seeing if the likelihood that this will work was as great as the scientists the engineers the technologists that were looking at the populating the shark tank thought it would be nih scientists hope to be able to select at least 20 of these to consider even more quickly and in fact just last week announced seven companies to start scaling up production of their technology we're investing taxpayers are investing about 250 million dollars to help those tests get out there quickly these are tests that could be available as early as next month some of them are the type of rapid test that gives a result on site one test uses a handheld device that can could that can detect the virus within 30 minutes another test companies developed a way to speed up lab testing so that labs that now handle hundreds could handle tens of thousands in the same period of time uh these kinds of technologies and others are essential if we want to get our society fully reopened in early april there was an average of 145 000 tests today today we're running about 800 000 tests but often they're not the kind of tests we need and they're not the numbers we need we need we need tests that millions of people can take the test dozens of times we need to ask for every person who walks into an office or a factory or a nursing home or a school or a child care center has the confidence to know that they're not bringing a virus into that center that they don't know about it's a high hurdle but i think it's one we're going to clear the heels act includes another 16 billion dollars for testing to help in our priorities which are nursing homes and day care centers child care centers elementary and secondary schools colleges and universities those are things where we think the government itself has an extraordinary obligation to make the difference that's 16 billion dollars added with nine billion dollars of money for this purpose that hadn't been spent up till now means that we have that kind of big investment to see that people have tests that work for them uh and work quickly for these things to happen we have congress has to act congress has to move we have to be supportive of efforts that get our society back to school back to work back to child care and back to better health and with that mr president i'd yield the floor

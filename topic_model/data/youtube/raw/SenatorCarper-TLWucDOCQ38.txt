well president said to 12 you said you know we spend more money for health care than any other advanced nation on earth we don't get better results and there's probably all the stakeholders whether they're doctors nurses providers insurers employers large small pharmaceutical companies everybody all the stay close could try this apartment what we have to do is find a way to instead of nipple the legislative trainwreck to be able to get everybody to table state the table until we get this done and the president said of all the things we're trying to do this is may be as important as anything we're trying to get done this year we can't to continue to spend every more money for health care and not get better results it says because we putting our country companies like like our auto companies a huge disadvantage other employers in our country's largest won't hit a very large disadvantage against the rest of oil and it's going to break our back financially as a nation we're gonna there's no way we can balance our budgets there's no way can go out with a neutral hologram without addressing this I'm sorry beliefs in the prevention and wellness I work out every day try to write through take good care of myself and one of the things we need to do is incentivize people to take better care of themselves and to reduce the likelihood that they're going to be sick and go into hospitals anyway second thing i reminded my mom my mom's now deceased but she lived for many years in down in Florida of my dad died and she had dementia and and she got worse you know we had people living with her and taking care of her throughout through the day and I my sister's Kentucky I'm Delaware so hey any of it my mom had five or six doctors down here and my sister and I agree on take turns every other month used to check out and make sure she's doing okay gentlemen dr. work with her owner to make sure and other were arthritis another heart doctor and you're all prescribing medicines like she's taking 15 different medicines a lot of doctors were talking with each other none of the care was coordinated some of the medicines that she was taking worked against other medicines and mayor condition worse rather than better so I think what we need to do is to be able to better treat people holistically to make sure that there's if it were a coordinator of care and that people have a sort of medical home we need more primary care docs and folks to to work guy at that level or maybe just a few less less specialists

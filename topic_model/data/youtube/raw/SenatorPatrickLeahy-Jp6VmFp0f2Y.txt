yes i had an attack on myself and um shortly after 9 11 i received one of the deadly or was addressed to me and won the deadly uh anthrax letters people died because the letter is addressed to me and i still wonder who sent it and why they said it i think i'll probably wonder that for the rest of my life for a period of time the capitol police were superb provided security i felt i really didn't need it i feel perfectly safe in my state of vermont it's the most one of the safest states in the nation i know our local and state police in vermont have procedures for public meetings in vermont i am very satisfied with what they are obviously i'm not going to go into the details of it for the security reasons the capital itself is very very secure anybody who when i think of uh dean might think of what it was like when i was in law school you just walk in and all the doors open it's a little bit different today so i don't feel any worry being there um i would not want to see every member of congress walking around with security we have it for the obvious ones of leadership and the and the speaker and i have no problem with that i don't want to see members of congress all walking around with security i think it isolates you from the people you represent it's not the kind of country we are i've been in countries uh totalitarian countries where every single person has seems to have security that people from some of these countries come to visit and they're surprised to see me get in the car driving my own car or driving home and i'm going to go i want to go i want to keep it that way i think it would be a mistake if we put any more barriers the one place we can really be ourselves is at home i want that to continue and the country is better off if we can but i would urge i really would urge and this is not i'd urge us to the right and the left stop every time you disagree disagree with somebody in public office stop attacking their motives and ascribing some kind of a nefarious motive just because they disagree with you we have good men and women across the political spectrum who represent people in this country across the political spectrum but let us understand there are no easy answers to the problems facing america there never have been there weren't easy answers in world war one and world war ii there weren't easy answers during the great depression but we had men and women who came together and sought the best answers possible to make this a greater and stronger country don't we owe that to our children and our grandchildren step back from the rhetoric start going to reality step back from the the symbols and go to substance let's start working together this is a great and wonderful country we are a beacon to the rest of the world let's make sure that beacon's a little bit brighter than it has been

hello i'm jackie speier congresswoman from the 14th congressional district in california we are at a moment of reckoning for too long in too many workplaces men and women have been propositioned grabbed licked kissed and groped they've seen their careers crumble into dust through no fault of their own they have been driven out of industries journalism entertainment and yes Congress in which they had worked for years to excel now at last we are reckoning with this predatory plague that has spread throughout this institution including the very floor of the House of Representatives now survivors are stepping forward to say me too they are saying that they will no longer be silenced by powerful men by high-priced lawyers and by restrictive non-disclosure agreements and now at last the reckoning has come to Congress it is undeniably clear that misguided attempts to protect this institution have instead harmed it and have left the shattered lives of too many victims in its wake make no mistake this institution is special but we as members of this body are not it is a privilege to serve the American public in an elected capacity from City Council's and school boards to the commander in chief and that is why we cannot let this moment of reckoning pass us by the outcry for accountability that we are hearing from all corners of the country must be heeded we are seeing Titans of Entertainment News and every other business be swiftly terminated yet here in Congress we hide behind a structure that shields us from true accountability serving as a member of Congress is a privilege not a right and anyone who has abused their power in this manner deserves to lose it that is justice I'm proud today that the me to Congress act a bipartisan bicameral bill with nearly 100 Democrats and Republican sponsors heeds the outcry from the American people to bring transparency and accountability to Congress it will overhaul the current process to empower victims and bring accountability to perpetrators and prevent taxpayer dollars from being used for settlements by members of Congress we cannot fail in our duty to do what is right the American people do not want us to hide behind opaque decisions by the house administration or ethics committees they do not want to pay for an inability to keep our hands to ourselves they want accountability and transparency and they want it now every individual is entitled to a workplace safe from harassment and abuse together we can and will meet this challenge we can and will be the leaders that the American people deserve and that the entire world looks to for inspiration we can and will do what is right

thank you Mr chairman certainly thank you to our panelists our Witnesses here today for sharing your real life experiences this is very important it's compelling to hear your perspective as a relatively new parent myself I appreciate the challenges even more and I I think that we owe the American people the diligence of getting our policies right and and not sometimes recognizing that the Federal Government Solutions aren't going to solve the problems that we think they will I'm concerned that in data recently released by The bipartisan policy Center found that mothers in the workforce face heightened Financial insecurity a recent poll found over half of working mothers reduced spending on everyday essentials like groceries and transportation because it conflicted with other caregiving responsibilities I think we've heard you shared that here today unfortunately many of the challenges women are facing were created with the policies that have been put in place over the last year and a half and or they've been exacerbated and I I really am concerned that there is lacking the realization of that say high gas prices could have been avoided at least to a degree a significant degree I think that inflation could have been avoided and and reasonable respected economists were shared their concerns before some of the legislation has passed but as it relates to child care I think this is a very important topic because we've seen proposals that I think really really missed the mark aside from the question of whether or not the federal government should should get so involved in child care I think it's important to note that 70 percent of of families currently have in-home or a care provided in a a center relating to a faith-based organization even if it's just the roof over a building and I'm concerned that nine to five center-based care would actually do nothing for a second and third shift workers but the fact that the federal government would become so prescriptive in terms of what and where a child care would be offered I find that problematic in many ways and I think it could actually be extremely counterproductive especially when you when you look at like I said 70 percent of families currently have in-home or faith-based care so miss Huey I I appreciate your perspective here today I know that when we talk about these everyday expenses whether it's food whether it's gasoline I it's my sense that it's it has impacted households especially those struggling and we heard earlier that you know a mortgage payment perhaps would get pushed aside because gasoline is so expensive what is your perspective what is your observation out out in the workforce and your interactions based you know reflecting on the cost of of gasoline at the pump um it has certainly increased housing not just in delivery of you know products goods and services to the job site but also in the in workers um I have one very reliable very good Carpenter that drives an hour to work and he's told me he's going to have to go up on his prices because of the increase in gas you know I've experienced gas price increases before and I thought you know this is not going to last it's going to go up and it's going to come back done and then I filled up my car and I was in shock and then and then the prices have gone up since then so it has had a tremendous effect on on housing part of that's part of the increased letters I've gotten this year is based on fuel prices yeah thank you I I think there's so much that we can do we've touched on some bipartisan issues here in the past and in terms of Workforce issues and and uh ultimately helping folks uh address the workforce shortage because with the workforce shortage and the triggers for inflation that hurts everyone and and I think there's probably more appreciation for that Across America now but it's painful it is painful in in so many households that are are struggling to get by that I I hope that we can see reasonable policies put forth rather than rejections of domestic exploration for petroleum for perhaps or for example there there are things that we can do we we must do because I think it will help folks who are struggling each and every day thank you I yield back I thank the gentleman let me recognize

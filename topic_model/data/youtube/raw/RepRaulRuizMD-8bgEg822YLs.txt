well joining me now is california congressman roell rowie's a democratic member of the house energy and commerce and veterans affairs committees he is also chair of the congressional hispanic caucus congressman it's very good to have you here thank you for joining me okay let's take a look at part of the buildback better bill you have led efforts to include protections for immigrants in the package the hill says what's included in this is the most extensive immigration reform package reviewed by congress in 35 years so share with us some of the details and how it would impact undocumented people here in the country well thank you for having me alex first of all the buildback better plan is a rocket boost to the economy and will launch uh american families by putting money in their pockets with middle class tax breaks and lowering the cost of three of the most expensive elements of a household which are child care health care and housing and immigration in that will also boost our economy because uh by providing work permits and protections for about seven million individuals essential workers for five years for those who can apply uh the criteria or anybody who have been here for over ten years by january 1st 2011 we'll be able to have a peace of mind and contribute to our economy for five years and then reapply for another five years for a total of 10 years okay i want to talk about the senate parliamentarian first of all are you confident that this bill uh will be approved by the senate but when it comes to the parliamentarian that person can reject other proposals and has done so a path to citizenship has been rejected green cards have been rejected so what happens what's your plan if the senate parliamentarian rejects what has already been approved in the house because it could happen you know i'm i i think the better word other than confident is hopeful i am hopeful that the parliamentarian based on her previous rulings that said that because of the policy impact that was uh not uh temporary or finite or because it was focused into small targeted groups that this does not have those elements and so i'm hopeful that she will rule in favor but in addition to that there are senate rules where the chair could also give their uh ruling or their opinions and there's a process in which they can continue to move forward with those protections and and we're hopeful to see it across the finish line because it's going to benefit american families it's going to increase jobs by over millions of new jobs it's going to increase to our gdp by about 1.5 trillion over a decade and that's why this is going to benefit all american families yeah is this immigration provision is it a must-have to get your vote for final package i mean what happens if the senate strips it from their final version you know i'm going to keep my language to getting to yes instead of getting to know and so i'm gonna say that we're gonna we're we're gonna really push to get immigration in there to make sure that we put money in american families pockets uh with middle class tax breaks and lower the cost because american families right now are struggling at the gas tank they're struggling at the grocery stores and this is a bill that's going to boost our economy that's going to lower the cost that's really going to help the middle class families get ahead i love your optimistic approach let me ask you if it exists with this the other major provision in the bill the expanded child tax credit how much do you think this will impact hispanic families that are still recovering from the pandemic look alex this bill is going to help hispanic families the most because hispanic families have been devastated by the pandemic the most there's no doubt that latinos latinas especially latinas have beared the brunt of the economic burden of this pandemic there's more hispanic children that live in poverty hispanic families are struggling to pay for child care for uh for their elderly care as well and this bill is going to extend that child tax credit i'm very confident that it'll remain it'll lift millions more children out of poverty it's going to help with child care which is going to enable latinos latino parents to go back to work and it's also going to help lower the cost of healthcare uh for those that fall within the medicaid gap and can for the first time provide uh hearing aids for elderly uh uh relatives and that's gonna be pivotal for the american family yeah so i hear all that you're saying but what do you think is key to taking this legislative victory and selling it to hispanic voters in a very broad way how do democrats help turn this into a win next year in the midterms especially when republicans as you know are expanding support within the latino community is buildback better is that going to bring hispanics back to the democratic party you know it's going to be a big step towards that including the already accomplished uh historical infrastructure law that we just passed that's going to fix our roads build our railways that's going to bring broad brand fix our bridges provide clean water and clean energy and also deal with our climate you know so these are accomplishable wins that people feel in their in their pockets people will talk about these things so when parents are are having dinner and they're worried about needing to go back to work but they can't afford childcare when when they know that kids do better in school and in life when they're able to go to preschool and this bill is able to provide expand uh preschool for three and four years old when they're when their elderly patient uh or grandparent is is is starting to have hearing problems which can expedite their alzheimer's and dementia uh if they don't take care of it now they're able to provide hearing aid these are real tangible life improving elements from the buildback better act that that is going to boost our economy it's going to help bring relief for the costs that are going up and this is why i think the senate has an enormous opportunity to understand that and get this done for the american families okay well keep on keeping on and happy thanksgiving to my fellow californian congressman raleigh royal ruiz thank you so much thanksgiving thank you you

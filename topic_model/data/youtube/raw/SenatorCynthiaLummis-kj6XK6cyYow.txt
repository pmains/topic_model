following those developments in the meantime i want to go to wyoming republican senator cynthia lomas what she makes of this back and forth but particularly senator it's always good to have you thank you for taking the time uh i'd like to get your thoughts on thank you again uh this idea of a federal gas tax holiday for up to three months would you support that that's just a stupid idea 18 cents off a gallon of gas will not even take our gas prices back to their high in 2008 and 2009 this is rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic the biden administration caused this mess it started on day one of the biden administration my state is the largest net exporter of energy in the united states what did he do he took the executive order that would prevent us from drilling for oil and gas on federal lands he has stopped the quarterly lease sales on federal lands including offshore the lawsuits from the environmental community block permits to drill it's an all-out attack on u.s production of oil and gas that's what was keeping the price down that's what was keeping our economy going that's what was keeping our tax structure strong this is all a self-inflicted wound by the biden administration all right now you know the back and forth on this senator they blame much of this on vladimir putin we know that half the increase came prior to the first russian boots getting even near ukraine be that as it may we have this uh you know oil executive powwow with the energy secretary of the energy department not at the white house i found that interesting uh that if this were such an urgent problem as the president clearly seemed to indicate it was and is why isn't he meeting with him why isn't it at the white house well exactly right i think it's because he does know that he's responsible for what has happened here you know you can tweak it around the edges you can try to blame putin none of that is real and the american people know it let me tell you something neil on my ranch in cheyenne wyoming we would be pulling into the hayfields right now in my entire 67 years of life we've never missed a haying season i don't think we're going to put up a this year because the price of diesel and gasoline is so high and we're in a drought so the hay crop is so small that it's not worth pulling into the field at gas prices this high and diesel prices is high we'll take our chances we'll buy expensive hay this fall to take into the winter this is unprecedented it's affecting everyone in every industry it's affecting tourism and this is all a self-imposed wound by the biden administration having said all of that senator uh art laffer you know very well of course uh not exactly a liberal but he said you know if he were advising the president uh given his list of choices to ease the pain at the pump he certainly would be talking about more production but he would go ahead with this gas tax holiday to give americans some reprieve what do you think of that you know i i like you i think the world of art laffer i disagree with him on this point it's too little it's too late uh and it will impose burdens on our highway trust fund which is already uh going heading for insolvency so it's it's just the wrong approach to take and its effect overall on our ability this summer to get around and and uh and and afford things is just minuscule senator well i have you on another topic the bipartisan gun package they're working out of the senate uh it looks like they've got 14 republicans supporting it it's a long way from done the devil as you often remind me is in the details but as it stands now what you've seen now would you support that measure yeah the answer is no and i'm just devastated for the parents in uvalde i have co-sponsored a bill with roger marshall that would help harden schools i am supporting a bill by ted cruz and my fellow wyoming senator john barrasso that would put more law enforcement out there but the bill that is we're going to get to vote on and by the way we can't even try to amend it is one that will impose restrictions on gun rights and my home state of wyoming has a gun culture uh surrounding hunting and self-protection and this is uh just not something that wyoming people uh can support there's nothing in there that would limit gun sales as you know senator certainly tighten them up for for you know red flag cases and all of that uh does that not do it for you is it that your fear is it would lead to limiting guns the problem is the x part a taking of guns without adequate due process and i get why the the people who crafted this bill don't want to come with a national standard because there are oh maybe 19 states that have red flag laws with different standards but the fact is the problem with some of those state standards is you can take a gun away from someone without a hearing without adequate due process and that's just inconsistent with good quality second amendment rights so i i applaud them for trying i understand and appreciate their efforts but if the mental health components of this bill if i could vote on those alone i would in fact if i could have separated the mental health components of this bill from the rest of the bill i would have voted for the mental health components of the bill they won't allow us any amendments this is a take it or leave it vote up or down and for that reason i'm i'm a no all right we'll watch it very very closely uh senator cynthia it's great catching up with you again you as well neil thank you

the questions Thank You mr. secretary I look forward to getting to the coronavirus someday that last second round of questions so the support Act we passed last year included mob build a comprehensive opioid recoveries act to establish treatment centers that offer fda-approved medication assisted treatment all of them comprehensively currently Samsa has the grant application open for entities to apply and I'm glad HHS is moving fast and implementing the program but my question is how is HHS implementing other parts of the support act and does HHS conduct any oversight on how the funds are actually being used so first thank you for the support act and it is so comprehensive we actually established a support act implementation leadership committee to track all of the different work streams needed under the support act it's really enhancing our work across all five elements of our strategy on opioids and and so we're just we're driving forward making progress on the opioid epidemic we've got the overdose deaths are down for the first time in decades as a result of our collaborative bipartisan efforts here and we're implementing and using the support act authorities so thank you for those okay thank you and also in 2018 Congress passed my bill the bipartisan bold infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act can you please provide an update on how this law has been implemented across the country so with the with that act I'd want to if I could get back to and writing on that I don't have all the details on that particular program I apologize if I could get back to you okay thank you and then this is what kind of technical from our role as ranking Republican on the on the oh and I subcommittee for this committee and we can that's committee and oh and I conducted extensive oversight cybersecurity at HHS including through technical audits conducted by Gao of cybersecurity controls at HHS operational divisions so I said is very technical last Congress the Subcommittee on Oversight and investigations held a closed hearing in part because HHS failed to properly identify and address certain vulnerabilities we recently received preliminary results from the most recent audit of another HHS agency though I can't go into details in this setting so my question is does HHS have a point person who coordinates corrective actions on cybersecurity among all HHS agencies and if so we direct that person to continue to work with the Committee on improving enterprise cybersecurity at HHS and ensuring that mitigation is applied in one setting are consequently applied through all of HHS yes we do our chief information officer jose arrieta who works directly with me absolutely is in charge of those issues if I could go back to your previous question I'd miss I'd miss hurt on on the bold and bold act I so I apologize on that for fiscal year 2020 CDC will have two funding opportunities to carat actions under the bold Act so first there'll be the public health programs to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and second there will be the Centers of Health Centers of Excellence to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias we expect both of those funding opportunities to be out in the coming month and for FY 2021 the President's budget for CDC includes three point four nine three million dollars to continue to support these Alzheimer's activities because by 2050 that's when I'll be 86 I believe they believe it's going to be a trillion to estimate CBO a trillion dollar spent on Alzheimer's disease not only is it devastating to the individual has it the family that cares for that person but also it be devastating to the deficit and a budget of our of our country so this is something very important thanks for your leadership and effort and I appreciate working with my colleagues here to move the bold act forward and address it and I yield back

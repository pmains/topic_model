yeah yeah i can get elected in this room yes i am a troublemaker and it's wonderful to be here i went through the duty-free and i had to contemplate the state of duty-free and wonder if jews can ever be duty-free and then i crossed the street here and i saw how much i can accomplish in 17 seconds how those lights here they tell you 18 14 13 and across the street and i never heard so many people who are not bedouins talk about a tent as being here many of you i don't know but i'm not worried because in israel when i don't know someone and he says i look familiar i'm always worried that i sued him and it looks like you are just just nice i came to america as a swimmer i unfortunately failed high school in israel but i was israel's swimming champion and i my american accent to the extent that i have it is a function of going to ucla and who couldn't care less about my grades but uh i the times in the 100 and 200 freestyle in 200 400 medley and i have an american education i was kicking and screaming i went to learn american government in constitution and i'm very moved to be in washington and see the lincoln memorial and read the gettysburg address this is really a fantastic visit to here i'm one of the new criminals that staff shafiel talked about on the first evening in that day the jerusalem police in its wisdom established that i was carrying a torah with the intent to read and it's likely that i may do it again the wall is an interesting place it's where israelis actually gave the keys to the holiest site to a minority group in judaism and that minority group having the state funding behind it and the state power behind it has abused the place this continues because israelis don't care many israelis think it's the ultimate discotheque for the ultra-orthodox and you are awfully quiet about this and it's time you used your wonderful nuisance value and started making trouble over this i i can see that there could be a first bat mitzvah at the wall i'm really hoping that the hadassah women who are coming to israel to celebrate their 100th birthday 2 000 strong with their teletot and si freitoa let's see the jerusalem police tackle two thousand hadassah women i'd love to see that the first bus in jerusalem that was segregated between men and women was the bus going to and from the wall and in the beginning secular israelis felt that well since it serves the ultra-orthodox community why not then it spread to quite a few lines across israel to the point that there were 2500 rides every day where women are sitting in the back of the bus men are in the front of the bus we went to the supreme court representing brave orthodox women who are saying that this is unacceptable to them in fact it opened our minds to the idea that black comes in many shades and many orthodox women refuse to sit in the back of the bus they're not one cohe one a monolithic community so uh we had the long time at the supreme court then there was a committee headed by the uh that was appointed by the minister of transportation then the committee heard 1500 testimonies some of them said that it's safer to sit in the back of the bus and in fact segregated buses have less accidents but then the minister refused to accept the recommendation of his own committee when the committee said that it's illegal to segregated bus in israel and then the supreme court made a decision that this sign has to be in all israeli buses it says due to supreme court petition 47607 people can sit anywhere they wish on a bus anyone harassing a person anybody harassing a person for sitting on a bus is guilty of a felony well as you know israelis don't adhere to signs and even though this is hanging in every bus the segregation continued in fact when an israeli sees a sign that says fresh paint the first thing an israeli does is just to make sure he's not a sucker is it really fresh paint or not so we started the freedom rides where we asked israeli volunteers who wore stickers that say how am i dressed one eight hundred none of your business or chev atamer and then you joined and we have a full-time person having you guys and i'm inviting all of you come to israel and be a freedom rider we can have all of you on buses tell us how much time you have and you will ride a bus and we will you will leave a room next to you for a woman an orthodox woman to sit next to you and we will change it one bus at a time i love your president jefferson i think that i heard that when kennedy had a breakfast for all uh all the nobel prize laureates in the united states in the white house uh he was asked well isn't that the most brain power ever in the white house he said well maybe except when jefferson had breakfast on his own jefferson said that in in religion it's the opposite that in politics in politics united we stand divided we fall but in religion divided we stand united we fall and when we look at the blossoming of religion in the united states how right he was and how wrong we are in israel to actually give religion to one voice one minority voice the orthodox i don't think that orthodoxy is corrupt in any way innately but it's the first time in jewish history that there is the power and the funding of the state behind one faction of judaism we've always had arguments the first jew abraham hasn't had an argument with his new god that's the first thing he does and we are an argumentative remediative people and the eo dolment sitting here boy uh we've had our arguments day in and day out and yet these arguments are the jewish sport and if we ever had the olympics in jerusalem that would be the sport we add but all these healthy arguments that throughout jewish history ended in israel when the state backs only one faction there is only one product on the shelf and that's orthodoxy one of the uh very disturbing things we see now is that among the 4 000 state-paid rabbis in israel 49 are engaged in racist incitement we have a published a report love the stranger as yourself question mark it's on our website um i work for an organization called it's a very sad arc acronym iraq iraq israel religious action center uh you might know rabbi david saperstein the head of the rack who's right here so iraq published this report and it looks at how the state of israel turns a blind eye to these 49 rabbis and even though they are regularly inciting against the israeli arab who is 21 of our population israeli citizens saying to people don't rent an apartment to them don't employ them don't allow them to fraternize with israel with jewish women and worst of all a book called torata melech that says that we can kill the non-jew because he may grow up to be the enemy these are unacceptable things jewishly halachically morally ethically it's gotta end so i see a fist of religious coercion above the heads of people at the wall israelis of all sorts that clenched fist is is something we've got to work on one of the problems is that a recent study shows that israelis think of the every day every day there is a moment when when you're in line with other people to get soup when your feet or hands are cold when a baby is crying and you're not very close to drinks or food when a trains come and go when you hear the german language when you see a cubbyhole and you think can a kid fit in there these are israelis third fourth generation in israel and still a showa moment every day the shoah has turned into a all-encompassing religion in some ways replacing zionism and a healthy understanding of what it is to be an israeli patriot so this is an important point so i would like to uh relate to uh a pasuk that says a person should always pray in a place that has windows we should always be looking out and also having others look in you can't pray in a bunker you can't put yourself in 19 in 2012 in a bunker and think you are in the 40s of the last century so so since it's the eve of pesach i am applauding you for asking the ultimate question why not the most important jewish question why not it's time we we felt your voice we felt your nuisance value and it's time to take this fist that is all over israel and put it where it belongs over the jewish heart that's where it belongs the jewish heart and the jewish fist belong with each other on yom kippur and they belong together all year long this is where it belongs not over a a women at the wall not over converts that or newcomers to israel not over all these things where the jewish fist is hanging but over the jewish heart so don't lose heart have a wonderful a dinner i'm delighted to be here and if anyone has questions or arguments or anything to do i am in table nine and i would be delighted to hear from every one of you today

11 soviet era m117 helicopters to ukraine it's part of that new 800 million dollar relief package congressman michael waltz a republican from florida joins me now great to see you congressman what can you tell us about those helicopters and the other weapons that uh that we're sending to ukraine well apparently these helicopters were intended for the afghan military uh and my question is why weren't they shifted last fall uh you know after the full debacle from afghanistan you know we're again we see the by diminishing finally belatedly starting to send weapons like howitzers artillery rounds uh even some anti-ship capabilities but we're two months into this war why number one the ukrainians were asking for them before the invasion perhaps they would have had a greater deterrent effect but even general milly the chairman of the joint chiefs agreed that if ukrainians had had stingers and had uh anti-ship missiles on day one they would even they would be in a far better position look we should be sinking more russian ships uh and this activity uh in the black sea this development in the black sea is tremendous because the russians have essentially had a block and have owned the black sea uh for for the duration here the ukrainians have been asking for these anti-ship missiles we didn't send them because biden deemed them too escalatory and too provocative these neptune missiles that they used they've developed domestically we've got to send them everything they need to win we should be helping them play for a win not for a tie at the negotiating table well next one for your congressman the leaders of four nato countries just visited keith in a show of solidarity and of course this comes just days after uk prime minister boris johnson was there walking around the streets with president zielinski uh meanwhile joe biden has been sitting at the white house or traveling home to delaware uh what kind of message is that sending well i thought it was an incredible move on the part of boris johnson uh and a great show of leadership uh there um to do that so i would uh i would just strongly i don't know about the president of the united states going uh but uh anthony blink your defense uh having a senior american leader standing shoulder to shoulder uh with biden i mean excuse me with zelinski would be would be incredible yeah because up until now we've really taken a a kind of a not a really very strong leadership uh role uh we seem to be in the background uh at what point do you think we should uh start to pick that up a little bit and leave from the front well zelinski himself uh called on by not just to be the united states to be the leader of the free world uh and and this is one of the instances proud of congress both republican and democrat we've been demanding since last year to put the sanctions in place then to send the heavy weapons then and we've kind of had to drag this administration along whether it was dropping the trade relation status banning russian oil or sending the migs and sending the heavy weapons i think congress has taken the leadership role for a change here uh but this administration continues to let fear of putin and fear of escalation drive its policy uh and look putin's afraid of us too uh deterrence works by showing and making him afraid of our actions uh and we'll but we'll continue to push just this administration is taking the wrong approach from a foreign policy standpoint right we'll have to leave it right there but congressman michael waltz thank you so much for joining us with your input today we appreciate it thank you all right

THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN   FROM NORTH CAROLINA, MR.   MCHENRY, FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY TO HONOR MIKE   RYAN, A GREAT MAN AND A FRIEND   FROM RUTHERFORD COUNTY, NORTH  CAROLINA.  MIKE SERVED AS AN ALTERMAN FOR   THE SAME TOWN WHERE HIS  BROTHER, JIM, SERVED AS MAYOR,   AND SERVES AS MAYOR. IT IS A SMALL TOWN BUT THEY  DON'T VIEW THEMSELVES THAT WAY.  IN FACT, MIKE AND HIS LATE   WIFE, PAT, WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN  STARTING THE TOWN'S YEARLY   FESTIVAL.  WHEN THEY DECIDED TO FIGURE OUT  A NAME, THEY CALLED IT   ELLEMBURG'S BIG DAY. THAT WAS MIKE'S PERSONALITY  COMING THROUGH IN NAMING THAT  ONE EVENT. IN FACT, MIKE GAVE ME A  T-SHIRT. I STILL HAVE IT. THE BIG DAY T-SHIRT HE GAVE ME   A FEW YEARS AGO. MIKE ALSO SERVED AS A -- REALLY  DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR   RESTORING THE OLD ELLEMBURG  TRAIN DEPOT AND TRANSFORMING IT  INTO THE TOWN'S HISTORY MUSEUM.  IN THIS HISTORY MUSEUM THEY PAY  TRIBUTE TO THE COUNTLESS   VETERANS THAT GREW UP, THAT  WERE RAISED AND CAME HOME TO   THERE AND GAVE THEIR LIVES IN  SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY AND THAT  REALLY PAYS A SPECIAL TRIBUTE  TO OUR COMMUNITY.  TO MIKE'S FAMILY, I EXTEND MY  SYMPATHIES.  RUTHERFORD COUNTY HAS LOST A   TRUE PUBLIC SERVANT. I LOST A GOOD FRIEND.  MR. SPEAKER, I ALSO RISE TODAY   TO HONOR A GREAT MAN AND GREAT   FRIEND.  ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS, DAN  HERN WHO SERVES IN THE CHAMBER   OF COMMERCE AND HAS DONE SO FOR  THE LAST 12 YEARS AND HE   RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HIS   RETIREMENT FROM 43 YEARS OF  WORK WITH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE   THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEAST.  DANNY IS A GRADUATE OF LENOIR  RYAN UNIVERSITY. SHORTLY AFTER GRADUATION HE  WENT TO WORK AT THE LOCAL  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AS AN  INTERN AND THAT CAREER WOULD   LAST UNTIL ACTUALLY A FEW  MONTHS FROM NOW. HE SERVED LOCAL CHAMBERS,  RISING THROUGH THE RANKS FROM  NORFOLK, VIRGINIA, ROCKINGHAM,   NORTH CAROLINA, STATESVILLE,   NORTH CAROLINA, AND HE WILL  FINISH HIS CAREER IN HICKORY.  DANNY IS KNOWN FOR A COUPLE  DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE  COMMUNITY. HE'S KNOWN FOR HIS COMMITMENT  TO SMALL BUSINESS. HE HAS FOUGHT TIRELESSLY ON  BEHALF OF THE SMALL BUSINESS   COMMUNITY AND THE BUSINESS   COMMUNITY GENERALLY. IN FACT, ONE OF THE GREATEST   ACCOMPLISHMENT AT THE CHAMBER  OF COMMERCE UNDER DANNY'S  LEADERSHIP IS THE EDSON PROJECT  -- EDISON PROJECT THAT GIVES   STARTUP CAPITAL TO LOCAL   ENTREPRENEURS. HE BEGAN THIS INITIATIVE IN ONE  OF THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS  OF OUR COMMUNITY.  HE KNOWS THE BACKBONE OF OUR   LOCAL ECONOMY AND THE BACKBONE   OF OUR COUNTRY, SMALL BUSINESS.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT SMALL  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IS THE KEY  TO OUR REGION'S ECONOMIC   DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH AND   RECOVERY.  DANNY'S WORK WITH SMALL  BUSINESS HAS TRULY PAID OFF. RECENT STATISTIC SCHOETZ THAT  WAGES IN THE COUNTY ARE GROWING  AT A FASTER RATE THAN MOST   COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND   THIS IS A GREAT SUCCESS UNDER  DANNY'S LEADERSHIP.  DANNY IS ALSO VERY WELL-KNOWN,   EXTRAORDINARILY WELL-KNOWN FOR   HIS LOVE OF GOLF.  DANNY'S SECOND TO LAST DAY ON  THE JOB IN SEPTEMBER WILL BE   HOSTING THE CHAMBER'S ANNUAL   GOLF TOURNAMENT. WHAT A FITTING WAY AND TRULY   POETIC WAY FOR DANNY TO END HIS  CHAMBER CAREER.  HE'LL BE DOING TWO OF THE GREAT  THINGS HE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT,  WORKING WITH SMALL BUSINESS  LEADERS AND PLAYING GOLF.  SO TO DANNY, YOU'LL TRULY BE   MISSED IN THE COUNTY.  YOUR LEADERSHIP WILL BE TRULY  MISSED.  HOWEVER, YOUR IMPACT WILL BE   FELT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.  WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR  LEADERSHIP AND I THANK YOU FOR   YOUR FRIENDSHIP. I YIELD BACK.

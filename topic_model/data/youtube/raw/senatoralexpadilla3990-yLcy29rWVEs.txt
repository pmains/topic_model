thank you mr chair um like several of the members of the committee i want to share uh just a couple of remarks and uh response to the tragedy from yesterday but i know our time is limited so i'll jump to my questions uh first and end with remarks of what happened in uvalde yesterday mr delbach welcome as a u.s attorney as i understand you prosecuted a number of suspects for very violent crimes including those using guns we know president biden has made it a priority for the administration to disrupt what experts refer to as the iron pipeline the pipeline refers to the path by which guns flow from southern states with looser restrictions up interstate 95 to northern states with stricter gun laws and by the way it's not the only region to happen there's pipelines with similar dynamics in other parts of the country including out west but the iron pipeline and others like it undermine efforts of many states and major cities to protect their communities who pass laws to help prevent gun violence yet a number of states continue to expand access to firearms and loosen their restrictions without justification and the lack of action at the federal level leaves communities at the mercy of what seems to be a race to the bottom so mr dottelbach can you briefly describe how the iron pipeline increases the prevalence of gun violence in american cities and why a federal response is required senator in my time as a as a prosecutor especially as u.s attorney i learned that one of the most important tools we have is data we collect data we follow the data so that we don't let our own predilections interfere with how we deploy resources and so i am not pr i'm not privy to all the data but i know that the president and the attorney general have prioritized based on data certain regions and areas where we we have seen an increase in firearms trafficking and established task forces because that's another tool in addition to data so that federal law enforcement can can be a force multiplier for state law enforcement in trying to disrupt illegal gun trafficking and so i believe that that's an effective approach i believe that we need to scale it i'm not in the atf yet so i don't know the specific areas where we're seeing the trafficking but i think that's an important approach well once you're there you will be privy to the data and you'll see the data justifies my statement president's um focus on this and i pray your response when the time comes you know data tells us that it's not the only issue there's an increasing uh concern about the prevalence of ghost guns and their impact on public safety look i represent california and i'm proud of the state's efforts to address gun violence broadly starting with the governor legislative leaders and others in addition to the dynamic of the iron pipeline you know california's laws and restrictions versus other states in the west ghost guns is increasingly a top priority and last year senators blumenthal and senator cruz held a subcommittee hearing on this very important topic now ghost guns are weapons built by individuals using components they've purchased online these guns lack serial numbers which is typically used to track weapons by law enforcement so no serial numbers no data to your point and because these guns are usually built at the purchases purchaser's home there's also no background check that goes along with it no registration process or even an age limit that is on the books clearly ghost guns have become a problem throughout the country but until the california in particular violence with the involvement of ghost guns is up significantly can you just briefly discuss the ramifications involved if unregulated gun production continues to increase uh senator one of the things i've done in up till now since my nomination is talked to a lot of law enforcement officials and they have uh they have told me that ghost guns present them with a violent crime problem uh my understanding of of the regulation that the atf put out is that it would require serial numbers uh and background checks for a certain category of individually made firearms and and that would enable uh people to uh avoid not to avoid a background check by for instance purchasing one of these buy build chute kits which is basically a gun that you assemble on your own you but you buy together and so closing that loophole uh would enable us to get serial numbers from guns found at crime scenes and would also uh enable us in certain circumstances to run background checks on individuals uh to prevent people who everybody agrees should not have a firearm from having one okay thank you i look forward to uh following up and working with you on these critical issues and mr chair just in closing um i just want to join the course of members of this committee in the senate and sharing my condolences to the families uh and the communities reeling from recent gun violence across the country from buffalo new york to laguna woods california and now uvalde texas the gun violence in our communities are that are experienced that our communities are experiencing is simply simply unacceptable i've spoken nonstop since yesterday's tragedy not just as a senator but mr chairagino is a father of three young school-aged children this shouldn't have to be the case in the last two weeks we've experienced at least 22 mass shootings across the country no other developed country has to deal with this but we do now some folks suggest that arming teachers or providing more armed presence on school campuses will make them safer if more guns were the answer the united states would be the safest nation in the world but it's not the case when i was growing up i remember on at least an annual basis we'd go through these fire drills at school what to do if there's a fire on campus i come from california i grew up in california so we're also not unfamiliar with earthquake drills to think that our young people today have to practice active shooter training is a sad statement on our society when young children aren't don't feel safe going to school when people have to wonder whether it's safe to go to a grocery store or a house of worship it's a nightmare come true uh i know the jurisdiction over gun safety straddles a few committees they said on the homeland security committee but this is the primary the judiciary committee and i hope that we can find the will to advance common sense gun safety legislation because yes it is a choice to take action inaction is also a choice i choose to take action we cannot sit idly by and watch children in america die to gun violence thank you mr chair

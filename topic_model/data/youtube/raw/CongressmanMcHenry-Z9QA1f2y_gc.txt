that's in fiscal year 2013 congress allocated 34 billion dollars for hud's budget with an additional 16 billion appropriated to hud's community development block grant or cdbg program in the aftermath of superstorm sandy in the first six months of this year the hud inspector general's office has released 49 audits which included recommendations that 739.5 million dollars and funds be put to better use these 49 audits also identified over 770 million dollars in question cost and more than one billion income in collections from audits as a result of the hud ig's investigations of suspected fraud and hud programs hud has so far recovered 700 i'm sorry 74.9 million dollars and the investigations resulted in 225 indictments or information gathering and 270 convictions pleas or pre-trial diversions during this fairly short six month period of a particular concern to this committee is the handling of the cdbg program the largest source of federal financial assistance to support state and local neighborhood revitalization housing rehabilitation and economic development activities over the years hud has failed to adequately account for how taxpayers funds are being spent in the cdbg program leading to wasteful spending and frivolous pork barrel projects although one of the three national program objectives of for the cdbg program is that projects principally benefit low and moderate income persons critics have noted that the cdbg funds often end up being used for parks pools street signs and community centers diverting dollars from those communities with the greatest need in particular housing in fact the new york times has exposed a practice where well-off communities sold grants to other communities in exchange for smaller purses that had no strings attached this is very trouble troublesome this also highlights the concern that cdbg's formulas for dispersing grant funds may be outdated and unsuitable for today others have commented on administrative failures within the program gao has noted failures in hud's ability to track funds appropriated in the program this goes back to a 2006 gao review of the cdbg program that found that hud does not centrally maintain the data needed to determine compliance with statutory spending limits gao added that the hud had not developed a plan to replace monitoring staff or fully involved its field staff and plans to redesign an information system that they use to monitor these grant recipients i understand the office of inspector general's worked tirelessly tirelessly to fight waste fraud and abuse identified within hud and i look forward to our testimony today from the inspector general inspector general montoya on ways in which hud can better track the taxpayers money and put it to best use as the congress intended

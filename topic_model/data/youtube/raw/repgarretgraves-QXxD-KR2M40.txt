the the democrats control the agenda of this committee the amendment's intent is to actually try to focus the agenda of this committee on the jurisdiction that is of the highest priority of the american people of look your constituents i guarantee you i'd be willing to take a bet right now they haven't they haven't said we want you to address big cats they've said they want you to address isis the gentleman reclaims mr chairman the question is very specific if the gentleman still would like to yield how much does he expect his amendment to lower gas prices in the big cap bill when the amendment reads no provision of this act shall take effect if it will result in an increased reliance on hostile foreign nations and the prime sponsor made it very plain that this bill doesn't do any of that then how does this this amendment specifically how much is he expecting this amendment to reduce gas prices in a big capital does he have an amount or are we just going to have a whole another narrative thank you mr nicholas i appreciate the yield uh mr st nicholas how many constituents of town hall meetings have asked you to dress big cats and how many have told you that they want you to address energy prices we're trying to help you focus you're talking about big cats right now i can't even believe you're doing this you're talking about mr graves the gentleman who claimed his time oh i'm sorry i didn't realize that you heard it thank you thank you mr chairman so i just wanted to make it plain to the american people first and foremost i think that my colleagues on on the democratic side of the aisle have been very gracious calling for all of us to work together i think that that's something that we need to do i think mr huffman has been very gracious and calling for us to address the issue at hand and i think that the points that have been made on both sides of the aisle are definitely points for all of us to consider that the american people will agree to that but let's be upfront with the american people that voting yes on this amendment will do nothing for gas prices voting no on this amendment will do nothing for gas prices and this amendment has nothing to do with foreign nations because big cats have nothing to do with our reliance and foreign nations so i think that the dialogue is is very passionate i think it's very relevant uh in terms of what the american people are going through but the actual the actual amendment itself will do nothing for the issue at hand so let's let's move on and let's just be up front with the american people as we continue to entertain the remainder of these amendments as to whether or not it's actually going to accomplish the purposes that are intended in the opening narratives of these amendments because this does nothing for gas prices i mean the mover of the amendment can't give us a firm answer on whether or not the the dollar amount is going to change it's very plain that it won't so i'd like to uh echo the the sentiments of mr huffman let's address the big cat legislation if you don't like it don't know but let's not introduce amendments to make it seem like there's going to be a solution for the american people in here when there is none

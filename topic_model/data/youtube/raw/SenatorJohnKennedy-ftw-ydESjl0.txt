let's bring in louisiana senator john kennedy who joins us from the i think the russell rotunda senator good morning to you good morning good morning guys so why are you mean republicans going to reign on the parade of the democrats by not allowing them to pass the we the people act which they say is voter suppression is voter suppression on the part of the republicans well this is an extraordinarily cynical bill in my opinion even by washington standards it's uh it's very ruthless even by washington standards speaker pelosi and senator schumer call it i think the for the people act but i think it'd be more aptly described as screw the people out it will it will make it much easier to cheat in an election and their bill does that in two ways number one it almost guarantees that we'll never have another election day we'll have election months and i think that was the genesis of a lot of concern by many people in the last election number two it achieves its purpose by taking elections which are governed by the people through their state legislatures right now and and gives that authority to the federal government now why anybody would take something that's working and give it to the federal government is beyond me the federal bureaucracy can't even stop scam calls or spam calls but but nonetheless if you turn our voting procedure over the federal government i guarantee the first thing they're going to do is get rid of voter id and i think most americans believe that you should have to prove who you who you say you are when you go to to vote so there's a new poll out mammoth poll you've probably seen it 80 percent of american voters they support having to show an id when you go to the polls 18 percent oppose it is that why the democrats are changing their tune stacey agrams abrams says she's open now to side with joe manchin joe manchin wants you to have to show an id she's all along said no id no id jim crow 2.0 and now she's changing her tune is this why well yeah many most americans are not morons and many my my democratic friends think they are they think they'll fall for anything most fair-minded people believe that when you go vote you ought to have to prove you are who you say you are and the suggestion that people don't have id ids or can't get an id is just ludicrous and after they they meaning my democratic friends saw what the american people thought they changed their position as simple as that so yeah the demons are now going to pour 20 million dollars into a voting right initiative so they're going to flood the zone expecting to lose today and just try to drill down everyone's throats that republicans want to repress the vote and stop minorities from voting do you believe you guys have to organize and tell what you think is the truth about your your reservations about what they're doing or are you concerned about being marginalized in that uh simplistic way inaccurately no i'm not worried about being marginalized i think the american people are fair-minded and reasonable they can they can look at this bill and see for example this bill the democrats would would legalize battle harvesting that allows a paid political operative to go knock on your door and say i've got a ballot here let me help you fill it out and i'll turn it in for you uh what could possibly go wrong right you know it's it ought to be illegal it is illegal in most states it's not illegal in california and and that's what my democratic colleagues not all of them but many of them want to do they want to make every state california which does everything it can to elect democrats well one thing that's happening in all the states uh senator is there a lot of employers who would like to hire people but there's such a labor shortage the white house says it has nothing to do with that supplemental 300 bucks people across the country are getting per week through september but there's a chicken finger joint located down in texas and they're having to pay teen it's called lanes the roanoke location is now open uh they've got and and their chicken fingers look delicious uh they're having to pay teenagers 50 000 a year and they're training them as managers because they can't get anybody else to work for them because the kids are all you know the good jobs are at walmart and mcdonald's so they're going there so if this guy wants to hire people he's got to pay him fifty thousand dollars to be a manager and you're 16 years old well let me be sure i understand steve the white house is saying that the rich unemployment benefits have nothing to do with it well they must believe you can land on the sun if you go at night too i mean that's preposterous i don't know i don't know anybody uh in america who believes that i mean people respond to incentives and if you some people make a rational economic decision if you pay them more to stay home than to work not everybody but many people are going to make a rational economic decision uh i i i can't believe the white house said that they got to follow the data center uh they've got to follow that data so that's what just like nature abhors a vacuum nature abhors a and that's a moronic statement i mean that's just not true senator thanks so much appreciate it thank you good luck and not voting for uh the for the people act okay man all right i don't think he's going to change his mind

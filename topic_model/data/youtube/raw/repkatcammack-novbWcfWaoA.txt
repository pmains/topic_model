cat kamek a republican congresswoman from Florida joins me now thank you so much for taking the time China's new foreign minister is calling Washington's view of China distorted uh it's they're also warning the U.S should change its attitude toward the country or else risk conflict and confrontation so clearly a threat what do you make of this heated rhetoric coming amid the many issues training U.S China ties and what does that say those comments say about China's lack of respect for the U.S where to start you know it's interesting the the term distort let's start with what's distorted in China how about the fact that they've been distorting and manipulating their currency for decades how about the fact that they have a distorted human rights record where they are actively engaging in genocide within their own country when it comes to regulatory practices trade trade deals you name it they are the worst offenders and so it's pretty rich to hear from the Chinese that they're now threatening America of threatening Americans and saying that it's a distorted world view no it's a very clear crystal clear world view and I would say that they're trying to distract from what's really going on when they threatened us for shooting down their spy balloon when they are starting to talk tough now because we're getting closer to the origins of covid and their responsibility in that that is when they're starting to get scared so this tough talk it's nothing more than a cover for people who are extraordinarily worried about the truth coming out all right uh House Republicans are promising that accountability is on the way the oversight committees with eight hearings in three days they will be looking at issues ranging from coveted origins The Border crisis and the Biden family business dealings among them now the house Judiciary Committee is also very busy you've got the chairman Jim Jordan issuing a slew of subpoenas for testimony and documents among other things representative Jordan wants answers on fed's targeting concerned parents and that Infamous disinformation board we're going to focus on the attacks on the First Amendment and a number of Errors there whether DHS and the disinformation governance board what we saw from FBI coordinating and and in colluding with big Tech to suppress information and shape and mold The Narrative the real power of congress the real power of the legislative branch is the power of the purse and we're going to have to use that both on all this issue where we think the government's been targeting the very people it's supposed to serve all right he just gets under the skin of every single democracy Kratt in Washington they just want Jim Jordan to go away he is never going away he wants to get answers and there are many questions that he needs to pursue yes absolutely you know I'm really lucky I get to serve on the house select committee on government weaponization with Jim Jordan and we are really getting to the bottom of some of the worst offenses against the American people by their own government really truly attacks on our Constitution and constitutional rights but us in Congress we have a constitutional Duty for oversight of these executive branches and for these abuses but more importantly I think the American people they want to see the oversight and then the follow-up action to make sure that it never happens again that is why we have to do these oversight hearings but then we have to take the action to fix the problems in the first place so while there's a lot of activity happening today this is going to go on for the next two years and to the point about the the parents being targeted by the doj this is why the legislation that was introduced last week the parental Bill of Rights that is so critical putting parents back in the driver's seat for their children's education where they're no longer vilified but empower that is the kind of response and solution that the American people are looking for not a finger-pointing game they want to know who's responsible but most importantly they want it fixed and that's what we're doing all right congresswoman thank you very much for talking to us we appreciate it have a good one you too

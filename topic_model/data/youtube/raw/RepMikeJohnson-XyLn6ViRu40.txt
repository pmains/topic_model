all kidding aside mr chairman i i i actually do believe this is an amendment that you all will agree with because i'm going to assume this was an oversight this amendment would exclude active and retired members of the military from the restrictions in this bill under the current bill active and retired law enforcement officers are exempt from the restraints of the legislation but active and retired members of the military are for some reason left out again i'm i'm going to assume that was a good faith error the chairman argued that his opposition to my previous amendment that would have included pregnancy care centers among those exempt from the restrictions in the bill was based upon his concern that those ladies had no training and and thus couldn't possibly be trusted to handle these firearms for self-defense but here's the distinction obviously about this amendment is that you know any member of the army for example let's take the army is exposed to three phases of training during their initial entrance into the military these phases consist of learning how to disassemble reassemble and clean their weapon as well as safe handling procedures that's phase one they learn to actually fire it in a safe and accurate practices phase two and finally they learn to shoot targets from three firing positions phase three that is equal if not more than the training of many law enforcement officers who you know again are covered in in your bill draft even after this detailed training members of the military must undergo an annual qualification review so keep in mind keep in mind the guns being utilized in this training are more complicated than the ones being debated today if members of the military can handle the larger more intense guns they should be able to handle a gun that is no more than a deer rifle active members of the military have also undergone background checks of course to ensure their possession of said weapons so again i'm just going to assume that this was an oversight and that you will all agree with this obviously common sense and necessary amendment with that i yield back

here at the world war ii memorial and getting ready to do one of my favorite things and that that's the great veterans that are coming from kansas on the honor flight uh absolutely uh just just builds me up it's so encouraging to me to meet these folks and to listen to their story absolutely one of the greatest programs we have going i'm so grateful for all the people that take their time and money to make this possible for all of our great veterans what i love behind me is seeing the staff our interns meeting uh some of the veterans themselves and letting the veterans tell their stories firsthand so that those stories will be remembered for future generations uh just so proud and honored to be here representing kansas today and paying tribute those great folks that have all paid the price for our freedom [Music]

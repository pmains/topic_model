Jen I was going to talk on a bipartisan bill to like my friend mr. loebsack did seems like I'm hearing about every other day almost not all hearings we had a few here but most somebody always starts out with to spite of all the partisanship in town this is a bipartisan bill so saying that there's a lot of bipartisan stuff going on some of the big stuff that makes the news and you talk about we have differences opinions on and we express those but just some of these things are not ideological it's just trying to move to fix things we're working together and an example is a congresswoman Matsui and I have worked together on spectrum spectrum caucus trying to free spectrum I've said before is that I it's an issue I didn't campaign on go around saying send me to Washington and I'll deliver you spectrum but people expect it and won't it won't the product products products to work and more more and so as we look at who the biggest holder of spectrum is the federal government and so we're our bill is the intent of and it's a work in progress is supposed to been filed last night quite honestly I had at my hand this is how i'll skip made sometimes hat in my hand and i set it down because something happen i sent it to some time office remind me to take that to the floor and votes are called and i'm going to get a new designated reminder because i knew i was going to forget but it made its way over last night I think ain't got filed is not first thing this morning but I'm the point is that that we're trying to have you incentivize the federal agencies to free up the spectrum one on their behalf one is that if you have something I want to get rid of it you don't want to lose it and the second thing is it expensive and time-consuming and difficult to clear and repack so I know that mr. Bergman turning on the panel if you'll start first you looked at the bill you're the concept of federal incentives and like I said this is a work in progress is it similar even though it wasn't filed to like late last night it's similar to the same as last year and it's a work in progress too thick so if you could comment on I'd really appreciate it it's congressman Guthrie we thank you for your leadership as co-chair of the spectrum working group and certainly your partnership but congresswoman Matsui on that legislation I've seen prior Congress's version we look certainly look forward to that we take your focus on federal incentives it's critically important as you mentioned the federal government which has very important missions nonetheless as in a primary access to over sixty percent of that key spectrum in the those key low and mid bands and so trying to create incentives for that spectrum to be made available for commercial use is critically important the partnerships that we were able to develop through the AWS three spectrum which was freed up government spectrum and created the largest spectrum auction by revenue in FCC history enabled us to lead in 4G but also gave important funding to those federal agencies through the spectrum relocation fund and has enabled them to upgrade their systems so we truly do believe that there are win-win opportunities and we believe that the legislation that you're working on only underscores and makes those benefits stronger and I'm open to the panel but I want to focus on something and everybody can comment on tues like I said it's the same deal whether it was pumped ly available tonight or this morning it's the same bill so it does take a long time to get this through the system and to clear and repack so in the meantime and so on about the incentives everybody else on the panel to talk about but also to the FCC be taken steps to modernize its rules and bands that could be repurposed for broadband and embrace secondary market transactions that could potentially make a digital spectrum available for a wireless broadband in the meantime sure there are absolutely things that the Commission can do and and we certainly applaud the FCC that it's an open meeting last week it provided more flexibility for companies to use spectrum for LTE services took steps to eliminate some of the redundants licensing requirements and harmonized those across different spectrum bands so we think the FCC can be busy trying to create more opportunities for flexible use we also think it's incredibly important that they move forward on that high band spectrum that we've talked about earlier again that really we believe is a launching pad for 5g services and as we talked a little bit about satellites access to those bands I just want to reaffirm for the committee that the satellite industry we welcome their competition in 5g they also have the opportunity to lease spectrum or show up at auction and bid for spectrum the same way that the wireless industry does so you think the FCC has has its own authority enough now to release hot band into the marketplace or do its legislation need to be positive we certainly we applaud them for the work that they're doing we think that when Congress can provide clarity and timelines and guidance that is always helpful this committee is a long history of setting deadlines and making spectrum and I won't think I'm not only have that second saw you if you want to as long as the chairwoman allows it I really wanted to respond not directly to mr. Bergman but to you congressman and your statement about how to move things along faster and and we recognize my company certainly recognize there's a need for spectrum sharing but i think that overall the process would work faster and better if there was also in a recognition of the need for technology neutrality and it doesn't mean splitting spectrum in half and as i said giving half or a third to wireless that their to unlicensed and a third to satellite that won't work but i think without those protections you're going to end up continue to end up with these long protracted regulatory proceedings and that certainly does hinder access the market and more importantly hinders certainty in the marketplace which is critical for all of our companies to deploy I think the chair for indulgence and I yield back gentleman yields back mr.

we'll hear about them from maria mingalong the executive director of the oceanside museum of art and the chair of our judging panel hello maria hello congressman how are you doing fantastic how about you doing great excellent take it away absolutely um i wanted to talk a little bit about the judging process um we had i had two other um judges working with me one is zach cordner he's a photographer and he's the co-founder of the o cider magazine as well as marcelo or to the brain who is an amazing cinematographer and is also an oceanside native we had a great time with a lot of lively discussion about all of the 127 artworks that we had and came up with this list of 15 including three prize winners fantastic let's get started maria the judges selected 12 pieces worthy of honorable mention so i'll begin with those the first honorable mention goes to violet britain of carlsbad high school for right where you are this is an oil painting it's really amazing just look at how skillfully violet handled the paint the color and the dramatic lighting the quality is definitely here in this artwork the second honorable mention goes to cormac smedley of oceanside high school for green dragon it's a really stunning image it's a photograph and if you look at it the focal point is right on the snake's eye it's pretty crazy in terms of the amount of detail that you see and zach and marcelo both of whom are photographers were really blown away at how well he executed this uh photograph is the third honorable mention goes to eden stambaugh of santa fe christian school for pay at the pump you know this is a piece that you really want to see in person to get a sense of the detail which is kind of hard to determine in the digital image what we really liked was the humor and the timeliness of this subject dinosaurs pumping oil come on what are we all thinking about these days this student hit it right on the mark the fourth honorable mention goes to alexander dwong of el camino high school for forgotten focus you know when you look at this photograph it's really a reminder to us to really think about the beauty that's right in front of us alexander expresses this visually so beautifully but he also talks about that in the comments of the section for their submission as well so point well taken look around and take in the beauty absolutely the fifth honorable mention goes to paisley kennen of rancho buena vista high school for the queen this photo portrait really is it looks like it's a nod to the old masters look at the way that there's that darkened dramatic background and the draped cloth and the subject's pose there's a feeling of royalty that this young artist deliberately set up to capture and did it so well the sixth honorable mention goes to paloma pernice of carlsbad high school for mr rivera's colorful re-looking and colorful it is the color in this portrait is outstanding it's beautiful the newspaper clippings that you see at the top of the head is a really nice use of use of collage which literally is representing our thoughts in this piece the seventh honorable mention goes to catherine stickney of pacific ridge school for into the void there's great use of the negative space so that black space that's between the figures and then if you notice there's a pulling on the t-shirt that adds this tension and it gives you this sense of feeling that there's motion that the figures are actually spinning in space the eighth honorable mention goes to victoria allison of la costa canyon high school for last dance we love this piece it really um it's such a feel-good piece and it puts a smile on your face there's so much creativity that victoria used in terms of the actual materials in making her artwork the shirt of the sh the skirt of this show girl is made of real feathers that actually spill over the edge of the painting and the sparkling gems on the bodice just really throw it over the top we loved it the ninth honorable mention goes to stephanie hernandez of carlsbad high school for seamless so we spent a lot of time looking at this surrealist drawing it was a contender for one of the prizes um it has this crazy perspective and all of the objects and the body parts are all over it yet it totally makes sense i'm not sure how she did it but she did and um and we were really impressed the 10th honorable mention goes to jada mccullough of pacific ridge school for liberty for all liberty for all really feels like a street art piece you could imagine this painting being on the side of a building larger than life size we love the background the use of the repeated flag image and check out the swirls around the body it makes it so dynamic as if that figure is literally bursting through the background and if you look really closely at her shirt you can see the statue of liberty the 11th honorable mention goes to charlie colb of oceanside high school for sly fi sly fi you can't help but laugh there is a banana man in the galaxy as if he's being carried along with the planets through our solar system it makes no sense it's super funny and we loved it the final honorable mention goes to briana crystal of pacific ridge school for when mother was there this is really a 21st century update on the classical portrait it's digitally it's digitally manipulated and the lighting is moody and dramatic if you take a look at that rose crown across the top it's really beautifully rendered overall it's a very striking image of the artist's mother when the mother was the age of the artist which we thought was charming congratulations to all the honorable mentions now it's time for the main event that's our top three and we'll start with a third place winner with a cash prize of 100 it's joaquin lagunas from oceanside high school for one way out congratulations um it was really hard to figure out first second and third prize but here we go you could imagine seeing this in a fine art gallery or even in a museum in fact we invite all of um the families and friends of these artists to come and see this work at the museum live it'll be up from the 23rd of april through the 22nd of may it's a really strong image it's viewed even just if you viewed it from the abstract elements if you look at those geometric shapes the dark the light the geometry of the tiles in the staircase what it actually is it's an image looking up through a stairwell out of a skylight at the oceanside city hall can you see that its framing and composition are really perfect you really have to look to figure out what's going on i can see that you're doing that though congressman we're bombarded by images and something that makes you pause and really take time to look really meant a lot both to me to zach and to marcelo so that's why this one was a prize winner for us fantastic all right i feel like i need a drum roll here in second place with a cash prize of three hundred dollars is angelina keampe of la costa canyon high school for first light there's so much that's going on here you could stare at this for a long time and just keep seeing new things there is that beautiful colorful background we really love the color palette that she used it gives this piece a kind of hip street art feel and maybe it's even a nod to some of the well-known street artists from our own region if you look at the black contour lines that are on the left side you'll start to see that there are features of a face and that as it comes into focus you'll see what an amazing skill that it takes to use line to create that three-dimensional effect overall it definitely keeps the eyes occupied all right here we go the winner of the 2022 congressional art competition for our district with a cash prize of 500 and also an invitation to display this piece of work in the united states capital which means i'm going to walk by this every single day that i'm in dc for the next year and i'm excited about this the winner is clementine thompson of la costa canyon high school for california cars what an amazing opportunity for one of our artists here from southern california to show their work in the capitol and what a great opportunity for you to see it every day while you're at work it's a charming painting that's really a look back into the 1950s in southern california it's full of so much nostalgia this is a welcoming landscape that really invites you to take the quintessential southern california journey down the coast everybody likes to cruise and cruising is a reality here in southern california it's a big part of our culture this landscape is faithfully rendered and pretty much anyone familiar with the region would recognize this bit of coastline we thought it would be the perfect artwork to represent our region in washington well i think that's absolutely right and i was just about to say that i will be pointing it out to all my colleagues as we walk through the hall sharing that our district is probably the most beautiful of any in the entire united states so very very excited by this piece of work i want to thank you so much maria i want to thank our fellow judges we so

well everybody i'm a united states senator tom carper i want to thank you for tuning in to the 21st annual service academy information uh night uh for some of you this will be uh the first step to a career in the military as a 23-year veteran of the united states navy last vietnam veteran serving in the u.s senate today my military service gave me so much provided me with a chance to go to college get an education a chance to gain great badly needed leadership skills as a young man and things that that i've carried with me throughout my life my time with the navy also provided me with a chance to get education undergraduate ohio state graduate school university of delaware and allowed me to see the world all over the world from southeast asia to the mediterranean back and forth again perhaps most importantly my service gave me the opportunity and to serve our country i think of myself as a servant my job is to serve not to be served and i still serve today and privileged to serve in a different role as as i said as one of your two united states senators one of my responsibilities in that role along with senator chris coons and congresswoman lisa blunt rochester from delaware's to nominate some of delaware's best and brightest students to attend our nation's service academies and soon you're going to hear from presenters from those academies and at the end you're going to have a chance to submit any questions you may have and the representatives from our congressional office will get back to you promptly now i want to introduce to you if i could a fantastic young man who last year was in your shoes his name is rocco rocco alessandro and he's currently a senior at cesar rodney high school in kent county he received nominations to go to not just the u.s merchant the marine academy not just the u.s military academy west point but also to the u.s naval academy that's a hat-trick where i come from you're going to hear from him next on his experience in applying for not one not two but three nominations i want to wish uh you all the the best on your applications and let me just say this my work ten words of advice uh if i ever gave your commencement address this would be my 10 words of advice i'll give them to you right here aim high next two words work hard next four words embrace the golden rule the last two words don't quit aim high work hard embrace the golden rule don't quit do those things whether you make it make the cut at one of our military academies or rotc's you will be ready for life take care good luck god bless hello everyone i am rocco alessandro and i'm honored to be speaking tonight i'm sorry that academy night this year is once again virtual but i'd much rather speak before you in person tonight i would just like to share some things i have learned that could be beneficial to you if you have started your academy applications then you are aware of how time consuming and confusing they can be and if you have not started them by chance you will soon come to understand the lengthy process which is why it is crucial that you start taking initiative as soon as possible this means creating relationships with peers and teachers alike these relationships must be genuine and thoughtful because later these people will have your back whether you attend an academy or not remember life is about the relationships you create burning bridges will not benefit you in any way taking initiative also means involving yourself in leadership activities and studies true leaders are confident but humble decisive but integral calm but responsible and physically sound but lifelong learners read up on leadership strategies and tactics some books i have found helpful are extreme ownership by jaco willink dichotomy of leadership by jaco willink can't hurt me by david goggins the art of war by sun tzu and about faced by david hackworth while these books do provide invaluable knowledge the only way you will truly understand and benefit from the lessons in these books is through applying them in real time leading others is hard so you must practice taking initiative is done through pushing yourself confidence is key when you go for your nomination board interviews project confidence look everyone in their eyes say your name and shake their hands with a firm handshake answer questions in a clear and concise manner if you are asked a question that you do not immediately know the answer to ask for a moment to think bring in a notepad and take notes while board members talk to you and don't be afraid to ask them questions for one it will blow their minds because rarely do people ask them questions in an interview and also the obvious has to be stated they have more experience than you remember good leaders never stop learning so take every opportunity to learn from others if you're not comfortable with public speaking or stepping up and leading your peers do it anyway a life lived in the comfort zone will not lead to self-betterment don't cave to the fear of failure because simply put failure leads to success and if you are afraid to fail you will only achieve mediocrity if by chance you do fail and you will at one point or another don't lie to yourself or blame others take ownership for your mistakes and own the solutions to your problems the last point i have to make is one dealing with staying organized applications for the academies like i have said before take a long time and can be confusing get into the habit of writing important information down and check it every day do not procrastinate good leaders prioritize and execute don't fall behind mentally physically or spiritually you must perform as a well-cogged machine with organization comes delegation humility is key don't be afraid to solicit help from family members i'm eternally grateful to my parents for their support and guidance throughout this whole process i love you mom and dad thank you for all the love and support in order to achieve your goals you must take initiative create relationships project confidence practice humility make good decisions exude integrity stay calm take ownership prioritize and execute destroy mediocrity and never stop learning good luck everyone stay on the path to success and don't forget to get after it hello everyone i'm captain tony riker and i'm currently an assistant professor of military science at temple university's army rotc program i've sat on senator carver's service academy selection board for the past three years and what i'd like to do is provide you all some recommendations and some things that can set you up for success kind of give you some insight into what we are looking for and uh potential candidates so rightfully so um i have to say that i'm always always super impressed with the candidates and how they prepare for the board they're always very impressive so there are some things that i'd like to share with you um that will help you get ready and prepare for this process and let you know kind of what we're looking for the first thing i would say is know what your why is what do i mean by that um be able to speak to why you want to apply for a service academy nomination what's your why behind it um it could be you have family members who have served you know parents uncles great grandparents um it could be that you're looking for a challenge it also could be hey you know maybe you're looking for financial stability in your future whatever your why is know what that is and be able to explain that to us and be confident in it whatever that why might be for you the next thing i would say that we look for in our candidates is be able to explain to us how you have prepared for this this journey both physically and mentally being a commissioned officer myself i will tell you that a big part of being an officer is being physically prepared um have you played any sports do you have a solid workout regimen are you a member of a gym be able to explain to us what you have done to prepare for this journey physically on the other side of that corn is you know be able to explain to us what you have done and prepare for this journey mentally you know how are your grades what's your gpa have you partaken in any ap courses um have you done additional studies uh so just be able to to articulate those things and uh let us know and be able to speak to how you have prepared for this journey both physically and mentally the next thing and i'd say one of the more important things is um are you willing to learn now make no mistake we are not looking for perfect candidates and by that i mean we're looking for individuals who are um passionate about being developed because that's what a service academy nomination is all about we don't expect you to show up and be the perfect candidate we expect you to have an understanding of what your strengths are but even more important than what your strengths are we expect you to have an idea of what your developmental needs are and what you have done and plan to do in the future to address those developmental needs um so that's very important be able to demonstrate a level of introspection and i think that'll certainly serve you well one of the other more important things we are looking for in our candidates are those that have high moral integrity um so the definition of integrity is being able to do the right thing even when nobody's watching you um and sometimes that can be difficult um sometimes it can be difficult to make those unpopular decisions um so be willing to and be able to share with us sometimes in the past where we've demonstrated that you have high moral integrity because that's really important as a commissioned officer and it's very important and what we look for in terms of our nominees next i would say we are looking for candidates who have demonstrated the ability to serve their communities what do i mean by that um being an officer is all about service and your service starts right now in the communities that you're in so be able to talk to us a little bit about how you served your community have you how you served uh businesses in your community um places of worship um how have you taken advantage of volunteer opportunities being a commissioned officer and being enrolled in a service academy is about service right that's why it's called a service academy so be able to speak to um how you served your community i would say one of the final things i would leave you with is we look for candidates who understand the importance of being a good teammate being a commissioned officer is about putting the welfare of others before yourself so be able to speak to how you demonstrated your ability to be a good teammate in the past and i really feel like that'll serve you well all things considered um all of these things should help adequately prepare you for this journey i wish you all the best of luck and i'm sure i'll see you in the future my name is gail mater and i am an admissions liaison officer for the united states air force academy i graduated from the air force academy in 1996 and i would like to share with you the opportunities of those that wish to continue their education beyond high school at the academy there are two main things that you must understand first it's an appointment and therefore you need to one apply to the academy itself and secondly you need to receive a nomination these nominations come from congressional sources um as well as a few other sources primarily you apply to each senator of your state and the congressional representative for your district which of course for delaware we have one everyone should also apply for a vice presidential nomination even though these are very limited in number it is best to do that to have as many avenues of opportunity as possible um the other is if which these are very rare cases um medal of honor recipients um their children can receive a nomination and also there are presidential nominations so if you have a parent that served eight years of active duty or an equivalent amount of point system within the reserves you can also apply for a presidential nomination as well um another one actually that we need to mention is that if your high school jrotc is an honorary jrotc they also can offer nominations so when you're looking at applying to an academy it's um different than most colleges not better not worse just simply different the academies are looking for a whole person concept the reason being not only will once you graduate you'll have a commission in the united states air force or now even the united states united states space force um it's also to prepare you because not everyone is going to serve 20 years but you will if you choose be a leader in whatever industry um or life path you take so there are a couple of things to consider there's four main pillars there's academics athletics leadership and this one's always a little bit hard for me to find just the right word for um i would say moral but it's with the understanding that the academies have an honor code and therefore they are seeking people of integrity the air force core values are integrity first service before self and excellence in all we do and therefore when seeking candidates um [Music] to become our the future leaders of the air force in our nation that's what one aspect that we're looking for so leadership what does that look like um really quite honestly it looks like you doing the best that you can do and what you're passionate about if you're in jrotc hopefully you have some leadership positions if you're on an athletic team hopefully you're pursuing captain's slots i myself was a band member so i was a section leader maybe your journey isn't right in high school or you have some um unique life uh challenges or presentations that you need to work with so maybe you're working a lot of hours to help support your family so it's if you're working a job to help support the family or yourself that you're doing the best you can at that so i always encourage candidates there is no um right or wrong here okay because it's about you being the best version of you find something you love and be the best you can be at it and help others along the way academically quite frankly the academies are challenging so you need to be as prepared as possible that means taking those challenging those college prep and those ap classes that being said you don't want to solid see in all of them to drop your gpa so be mindful challenge yourself but at the same time do your best of course part of academics but yet seen separately is the s.a.t and act uh the best thing the best advice that has been around the block for decades for the academies is test early and often we recommend you take both sat and act and take them frequently because thankfully the academy's super scores what that means is if you go let's say you take two tests and on the second test you go up in one area and down in the other one in uh you know in comparison to your first one the academies are going to take the best from each so you can't go wrong i myself took the act five times i've worked with people that took it six times do your best right it all goes back to that another aspect of course is physical fitness so the academies have a candidate fitness assessment and it is designed to exhaust you you start with a basketball throw you have pull-ups or a flexed arm hang you continue with um push-ups sit-ups and a shuttle run and then lastly after all that you run a mile so it's a test of endurance and fortitude and overall physical fitness but yet again it's simply a piece of the pie if you max it that's wonderful but that's not a whole person concept right so we're looking at being the best in everything we can with understanding and accepting where we are and of course there is the department of defense medical examination that being said you know there are basically simple i don't want to no that's not worded properly there are simply basic qualifications that are needed to be in the service um and you know that's outside the purview of an admissions liaison officer such as myself um we don't handle that but you um do have to go through that process as well like just like you would if you were to enlist or go through another commissioning source i'm trying to think here let's see i've covered oh high school curriculum let's talk about that so you want to be looking at four years of math four years of science with a lab four years of english three years of history or social studies and at least two years of a modern foreign language remember that approximately 30 percent of every class it's not their first application so what does that mean that means if you don't get in the first time if you really want it try again generally you look to start your application july 1st it is a rolling deadline so you have four months from the time you start to the time you finish so when you go online to academyadmissions.com and you fill out that pre-candidate questionnaire i recommend you start getting the ball rolling as all my friends that are in scouting say how do you eating how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time so you look at that big picture and you plan ahead and you do your best you enjoy the journey and know that no matter what whether you get into the academy or not the intention is to be the best version of yourself and no matter what life throws at you if you're open to it you will grow thank you so much for your time good evening and welcome to academy night on behalf of the naval academy my name is major brad boyd i am the delaware area coordinator for the naval academy information program also known as the blue and gold program and i'd like to briefly familiarize you with the naval academy in the time that i have so without further ado here's my contact information i know the administrators will provide this at the end of all the presentations but uh feel free to copy this down if you have an opportunity now so uh the naval academy we affectionately refer to as the yard it's a great combination of a military base in a college campus they have all the amenities and services that you would expect probably a little more than that it's located in annapolis maryland about halfway between baltimore and washington dc uh we have world-class facilities uh not only for our division one athletes but for uh club sports and intramural sports as well the burghead of midshipmen is what we refer to as the student body if you will a midshipman is a student at the naval academy uh roughly about 4 500 students there and you see the breakdown of male and female midshipmen uh all the midshipmen are represented in all 50 states our territories and foreign countries uh we have many diverse and cultural backgrounds and uh even sailors and marines come from the fleet to attend the naval academy and amongst them are many leaders uh scholars and varsity athletes so the naval academy is a stem school we're heavy on engineering math and science we only have 25 majors to offer we also address humanities and social sciences and available uh but as you can see in the left column and center column uh pretty heavy on the science thing and um that's that's the onus that you come with strengths and those particularly when you demonstrate that um in your transcripts your high school transcripts so uh we have small class sizes in the classrooms uh it's we think that's better for learning student to faculty ratio is eight to one and in addition uh we have a one-to-one civil uh to military faculty ratio so we have uh fleet marine officers and navy officers that are also instructing in or on campus so we have varsity sports we have club sports and we have intramural sports there is a requirement for each midshipmen to engage in one of those and you can see the list of uh the typical sports uh men and women sports and then co-ed sports that we offer and believe it or not you get pay and benefits while you attend the naval academy because you're essentially almost on active duty they receive a full scholarship if you earn an appointment to attend the naval academy which includes tuition uh your room and board and medical and dental coverage uh each midshipman receives a stipend or a pay each month however as a pleb or a freshman you have a lot of things to pay for you get your whole allotment of uniforms in the first couple of weeks you buy a computer with that money and so uh you only may see as a freshman a plebe about a hundred or so dollars every month and as you uh uh get more senior uh a first first-class man or a first-eat may see about 600 a month in a pay stipend so the goal at the naval academy obviously is to graduate um there is a service obligation at the end and everyone graduates with at least a bachelor of science degree you uh earn a commission as an officer in the navy an ensign or a second lieutenant in the united states marine corps you have a minimum five-year service commitment and some of the opportunities i mean there are many but as depicted on the slide here you can see uh at the lower right uh part of the slide you see the submarine service and then above that is naval aviation and in the center of the screen is marine corps aviation and then the backbone of the navy is the surface warfare uh officer uh pipeline and that's depicted with the uh the destroyer there um what's not listed here is marine corps ground and that is the backbone of the marine corps so here are the service assignments for last may uh we graduated uh almost 1025 uh second tenants and ensigns and you can see uh surface warfare took up almost a quarter of the class uh both conventional and new and nuclear and i say surface warfare a surface warfare officer is a swo or swo the submarine service also took a fair amount of the graduating class we graduate 30 seals 25 to 35 navy seals every year and explosive ordnance disposal is listed and you'll see also naval aviation marine corps aviation and marine corps ground at the bottom and then the restricted line is predominantly navy side of uh specialties in crypto um intelligence oceanography and the like at the bottom you see a marine corps cyber intelligence is also a supported field so you have to have a basic uh there is a basic eligibility to attend the naval academy uh somewhere between ages 17 and 23 you must not have passed your 23rd birthday by the time you get to plebe summer must be a citizen you must have no obligations outside of yourself and you must be a good moral character which means you can't have a police record essentially so uh the naval academy website is where i go to find all the information i need it's updated frequently and it's uh i think it's an exceptional resource for those uh thinking of applying and those in the application process it's at usna.edu admissions um there are other sources also on social media which i'll touch upon in a bit but uh basically let's talk about the uh information required in the application you will exp be expected to provide a personal statement usually in the form of answering two questions and uh two essays you have to do a fitness assessment which i'll touch upon shortly and then you have to go to your guidance office and uh seek out an activities record and your academic information your transcripts and then you would go to uh your favorite math and english teacher for a recommendation on your performance uh in a class that they had you for and then of course uh hopefully in your junior year you're entertaining s.a.t and act prep courses and actually full on act and sat class tests so i mentioned the physical qualification required it's called the candidate fitness assessment all the service academies have it um i think there's some variances as i understand but it's six events in roughly an hour ending with a one mile run and that is administered by either a blue and gold officer a commissioned officer from one of your uh or a junior rotc unit uh a coach or a physical ed teacher from the state of delaware and then there's a medical qualification that's uh we call it god merb but it's an organization within the military that evaluates uh candidates for service academies and rotc programs uh usually you're notified about 50 into your application so that we know you're serious uh and then you would start you know filling out your health history and you just have to meet requirements and there are actually some things that would make you not eligible to attend the academies or rotc um and that's what this is for obviously so nominations nominations are a separate a separate pipeline from the uh application um while you're applying to the academies you actually have to seek out a nomination from one of your two state senators in the state of delaware or our congresswoman lisa blunt rochester there are other nomination sources like the vice president you can also apply uh to uh her for uh five spots she has five spots per year and uh you have to adhere to a domicile requirement if you go to school in the state of delaware but don't live there then you would have to apply to either maryland or new jersey or pennsylvania but if you live in the state of delaware then then you're good with uh with with my team of blue and gold officers to oversee you so here's a little bit of a busy slide it's a candidate cycle and it starts with the uh january of your junior year so second semester of your junior year hopefully you've already started uh working left to right you've already taken your act and sat scores or tests but hopefully working on them and fully engaged in them also in january the summer seminar application opens for rising seniors the preliminary application opens about the first of may at the naval academy and then you'd be notified by the naval academy if you're an official candidate and you can start working on it we recommend all candidates that they do their best to complete as much of the application before the end of the summer um maybe as you're starting you can tie up loose ends as you're starting the uh your senior year uh but um it really is in your best interest as you see where september is marked the admission board meets every thursday and reviews all the completed applications at that time so um it's in your best interest to complete the application uh briskly and quickly um and and move on from there uh so the deadline for the application for next year for the class of 2026 is december 31 or excuse me january 31st as far as we know uh the deadline to open a new application is december 31st but really it's a moot point if you get the application open in may really it's it's in your best interest to complete it quickly um and then the admissions places a uh sort of a restriction on themselves to try to notify all candidates by april 15th of the following year uh or or this this uh candidate cycle to let everybody know who's appointed who isn't you can go on with your plan b if you're so interested maybe you go to college for a year reapply uh the disguise the limit and then if you are appointed plebe summer would uh begin at the end of your junior year end of june after you've graduated in maybe early june or late may so the admissions process as i described you so you fill out a preliminary application the naval academy uses the basic information that you provide to assess your competitiveness as a candidate then you become an official candidate hopefully not everybody does then the admissions board will review your completed application you'll complete your candidate fitness assessment and you'll go do the dodd-merb exam if there's any questions about any medical things the medical office at the naval academy uh engages you and hopes to complete that application without any problems then you obtain a nomination separately that usually happens late december maybe the first week in january you uh learn that you've earned a nomination and that means now you're eligible to come to compete for an appointment to the naval academy in the state of delaware and you're competing against other students and then if uh you're tremendously fortunate and offers a offer of appointment is uh is provided so here's some advice for admissions uh you need to be strong in math and science like i said it's a stem school chemistry and physics with the lab and uh background in algebra uh trig geometry pre-clock and calc uh ap and honors and ib courses are highly encouraged that's just what is competitive and there's no minimum gpa requirement but you strive to be in the top 20 of your class and then at the bottom there we'd like to see demonstrated leadership potential and i'd like to see that you're active in athletics and non-athletic activities and that includes community service and volunteer work so the top right five reasons to attend the naval academy it's a full ride you have guaranteed employment upon graduation it's in a really great location and it's not far from delaware mind you it's about an hour and 45 minutes away excellent leadership and character development and an 89 graduation rate here are uh some social media links on facebook twitter and instagram our website usna.edu admissions is up there as i mentioned before and there's additional information for athletes at navysports.com that is all i have i appreciate your time tonight and thank you for coming and also thank you for the senator and your staff for putting this together by far it's one of our most popular events and uh look forward to speaking with all you candidates in the near future have a good night hello everyone i'm captain richard simpson from west point admissions i'm the northeast regional commander which includes delaware and pennsylvania all the way up to maine and i'm excited to be joining you virtually for this event today i want to say thank you to senator carper and lauren gutierrez for inviting me to record this video to share about the awesome opportunities at west point with you i also want to mention steve murphy he's our field force state coordinator for delaware he's been doing it for 15 years and he's a great resource and you can find his information when you have an open application go into your candidate portal and look up field force and you can see stephen murphy's information there a great resource to direct any delaware specific questions about west point so let's get started so here's what we're going to talk about we're going to talk about the west point experience what west point offers what differentia uh differentiates west point from the other academies that you may have heard about uh such as navy or air force coast guard merchant marine and some application highlights for the application process so west point it's a leadership development institution and our mission is to produce leaders of character who are going to serve in the us army for uh five years they get the privilege of serving and leading soldiers for five years on active duty following graduation and it's challenging right west point it's not an easy experience it's gonna push you academically uh physically through all our dp courses and athletics and through our military training um but it's worth it because it's gonna it's going to grow you and prepare you so that you're ready to step in front of soldiers after graduation and lead them um supporting and defending the constitution doing various missions throughout the world 100 of our graduates are placed in the us army in 18 different branches which i'll discuss a little more on the next slide very competitive starting salary and i remember my commissioning day like this young lady here in the photo and my mom and my wife she's my girlfriend at the time or fiance excuse me got to pin my shoulder boards just like that and it's a really cool day because you get to graduate and throw your hat in the air and then right after that you go down and you get to commission with your family and friends so it's a huge privilege and a huge honor and here's our 18 branches that i mentioned previously that you can get in uh you know commission into now you don't have to stay with these branches but this is if you pick these branches and you're selected into them this is where you will serve your first five years and we have everything that you can think of as being army such as infantry armor filled artillery but we also have a lot of things that people don't think of we have a pretty significant aviation branch right after the air force we have the second most aircraft of course they're all helicopters so apaches chinooks blackhawk helicopters and our aviation branch is a little different right most of our pilots are warrant officers so unlike the navy or the air force if you commission into aviation you'll be a pilot and you'll clearly be in charge of your aviation unit you'll be able to leader company commander with ucmj authority over over your warrant officers when you're working with them we have cyber and we're building a new cyber engineering academic center right next door to where i am right now in the admissions building we have finance medical service corps every year we send 20 officers into the medical corps to go to med school after graduation we have military intelligence military police logistics like what i am this is a quartermaster branch so we have ordinance to include explosive ordnance disposal quartermaster transportation signal corps which would be like our it support lots of different things there's lots of opportunities now later on in your career you can get you can assess um if you're selected into special forces psychological psychological operations civil affairs and we have so many jobs we have marketing data analytics acquisitions professors at west point uh you name it so there's lots of different ways to serve so west point was established in 1802 it's america's first military academy so we need to point that out because avian air force they built their schools after our model um and it's america's first school of engineering yeah which we're very proud about because we're currently ranked number three for civil engineering programs in the nation uh in 1817 we use what we call their method in the their method it's pretty important um so it's where you study the material ahead of time and then when you show up to class you're already at a higher level of learning and you're you're just working out where you don't understand the material with the professor and with your classmates west point's very distinguished we have many notable alumni to include two u.s presidents to include president eisenhower uh 20 astronauts to include buzz aldrin the second person on the moon general benjamin o davis who the new davis barracks is named after he was uh leader of the tuskegee airmen and had a very notable career broke a lot of glass ceilings for african-americans lieutenant general nigel west she was the first female african-american surgeon general in the united states army also broke a lot of glass ceilings uh lots of people think of duke when they think of coach k but coach k is a west point grad and so i always actually hear when he got to come here and uh go up into our mess hall and you know give giving announcements all the cats that's pretty cool and alexander villanueva he was with um the steelers but now he's even close to close from delaware he's over with the multiple ravens so we're going to talk about cadet life so our classes are small we have a seven to one student to faculty ratio um and we're actually ranked number one um by i believe us news it might be princeton for the uh best classroom experience or second best classroom experience number one most accessible professors so classes are pretty small it's not like a normal college you get to know your professor they work with you they know if you know the material or not so there's not a lot of hiding if you're not prepared but it's good because if you're ready to learn you know you're going to understand the material half of our faculty are permanently assigned either military civilian you know a lot of them almost all them have phds academic uh professionals and experts in their area the other half are like me where we have graduate degrees and we rotate through and then go back to the army and we're a great resource to talk about those 18 branches so if you want to learn about quartermaster you can come and ask me a question about it because that's what i do and that's what i want to go back to the army and do again lots of different scholarships so we have a west point scholarship program and we have an excel program for our african american and latinx cadets um and these programs groom and prepare our cadets to compete and win these scholarships so this last year we had four females which is really cool it's cool that we had four and that they were all female win uh rhodes scholarships so we had now i have a hundred road scholars from west point um but we meant we win many of these scholarships every year we have uh 36 academic majors which is more than any of the other academies and it's it's not just stem so even though we were founded as an engineering school and we have lots of engineering we have things like cyber science mechanical engineering civil engineering mathematics we also have a lot of non-engineering stuff too like history philosophy department of foreign languages is pretty popular you can major in french chinese russian and a lot of times get to go on internships around the world to do an immersion in that language so we have everything you can want plus 15 miners and everyone graduates with the bachelor's in science so it's going to give you a good foundation to pursue something later like an mba here's our military training so you can't do three years you can't do five years at west point um with a few exceptions like people that get hurt or something like that um because you're going through this military development training right you start off with beast barracks then you do buckner and then later on you do these other trainings like cldt which is like almost like a mini ranger school uh ctlt where you get to go out to the army and be a platoon leader for a few weeks um you get to be part of the training details for buckner which uh which is the second one the cft or beast and you get to lead cadets because west point can run itself for grooming you and preparing you to be a leader of character so that when you stand in front of soldiers as a second lieutenant you're ready we have hundreds of advanced individual development opportunities so when i was at west point i got to go to gabon africa and cross the equator seven times uh and do training with the french foreign legion ride in a french puma helicopter uh shoot it from a french famas rifle so it's really cool really great opportunity and military qualification schools which i'll talk a little more on this slide lots of opportunities to do semesters abroad uh so one of my classmates got to go to france and was at a french civilian school in paris for six months um you can go to other service academies air force navy coast guard and many other military academies around the world and that's all going to be in your junior year we don't do that the first two years of the last year just in your junior year lots of different uh individual advanced development opportunities ids so i talked about i got to go to gabon there's you can go to the white house you can go to congressional offices fbi nasa training with industry and military qualification schools so airborne get to jump out of perfectly good airplanes with parachute air assault get to rappel out of helicopters and we actually do that here at west point uh so this last summer you can see the helicopters landing and the cadets training with their cadre to connect sling loads to the helicopters or repel out of them so what it takes we're looking for excellent academic ability leadership potential and your overall fitness and this is this is how we evaluate a value view so i'm going to talk about the claw uh qualitative components first so you have your interview with a field force member or an admissions officer you have your candidate statements and you have your school official evaluations um which are going to be the mandatory components of your application and that gives us a pretty good triangulation of who you are as a leader of character and we also have optional you can submit an employer evaluation or you can submit letters of recommendation as well and that's you have a lot of different folks plus what you're saying about yourself that tell us why you want to go to west point why you want to serve in the u.s army and then uh quantitatively we use this pie chart so 60 academics 30 based on your leadership potential and 10 based on your candidate fitness assessment so the deadline for this for the class of 2027 is going to be january 31st of 2023 okay but the sooner you turn this in the better right because we're gonna release the second step kit in the summer and we do rolling admission um so when you when your file is complete and you have these other two components the medical qualification and a nomination which is why many of you are here today um then your file can be considered by the admissions committee for appointment but without any of those without one of those things you need to have all of them you're gonna be waiting until you receive those or your files complete so nominations every um cadet candidate is eligible for four nominations and we encourage you to apply for all of them so one from your representative one from each u.s senator from your state and one from the vice president of the united states um so make sure you go on their websites understand their nomination application requirements and you understand the timeline for that because a lot of times sometimes people don't pay attention to that they'll miss the deadlines and they can't receive a nomination from that source and there's also service connected nominations so these are extra nominations that um children of career military children are veterans who are 100 able disabled or deceased or members of the us army or armed forces rnc or junior rc they can apply for these and i encourage you to do that as well so if you are eligible for a service connected domination apply for all four of your congressional nominations and also apply for your service connected nominations and this is what we're looking for we're looking for people that want to serve in the us army and are mentally tough so angela duckworth she wrote a book called grit and she does a leadership or a grit survey of a lot of west point grads and she mentions that that grads that do well are the ones that um that are mentally and fit you know mentally tough and they have grit so sle the application is open right now so if you apply to west point uh between one february and 15 march and you're a rising senior this summer so this summer you're going to be a senior between your junior and senior year you're eligible to attend this program um so if you apply to west point right now you're automatically considered for this if you'd like to go and you can follow us on social media facebook instagram youtube and our website is a great source of information if you have any questions please feel free to reach out my email is richard.simpson westpoint.edu so that's richard.simpsonlikethecartoon at westpoint.edu thank you very much greetings everyone my name is lieutenant commander joe becker i'm the northeast regions admissions officer of the united states merchant academy i'm here today to talk to you about our academy who we are what we do and our requirements for admission picture here is our academy this is taking on a beautiful spring day you notice our academy is relatively small we're the smallest of all the service academies what does this mean for you as an applicant it means you have small class sizes our average class size is 13 students to every one professor with the easy access to facilities and accommodations parents what does this mean for you we know where your son and daughter is at all times if you ever need to get a hold of them we know exactly where they are during the day what do merchant mariners do i receive this question all the time and the best way to describe the merchant marine is don't think of it so much as a career excuse me don't think of it so much as a branch of the military but think of it more as a career field so there's so many great career fields students can go into these days uh law enforcement food service entertainment there's so many great ones out there the merchant marine the maritime industry is one of those great career fields the merchant marine consists of both properly owned and government-owned u.s flag vessels we provide waterborne transportation for cargos and persons moving both domestically and internationally in times of war national emergency the merchant marine serves as the fourth arm of defense uh case in point with the with the recent covert pandemic that has affected us all the hospital ships that were sent to new york city and california were crewed by merchant mariners while the vessels were owned by the united states navy they were crewed by civilian merchant mariners so that's just an example of some of some of the great services that we provide what do graduates earn the the us merchantman academy is very unique in the sense that our graduates gradu graduate with what we call the triple crown the triple crown consists of the bachelor of science degree a commission as an officer in the navy reserve and i will put i'll put an asterisk next to that and i'll tell you why in a second as well as a coast guard license as a merchant marine officer as either a third mate or third assistant engineer again the triple crown we're the only academy that offers you this option uh as detailed i explained that the all of our graduates commission has ensigns in the navy reserve at minimum everyone does have a service obligation many of our graduates will go to the navy reserve however graduates have the option to join any branch of the military they so choose whether it be an active duty or reserve and i'll go into further detail on the next slide as detailed all of our graduates encourage service obligation and following graduation what's unique about our academy is the the options you have for satisfying this obligation the majority of our of our graduates will take the first uh option here they will work in the maritime industry for five years they will maintain their uh coast guard license for six years and they will serve in the navy reserve for eight years this this time is all served concurrently so within eight years of graduation the student would have satisfied their service obligation roughly seventy percent of our graduates will take this option they will serve the maritime industry for five years again maintain their license for six years serving in the navy reserve for eight years thirty percent of our graduates will go on to serve active duty military five years service period they can go to any branch in the military they so choose the below chart details the various services as well as the number of graduates that went into that respective service dating back to class 2016. as you can tell roughly 30 of our graduates will go active duty the remaining 70 will go navy reserve with the option of pursuing their deck or engine license academic majors our academy offers five academic majors in total we offer two within the department of marine transportation and three within the department of marine engineering understand that we are a very stem-focused school we do not offer programs in liberal arts or sciences uh in psychology in any of the medical fields so if you're looking to be a dentist a sports psychologist or going into a business other than the merchant marine or maritime shipping this may not be a great fit for you again we're very stem focused and this is reflected in our admissions criteria which i'll touch on in the next few slides our academy offers a very unique program called senior senior is by far the greatest paid internship and study abroad program there is all of our students will go out to see between their sophomore and junior years typically in a for a four month sailing and then an eight month sailing in their junior year students will on average visit between 15 and 20 countries they'll be paid about a thousand dollars a month while they're at sea by their respective uh ships employer the pictures you see here these are not actors these are not stock photos these were photos that were submitted by our graduates uh following and following their respective seniors so just you take a moment just look at look at these photos again this is the greatest paid internship and study abroad program there is if you can find one better please let me know uh right here this is a typical day at the academy if you like structure if you like a routine this is going to be a great fit for you all of our students wake up in the morning typically between five and zero six hundred they'll go through the day's activities uh culminating uh at twenty two hundred ten o'clock at night when they go to sleep they'll wake up the next day and do it all again so again if you like structure if you like routine this would be a great fit for you uh our athletics program is pretty robust we are a division three athletics program so if you have any interest whatsoever in playing sports in the collegiate level i encourage you to check us out uh because we are division three our coaches uh tended not to make cuts as long as you're willing to participate you put the time in and and uh put a good effort forward to find a place for you on the team the teams listed here are our division three uh programs again we're very robust programs we're very competitive i encourage you to check out our website check out our teams as this is something we do consider for admissions purposes we also feature a very robust waterfront program waterfront features everything from rowing and dinghy sailing to offshore and capital vessels our crew teams and sailing teams are considered division one athletics programs and they fall under the waterfront program waterfront program is open to all students regardless of uh grade or a major it's a it's an excellent excellent extracurricular activity and we encourage students to participate at least at some point during their time at king's point our next few slides i'm going to talk about the admissions process uh what we're looking for in terms of admissions and how to be competitive and how to ensure that your your file is uh successful application when we evaluate student we look at four major areas act to include academics which also includes extracurricular activities physical fitness via the candidate fitness assessment we look at your medical suitability via the dahmer medical examination as well as your ability to secure a nomination from your member of congress of these four areas the physical fitness test the medical and the nomination are strictly pass fail meaning for the physical fitness test you need only to pass the test we do not award additional points based on performance we do not post the minimum results or the minimum score necessary we encourage you to try your best with that said is if you if you do take a practice test and you reach out to your admissions officer myself or admissions team uh we will give you advice of how to improve your score where you need improvement for the doddmer medical this this medical examination is required for admission all the services require a diamond physical what's unique about the dahmer examination is that you can take this for any academy and the results will be made available to us so if you're applying to other academies which we encourage you to do so those results will be made available to us likewise the candidate fitness assessment if you take the cfa for another another academy with the exception of coast guard the you can send those results to us and we will accept them for a score understand the medical examination can only be completed after you start your application typically.more allows candidates to start testing in late august early september so we encourage students to apply early and to take the donor examination when they're able to do so the cfa the candidate fitness assessment uh can be conducted by any uh physical education teacher strength and conditioning coach it can also be conducted by any former or current military officer or non-commissioned officer the testing you can start taking the physical with some sorry the cfa uh during june of your uh junior year or going into your senior year so we encourage you to take the cfa and then medical over the summer as soon as you can don't wait for the fall and winter months um finally you're all required to secure a nomination from your member of congress uh being if you're from delaware you can secure from either two senators or your u.s representative i will tell you right now from state of delaware app nominations are competitive again you only need one nomination and understand the rules for our academy differ from the other academies you need only secured nomination there's no primary or secondary selection we can and have in the past uh selected multiple candidates from the state of delaware uh so it's a competitive state but you also have some very great great great candidates coming out of your state so if you you know if don't be don't be concerned if you only receive one nomination you only need one nomination to be considered uh below is an sat act admissions uh testing chart uh well we don't have a minimum testing score this is our middle 50 range based on previous year statistics uh this is what we're looking for if you're applying uh this past year due to covid we we waived the sat act requirement however we do anticipate that it will be required for the class of 2026. so we encourage all students to test the early test often we do super score the exam we'll give you the highest scores available likewise you can take the sat and act we will take the highest math and english scores and consolidate them into a single score to try to give you the best score possible for the sat we do not require the essay we only look at the reading score the reading score is a two digit score that is found in your sat score sheet uh we encourage students again test multiple times if you'd like to forego the essay within the sat you're certainly free to do so however understand that that test made it you know main factor for other academies or other schools other opportunities that you're applying for as discussed uh academics is one of the foundations of our evaluation process it is the only category where students are actually ranked accordingly against each other within our academic criteria 75 of your evaluation is academics this includes your transcript uh your high school class ranking in your sat scores as previously mentioned only 25 includes your leadership and extracurricular activities so while we want students who are well motivated that are involved in uh extra extra curricular activities athletics band etc we place a great emphasis on our academics uh more so than the activities so please understand that within academics or we we take a very hard look at your transcript all students coming in at very at minimum should have taken chemistry physics and pre-calculus free calculus is okay we prefer to see calculus but pre-calc we can work with you on that ideally you should have a b average or better in these courses we want to see you take a take the hard courses challenge yourself take the ap courses the honors level courses any courses that give you college credit uh are very desirable so especially going to your senior year if you can take chemistry or physics or you know calculus do so if you're taking a second time that's wonderful we love to see students take take courses multiple times especially on the ap and honors levels for high school class ranking this only accounts for about 10 of your evaluation in the event your school does not rank we do accept a decile or estimation if the event your school cannot provide us that that figure we revert to the sat to determine your high school class rank okay application process understand the process there's a lot of moving parts we understand it's there's multiple items you do need to secure our application opens up may first of your junior year so may 1st 2021 our application window opens we encourage you to apply as soon as you can the sooner you apply the sooner you're able to upload documents schedule appointments and do all the items that are necessary for uh completion of the application we do require a copy of your high school transcript uh official test scores from the sat and or act a school profile an activities record a biographical essay the essay is only 500 words the only thing we're looking for is just tell us why you want to come to the academy there's a prompt included with the application uh again 500 words we don't need your life story but please be concise clear and why you want to attend the academy and also state that you understand the service obligation following graduation we do require school official evaluations from a math teacher a science teacher and an english teacher these can be teachers that have taught you in the past doesn't actually have to be your senior year teacher but someone that can give you an honest assessment of how how you perform within their class deadline for admission is february 1st this is a hard and fast deadline uh this comes up every year where students try to ask for extensions and unfortunately we operate a nationwide campaign here for admission we cannot grow grinch extensions for under no circumstances so please take advantage of the time frame we're offering you may 1st the application window opens and the sooner you start the sooner you'll be able to finish and we encourage students like do not hoard documents don't wait for a test score don't wait for a nomination as soon as you have a document upload it okay because everything can be submitted concurrently you're not dependent on uh medical examinations or nominations to submit your items uh following slide here these are just admission strategies that we offer we tell all students coming in here uh first two items here i can't stress this enough uh the applicant not the parent should be driving this process all right uh ultimately if you're if you're successful if you're accepted for admission you're going to be one going to the course of study you're going to be the one that's here raising your hand your right hand taking the oath of office not your parents so typically students who are successful are the ones that are assertive that are involved in the process uh that complete their items early and um accurately all right we encourage you to play all available nomination sources early uh within the state of delaware and nationwide every office will typically put out their information in april may time frame go on each respective congressional members website plenty of information there about how to apply for the nomination what they're looking for and what their timetable is understand every office a little bit different about what they're looking for and what their timetable is but they do have similarities in terms of what their you know items they're looking for and typically deadlines can be october november time frame it may vary between offices but that's what we see nationwide typically october november is when your items should be submitted to a congressional office again complete the application earlier we can't stress that enough the sooner you start the sooner you're finished the more time we have to provide feedback to you and to provide ways that you can improve your application take the sat and or act early and often at minimum you should take each test once even if it's a practice exam that's okay just to get an idea of which one you're better at and proceed from there again we do super score we'll give you the best possible score we can and we don't judge on how many times you've taken the test i've literally seen students take the test more than five times okay so that is a viable viable strategy for admission uh take chemistry physics and calculus i can't stress that enough we're a very stem-focused school as reflected in our curriculum chemistry physics and calculus are valued if you can score at least a b average or better a is terrific if you have an a in all those courses wonderful uh we also encourage you to take those on the honors and ap and uh collegiate level if possible um practice for the cfa i can't stress this enough the cfa you can start taking the effect of june 1st and onward it can be conducted by any strength and conditioning coast a physical education coach any colonel former military officer or a non-commissioned officer can complete this for you as well i encourage you over the summer this way you're you're not running up against your school schedule the weather conditions are favorable and then if you need time to improve uh you do have time to work with i can't tell you how many students wait till the last minute take the test are not successful and then try to ask for an extension age it doesn't work out for them complete the diamond physical early again this is a medical examination you cannot complete this medical examination until after you apply once you apply your information will be forwarded to doddmob they'll provide you follow-on information about how to schedule the examination dahmer contracts with doctors in your local area uh via your zip code so you go into their website you punch in your zip code they will tell you who the local nearest local provider is and it's an easy day don't schedule the examination again until you receive notification from donor but i can't stress that enough uh we've had students in the past that have taken the exam on their own without scheduling it and it creates all kinds of headaches so please don't do not schedule the examination until after you receive notification uh from dober that you're eligible to do so we encourage you to visit king's point uh pre-covert we would host uh daily and overnight visits uh please consult with our office about our availability and when we can we can accept her for a visit and lastly explore all your options i can't just i can't tell you this enough there's so many great options out there and opportunities if you're looking to join the military i encourage you check out all the academies check out rotc uh there's multiple ways to the top of the mountain don't think that the merchant academy is the end-all be-all um you know case in point myself i did not go to school here i attended rotc at suny maritime that's where i received my commission my license and i tell students hey there's multiple ways to top the mountain explore of your options and ultimately decide what's right for you um again we can't stress this enough the worst thing that can happen is a student gets here um the program they're looking for it doesn't match up with what we're teaching them and they end up dropping out and nobody wins if that happens so explore your options do what's right for you i you know the phrase i use is test drive them all so if you're if you can if you can't visit the academy at least jump on their on their admissions zoom calls check out their website ask questions and just again figure out what's best for you uh lastly any questions uh feel free to contact our admissions office our website is detailed here the email listed there is the admissions email if you email them they they will forward to myself my information is also on the website my email is becker j b e c k erj at usmma.edu and my contact information is on there as well um we're here to help you we'd like to see you be successful but at the end of the day it comes down to your willingness to apply the academy and put the work in that's necessary to be successful i wish you all the best and take care good evening everybody my name is lee dawkins i'm the state of delaware coordinator of admissions partners for the u.s coast guard academy in new london connecticut so i'm here tonight to talk to you a little bit about the us coast guard academy as a college option for some of you and briefly touch on the coast guard for those of you who might be interested in direct enlistment into the coast guard so let's take a look at a couple of programs that we have here to talk about tonight uh our main point of contact for you if you are interested uh as in the academy is uscga.edu and that'll be your point of contact for getting some information all right so immediately uh so let's talk about what you think the coast guard is and let you know that there is a series of missions at the coast guard that allows you to do the job of protecting and serving every day many of you probably familiar with our maritime safety the search and rescue whether it's on a ship or a small boat out of a small boat station like in ocean city maryland or maybe flying or jumping out of a helicopter as a marine swimmer there's also aids navigation boating safeties and water waste management there's also marine maritime security the u.s coast guard is a law enforcement agency we also operate defense operations drug interdictions and migrant interdiction especially down in the caribbean there's also if you've seen our ice our icebreakers so we have small icebreakers that go into the great lakes and up the hudson river also a very large icebreaker that's in the arctic and antarctic but maybe you're more interested in environmental protection that type of thing marine sciences and environmental responses on the screen there's a big picture of the big fire that was down in the gulf of mexico years ago but there was also if you read recently in the news about an oil spill right here off the in the delaware bay that the u.s coast guard was handling also being part of national defense again the u.s coast guard is not a part of the department of defense but we're depart part of the department of homeland security so that means that we take care of port security and anti-terrorism so great careers uh that will be around for a long time if you're interested in those types of things so it is a the only military service that is a law enforcement and regulatory powers enacted by congress so we do all the arrests so that's be a co if you're interested in law enforcement that's a great small service to be a part of the united states coast guard is only about 35 000 active duty members and it gives you a heritage of lifesavers so if you're a guardian that wants to go out and save lives then maybe we are the right fit for you being a part of the homeland security it's a career that can lead you to the fbi secret service nsa in the private sector and law enforcement and into the merchant marine the school is small and so is the service so where is the us coast guard academy not as famous as maybe as west point or our cousins over in annapolis uh the u.s coast guard academy is located in new london connecticut easy to get there from delaware just go up route one do you hit i-95 turn north and travel up to you see the sign that says u.s u.s coast guard academy in new london it's about a five-hour trip from dover to give you somehow some a bit of reference on the distance there is also an amtrak station right in downtown new london so it's an easy train ride from wilmington on up to the us coast guard academy so what about the size of the school we are a smaller school there is only about 1100 cadets at the academy we try to represent all 50 states and we also do training for coast guard officers from around the globe so at any one time there are 10 to 20 different nations represented so you have an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people from all across the world while at the coast guard academy we also are upping our militar minority and female population so we urge anyone that falls into those categories to to think about us and apply you have a home at the u.s coast guard academy so our average gpa for a high school graduate if you're thinking of the academy is about 3.75 in the mid 600s for the math sats our student population was approximately 80 percent high school varsity athletes that also means 20 were not so don't think that eliminates you we are a stem school so engineering math degrees and sciences are important to us so that would be part of your high school curriculum that you should be looking at right now especially if you're just a sophomore starting out so this is what a cadet kind of looks like how about the academy what do we offer in the terms of an education well we are the top undergraduate experience in the northeast according to u.s news and world report our majors are listed over on the right side of the screen up here with our newest one cyber systems now cyber problems as you know in the news today is a big problem and several years ago we started a cyber major to help combat that down the road we are also one of the top 15 engineering schools in the country so how about mom and dad what about tuition well like the other military academies we are tuition free you happen to owe us five years of military ex duty at the end but the nice thing is on day one when you arrive you get on the payroll with about a thousand dollar a month uh paycheck coming in nice thing also for mom and dad once graduation comes you have a hundred percent job placement if you graduate from the u.s coast guard academy uh the other thing that is very nice is the graduates of the academy we have a high retention rate and so that because of high retention rate over 85 percent of our graduates go on to earn a master's degree which is paid for by the us coast guard so that's a very nice uh bonus to be able to go to school get your masters and while you're in that program that's your only job so maybe your parents can tell you about having to juggle a full-time job and raising kids and trying to get their master's degree is pretty tough if you're in this program you're able to go to school and that is your only job at that point so while you're at the academy we're assault a small student body that means there is a small ratio of students to teachers once you get into those upper programs out of your mass freshman courses you have about an eight to one student ratio to your faculty and as a bonus when graduating from the us coast guard academy you graduate with a 100 ton mariners license so if you had dreams of operating big ships or being a captain of a boat of a ship in the maritime service you have a really good start here and right there on that list again i want to emphasize is being cyber that's one of the big things maybe you're also an athlete what happens what will happen to you here at the academy well we still have um athletics for you to choose from health and physical development are core requirements for the academy uh so we want you to encourage you to play in sports so we have 25 inter interscholastic sports uh two of them are division one the rest are division three but we also have club and intramural sports and if you are an athlete and you want to be considered and recruited by our coaching staff as part of your admissions packet go to our website which is thecoastguardacademy.edu and then go to the athletics page and on the athletics page there is a recruit me button which you can then connect directly with the coach and be so that you can send in sports tapes they can come out and see you at local sporting events that type of thing and for some reason the kids kind of think it's important to have an adidas shoe contract and apparel contact contract so i can tell you the new uniform swag is pretty nice but like i also said we also have music programs so it's not all about athletics so if you're a vocalist or a band member we do want to hear from you also the arts are important so you can reach out with your audition tapes again as part of your packet basic administration admissions there's our website uscga.edu is where you can start and get your bears in account and get more information and i would urge you to do that even if you want the slightest interest register and you'll start getting some information we have a modified rolling program on admissions you do have to be a us citizen no dependents in under 25 23 years of age we were looking for heavy math english and science and no nomination is required so if the only academy that you're going to apply to would be the us coast guard academy you would not need a congressional nomination from our congresswoman or one of our two u.s senators it's not required at the academy here are your careers you can go to sea land and air you can uh and if you want to be a direct enlistment so let's just say that uh being a high level student maybe isn't uh you're where you stand but you do want to serve in the military or maybe you are just a great leader and know that you can eventually be an officer well we'd enjoyed you and encourage you to join directly so you can go to go gocoastguard.com and then you can get information from there about direct enlistment because there are 25 ways to become an officer from the enlisted program if you are a leader you'll eventually become an officer you want or you can have just a fun job in the coast guard by going to there so lots of opportunities uh and here the last thing i'd like to cover here tonight is our if you are a junior we have an aim program which this is our summer program for this summer you need to apply now to come up for a week this summer so if you are are a junior right now i'd urge you to apply to that program as soon as possible again go to uscga.edu all the information is there lots of youtube videos you can also again sign up for what we call a bears den account and that'll start feeding you some information even if you're only slightly interested what we want you to do is make sure that you're a good fit for us and that the school is a good fit for you you have to make sure that where you go to college is what you really want to do so i want to thank you for your time and again reach out to us as soon as you can that concludes the presentations this evening please feel free to reach out to any of the contacts listed here with your questions thanks again for joining us and we hope to hear from you soon

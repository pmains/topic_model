mr. Pascrell for 30 minutes the gentleman is recognized mr. speaker in light of the upcoming one-on-one meeting between Donald Trump and president Trump and Vladimir Putin I rise today to remind the American people about the cloud of collusion hanging over their heads as the American people continue to learn details of this unfolding scandal the implausible idea of Russia compromising the President of the United States becomes more fact than fiction the president his family members his campaign staff his close associates have repeatedly repeatedly lied about their multiple contacts with Russian officials and klas Associates of Putin they have had no consistent explanation for these meetings and has happened over and over furthermore the president continues to pirate Putin's version of world events over those of his own American career civil servants intelligence operatives military officials and allies this betrayal has become like clockwork in inexplicable routine we cannot simply shrug off while it is possible the current list of known campaign context positive policy positions and fawning statements have an innocuous explanation there is a simpler reason the house should be investigating has President Donald Trump been covertly influenced or personally compromised by Russia a hostile foreign power Russian intelligence is known for using blackmail that exploits greed stupidity and ego and other weaknesses to leverage over people he has employed mr. Michael Cohen mr. Felix aider the record is very clear honest both of whom have links to the Russian mafia he has continued the secrecy about his business finances by not releasing his tax returns the xyx commissioner told the President of the United States to divest he did not and he defied that person most responsible for draining the swamp the ethics commissioner from operating his business at or beyond the edge of ethical boundaries Trump's penchant for compromising behavior his willingness to work closely with criminals and expressed desire to protect his privacy makes him the ideal target with close business ties Russia has enjoyed financial leverage over President Trump for 15 years this is a fact that his family has admitted to multiple times the story is well known after a series of brazen abuses of bankruptcy laws President Trump was not president at the time mr. Trump found it impossible to borrow from American banks so he turned to unconventional sources of capital including Russian cash from 2003 to 2007 teen people from the former Soviet Union made 86 all-cash purchases that we know of a known red flag of potential money-laundering of Trump properties totaling 109 million dollars Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets quote unquote those are the words of Donald Jr in 2008 in 2010 the private wealth division of Deutsche Bank also long Trump President Trump hundreds of millions of dollars during the same period it was laundering billions in Russian money we don't rely on American banks we have all the funding we need out of Russia those are the boasts of Eric Trump in ninth and 2014 shady business transactions offer the perfect cover for cover payments and president Trump's adamant refusal to release his tax returns publicly only raises the level of suspicion the idea that Russia has been cultivating supporting and assisting Donald Trump to undermine Western alliances should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention before in during his campaign for president mr. Trump there were several odd connections between the two men when they lied about to the public as president mr. Trump President Trump called Putin find people he ignored the fact that Putin invaded Crimea intervened in eastern Ukraine poisoned people and United Kingdom and has commissioned the murder of dissidents journalists and spies shot down a commercial airliner in Europe and propped up most ruthless dictators of our time in Syria and violated our sovereignty in 2016 presidential election by every every intelligence organization that says USA to ensure the American people in future congresses know how we got here today today I will read parts of the Trump Russia dossier into the record also known as the crystal steer dossier and enter its entirety into the Congressional Record partisans on the other side they are may dismiss the document as bogus even fake news but they know that several allegations in this document have already been verified well the dossier represents raw intelligence or effectively a first draft and that a single thing of substance has been disproven not one and Christopher Steele has reliably provided intelligence to the UK and US intelligence agencies for decades while history will be the final judge on these matters these are this are some of the allegations which we now have been verified not a speaker mr. speaker this is serious business and when I read from the dossier I'm reading from my prime source what I read tonight has all been verified and certified than what the stuff that I'm reading while history will be a final judge on these matters here are some of the allegations page 1 of the dossier the claim quote/unquote Russian regime has been cultivating supporting assisting Trump for five years at least Haines endorsed by Putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in the Western alliance and the Western alliance so far the dossier reads I've continued mr. Trump has declined various sweetener real estate business deals offered him in Russia in order to further the Kremlin's cultivation of him however he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin including on his Democratic and other political rivals now here's the truth On January 6 2017 intelligence community assessment released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that Russian leadership favored Trump's candidacy over Clinton's and that Putin personally ordered an influence campaign to harm Clinton's electoral chances and quote undermine public faith in the u.s. democratic process as well as ordering cyber attacks on quote unquote both major u.s. political parties page 7 in 8 I don't have time to read the whole thing tonight obviously dossier claimed on page 7 & 8 the Russian regime quote has been behind the recent leak of embarrassing email messages emanating from the Democratic National Committee to the WikiLeaks platform the reason for using WikiLeaks was plausible deniability quote-unquote and the operation had been conducted with full knowledge and support of President Trump and senior members of his campaign team in return the Trump team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise us NATO defense commitments in the Baltics in Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine a priority for mr. Putin who needed to characterize and cauterize the subject this is what he wrote that's on page 17 eight that the dossier claims now here's the truth in July 2016 the Republican National Convention made changes to the Republican Party's platform on Ukraine initially the GOP platform proposed providing lethal weapons to the Ukraine quote-unquote that's what it originally stated that platform but the line was watered down to promise appropriate assistance quote unquote NPR reported that Diana Denman a Republican delegate is supported arming US allies in Ukraine has told people that Trump ajd Gordon said at the Republican convention in 2016 that Trump directed him to support weakening that position in the official platforms unquote JD Gordon was one of trumps national security advisors during the campaign said they had advocated for changing language because that reflected what Trump had said the Trump campaign did not appear to have intervene in any other platform deliberations only the language on Ukraine and here's the truth as the president and throughout the campaign Donald Trump has called NATO obsolete although he changed his mind today a little bit champion the disintegration of the European Union and said that he is open to lifting sanctions on Russia or has declined to enforce them Trump has repeatedly questioned whether our allies are paying enough into NATO ultimately raising questions as to whether he is deliberately facilitating Putin's long-term objective of undermining the Western liberal order dossier page 30 quote speaking to a trusted camp a trot in mid October of 2015 a close associate of Rosen EFT president and Putin Ally Igor session his name appears all over the place in the dossier elaborated on the reported secret meeting between mr. session and Carter page of the United States Republican presidential candidates foreign policy team in Moscow in July of 2016 the secret had been confirmed to him or her by a senior member of the staff in addition to my Rosina that President himself it took place on either the 7th or 8th of July the same day or the one after Carter Paige made a public speech to the higher economic school in Moscow unquote in terms of the the substance of the discussion sessions mr. sessions associate said that rose left President was so keen to lift personal and corporate Western sanctions imposed on his company that he offered page mr. Trump's associates as well the brokerage of up to 19% privatized stake in Rose neft in return page that expressed interest and confirmed that were Trump elected US president sanctions on Russia would be lifted the truth on December the 29th 2016 during the transition period between the election and the inauguration NASA National Security Advisor designate Mike Flynn spoke the Russian ambassador Sir Jake is slack urging him not to retaliate for newly imposed sanctions ultimately the Russians did not retaliate days after the inauguration the Trump administration ordered State Department staffers to develop proposals for immediately revoking the economic and other sanctions opposed against Russia thankfully these staffers alerted Congress who took steps to codify the sanctions and a law passed in August of 2017 the attempt to over the dissenter overturn the sanctions was abandoned after mr. Flynn's conversation was revealed and mr. Flinn resigned quarter-page has confirmed this meeting with top Moscow and Rosen eft officials that company corporation in house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence testament it's all laid out when page was asked if a rosen eft executive had offered him a potential sale of significant percentage of Rosslyn page said he may briefly mentioned it unquote dossier claimed on page 23 quote finally speaking separately to the same cap atria a senior Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs MFA official reported that as a prophylactic measure a leading russian diplomat macau hooligan had been withdrawn from russia i've been withdrawn from washington excuse me at short notice because moscow feared his heavy involvement in the u.s. presidential election operation including the so-called veterans pensions ruse which we reported previously in the dossier would be exposed in the meeting his respect his replacement was andre bond Arif however he was clean in this regard the truth Mikell culligan is the head of the economics section at the Russian embassy he returned to Russia in August 2016 the BBC would go on to report the United States officials in 2016 and identified kulagin as a spy that he was under surveillance thus verifying this key claim in the dossier further reporting by McClatchy has claimed that the FBI was investigating with the culligan Callaghan played a role in the election interference mr. speaker these are facts they just scratched the surface of what we're dealing with this is what we know despite some opponents and opportunists and attempts these facts are indisputable I asked for unanimous consent to add the entire Trump Russia dossier produced by Christopher steel into the record so future generations will know the truth of how we got here today without objection mr. chairman many I'm gonna read a little bit more of the dossier and I'm gonna stay away from the scurrilous things that have been reported in the newspaper because they to me are just distractions from what we should be looking at the mechanism this is from the dossier the mechanism for transmitting intelligence involves pension disbursements to russian immigrants living in the united states as cover using counselor offices in new york miami and DC suggestion from source close to mr. trump and mr. man afford that republican campaign team happy to have russia as a media boogeyman to mask more extensive corrupt business ties to China and other emerging countries speaking confidence to Akane compatriot and late July 2016 source II an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation between them and the Russian leadership this has managed on the Trump side by the Republican candidates campaign manager Paul manna for who was using foreign policy advisor Carter page and others as intermediaries the suit two sides had a mutual interest of course in defeating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton whom President Putin apparently hated and feared inter alia source he acknowledged that the Russian regime have been behind the recent leak of embarrassing email messages emanating from the Democratic National Committee to that WikiLeaks platform attention attention source he said he understood that the Republican candidate and his team were relatively relaxed about this because it deflected media and the Democratics attention away from chumps business dealings in China and other emerging markets for the record mr. Chairman I will enter that in the record at the proper time not this evening we have a whole dossier again having nothing to do with this of every deal that we know of that the president and his team made in 52 foreign countries that will be entered into the record finally regarding Trump's claimed minimal investment profile in Russia a separate source with direct knowledge said this had not been for want of trying Trump's previous efforts that included exploring the real estate sector in st. Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the end mr. Trump had had to settle for the use of extensive other services there from local prostitutes rather than business success that's what the dossier says Trump advisor Carter page holds secret meetings in Moscow with mr. session and senior Kremlin international internal affairs official that it's dinner session raises issues of future bilateral us Russian energy cooperation and associated lifting of Western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine page was non-committal and response the vet Caen discusses the release of Russian dossier of compliment on Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton but also hints at Kremlin possession of such material on mr. Trump Kremlin the Kremlin concerned that the political fallout from the DNC email hacking operation is spiraling out of control extreme nervousness among trumps associates as a results of negative media attention accusations Russians meanwhile are keen to cool situation maintain plausible deniability of existing and ongoing pro-trump and anti-clinton operations therefore unlikely to to be any ratcheting them up ratcheting up of defensive plays offensive plays an immediate future a source close to the Trump campaign however confirms regular exchange with Kremlin has existed for at least eight years I said five years before eight years including intelligence fed back to Russia on the oligarchs activities in the United States within the context poland's priority requirement has been for intelligence on the activities business and otherwise in the US have leading russian oligarchs and their families and his associates duly had obtained and supplied that information speaking in early August 2016 - well placed at established Kremlin Wars sources outlined the divisions and backlash in Moscow arising from the leaking of Democratic National Committee emails and wider pro-trump operation being conducted in the United States the head of presidential administration Russia Sergey Ivanov was angry at the recent return at the recent turn of events he believed the Kremlin team involved led by presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov had gone too far in interfering in foreign affairs with their elephant and a china shop Ivanoff claimed always to have opposed the handling and exploitation of Intel legends by the PRT following the backlash against such foreign interference in US politics Ivanoff was advocating that the only sensible course of action now for the Russian leadership was to sit tight and to deny everything and they did continue on this theme the source close to Ivan off reported that pest golfNow was scared I will not use the derogatory term that he would be scapegoated by Putin and the Kremlin had held responsible for the backlash and so page after page mr. Ivanoff appears he's at the center of this and if we know this that mr. Muller knows this and if we know this mr. Muller knows more so this is the dossier which has been public now since early last year and I wanted to bring this to the floor last year but we chose to do it another way if you remember and trying to get the president's taxes made public so I will conclude by this mr. speaker you've been patient this is to me a big deal 83% of this dossier has been proven correct 82 I did not use anything that was dubious of the 17% and so I say to you the Congress has a right as an equal branch of government to review what has happened so that our president as mr. Schwab said shop said head of ethics in the kinetics Commission said to mr. president Trump what you need to do is cut yourself off from your assets that's what you need to do that's what you must do and obviously he did not do it so there's a lot of material out there going at it at this a year and a half is not a long time you know along the Watergate talk but I would think that this is gonna take longer than me Watergate that's my opinion on some of these things which will have to be traced some people have been indicted some people are going to prison already but I am Telling You the bulk of information is gonna be laid out when mr. Muller is ready not when I'm ready or anybody in the chamber is ready with that I yield and I thank you members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities towards the president that it that is unacceptable I did not engage in any personalities I read from the record I didn't call anybody a name if I read it it was somebody else that was writing it not me remarks in debate in the house may not engage in personalities towards the president whether originated as the members own words or being reiterated from another source the president is not above the law sir I am not above the law gentleman have a motion I'm sorry does the gentleman have a motion no I don't have a motion the gentleman is not recognized for a debate at this time well can I want me to make a motion to extend is that what you're asking me to do a chair would entertain a motion to adjourn at this time fine you have it your way I'll be back the question

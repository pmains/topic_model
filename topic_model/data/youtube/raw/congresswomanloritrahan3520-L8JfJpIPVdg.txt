hi I'm Dr James Baker and I'm a constituent of Representative Trahan and I have the honor of being her guest at the State of Union presidential address tonight here in Washington and I'm thrilled to be here with her I've worked closely with Lori for the last couple of years on a very significant Bill both for the American people and to me personally I had lost my youngest son to an opioid overdose when he was 23 we couldn't find help Lori listened to that story and asked what she could do what legislators could do so this doesn't happen to other families and over time she worked with both Democrats and Republicans and ultimately got that bill passed and signed by the president and it's going to be wonderful tonight to be in the same room with the people who agreed to that law and are going to make change for every every person who needs help with substance use disorder and it began with Lori so I'm enormously grateful to her and uh very happy to be here tonight

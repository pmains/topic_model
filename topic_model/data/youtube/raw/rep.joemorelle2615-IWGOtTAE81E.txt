one of the issues I'm most passionate about is protecting and strengthening Social Security a critical Lifeline for older adults in our nation and right here in Rochester it was 83 years ago today that Miss Ida May Fuller of Ludlow Vermont received America's very first social security check and Ida as she was known to her friends and family had been a classmate of President Calvin Coolidge and spent her career as a teacher and legal secretary following her retirement Ida visited a local Social Security office to learn more about this new program which could offer her support after she left the workforce after filing her claim in November of 1939 she received check number zero zero one on January 31st 1940. that first payment to Miss Fuller would be the start of a social contract between the United States and its citizens a commitment that we must continue to honor since its humble beginnings the Social Security program has provided invaluable support for generations of hard-working families helping them achieve stability and peace of mind in retirement sadly there are those right now in Congress who are demanding cuts to Social Security we cannot and will not make cuts to Social Security and I'm fighting every day to protect and expand this valuable program you can count on me to do my part to fulfill the promise that began with Miss Fuller 83 years ago today

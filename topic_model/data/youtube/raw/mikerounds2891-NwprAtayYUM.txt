hey mike rounds here i just got off the phone with the former governor tom vilsack of iowa he's also the former secretary of ag but tom and i were governors at the same time we've worked together on projects on a number of different occasions he is now the nominee to be the next secretary of ag i'm going to support his nomination i think he's the right guy at the right time just had an opportunity to visit with him about the future of ethanol we both agree there is a bright future that there are some challenges that i think he's committed to help us overcome he understands that you know as an additive you can run 25 30 percent corn ethanol in with a petroleum product really improve the octane and give ethanol producers a very bright future but along with that we also talked about some other things that that we should be able to do including with regard to our cattle industry he understands the need for mandatory country of origin labeling his challenge in the past has been how do we get it done how do we make it work and i shared with him um senator testers uh and my approach which is to to actually give direction to our trade reps to negotiate with canada and mexico and to include in our trade deals the mandatory of country of original labeling is going to be a part of our policy and so we're going to continue we're going to reintroduce that legislation and i think we're going to have a real ally in the secretary of ag furthermore we discussed the need for more uh locations to be able to market our products um i shared with him senator king and my bill that would expand the ability for a small beef processing plant pork processing plants states state license plants to be able to sell across state lines i shared with them some of the opposition that we had found in that some of the big guys just don't like the idea that the state-operated plants get through the red tape easier than the big boys do and they don't think that's fair but i do and i think that's the way we should move to try to give our smaller processors that are just as safe and have just a higher quality production facilities to give them an opportunity to market across state lines and i think once again we're going to have an ally in the the nominee secretary tom vilsack and then finally we talked about about the markets themselves and about creating new markets i'm convinced we can work together on a number of different issues we know that this new administration coming in is going to put a significant amount of pressure on on finding ways to address to a a climate change issue based on that and their concepts involved where we can uh help our our ag producers to find benefits i think we've agreed to work together but i do look forward to i plan on supporting uh him in in in this role and i think there's a real opportunity here for producers to grow their markets and uh along the line um i i just have to admit i warned him that uh the change back to a lotus or anything like that for our ag producers is not going to be something that anybody's going to want um i told him that i thought you know the overreach by the nrcs in some cases with wetland determinations and so forth is something that he may very well have to deal with and that we're going to continue to put pressure on a revised program to allow due process for those ag producers that find themselves in a precarious situation with wetland determinations that are made after the fact but overall a very good conversation and one that i hope to be able to continue on with him as he takes on his new role once again as secretary of ag

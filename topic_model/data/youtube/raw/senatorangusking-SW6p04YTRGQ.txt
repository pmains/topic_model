our angus King Center you you were on the Senate floor earlier today part of this huddle with Senator corker can you just explain what was going on and what the major sticking points are sure well first let me say your reporter was absolutely right the real question to be asked tonight is what tax bill Believe It or Not Anderson nobody's seen it we're gonna be voting on one of the most important votes will ever take in this body that'll affect this country for the next thirty years sometime tomorrow nobody's seen the bill to call this a circus would be an insult to circuses but let me talk about what was going on I submitted a very simple amendment that simply said send the bill back to the Finance Committee and have them report back a deficit-neutral bill a bill that doesn't blow a hole in the deficit and there were a group of Republicans that were inclined to support my amendment it threw everything into disarray a vote that was supposed to take 15 minutes ended up taking over an hour ultimately those Republicans ended up voting against my amendment but the issue is not settled by any means and as I say the amendment was very straightforward send the bill back to committee send us back one that doesn't blow a hole in the deficit and now here we are faced with you know we don't know what and we're going to be taking this big vote tomorrow but there there are so many moving parts and it would be fairly easy for them to fix this but so far they just aren't doing so so are there other options all night yeah I mean are there are other options on the table because I understand from Phil Mattingly is reporting that one option is the corporate tax rate going up after six years well that's one option and and then to complicate matters marco rubio and mike lee have an amendment to provide a more generous tax credit for children which i think is very appropriate they would bump the corporate rate up from 20 to 22% in order to pay for that so if there's there's a lot of things in play here and but but the really frustrating thing anderson is this is a bill that's never had a hearing it's never had a hearing when we did tax reform in 1986 there were 33 hearings over ten months and the bill passed the senate 90 to 10 in this case they've tried to jam it through no hearing one week of committee consideration no expert opinion from outside no ordinary citizens and here we are and as of you know whatever it is 8:30 tonight we don't still we still don't know what the bill is that the the people that are running this show don't know what the bill is so I just think it's ridiculous and what we ought to do is take a deep breath stop and try to develop a bipartisan bill which could still be done that everybody agrees I don't know about everybody but most people agree we've got to cut corporate tax rate to be more competitive and there's some other things we can do to stimulate the economy but the report that came out this afternoon boom the joint Tax Committee just blew away this argument that somehow this is going to pay for itself and so you know they're left trying to figure out how to make it whole and and I don't think they're gonna be able to do it I mean how can people in good conscience vote for a bill that that nobody has actually seen or read I mean there could be all sorts of favors to people and organizations and lobbyists inside their anderson the bangor city council wouldn't amend the leash law with a process like this i mean it's embarrassing and it's not the way the senate supposed to work i worked here as a staff member many years ago there were it was never anything like this and having bringing a bill up and rewriting it I mean Bill's always get changed and they're always complicated but the idea of having us vote on as I say I think one of the most important bills that we'll ever vote on it's going to affect every business every American our entire economy probably for the next 20 or 30 years and we have no idea how it all fits together whether it does what the unexpected consequences are I mean it's it's it's it's just a hell of a way to run a railroad what do you make of the president's comment saying that this bill quote cost him a fortune will it in your opinion well of course it's impossible to assess that because we've never seen his tax returns but the one tax return we did see from 2005 we saw a summary I think I remember my figures right he paid 38 million dollars in tax 31 million of that was because of something called the alternative minimum tax which high income taxpayers it basically says you can't deduct down to nothing and it clicks in for high income that's repealed in this bill the estate tax is repealed in the House bill and modified in this bill those two provisions I don't see how they could help but help the president now you know it's one thing for him to assert that it helps that it'll hurt him but all the evidence is to the contrary and he could solve this issue very easily by simply handing as releasing his tax returns which every president every presidential candidate for the last 40 or 50 years has done but to me for him to say it's going to hurt me that doesn't square with what we saw from his o-5 returns a strange day senator appreciate your time thank you yes sir coming up next we

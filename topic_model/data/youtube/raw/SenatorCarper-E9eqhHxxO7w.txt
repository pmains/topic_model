mr president mr president uh free uh fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy charges of unfairness are serious i think we'll all agree but calling an election unfair does not make it so charges require specific allegations and then they require proof we have neither here those are not my words those are the words of a judge on the u.s circuit court of appeals for the third circuit rejecting president trump's legal challenges to the pennsylvania election i might add a judge who was a long-time member of the conservative federalist society and was nominated to the bench by none other than donald trump mr president to 2020 presidential election was hard fought we'll all agree but the american people spoke clearly and they spoke decisively 81.2 million voters voted for joe biden 81.2 74.2 million voted for donald trump 51.3 percent of the vote went for joe biden 46.8 of the vote was for donald trump 306 electoral college votes for joe biden 232 electoral college votes for donald trump just four years earlier donald trump uh referred to that kind of outcome as a landslide for him and he lost a popular vote by three million votes but accepting the outcome of election can be difficult when our political party doesn't win we've all felt that before but calling an election unfair does not make it so more than 60 federal and state courts involving more than 90 judges many of whom were nominated by republican presidents including donald trump are all in agreement that's pretty amazing isn't it all in agreement no evidence of widespread fraud wrongdoing or other irregularities have been uncovered during the 2020 election that's a that is a victory for democracy for our democracy unfortunately some of our colleagues today ask us to do the same thing that donald trump asked of the secretary of state for the state of georgia to overturn the results of the 2020 election without specific allegations and more importantly without any proof our colleagues are asking us not to abide by the will of the people but to the bend to the will of one man one man donald trump in 1787 delegates from the 13 colonies convened in philadelphia to debate the future of what would become the united states of america our founders disagreed on a lot of things but you know they all agreed on one thing for sure they did not want a king they did not want a monarch many of them had been there done that they didn't want to see it and feel it again and they set up this intricate system of checks and balances to ensure that we would never have that all all-powerful king in this country that system of checks and balances is being pushed to a dangerous limit here today but that system will prevail along with it our democracy here are just some of the claims that donald trump and his legal team have made and that our colleagues lend credence to here today that venos venezuela cuba and china rigged our country's voting machines in favor of joe biden that dead people voted in this election and they only voted for joe biden that poll watchers and election observers who risked their lives during this pandemic to uphold the integrity of our elections that stuffed ballot boxes with biden votes and then they shredded trump votes not one let me repeat not one of these things is true there is no evidence no evidence to back up these ridiculous claims many of these absurd claims from donald trump and his legal team are nothing more than conspiracy theories circulating online this misinformation and dangerous rhetoric from the president and his allies including calls for violence have polluted our discourse and imperial imperil our peaceful transfer of power and when our colleagues show indifference to our outright support for these unsubstantiated claims and conspiracy theories they lead our nation and our constitution down a dangerous dangerous path all of us who serve here swore an oath to support and defend our constitution i swore that same oath as a naval flight officer many times to miss shipman before that but all of us here have sworn support and defend our constitution not our political party and certainly not any individual candidate colleagues for the safety of our citizens in our republic we must lead by example we must turn the temperature down it was a hard-fought campaign but the campaign is over the votes have been counted the county has been certified in all 50 states and in two weeks on january 20th joe biden and kamala harris will be sworn in as president vice president of the united states as they should be we have serious and urgent challenges that will require working together with our new president our new vice president with one another in this chamber democrats republicans independents and with our colleagues over in the house of representatives what's on our to-do list well we can start with making sure that hundreds of millions of americans get vacuumed vaccinated that we get off the dime and start vaccinating we vaccinated four million people last month 4 million we're supposed to vaccinate 20. how are we ever going to get to 250 million at this rate what else is on our to-do list we're getting our kids back to school we got kids that are unable to get on the internet unable to participate in their classes may not have any adult supervision at home they're struggling they're falling even further in fact behind we need to do something to help them what else is on our to-do list giving their parents getting their parents back to work just to name a few things i think well the millions of people lost jobs and they don't have skills anymore to fill the jobs that are needed they need our help they need to be root tooled and retrained it's time to stop trying to overturn the will of the people and get back to working on their behalf mr president abraham lincoln has been quoted a couple times here tonight but he observed at the the end of the gettysburg address that ours is quote a government of the people by the people and for the people even in the midst of the civil war president lincoln put his unfavoring weight and his unfail unfair unwavering faith in the people to chart our nation's course we would be wise to remember lincoln's words at this moment at this special moment in our nation's history we're not a government of trump by trump and for trump we're a government of the people by the people and for the people and the people have spoken the people have spoken our job here today is to listen to them i intend to do that and i trust that my colleagues will join me in doing that as well mr president i yield the floor

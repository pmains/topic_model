Susan Collins is trying to bring more attention to Alzheimer's disease but she has a lot more on her plate besides that in an interview with new centers Pat Callahan she also discusses the latest budget passed by the Senate and why she thinks republicans should stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare senator only asked you about the the hope for Alzheimer's Act what is the great need for why we need to spend more money on research here Alzheimer's has become our nation's costliest disease we're spending an astonishing 226 billion dollars a year as a society caring for people with Val Simers up 150 4 billion comes from the Medicaid and Medicare programs if the current trajectory of this disease has not changed it's expected to consume a trillion dollars by the year 2050 not to mention the human suffering bidding and currently we're only spending what 600 million on research is that pathetic million that pales by comparison to what we're spending on cancer research which is about six billion hiv/aids we spend 3 billion cardiovascular disease about 2 billion and that bad investment has produced real returns better treatments that means the prevention in some cases and that's the kind of investment that we need to have pharrell sex what's your target for spending roughly and and what are the chances of passage the target is the double the amount were spending this year and over five years to reach two billion dollars that's not a number plucked out of the air that's what an expert panel has told us we should be spending in order to take advantage of the many research opportunities that are out there and if you think about that the two billion dollars is less than 1% of what we're spending caring for people with alzheimers in addition Alzheimer's is the only deadly disease in the top 10 without a means of prevention effective treatments or a cure we really need to step up and increase the investment and what are the odds of passage I'm finding that more and more people are interested in trying to boost alzheimers spending and they understand that the research is on the cusp of really making some exciting breakthroughs that's what are our panel said last week the head of the institutes of aging told us that they're only able to fund about twelve percent of the worthwhile applications that are being submitted so there are a lot of opportunities that are being unfulfilled during the budget I offered an that set the two billion dollars as a goal now this isn't binding language but it was accepted by the Senate and it was bipartisan so you have a feeling that there's support for this in the Senate I do finding the moneys always difficult particularly in this day and age but frankly we don't find the money this is the disease that's going to continue to cause so much heartache for so many families across our nation and it literally is going to bankrupt our healthcare system

hi this is congressman bill heisinga and i wanted to give you a quick update on the latest in the debt ceiling and spending debate out here in washington i know it hasn't been a pretty process and i understand how folks can be put off by the debate but the consequences the american people could pay if we don't find a solution is too high and it requires a hard fact-based discussion of the issues after months of deliberation we finally have two plans senator harry reid finally delivered his plan endorsed by president the president earlier this week after he threatened to veto the house plans and speaker john boehner's budget control act the house of representatives second spending control plan after our cut cap and balance plan while i believe the new budget control act does not go nearly far enough in reducing spending i am supporting it because this plan reflect reflects my firm commitment to overall government spending caps and a balanced budget amendment the two main principles you all in the second district elected me to achieve i believe the most important outcome of this debt ceiling debate is to signal that our government is changing the trajectory of our spending in the long term this plan does that well not as much as i would like or as much as necessary frankly but it is another step towards reducing spending and restoring fiscal discipline to our country without tax increases and by cutting spending by more than we raise the debt ceiling more importantly after we pass this plan we have the opportunity to make history by voting for a balanced budget amendment to our constitution which i strongly believe must be passed on to the states and the american people to let them decide to let you decide whether our federal government should balance its checkbook just like we must do in michigan you know the house is negotiating a good faith by passing legislation that changes the bad spending habits that have put us in this crisis this house will continue to find opportunities to end out of control spending and improve our country's economic outlook well thank you everyone for contributing your opinions from all sides of this debate i value that input and we will continue to make sure that we communicate with you

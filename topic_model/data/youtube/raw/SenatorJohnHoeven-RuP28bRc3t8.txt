Governor Perdue it's great to see you I want to welcome you and Marion your beautiful family thank you thanks for being here and for your willingness to serve I chair the egg Appropriations Committee and so I want to express my appreciation for senator Klobuchar as question and even more I want to express my appreciation for your answer and I look forward to working with you on that very important issue also one of our former colleagues Senator Mike Johanns as you know was an outstanding Secretary of Agriculture and he visited North Dakota on several occasions and so I want to ask if in fact you would be good enough to show up and visit our farmers and ranchers in North Dakota who do a fantastic job and would love to see you what's the record senator you know I don't know but I know Jo has observed multiple occasions and you can't let him show you up so I need a commitment you're coming I look forward to surpassing my mentor I appreciate it can you build the coalition we need to build North South and Midwest to pass a strong farm bill that really works for our producers I believe we can I think in working with you all and you working on behalf of your constituents I think that we we can I think there was a great progress made in the 14 farm bill we know that we've got a couple of areas that felt left left out and we talked about those today and I think we can get ahead of that and it's even more critical today in the light of commodity prices and where they are that we get a safety net not only for our producers but also our consumers and going forward so that's the challenge I look forward to Senate for them confirmed to work with you all in providing the resources and enabling you all to get a farm bill that will be embraced by American agriculture but you agree it takes that North South Midwest coalition to get it now oh absolutely as well as our nutrition people as well do you also agree that it's the heart and the sauna you kind of are going here in your answer but the heart and soul of risk management comes down to that counter-cyclical safety net building on arc and PLC and then making sure we strongly strongly support crop insurance as a risk management - do you agree with that and do you see that as a heart and soul of risk man apparently absolutely a will run will manage will design will administered program in that I think gives farmers a lot of confidence and talked a little bit about the importance of a Gris Search you know we've talked about the importance of trade and I absolutely agree with that but AG research is making such a difference in the crops we can grow disease resistance our yields which lead to profitability talk a little bit about your willingness and this goes back to the the budget issue as well but talk about your commitment AG research you know it's interesting we talk a lot about high-tech manufacturing I would submit to the president anyone that our agricultural sector has been the highest tech manufacturing industry we've had in this country for several years the phenomenal growth and productivity with less inputs and less water and better management better soil preservation is actually phenomenal it's really it's really wonderful and the basis of that as you said is not only good basic research and our land-grant universities and others but the transmission of that information through our Extension Service as well are you committed and willing to support sugar program I have as I mentioned earlier and certainly I think you all have done a great job in the past and the in the sugar program for those who grow the beets as well as the cane I think you all they've come together with a pretty unified front and talked about trade I mean it looks to me like we're in kind of a new era and how we're gonna do trade clearly the administration likes bilateral agreements over you know the larger group agreements which which can work but really important that we that we continue to press the trade issue how do you go about doing that as AG secretary leading leading the world of agriculture I think speedily I think is because our farmers cannot cannot wait very long the TPP had been around for a while negotiated but the bilateral will take time and we just need to get about the business of selling us products so if confirmed my first stops going to be at its mr. lighthouses office door we've already discussed some of this and he he indicated me the eighty percent of what he heard have been about agriculture so I thought that was good news and we just got to get get on it and and I think you know obviously with your background is so strong and in agriculture across the board but clearly your background and your knowledge of trade it's gonna be very important that you know you're a lead player in negotiating those agreements we hope to be senator great to see you thanks for being here and for your willingness to serve

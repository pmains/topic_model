thank you Mr chairman I'd like to call up my Amendment Sil 22a72 this amendment requires that government accountability office to conduct a look-back study to see whether the bill has achieved its desired goal which is to enhance local and Regional journalism if we're going to make this big change to ensure that more money is going to Publishers we should ensure that it actually works for journalism and doesn't just uh had the the profits or the bottom line of hedge funds specifically the study would look at the impact the legislation it has on the local news the number of journalists employed the broader impact this bill has on the open nature of the internet as I reference earlier and on the ability the ability of the public to share and access news and information it's also the amendment that Senator Klobuchar referenced earlier in her comments in support I uh trusted Senator candidates and support as well Senator Padilla would you be willing to take a question yes sir we just adopted a Kennedy Amendment which is I understand it provides for a termination date of this bill in six years does your GAO re Amendment require a report to Congress seven years after the bill is signed or maybe we should adjust it to come a little earlier to be a part of that uh so at some point it's going to be a renewal extension debate so it can inform that decision at the time so would are you suggesting you're going to amend the amendment pending before us so let's submit it to five years it's our objection to the amendment on its face to five years I'm supporting his Amendment objection the amendment is amended and the question is on the adoption of the amended Amendment all those in favor say aye aye those opposed no printing the chair of the eyes have it the amendment is adopted any further amendments to be offered to this bill Mr chairman yes just uh uh I'd like to call up my Amendment Sil 22A 74. now this amendment gets to the heart of what the bill is reportedly about ensuring we have more journalists covering more local and Regional news my Amendment would have at 70 percent of the money that Publishers receive under this bill has to go to actually employing journalists I've been clear from the beginning that my biggest concern with creating an Anti-Trust exemption for news outlets is ensuring that media workers will actually benefit in any industry we know there's good and bad actors large Venture capital-backed firms like Gannett and Alden Global Capital have bought up local news outlets around the country and are scrapping many newsrooms for parts and are spending available cash not on adding to The Newsroom but on stock BuyBacks and to boost executive compensation so why should we shouldn't we excuse me why should we reward bad behavior my Amendment would guarantee that money received under this bill will go to the hard-working journalists and news employees who do the work of keeping the public informed now I've discussed this amendment with Senator Klobuchar earlier I know she committed to me and stated so publicly earlier that she's committing committed to addressing this concern I appreciate her commitment on this Dynamic of ensuring resources buttress the work of newsrooms particularly at the regional and local level and with that commitment I'll withdraw this amendment the amendment is withdrawn are there any

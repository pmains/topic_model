thank you very much and thank you for this hearing i'm saddened that we are here yet again to discuss this crisis that continues to sweep our nation affecting each and every one of our communities as a physician i treated far too many patients with substance use disorder in the emergency department many fighting for their lives just this week i heard from one of my constituents jennifer bermuda in from bermuda dunes in my district california who tragically lost her son last year stephen loza was just 18 years old and had recently graduated from high school when he died of fentanyl poisoning he should have had his whole life ahead of him unfortunately this case is not unique these tragedies cannot continue we must continue fighting for jennifer stephen and families across the country who have been afflicted by this crisis and enact policies that help prevent more suffering and unnecessary loss of life earlier this year the biden harris administration's office of national drug control policy released their drug policy priorities which included various bold approaches to reduce overdose deaths i applaud this proactive approach this this overdose epidemic is one of the most important public health issues of our time and requires urgency mr chester i'm interested in hearing about the administration progress on these priorities and more specifically what major actions has the administration taken to increase access to evidence-based treatment services since releasing its policies priorities thank you congressman um so i i'd i'd like to bring you up up to date on a few things so at the administration level the american rescue plan invested nearly four billion dollars and that was to allow hhs and samhsa resources to expand vital mental health and substance use disorder services the funding also included 30 million dollars specifically for harm reduction we know how important that is in uh in saving lives and preventing overdoses the president's fy 22 budget 41 billion dollars across the national drug control program but that's both demand reduction and supply reduction as well and that's about 670 million dollars above the fy uh 22 enacted we've also designated six new counties as part of the haida program the highly successful haida program uh we've also funded the nationwide expansion of the uh overdose response strategy for the haida which is not only law enforcement but also brings together critical public health interventions in our communities as well we met with more than 300 state local and tribal leaders from all 50 states and territories to talk about uh how they could use opioid litigation settlement dollars and focus them in the right place uh for substance use uh disorders what's going on since you mess and try we know that many and like in many other areas of health care there's marked disparities and access to substance abuse treatment for underserved communities of color rural communities and tribes so what steps has the biden harris administration take has taken or is planning to take to close these disparities to access to treatment yes congressman i would i would i would offer you two things the first one is there is never a time uh that we did that we talk about a particular policy that we don't mention state local and tribal as well and we understand the the unique aspects and the unique needs of the tribal community and the fact that substance use disorder has fallen on our tribal communities in an outsized fashion uh two things that i can offer one of them is and this was hhs released practice guidelines for the administration of buprenorphine for trading oudd we know that there's been an expansion in the provision of buprenorphine uh over the over the covid uh pandemic and that's been incredibly useful in getting more more people into treatment and the other thing we're very proud of the fact that the dea in working with ondcp lifted a decade-long moratorium on opioid treatment programs that have a mobile component that's critically important for rural and tribal communities to be able to extend treatment in areas that are traditionally over underserved and so that's two examples of of things that we're very proud of that we've done uh just within the last 10 or 11 months thank you and are these efforts uh also conducted and these outreach educational efforts also conducted in spanish i can i can get you the uh the absolute answer on that uh but what i can tell you is i just let me just talk about the drug-free communities program for a second because the drug-free communities program is entirely local their motto and they are managed through the office of national drug control policy their motto was local problems require local solutions uh and that is one that uh i'd i'd be glad to provide you some more information um on on that and it being uh culturally and linguistically focused uh because we're very proud of that program and announced 13.2 million dollars in funds just just over this past year thank you you

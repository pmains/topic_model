joining me now the one and only Andrew Clyde Congressman Ninth District in Georgia Republican he's with us now and uh what are the people that held out of the 20 to get the rules changes in Congress that are going to make a difference but uh Hey I want to con congratulate Andrew Clyde right off the bat not only for his courage but he got named to the Appropriations Committee so Congressman Clyde I'm really excited about you being on the Appropriations Committee can you shed a little light on that for us sir well thank you John I appreciate being with you this morning uh you know it's important to be on the Appropriations Committee because for one thing uh that's where the final rubber meets the road in spending and if you're ever going to control spending if you're going to control an out of control government then then the Appropriations Committee is a very very important place to be and that's one of the things you know we have phenomenal rules now that we fought for we've got to have guardrails in place to ensure that those rules are maintained and uh and abide in in are abided by so therefore we need to have conservatives on committees that will help ensure that our government is fiscally responsible and and um you know does what the American people want them to do and that is not spend over your budget so it's just very very important that we have conservatives on these types of committees that can help to put guard rails on federal spending and that's that's what we're doing here so you guys got stripped of any real leverage when the 1.7 trillion dollar Omnibus Bill got passed out from one of you before you guys got sworn in by uh the Rhinos the quizlings and the and the basically the Communists as far as I'm concerned here's my question we got a debt ceiling coming up um what leverage does that give of our movement our conservatives in Congress what leverage does that give you to say get those 87 000 IRS agents out or not do the debt sale because you know everybody's going to be running around their hair on fire going on all the networks saying that oh if we default the world is going to end we're all going to die what leverage does that provide you with Congressman Clive well well John one of the things that we put in our rules is that we will not agree to a debt ceiling increase without a plan to reduce our debt and to bring our federal spending into check and that's one of the the uh the beautiful things about our rules package I mean it's a it's a honestly I believe it's transformational in change yeah I did not come here to Washington DC uh to maintain the status quo I came to change it because everybody knows that Washington DC is broken and this rules package that we have which has a lot of phenomenal other rules attached to it like um you know some of them people think are just plain logic and I agree with them in that 72 hours to uh to read a piece of legislation before it can come to the floor for a vote um a single subject rule a bill which is phenomenal and then you have germanness attached to it which means that yes your bill has to have a single subject and then no amendments that that are added to that bill can can be anything but the single subject of the bill so you know you can't have uh you know a National Defense authorization act with a uh you know an lgbtq Community Center in New York attached as a as an earmark which is a phenomenal thing that's what we dealt with in December we will never have to deal with that again because the rules package prohibits it so but again what what happens when when the debt ceiling comes I mean everybody figures we're going to Cave because that's what we always do because the pressure gets too tough and we totally say we can't default and so we just go but one of the one of the things you guys did in the rules is you went from Pago to Cutco so what is the answer to not raising the death ceiling would be simply say hey why don't we just cut these things out of the budget and then we don't have to raise a debt I mean is that a realistic option that is a realistic option and you know cut go is a great example of it uh so we do not we are not going to raise taxes we are going to cut spending and that's the whole Focus John we came here as conservatives to ensure that our federal government stays within our financial means you know you and I don't have the ability to go and spend more than what we earn or we're going to go bankrupt and somebody else is going to come in and take everything we've got left so our federal government cannot keep spending trillions and trillions of dollars more adding more and more to our debt and the way to do that is you and you you have a balanced budget and then you start paying off that debt and that just what we have to do or we're going to be in deep Financial straights when the world economy decides that they don't want the US dollar as the as the the primary means of payment anymore and China and Russia are trying to make that happen we have to to prevent that and being financially responsible is a is the way to do it Congressman uh let's get to Brass tax right because we've all been down this road so many times and we always get let down so here's what kind of we're looking at right so the debt ceiling comes the Democrats are going to be saying hey we need to raise it we're going to default Mark Warner from Virginia is going to run around every network with his hair on fire and his suit blowing up saying it's going to be the end of the world people get people are going to starve and die right I mean I've seen this act so many times I could script it out so there's gonna be all this pressure to just raise it Kick the Can down the road do what we always do and uh if you don't raise it then uh you know there's there's going to be a logger Jam government will have to shut down or something but I I you know when you're looking at it uh in about a couple weeks the Democrats are going to have 213 votes because uh state senator in Virginia Jennifer McClellan is going to win that special easy that's deep plus 29 she's going to win so they're going to have 213 votes which means they only need five Republicans to peel off and say look I can't I can't let the debt ceiling explode and then they got their 218 and it's over how do you stop that honestly because we saw and watched the Democrats stick together 100 percent through those 15 votes right 212 for Hakeem every single time nobody left nobody did anything they stuck together how do we how do we get our our majorities stick together and not get five that peel off and go with the Democrats honestly well John you know I can't promise that that we're absolutely gonna stick together because I'm one of those 222 I'm not all 222. we just have to be able to work together and I think we showed that we can work together and I mean we got speaker McCarthy elected uh and we got a great rules package because of it and in that rules package it does deal with the debt ceiling increase and how we are going to actually uh you know approach that problem it is a problem it is one of the most difficult problems that Congress is going to have to deal with it's also the greatest point of Leverage between now and the fiscal year 24 budget in the Appropriations so so that is our leverage Point uh the debt ceiling and um and as I promised The Ninth District I'm not going to um uh vote for a debt ceiling that doesn't have a corresponding plan to reduce the debt and therefore to bring us back into fiscal responsibility ability and fiscal accountability to the American people and I think the whole Republican conference yeah I'm an optimist but I think the whole Republican conference will be United in that regard under uh under speaker McCarthy's leadership so if you get if you got 222 votes they got 213 you got to peel five off uh do you think you guys have got the spine and the resolve now to just let the government shut down until you get the cuts you want in order to get us back on some sound of on some sound footing instead of just simply raising the debt like we always do he goes McConnell is going to be saying you're going to be fighting the Rhinos in the Senate the quizlings 19 of them I mean I guess what we're asking here publicly I mean are are we going to be disappointed again or do you think you guys have have the Spy now over what happened you know you're you're 20 of you in order to hold everybody accountable and say no well I think we will not have a government shutdown because I believe the plan will be uh to pass a continuing resolution that actually reduces spending it's going to be somewhere in the 95 to 98 of what the federal government normally spends so we're going to have a spending decrease right off the bat right there and so I don't think we're going to see a government shutdown but we are going to see a reduction in government spending until we can get this this situation resolved and I think that's a good thing I think that was actually Thomas Massey's plan uh and uh we're gonna we're gonna go with it I believe

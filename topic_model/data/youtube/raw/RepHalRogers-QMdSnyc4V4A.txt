well apparently there's no investigation there just called off i'm not aware of any investigation being called officer period or in chicago period aren't you ahead of investigations yes i am you don't know of any that's been called off not to the best of my knowledge no well if anybody should know you should you're the director right yes sir has any investigation been delayed or called off investigate there have been investigations that have been reviewed but none have been called off no what do you mean reviewed reviewed to ensure that there's legal sufficiency in terms of going after the employer and has a determination been made in some of those that there's not proper information available to you to allow you to go forward i don't do not have that information offhand i'm sorry though the review is still taking place on some of these investigations i do not have that information readily available has there been any of those investigations that you have reviewed where you have said no we don't have a good case none in which we say we don't have a good case we have had somewhere we've asked for stronger evidence to go after the employer so there has been some that's been delayed or put off because of insufficient evidence possibly something insufficient evidence in terms of going after the employer or asking or requesting for stronger evidence in those cases in those cases maybe the employer was not an unscrupulous exploiter of illegals but also you knew that there were illegals working at that place surely there's cases like that right i'm sure there may be cases like that so that you know whether you know some places where illegals are illegally working right we have received information yes yes and yet you've not moved on them and american citizens tax paying american citizens out of a job looking for work or being displaced by an illegal that you know is illegal right or wrong that we have received information that may be illegal yes and you're depriving an american taxpayer out of a job trying to support his family her family from making a living being displaced by an illegal alien in the country illegally gaining the job illegally that you know the government knows is there illegally now is that good policy or not i can't address the policy i can tell us as an enforcement officer in order to make a greater impact you want to go after the employer the one who is knowingly hiring the illegal alien what about the illegal alien that's being employed illegally it once again is a comprehensive approach with the target being the employer him or herself what about the illegal employee are they not a target to you the pro they are a target but the primary target is the employer well you won't leave that that's that's the line okay

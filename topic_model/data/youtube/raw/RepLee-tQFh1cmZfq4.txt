consensus winner from Wednesday's Republican debate was Carly Fiorina the number one highlight of course was her excellent response to Donald Trump's remarks about her looks I think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr. cumson it was so clean it was so but it was it had that kind of strength that you were talking about with Jeb and I wonder like is this as much as we're talking about drafting is one way to pull back are there other folks who were just going to need to like straight up stand up in order to demonstrate their credible she had to I mean she'd Massino in the second debate she basically made it from the kiddie table from the first mate this is her first appearance on the stage with the quote unquote big boys she's the only woman on the stage there would inevitably comparisons I would imagine viewers were going to be thinking themselves okay she like michelle bachman she likes sarah palin you know if she like Hillary Clinton right so she had to hang back but also move forward and her performance was extraordinary she and whether you agree with her pricing know or not before ways the way she carried herself the way she handled herself the way she was able to get back at Donald Trump or make the comment about Jeb Bush smoking pot 40 years ago and she did it in a way where people would not say that was a shrill woman yeah cherries or if she was so very measured you know I think people are going to get sick and tired of all of these personal attack yeah I think it's going to be very important that all of the candidates realize that that's got to stop or else the one who thought the personal attacks starts talking about the real issues such as equal pay pay Family Medical Leave not that theory know it supports all the right issues but I think what's going to happen is people in labor where do you stand on all these important issues that affect our daily lives why are you going after people personally that has she did that in making that pivot to say I think the American women in America heard it yes she did what a politician's meant to do don't make it about you make it about the people yet don't you want and yet you know in that moment and then of course the thing that occurs are after the big thing that's blown up in the press around mr. Trump has been failure to stop someone from saying a series of really troubling things about the president he actually ended up tweeting about it I don't want to play the comments themselves i found really offensive but i thought would be interesting to see how mr. Trump has responded and he's clearly saying look I don't have to you know why would my responsibility to stop someone else from saying something offensive and I was like because when you do you look like a president so let me just play John McCain actually stopping someone from saying something offensive back in 08 I can't trust Obama I i have read about him and he's not he's not he's a he's an Arab he is not no no man no man no man he's a he's a he's a decent family man citizen that I just happened to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what this campaign is all about he's not thanks no that's extraordinary and what Donald Trump did I found to be horrifying number one let's assume that the president is Muslim we know he's not but let's assume that he is Muslim so what being Muslim doesn't mean jihadis being Muslim doesn't mean you hate America or does being lost by me do you want to blow up the country or it just qualifies you from being president but secondly if you want to be the leader of the greatest nation in the world and even appear or pretend you care about our Constitution why not put that person in their place out safe because it's not the American that we stand before where maybe giving Trump a little too much credit i mean you haven't remember where the Trump running for president even started this is a birther movement so although he was not about but almost to expect that he would I think it's maybe giving him a little too much credit for what his new holes here probably army in Barry Warner he absolutely could not renounce that guy first well good for you it's so important that whenever this comes up people say what's why yes what could be wrong with having an Arab or Muslim present that's important but secondly his base are the people who believe what that guy believes a significant part of his mace not the whole thing and he came into this business he began to build a following on the right with Bertha wrist hey john mccain had many of those people his base as well if he was like oh no no ma'am yeah you are not let me show you let me show you what what on what leadership is wes integrity and he has he did have a different base yea once again Donald Trump first of all it is is speaking to people who again are fearful of others mm-hmm secondly I believe that Donald Trump doesn't even understand religious freedom religious pluralism in our country as its basic central tenant is a country that values all religions and for him not to take a stand as John McCain tend to be tells me and tells the public that he really doesn't get it in terms of our religious diversity and if he really I mean is that leadership right family the answer's no that's not a lead right that was the point we like but he always talks about wall takes in the slings and arrows and you have to take them in that moment we come back we're going to talk about whether or not dr. ben Carson boosted his campaigns prognosis

for those who have served and for those who are willing to serve the one thing we can do in the Congress is passed the two pieces of legislation necessary to support that service you know today less than unlike World War two unlike past many past conflicts less than one-half of one percent of the population serves in the military so the other 99.5 percent need to stand up and do what we can to be sure that our military is the best supported military in the world we never want an American soldier sailor Airman marine person in the Coast Guard the National Guard the reserves to be in a fair fight we always want them to be in an unfair fight where they have advantages in that fight and the only way you can ensure that they have those advantages is to have the training dollars to have the equipment dollars to have the command structure that allow that to happen and so you know for 59 straight years the Senate has passed the National Defense Authorization Act this is the act that defines what the Congress believes should be the guiding principles for the military for that year the the places where money should be invested the equipment that should be bought the other changes that need to be made and then the other bill we passed is the appropriations bill that takes that authorization bill and really puts the money by it that allows it to happen so for 59 straight years the only authorization act we pass every year and I think we can have a real good debate as to why it that's the most important of what we do it's the most important thing the federal government does we've done that but we can't seem to get it done this year that bill that bill that has the biggest pay raise for people in the military in a decade is somehow been being negotiated since roughly June the 27th of this year this should have been a week evert not a weeks and months efforts that bill has money in it that that it that direction that encourages spouses so when somebody is assigned to a new base the spouse can go to work doing what they do as quick as they could possibly do it facilitating and expediting state certification we just had our first military spouse sworn in as a member of the Missouri bar in January her husband had come to take a command position at Fort Leonard Wood the first week she was in Missouri she was able to be sworn in to the Missouri bar and go to work and whether it's a therapist or a teacher or a truck driver or an electrician or an or an engineer or a welder if you've got those skills and you followed your spouse to a new assignment we should make that a top priority so that's what happens in these bills it supports the Readiness Center in Springfield Missouri it supports the vehicle maintenance facility at Whiteman Air Force Base the c-130 flight simulator and Rosecrans all those things we decided as a Senate need to happen now we need to side as a Senate and a congress how to make them happen whether it's 24 fa-18 super hornets the Navy wants that will be built in st. Louis Missouri or 15 f-15s for the Air Force these things don't happen unless they're authorized let's get them authorized let's appropriate the money we're already weeks late we don't need to be months late better to have the money the day you're supposed to have it if you're going to spend it as wisely as we'd hope you'd be able to spend it so I joined my colleagues today and I know you mr. president saying that we need to get this work done it's critical it's a priority and I'm glad to join my colleagues here on the floor fighting for those who fight for us

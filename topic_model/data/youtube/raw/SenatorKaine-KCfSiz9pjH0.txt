Virginia Senator Mark Warner called sequestration stupidity on steroids sequestration was set up to be so stupid that no rational group of people would ever let it happen yet it's happening Virginia senator Tim Kaine singled out Congress in general and House Republicans in particular insisting they are the one standing in the way of a solution it is on us we've got to show a willingness to listen to each other and compromise and it is my strong strong hope that the members of this committee that the members of the Senate will eventually convince the house that that is the right way to proceed

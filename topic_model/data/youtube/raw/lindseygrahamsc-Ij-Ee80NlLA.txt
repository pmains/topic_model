again from Fox News in Washington NSA leaker Edward Snowden is on the move today with the US seeking Snowden's extradition Hong Kong authorities allowed him to leave the country reportedly on a flight to Moscow and Russian news agencies say he's booked on a flight from Moscow to Cuba on Monday joining us now to discuss the Snowden case and the split inside the GOP over immigration reform are two leading Republicans Senator Lindsey Graham is a member of the gang of eight that is leading the push for reform Senator Mike Lee opposes the legislation and he is the author of a new e-book why John Roberts was wrong about health care we should also point out both are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee gentlemen let's start with Edward Snowden senator Graham what do you make of Hong Kong excuse me Hong Kong authorities allowing Snowden to go they say that our extradition papers were not in full compliance with their law and what leverage do we have over Moscow what they decide to let him go to another country well I'd like to find out why our papers were not in compliance that would be a big mistake by the Department of Justice well I I don't think he's a hero I believe he hurt our nation he compromised a national security program designed to find out what tariffs were up to so the freedom trail is not exactly China Russia Cuba Venezuela so I hope we'll find chase him to the ends of the earth bring him to justice and let the Russians know there will be consequences if they Harbor this guy well I was going to ask you about that because the key decision over the next 24 hours has to be made by Moscow senator Graham should we put pressure on the right now hold him there absolutely they want to be part of the world community WTO they want a good relationship the United States they should hold this felon and send you back home for justice senator Lee are we basically helpless here as ed Snowden thumbs his nose at the United States with the help of the Chinese and now apparently with the help of the Russians and what if he goes to another country whether it's Cuba or Iceland or some place in South America yeah I don't know if I would use the word helpless Chris but we are in a precarious position here but I think mr. Snowden is also look I've made no secret about the fact that i've got some concerns about much of what the NSA has been doing but I think mr. Snowden is delusional if he thinks that he's going to find a country with a better human rights record in in Moscow or in Havana or in Caracas I think he's in for a rude awakening if that's what he has in mind so what does it tell you if fed Snowden is headed to one of those countries rather than the u.s. I it tells me that if he's looking for a place with a better human rights record than the United States he's certainly not going to find it in any of those countries all right gentlemen let's turn to immigration reform which reason we invited you here in the first place with the addition of more than 40 billion dollars in new border enforcement will the Senate this week pass comprehensive immigration reform and if so how many votes senator Graham let's start with you the bill will pass I think we're on the verge of getting 70 votes that is my goal has always been my goal we're very very close to 70 votes the Hoeven cork or amendment I think gets us over the top and we're going to talk in detail about that in just a moment but let me ask you for a general prediction also senator Lee I know you're opposed to this legislation but do you agree that it's going to pass with a very wide majority something like somebody votes I think it is likely to pass and I think it may well be along the margin senator Graham suggested and you know look the sponsors of this bill had the best of intentions in my opinion the best of intentions aren't enough when you're dealing with a 1200 page bill that they promised us that under this bill illegal immigration would be a thing of the past it won't CBO told us this week that 10 years from now we'll still have six to eight million illegal immigrants in this country they told us that it would be tough but fair and it's neither it's not tough on those who have broken the law and it's not fair to those who've been patiently waiting their turn in line to come to this country legally and perhaps worst of all Chris we learned late Friday just late Friday that they're going to replace the entire gang of eight bill of on a thousand pages with a 1200 page to corker-hoeven amendment that this is a provision that very few people have read and even fewer fully understands so look we all want immigration reform but this bill is not the right vehicle for getting there all right well let's talk about this amendment which has apparently changed the calculus and added 10 to 15 more Republican votes it's being called the border surge amendment let's take a look specifically at what it would do double the number of border agents to 40,000 complete 700 miles of new fencing deploy drones radar and ground sensors full implementation of eve arif I for employers and beefed up entry exit tracking for people on visas senator Lee it is your problem that you don't think even with this forty billion dollars in extra border and forth but you still don't think it's going to work where is your problem the sequencing the idea that it's going to allow a provisional legal status for the 11 million people immigrants were already here before you get all of this border enforcement in place as a proponent of immigration reform my problem has always been with sequencing and with the fact that it's not a good idea to try to attack the entire problem at once that's how you end up with a 1200 page bill and with the sequencing of this bill in particular we have to look at the fact that the pathway to citizenship begins basically on day one but it will take many many years if not decades to fully implement all these border security measures senator Graham you say that that many of the Republicans who are opposed to talk about border security they really just don't favor a path to citizenship but the Congressional Budget Office and this is something that Senator Lee just pointed out the congressional budget office said that your gang of eight bill would only reduce illegal immigration by twenty-five percent they're talking about the entry/exit problem forty percent of the people who are here legally overstayed their visas there will be improvements in that area as to the border we practically militarized the border I've been hearing for years less secure the border let's regain our sovereignty we have secured our border in a way I could not have imagined four or five years ago this whole border security amendment I think is the most aggressive attempt to control the southern border and regain our sovereignty this bill reduces our deficit by eight hundred and ninety billion dollars it is good for our economy this bill is good for our national security no one can get a green card until the border security measures are up and running until I verifies up and running controlling a job in America as to the 11 million they will have an earned hard pathway to citizenship they have to get in the back of the line before they can become a citizen they can't cut in line they have to pass to English proficiency exams I reject the idea of becoming the Mideast or your you have 11 million people with a legal status who can't be part of America America is different than the Mid East and Europe a flourish unum out of many one this is a good solution for our national security for our economy and tough practical solution to 11 million and most importantly if we do this bill amnesty is the status quo if we do this bill there will be no third wave of illegal immigration let me ask you about another objection that Senator Lee just mentioned the idea that this is going to be some huge 1200 page bill I heard you complain about that hearing Obamacare the idea that you have this huge bill that nobody is read and why not take it in more incremental bite-sized pieces why not in this case well let's look at it this way give the Republicans all the border security warning although the legal immigration you won't entrust the Republicans to deal fairly with 11 million that's not going to sell to a Democrat and I sure as hell not going to accept an agreement where they get legalization on a pathway to citizenship then they give me border security then they give me legal immigration reform you have to do it together we have tied border security and legal immigration reform to green card status until we secure our border until we get the legal immigration reform in place you can't get a green card which would put you on citizenship status we've tied the two together that's the only way to do this I've been dealing with it since two thousand five and six and this is a great solution for our economy and our national security and I'm very proud of this bill even if the Senate passes immigration reform this week it still has to go on to the house and senate early you have said that it will be dead on arrival in the house house republicans are talking about the kind of incremental approach that I know you favor let's deal with enforcement first and after that we can deal with the 11 million illegals who are in this country let's take a look at something's John Boehner said its border security and confidence that we've got the border secured before we begin to get out this path of addressing both illegal immigration issues and the illegal immigration issues but senator Lee lindsey graham says and i must say a lot of democrats say that'll kill the legislation they're not going to accept border enforcement first and then a promise of dealing with legalization the 11 million people who were already here afterwards well that's what they've said that's what they want to be the case the the fact is I think the house representatives has it right in any event the House of Representatives has said border security first and they're doing exactly the right thing they're dealing with this in the right sequence the House Judiciary Committee passed out of committee this week two of security measures two things to bring about robust immigration reform and a step-by-step process and I think that's the approach we ought to be taking what's making this contentious what's making it politically divisive is that the Senate gang of eight has insisted on wrapping all these issues up into one 1200 page bill that's what's making it to visit because they're putting the single most controversial confrontational issue that of amnesty and ultimate citizenship into a 1200 page bill all right gentlemen we got about two minutes left and I want you to split it evenly if you will there's a lot of needless to say a lot of politics and all this President Obama pushed for passage of the Senate this week as weekend media address take a look that's what comprehensive immigration reform looks like stronger enforcement a smarter legal immigration system a pathway to earned citizenship a more vibrant growing economy that's fair on the middle class senator Graham is President Obama doing enough to push this and if Republicans are seen whether in the Senate unlikely or in the house much more likely as stopping this comprehensive immigration reform what will be the political fallout as the GOP tries to reach out to Hispanic voters well President Obama has been better on immigration than senator Obama senator Obama started doing the union's bidding and took help take the bill down in two thousand six and seven every time we've asked him to do something he has really come through but when he does things on his own even this time around has been pretty much a disaster coming out of the White House as to the Republican Party here's my my firm belief america is not divided on this mike seventy percent of Americans including Republicans to support an urn pathway to citizenship over a 13-year period where you get in the back of the line learn our language and pay a fine so to the Republican Party this is a chance to improve our economy reduce the deficit by eight hundred ninety billion dollars to get border security you'll never see in your lifetime to regain our sovereignty and if it if it fails and we are blamed for its failure our party is in trouble with Hispanics not because we're conservative but because of the rhetoric and the way we've handle this issue I want to get reattached of the Hispanic community cell conservatism pass comprehensive immigration reform and grow this party the party's got to be bigger than you toe and South Carolina the Hispanic community is very close to our values but we have driven them away over this issue let's fix this problem for the good of the country and for the good of the party and this bill does that my friend senator Lee let me pick up on what senator Graham just said to you Mitt Romney got only twenty-seven percent of the Hispanic vote back in November 50,000 new Hispanic citizens become reach voting age every month in this country if you're party is seen as as killing immigration reform aren't you going to pay a price without of the polls for decades to come well look if we turn immigration reform into a political football everyone loses Chris we all know that we've learned that from the past we don't want to have to learn that their hardware in the future what the American people want is they want to make sure that our borders secure and they want to make sure that we fixed our legal immigration process especially before we go legalizing much less granting citizenship to 11 million people treating all of them the same regardless whether they overstayed visas or crossed in illegally in the first place we have to remember at the end of the day that CBO told us early this week that this will be bad for wages it'll be bad for unemployment this is not the right solution senator lay senator Graham thank you both thanks for joining us today to talk about all this and we'll watch what the Senate does this week thank you gentlemen thank you thank you

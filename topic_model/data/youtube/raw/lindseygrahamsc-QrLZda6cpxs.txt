this is committee senator it's good of you to join us if you were able to hear what Jay Carney said there do you agree that no one in the administration has been blocking anybody from testifying well he needs to call the State Department I wrote a letter weeks ago asking the state department to provide the names of the five security officers who were involved who were responsible for providing protection at the consulate in Benghazi I got a letter back yesterday saying that they're not going to be provided the names won't be provided to me or Congress because they're worried about the identities of these people being compromised and there's an ongoing FBI investigation well number one we can interview these people without revealing their identities and this is not a crime we're trying to solve we're trying to get to the bottom of a national security disaster so Jay Carney called the State Department and get them to change their mind about telling me that these witnesses will not be made available Gregory Hicks the who was the number two State Department official in the country that night says he was trying to get the Defense Department to scramble fighter jets to at least overfly the compound and make some noise maybe scare some people off the administration seems to have indicated that that would have been sort of a breach of international protocol will circulate a Pakistani airspace to get Osama bin Laden well I tell you that's a ridiculous excuse and the idea they couldn't get there in time is puzzling because they did not tell us when they attack the consulate how long the attack would last so I asked Dempsey and Panetta at the time you were made aware of the attack on the consulate did you know when it would be over this could have went four days so the idea they didn't scramble the Jets because they couldn't get there in time defies common sense and if this is the excuse given we don't want to violate interspace that's ridiculous I'd hate to be serving in some volatile region of the world if that's going to be our American policy because nobody will ever have you back you've been one of the voices in that building the Capitol building railing about what's gone on here Fox News has done a significant amount of reporting but but other outlets have not now all of a sudden it's on page one of the Washington Post and other papers today the fact that Gregory Hicks account is going to be told to Congress are you pleased that this story is finally getting some legs yeah not for me but for the people who lived through the debacle called Benghazi a CBS has done a pretty good job particularly cheryl atkinson and bob schieffer but the reason i want the information to come out is because america needs to hear the truth about what happened in Benghazi and what Washington was telling the American people about Benghazi did not reflect the truth of what happened on the ground it was seven weeks before an election I think they were jealously guarding the narrative that al-qaeda was on decline bin Laden was dead we're all safer in Benghazi destroyed that narrative and it's time for the people who live through Benghazi and the families of those who died to hear the truth it was a terrorist attack from the very beginning and the excuses is why they couldn't be reinforced really don't make sense and we're going to get with old people accountable the goal is to hold people accountable in a in an appropriate way and what if it turns out that those two former Navy SEALs Tyrone woods and Glen Doherty who were killed in the second wave of attacks at the annex what if it turns out that that their lives might have been saved by some kind of a quick response well what if it turns out that Benghazi was a death trap and should never been open and Secretary Clinton and the higher-ups in the State Department ignored warnings for months I think that's important what does it mean not to have any military assets available and if if they were assets available what does it mean to be told there were none available we being misled here so yes we want to know could it been prevented the families need to know the circumstances of how their loved ones died those who are in harm's way the American people need to know that they were under attack by Al Qaeda groups not by a riot generated by video that had nothing to do with this the truth matters in times like this and we also need to understand is our foreign policy working is this light footprint leading from behind outsourcing to non-existent government's so because you don't have a large American presence is it working I would suggest it live is Exhibit A that our foreign policy in the Mideast is not working a lot of questions yet to be answered perhaps we will start getting some answers tomorrow at those hearings senator losing one last thing I hope there's some bipartisan desire to get to the truth here because they should be bipartisan desire to find out what happened to these people and why the story told them Washington this was so wrong that's a very important point Senator Lindsey Graham thank you thank you

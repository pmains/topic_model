I want to bring in congresswoman Karen bass a Democrat from California congresswoman good evening to you good evening you think Kelly Sadler needs to be held accountable for her comments or at the very least as a White House need to issue an apology well I think all of that I think she needs to be held accountable I think she needs to make an apology but I think the chief of staff as well as the president need to be held accountable I think her comments need to be viewed in the context of the culture that we all know about this White House you know we started this week with the first lady urging all of us to be best and and it's ending with the White House staffer a White House staffer dismissing John McCain's opposition to to John McCain's opposition to CI a-- director nominee gina haskell saying he's dying anyway i mean she she needs to take that message to the Oval Office that's where that needs to go go on talk to me more about that well I mean I think you know for her to have the press conference for her to say that you know she's launching this program in this effort and I think it's noble I think it's fine but I do think that she needs to challenge the very culture that she's in with within the White House she also has a whole effort effort on cyberbullying and the number one cyber bully in the United States is her husband the President of the United States so I think that there's a lot of work that she could do on the home front that would help us all congresswoman the former Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on those comments today and he said that people have wondered when decency would hit rock-bottom with this administration it happened yesterday given the White House white-ass trail of disrespect towards Jon and others this dapper is not the exception to the rule she is the epitome of it what do you make of those remarks well I think his remarks are right on point but I really do think that the entire focus should not be on the staffer that staffer is wrong she should apologize she probably should be fired but having said that we really have to look at the overall picture I mean look at what the chief of staff said this week about immigrants he has a long history of making just very inappropriate insensitive and sometimes dishonest comments it doesn't it starts at the top at the top though the president criticized John McCain remember I prefer heroes that that are not captured repeatedly he ridiculed a long list of women immigrants a disabled reporter so that's at the very top well absolutely and you know I really do think her comments were sad I mean all of us you know understand that McCain is a hero and we're all watching him suffer and go through this illness and the idea that somebody would kick you when you're down like this is just completely unacceptable but I do have to say it's consistent it's what we've seen from day one it was the way he launched his entire campaign so none of us should really be surprised

all right Beijing ramping up its efforts to sow division among Americans because get this a new report well fake text messages social media posts about a national lockdown ordered by the president were amplified by Chinese operatives in an apparent effort to widen deep political polarization in the u.s. it's just like we have been saying and I guess the person that was way ahead of the curve about warning about China was President Trump because China needs to be held accountable for their lives for their deceit for their cover up for their endless propaganda and division that they're trying to create here remember China they restricted travel inside of their own country either in and out of Wuhan province couldn't travel to any other part of China or to Wuhan if you were in another part of China but they left the world wide open and vulnerable to international travel out of Wuhan privacy province they knew the severity of this they protected themselves and they exposed the rest of the world they muzzled whistleblower doctors they even cornered the market for key medical supplies and hoarded them and as we reported last night even worse they're now price gouging on top of every other evil and horrific thing that they did in this process thankfully the president he's taking aggressive actions to keep Americans safe here and abroad when it comes to Beijing or any other rogue actor around the world like for example tonight Iran as the president announced today he has instructed the US Navy to shoot down and destroy any Iranian gunboats that are harassing American ships following an encounter in the Persian Gulf last week and now compare that with the let's say failed appeasement policies of Biden Obama they're the guys that dropped 150 billion in cash and other currency and the tarmac to the Iranian mullahs shouting death to America death to Israel burning our Flags burning Israel's flag weakening America's standing in the world and still chanting death to America and just breaking tonight Iran reportedly launched a military satellite into orbit thought to be of significance since it uses the same technology to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile President Trump he's made it clear Tehran will always be held accountable for their rogue behavior and he's not gonna soften his stance with America's enemies and with reaction author of the book stealth war General Robert Spaulding along with congressman from the great state of Florida himself back gates general Spaulding let's first talk about this military effort you got these little boats out there I've always worried about the Straits of Hormuz although interestingly less strategically important to the US now than ever before because of our the president's decision to make us energy independent but how do you respond when they're harassing our ships in those narrow Straits or elsewhere well I think the president is right to use a bully pulpit of the presidency you know when you go back to the the general that for the IRGC that was taken down in Iraq it really provides a level of deterrence to the Iranian forces you know we don't want to have another call where one of those boats maybe has explosives comes in and really kills sailors and damages our ship so I think it's important that we created a turn effect I think the president talking about it really reminds the Iranians that they need to keep their distance Matt Gaetz let's go back to Florida we just had governor de Santos on we see these numbers in Florida you and I discussed this privately we were both very concerned about the elderly population a lot of people retire in your state in your district and and you are acutely aware of this hyper very very sensor just focus on the elderly population in particular it seems to by these numbers be paying off big-time history will judge governor DeSantis very favorably for focusing our efforts on those who are vulnerable dr. Burks recently said that Florida had a contact tracing system that was a model for America and that's precisely the type of technology we'll have to have to get people back to work as it relates to Iran Shawn the United States doesn't seek a war with Iran such a war would certainly be lost by Iran but the winner would undoubtedly be China and under president Trump's doctrine we're not going to gage in endless Foreign Wars but we will take out terrorists and so the message is very clear to any Iranian official that would engage in terrorism either get your act together or get prepared to meet general Soleimani oh that's a good line to die general I think the military effort is clear we learned that when the president removed the handcuffs the rules of engagement from the Biden Obama appeasement error and literally wiped out the Caliphate in Syria they just bombed the hell out of them there were no restrictions we'd have to wait for them the fire first the Iranians you would think would know by now that this president means what he says well I think they're they're clearly grasping it and I think it's good for the president to remind them to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to remind them that if they do things that there would be repercussions you know it you're correct in that we haven't always done that in the past and it's good to see this president actually stand up and take action and then back that up with words because words from his presidency can actually be a deterrent it's not gonna be hard Matt Gaetz to take out those those gunships that they've they're using to taunt our our American sailors our American flagged tankers that are in the region I don't think that American blood should be used to avenge foreign oil or foreign vessels but where Americans are in danger the president has been very clear that he will respond and again I appreciate the fact that the Trump doctrine is one that does not seek to engage us in yet another forever war but we take action swiftly and we reset deterrence we've done this not only with Iran we've also done it with Syria president Trump drew a red line and actually abided by that and delivered consequences and so Iran better get their act together because I think this president means what he says and he certainly put the word out that he's not going to tolerate that behavior against our interests all right thank you both for being with us

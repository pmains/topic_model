well he's the man who was reignited the investigation into the Benghazi scandal I said what's going on he said uh we're getting attacked and I said how many and he said they're all over the compound and I shocked I didn't know what to say and I said if I just keep fighting I'm on my way there was a British survivor Morgan Jones is his name and reputation are now under attack who is trying to keep him quiet and the other survivors as well Senator Lindsey Graham choices right now live good morning to you senator good morning all right you were on this program last week and you said you were going to hold up any of the president's appointments until you got the opportunity to talk to some of these survivors right give us an update or make it a little bit of progress the CIA is allowed a few of the survivors to be interviewed the contractors working for the CIA to be interviewed by the Intelligence Committee that's coming up had a good discussion with the FBI director now why don't want to talk to the survivors there are about six or seven Department of State people at the consulate when it was attacked did they ever indicate to anyone that there was a protest and if the people on the ground never said it was there was a protest they always called it a terrace attack where did the White House come up with a story about a protest and I also would like to talk to survivors did they ever ask for help to reinforce the consulate before the attack and how many times did they ask for reinforcements that night you know the one thing I think America needs to hear did they believe that their government was going to come to help them when it when they were under attack and when they found out their government was not coming to their aid how did they feel we need to hear it from them great senator you wrote a letter to the White House and they responded back on october twenty eighth what was their response take i've written a letter to the President and to Secretary of State twice all I want is I'm not trying to solve a crime here I'm trying to find out did the people on the ground during the attack ever say it was a protest did they ask for security weeks or months before the attack and who turned them down how can I go to the families and tell them that I know the story of Benghazi when we can't talk to the survivors and here's the big story Benghazi how did Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama miss the rise of al-qaida in Libya when they were told constantly al-qaeda flags are flying over Benghazi how did this administration miss the fact that al-qaeda was coming back in Libyan eventually killed for Miriam well we're learning more and more the president is very good at saying I don't know I don't know what's worse he really doesn't know or he's just saying he doesn't know tell me what's significant about this guy who used the pseudo name Morgan Jones being outed in the washington post as he comes forward with a different version of the reality on the ground that night yeah this is huge he was in charge of the Libyan guard force and he said to 60 minutes and the guard force was ill-equipped and not trained and they could not protect the consulate and he told people in the system that he also said that the militia group that the State Department was counting on to defend the consulate in case of an attack was infested with al-qaeda so he really does destroy the narrative and creates an ominous scenario he said he told that two people in the system the Americans till he got tired of hearing himself talk and now he also said he went to the compound and he found Chris Stevens his body at the hospital the State Department leaked an instant report to the Washington Post where there's no mention of him going to the compound or going to the hospital trying to impeach his story that he gave to 60 minutes but what the State Department did not release is that he was interviewed by the FBI on two separate occasions where he claims they've told the FBI that he went to the compound he found Chris Stevens his body at the hospital this is a big deal you can't use part of the file to impeach a person who's critical of the way you acted and withhold the rest that's why I want all the information because what they're doing here President Obama said if you like your your policy you can keep it well that turned out to be not true they said there was a protest not a terrorist attack that turned out not to be true this White House has a bad habit of telling stories that's not true that are politically beneficial he imagine if we knew ball these things before the election can you only imagine and this is very important the idea that the Congress cannot independently interview the witnesses after they've been interviewed by the executive branch is a bad precedent and that would stop oversight as we know it we can't let this become the way you do business in the future well it sounds like finally some of the guys are going to be talking in that's good news Senator Lindsey Graham keep on this and we thank you very much for joining us today thank you

mr. president I'm honored to come to the floor today and join my colleagues to support the nomination of Judge Neal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States judge Korsak is an example an exemplary pic from my home state of North Dakota and also for our nation as a whole he's shown deep respect for the Constitution as a strong record of upholding the rule of law if confirmed judge corsets will take the seat that was held by the late Justice Antonin Scalia of course filling that vacancy will be no easy task Justice Scalia was a brilliant legal mind who had earned the respect of many in the legal community during his nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court he was a true defender of the US Constitution and sought to protect it so that future generations of America of Americans could live and thrive in a free society his legacy on the court will influence American jurisprudence for generations to come if there is anyone who is worthy of filling Justice Scalia shoes it is judgment courses like Scalia judge Gossage has is an original list when it comes to interpreting the Constitution I had the pleasure of meeting with with judge Gossage last week to discuss his nomination I'm confident that he will make an excellent justice mr. president if you look at his background it is clear that he's he is an incredibly qualified nominee after receiving degrees from Columbia Harvard and then Oxford judge korsak's went on to clerk for notable Supreme Court justices Byron white and Anthony Kennedy before entering private practice after ten years of private prac practice corsets began his career in public service as a deputy associate attorney general at the United States Department of Justice in 2006 he was nominated by George Bush the United to the United States Court of Appeals for the tenth circuit and it was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate let me repeat that he was confirmed unanimously by this body I believe that says a lot about Judge gorvich as a candidate in a body that is so often divided a candidate that can receive you nana's unanimous support is truly noteworthy when nominated by the president judge Gossage said quote a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands and quote various tenure on the Tenth Circuit he has demonstrated fair and prudent judgment in his opinions in addition to his impressive professional background judge Gossage has roots as a westerner and will bring those roots and a much-needed perspective to the Supreme Court because decisions that come from the court affect the lives of Americans from across the country it's important that the court is comprised of justices from different regions of the country it's critical that our next Supreme Court justice has familiarity with the challenges Western and Midwestern states like my home state and other states issues such as states rights Second Amendment rights land-use disputes and the complex relationship between state and tribal governments these are the everyday realities that we face across this country that the justices must deal with I expect many of these important issues to come before the Supreme Court in the coming months in fact just yesterday the court decided to move forward on litigation regarding former President Obama's waters of the u.s. rule also known as wotus which has had a significant burden some impact on farmers and ranchers and threatens the constitutional role of the state's judge corsets background also makes him a prominent voice for Indian country as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee ugly that's important for our next Supreme Court justice they have a concrete record of respecting tribal sovereignty I was pleased to learn that he is there in the support of a number of Native American groups including the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights fun judge Gossage has a long history of handling cases that affect Native Americans from his time on the Tenth Circuit he's demonstrated a consistent understanding of the unique legal principles involved in federal tribal law the boundary between state and tribal authorities is often ambiguous yet judge Gossage was able to bring clarity as he diligently studied the law and respected existing precedence in tribal sovereignty for example the ute tribe of Utah has been engaged in legal battles with the state over the state's authority to prosecute Native Americans on tribal land judge Gossage has consistently ruled in favor of tribal sovereignty in hydro resources versus epa que a sandwich EPA overreach was redefining the boundaries of Indian lands judge Garr such overruled EPA's interpretation and respected the current tribal boundaries mr. president for all these reasons I urge a yes vote on judge Garcia's nomination was the highest court in the land the decisions have a widespread impact on millions of Americans in the stakes are this high is necessary that we confirm someone with a sound fair and prudent approach to the law I have no doubt that Judge course which is the right person for this role enthusiast enthusiastically support his nomination and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same

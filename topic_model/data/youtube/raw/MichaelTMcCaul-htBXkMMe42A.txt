Congress knew Michael McCaul too busy man he's the chairman of the committee on homeland security is charged with keeping us all safe from terrorist attacks he also sits on the committee of foreign affairs making sure we have good relations are in Laura and in represents the 10th District of Texas making sure his constituent needs are always taken care of here in Washington but all of us know congressman McCaul is much much more than that to us in Congress the chocolate cancer canopy has no stronger champion when it comes to securing more funding for research to get another drugs for our children and providing support for the children but survived no one has done more or for a cottage show us all and if that isn't enough we're all thrilled the congressman recall the co-chair of the childhood cancer caucus has just taken the lead in drafting and about to introduce the charming cancer star act then important bill to support child cancer let me take this one minute to thank the ND Taylor my heart hasn't slept all week for moving to getting ready for this to discuss our issues and to help us find solutions with the congressman he has got above the bottom young misogynistic chopping cancer a personal mission along with the congressman he is an integrated integrity Huntsman and do you want you to know how much we all admire and respect you as well I'd like to take a moment to present you with a card from Rex Ryan who is from your district it was unable to join you today to be if a stage 4 neuroblastoma survivor and he wants to make sure that people voting rights yeah yeah um congressman can be efficiently represent the Tenth Circuit of Texas but to all the room and the survivors were childhood cancer families and friends we consider you to be our constant on behalf of the entire childhood cancer community thank you for always working in honor and memory and in defense of all children with cancer yeah I'm usually not like John Boehner and I start crying that tough homeland security guy on TV but wow thank you so much really means a lot and we've all worked so hard in this issue and I see so many familiar faces and have their parents and survivors I do also want to thank Andy Taylor new is really the force the genius behind everything you do is so committed to the cause I know all of you are as well I have five teenagers at home so you can imagine the home weight security issues I have someone asked me you know that there's between a teenager in the terrorist I said what's that some more you can ago she a terrorist yeah but I'm reminded as I look at them how fortunate I am and when I started this cause I'm almost a decade ago they were much younger and how fortunate I am that that they were not stricken by this horrible disease that we know is his childhood cancer but I know many of you out there have been hit with this horrible disease my job as chairman of Homeland Security is to protect the American people but I can't think of a better cause than this to protect our children I just want to under most of you for these stats I didn't want to go over I think they're worth repeating over and over again by the way the same vulgar foundation let me shave my head it's only going t be every now and then that incident but that may be good cause I would say why I shaded that over 15,000 children diagnosed with this every year each and every year and as you'll know it's a leading diseased killer of children in the United States I think that's that one really speaks volumes as to why we're here we want to conquer this disease so that future generations don't have to deal with what you're dealing with here in the room what you have done with two-thirds of the survivors this is a lot of people of people you know think once you survived the issues over and it's not it's really just begun they suffered from late effects of their disease or treatment including secondary cancers and organ damage and a whole host of other problems associated with that and then finally my four percent the NCIS budget goes the pediatric cancer research that one is really shameful because when you look at the investment and the outlay of years in the future why aren't we putting the word of that research dollars into protecting our children and saving their lives when we have people start with cancer all different types my father died from cancer but with a shorter lifespan ahead of him these children has such a great life span ahead of them and we need to do better than four percent it loves did you know that creating go back was an experimental piece of legislation that was not easy to pass that took a lot of hard work pounding on doors and lobbying and bringing young and childhood cancer survivors to lobby members of Congress Andy works at very heart of this many of you in the room nancy goodman had the sort of genius idea of the creating affect the which was passed but better than that we demonstrated that it actually works and i'm really proud to say it's not we did a lot of things in Washington billion amount to nothing and a lot of bickering and fighting over this and that but I can't think of anything more rewarding than passing a bill that i can think about then we can all think about that actually saves lives as a result of the creating coat back now we have the first neuroblastoma during a fruit so little Rex Ryan I saw him at Dell Children's Hospital Boston where I live where the clinical trial took place he's a little cute little three year old blonde here boy full of energy a visitor with his parents and yet a sea to see that in the see him alive we're without this drug he certainly would not have survived man I can't tell you how powerful and experience that is far more than probably anything I've ever done as a member of Congress this will be up for reauthorization to make it permanent in the the Cure's Act which will be a must-pass legislation bill you know ever since the craneeno packed this neuroblastoma is only the second fda-approved Cancer going for children since the 1980s and I remember that talking about the crane hope like why was so important because we hadn't had a drug a person sin 1980s for our children what is more important than that we do so many things that are less important the voucher system actually works i didn't want to remind everybody we have our annual childhood cancer summit coming up and it will be friday sep 10 to the 18th here in Washington will be the sixth annual childhood cancer shot at night I encourage all of you to 10 it's a great rally session for parents who have lost their children or survivors you've gotten through this horrible disease but have many survivorship issues which takes me to the start act and I want to tell you a little bit about what the star rank does as always we want the advocates to help us with the members of Congress this is an advocacy an advocate driven bill this is a bill created by you you I'm a messenger I created them telling cancer caucus to give these little children that don't have lobbyists that are paid high-dollar to lobby for them I created it to give them a hope I ating basically a voice in the Congress these little children that don't have a voice that are stricken with this disease and you are never wasted and I admitted voice and together we can get this stuff done together we've done a lot we've done a lot one thing you'll see in the cures act of provision that I'm already getting cluded is what's called Compassionate Use and it dates me back to a friend of mine on andrea's long you had cervical cancer and she was denied access to a clinical trial drug and I watched her die on her deathbed she said please do something about this so that the next person that has to deal with this and are on their deathbed what hat would is happening to me what happened to somebody else and so the Adria slow and cures act is part of the overall bill that will provide greater access to life-saving medications for terminally ill patients and I would argue the majority of these will open it up to the pediatric so that a lot of shoulder that currently would not have access to these life-saving medications after the passage of this bill they will the star actor will be introduced this week and star stands for survivorship treatment access and research it really reflects the priorities of the advocacy community and does several things I do want to go through because I think it's important it would authorize the NCI to establish a biorepository of tumor specimens for research purposes it authorizes grants to state cancer registries to identify and track incidences childhood cancer it ensures that least one pediatric oncologist will be included on the National Cancer advisory board why don't we have a childhood cancer Dodger on this board it's completely unacceptable that we don't have a pediatric oncologist on the net national cancer advisory board I don't understand the thinking I don't understand why we're not including childhood cancer in this overall equation they won't require again companies to make their compassion use policies public under the in Richland Care Act it establishes a pilot program to develop model systems from monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors it authorizes grants to improve care for childhood cancer survivors and requires a report on barriers to obtaining and paying for survival that uncaring we're going to get more of this information out to you of the pocket cards as you talk to members of Congress the more members we can get signed up on the bill the better chances we haven't getting this passed and signed into law I find no reason why any member cannot support this as was mentioned before is early next week the house will vote on the 21st century cures Act this provides a 10 billion dollar increase for NIH again it reauthorizes the creating co packed it requires companies make their compassion these policies at public again and it will incentivize companies to repurpose existing drugs for rare diseases like in like chop bone cancer so you know we've got a ways to go we've done a lot of great things since it's the past 10 years we've made a lot of progress but we have a lot more to do to eradicate this disease once and for all to save our children and it may not happen in our children's length time but I certainly hope that happens in their children's lifetime they look back on this movement this cause and remember the efforts and remember that there was a generation you stood up for the kids head cancer to finally confident and once and for all I can't tell you how proud I am to be a part of this i'm just an advocate I'm a messenger for the team I have a lot on my plate trying to protect us from threats of terrorism and other things with this I can't think of anything more important i was on a red-eye flight from California last night and which is why he probably will fogging right now but this was so that's why I was on them right now because this is so important to me I want to be here today to personally come by and say thank you for everything you've done for this cause because you are the foot soldiers out there that make it happen those of us in the Congress again are just them really the messengers for you but you do this with that compensation you do because you believe in it because it's the right thing to do at the end of the day when you look back on your life it's did I make a difference in the lives of others what greater replace to make a difference then with our children

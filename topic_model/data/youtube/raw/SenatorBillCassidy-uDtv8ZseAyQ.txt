now Senator Bill Cassidy republican from Louisiana it's great to have you back on Bloomberg Senator happy New Year as you prepare to return to Washington I wonder your thoughts today knowing that Mitch McConnell you're a leader in the Senate is set to Mark a major Milestone here as the longest serving party leader in Senate history play that against what's happening next door Kevin McCarthy struggling to get enough votes to be the next speaker what does that tell us about the Republican party right now in its new majority in the house from your view well it's not much a majority right it's got five extra people and if he can't get those five or four extra people then he's then he's not the speaker so it tells you that the American people have voted pretty evenly where it's 51.49 in the Senate Democrat or Republican and it's four votes extra for republicans in the house the American people are divided that's reflected in both the house and the Senate right now so you project that on the agenda for the new year here Senator both parties like to talk about having a big tent could you have too big a tent to get anything done in this divided Congress we may have lost the senator can you hear us the only way you're going to get something done and we do need to get things done is to I I can hear you can you hear me yes please go ahead the only way you'll get things done is is if work together it takes 60 votes Republicans and we've got to get things done Social Security is going insolvent in 11 years Medicare in five millions of Americans depend upon those programs they are going and solve it it's going to take a divided government in this case to solve those and and that's in my mind something that we've got to do uh so we've got to divide a government let's go at it when you're talking about social security obviously what comes to mind a lot of Republicans have talked about using social security measures as leverage to strike a deal when it comes to the debt ceiling when you looking at the Havoc that's happening now in the house did that foreshadow what is potentially going to be a struggle to raise the debt ceiling later this year is it just healing is a separate issue if you want to a link reform of these programs that's fine but it makes it less complicated if we just speak to them and it's always been said you only achieve Social Security reform in the divided government whether it is Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich or whether it's Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan because there's too much of a Temptation the demagogue you know from one side or the other if it's only one party doing the the reform so I actually see divided government as the opportunity to strengthen programs Americans agree upon strengthen them for those who want it to preserve it for those who are going to be if there's a time to do it let's do it now do you view This Moment In Time potentially likened to what happened in 2011 where Obama had to strike this deal to cut about two trillion dollars over the course of a decade from spending to make sure he was able to get the debt ceiling negotiation through well clearly we've got a problem with our debt and deficit now if you look at it although the kind of what it's called discretionary spending the money for roads and highways the money for doctors excuse me the money for uh military that's discretionary that's actually a small portion of what our debt and deficit is about increasingly our our debt is related to Social Security and Medicare they are going and solve it and if we don't preserve them the people that depend upon them will not have that safety net so if the debt ceiling is part of how we use you know get the courage to take on something important for the American people maybe it is a debt ceiling but I think it's easier to consider those separately and the debt's living over here by itself it may end up being tied up but I think you have to work on them initially at least as if they're separate you're talking with Senator Bill Cassidy a republican from Louisiana as our viewers and listeners see here and listen to we've got an eye on the house floor we're opening prayers the Pledge of Allegiance taking place and they're going to move now to the beginnings of this process of electing the next Speaker of the House Senator tomorrow Joe Biden is going to Kentucky to appear with Mitch McConnell to talk about in a couple of other Democrats and Republicans as well to talk about the infrastructure law that you helped a broker as one of the five original negotiators of the infrastructure bill now law they're going to be talking about one of the major projects there in Kentucky but I wonder when will Americans see cranes in major construction sites major changes in their communities as this law is implemented and funded this year I think you're already starting to see those changes um uh in my state for example uh there is now internet uh broadband internet being brought to rural areas that does that that currently does not have broadband internet and the contracts have been let the the design is taking place and within two years those projects will be completed now some things take a little bit extra there's 150 million dollars extra coming to Lake Charles Louisiana to replace a bridge on the interstate I-10 over the Calcasieu Ship Channel well that money is just coming down so the bridge work will not begin for a year or so but some things I've already mentioned uh the internet I can mention other things like water projects are already taking place but the wonderful thing about the plan is that it will continue to roll out for five six and seven years so yes it didn't happen like that but absolutely it's going to continue to roll out Americans will continue to see that benefit well it's not lost on us that Joe Biden appears with Mitch McConnell at the beginning of a new divided Congress here Senator is that an example for you all to follow we only get something done in a divided Congress if we work together now Republicans are not going to sign off on something which is terrible from the left we're just not going to do that but if the president wants to get something done and we've already mentioned several things like Social Security and Medicare and and he is willing to meet Republicans where we are and work towards common ground then we can succeed I would argue it's critical for our country to succeed we can sit and throw things at each other all day long nothing ever happens our country doesn't move forward if President Biden is willing to work with Mitch McConnell and other Republicans Kevin McCarthy then I think that the next two years can be productive if we decide just to throw brick bats uh nothing's going to happen that's not good for the country potentially Kevin McCarthy and you're seeing those pictures now he potentially is going to be the speaker of the house there's a lot of drama around this which we haven't seen in a century Senator back to Joe's point where he started this whole conversation the dichotomy you're seeing in the house versus what you're seeing from your leader in the Senate Now record party leader in terms of his time serving is the bad PR potentially going to come though the Republican Party writ large given the chaos that's happening on the house floor I think ultimately the American people most Americans are not following us most Americans are rightfully more concerned about a young man who last night in a football game had a cardiac contusion and is now in critical care if you follow what's trending on on Twitter they're praying for him most Americans have a life to live but they are going to end that life they're living look to see if there's results that come out of this Congress which actually makes their lives materially better do we address issues like inflation are we able to make energy cheaper our jobs more plentiful are they higher paying Medicare and Social Security we refer to if those were things that Congress contributes to positive outcomes then Republicans will do quite well um but I don't think most as much as you and I are interested in what's happening right now on the live stream but most Americans are going about their day right there um and that's that's kind of conservative I like the fact that people are going about their day all right thanks to Louisiana Senator Bill Cassie and happy New Year to you too

[Music] last month the House of Representatives voted on a resolution to end US military involvement in the conflict in Yemen this is a war that's taken tens of thousands of lives and led to one of the worst humanitarian crises on the planet two-thirds of that country is now food insecure children are dying of starvation at the last minute Republicans moved attack language condemning anti-semitism on to the resolution it was an odd maneuver since most Republicans were going to vote against the final bill anyway nevertheless because of their clear opposition to anti-semitism every Democrat voted to include the language and shortly after the bill to end the war in Yemen and condemn anti-semitism passed the House with nearly every Republican voting against it opponents of the war were hopeful it would clear the Senate - but it never came up for a vote in the Senate why it turns out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the power to send bills containing non-germane language back to the house and condemnation of anti-semitism our non-germane to ending the war in Yemen in other words Republicans exploited concern for the rising bigotry and violence against Jews to stall a bill that would help put an end to the violence happening in Yemen and they're planning to do it again they're reportedly going to call votes to include the exact same language in the Yemen bill the next time it comes up if Democrats vote to include that non-germane language the bill will be stalled if they vote against it Republicans will say see the Democrats aren't serious about opposing anti-semitism they become an anti-jewish party by using Jewish Americans as pawns to prolong the war in Yemen Republicans are demonstrating that they in fact don't take anti-semitism seriously they see it as a political weapon not a problem to be solved there weaponization of anti-semitism against Democrats is doing harm to the Jewish community to sincere efforts to combat religious and ethnic hatred in this country and in this case to hopes of bringing the Yemeni Civil War to a close it needs to stop

and joining me now to explain directly to the president why he thinks he's right on the issue south carolina senator lindsey graham senator uh welcome back good to see you thanks thanks for having me all right well let's let's get your response to the president first well number one mr president uh after the fbi interviewed this young man and his mother the cia was contacted by the russians in november months later he was put into a terrorist watch list the tide system i believe it is he goes to russia and dhs finds out the fact that he leaves and he comes back but they never tell the fbi they're cia so nobody knows what he did when he was in russia and when he got back in june of 2012 he created a youtube channel on his internet site on his facebook page and he embraced radical islam for the whole world to see and the rest is history so mr president our systems are not working all right the russians warned us this the fbi interviewed him the cia had him on their watch list uh and then you're right i mean very few people in the media have even discussed this this youtube video channel of his filled with radicalism my question is why was there no follow-up was he not putting a database that said hey watch this guy watch when his name shows up on the internet it certainly would have been a telltale sign that's the ultimate question less than two percent of the people in the thai database our american citizens are hearing legal status but we can't have a system where you interview a guy after you've been tipped off by a foreign government you have a radical in your midst he leaves the country you don't know about it he comes back and he gets on the internet for the whole world to see and he embraces radical islam and we it's either political correctness stove piping criminalization of the war i can't explain it but the system to me is broken i love the fbi i love the cia but i don't know what's going on here but we got eight dead americans killed in the last seven months four in benghazi four in boston and when you look at boston and benghazi things are not working now i interviewed michelle bachman and she told me that she actually looked at the fbi training manuals and that they have been purged of any references to radical islamic jihadists now what's that yeah well that's political correctness isn't it yes there's three things here information sharing doesn't exist the way it should when he leaves the country dhs picks it up but they don't share it with the fbi the cia that's back to the old 911 stove piping i think polit political correctness is not monitoring these people's facebooks and websites what gets me is that it was not hard to understand he was becoming radical before our eyes but nobody really picked it up and when we found the photos of the two guys after the bombing how could that not alert the system you'd already interviewed this guy when they were asking the whole country do you know these two guys the question is why didn't the fbi know they had already talked there's one other component though and that is anybody that's posting radical jihadist videos are gonna be being monitored in my view yes all right there's two other points here though so our intelligence failed us but yet sherlock napolitano races out there to tell the american people something she doesn't know is true and that is there's no broader plot well three people were arrested today that sounds to me like there's some evidence out there that there is a broader plot she has no idea it sounds like susan rice all over again right after benghazi there's no evidence of an allocated connection here this is a spontaneous riot caused by hateful video did you see the three guys that the fbi released photos of in benghazi eight months later do they look like protesters to you no i mean what's going on here i mean benghazi is eight months old nobody's been arrested and the survivors have never been allowed to be talked to by the congress this administration is investigating itself and i'm urging the president challenging this administration to allow the survivors to come forward without the fear of being fired so where do we go from here i know you have called for a joint select committee to investigate the boston bombings and benghazi where do we go from here well the house uh is stepping up on benghazi they're having new hearings but the fbi the cia and the department of homeland security all need to be looked at not separately but jointly to learn from our mistakes again i love the fbi and the cia but when napolitano says there is no connection here to a broader plot she had absolutely no way she could have known that that soon and the more you know about these two guys they certainly didn't learn all this in the bottom of their basement and i this this administration doesn't want to admit that al qaeda bin laden's dead but radical islam is on the rise we need to up our game all right uh thank you lindsey graham we'll continue to follow it and we've got to get to the bottom of it or else it's going to keep happening bottom line amen we got to uh we got to keep our foot on the gas

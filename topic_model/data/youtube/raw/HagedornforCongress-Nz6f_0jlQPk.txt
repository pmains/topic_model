and I say is one of the four Congress is that last one is to sustain agriculture in our rural southern Minnesota way of life and I got born in a rural community bloomer through I lifted a carving very important to the backbone of our economy here in our world part of southern Minnesota and I see how tough it is for rural communities and farmers aren't doing well my dad and grandfather great-grandfather were all southern Minnesota farmers grain and livestock farmers I grew up in Truman those were my formative year to see farm roots little values is one of the sites that we carry when we go through our parades and so sustaining agriculture in our way of life is very important I understand that there's been some transition but you know we don't have to have government pile on and frankly our rural communities are under pressure where I come from a glory lost the woman you know here they might be losing a hospital or some of the jobs associated with that hospital in Fairmont the same thing happened and Laverne the lost 200 poultry jobs and Waseca were losing 350 print jobs those our rural communities need help the city of Rochester and some of these bigger cities are doing okay big money flop flowing in there but they need somebody out in Washington we do who's going to advocate for you care about you look out for you do everything we can now as far as farming is concerned you know Carla's right the input costs are high and the commodity prices are low but this has been going on for four years it's going on then going on since the middle of the Obama administration many of our farmers and our communities have been in recession effectively and when that happens there's no spending on Main Street while spending at the infamous no spending with the car dealers on it goes under pressure what do we need to do at the federal level while we need to continue the farm programs to make sure that we sustain agriculture I would want to be Agriculture Committee I've been out working the folks in Washington to make sure that would happen and I would be somebody that would try to support support agriculture across the board to make sure that we were going to be taken care of here but some of the policies that need to change in the federal government are simply these for farmers to help them lower their cost regulatory reform I support the reason which would require all major regulations to be affirmed by the Congress before they get implemented on farmers and businesses and others tax reform you're right let the farmers make the decision let them expense their items in the current year lower the taxes whatever you can to perform taxes make it simple lower their cost you know when you look at energy energy independence that's very important making sure that we have opportunities to use our United States for sources we have the most resources of any country in the world and they have the infrastructure the pipelines the distribution points to the fineries to keep the prices low very important half the cost of a bushel of corn and some you know depending on the price of gas or diesel is energy and on it goes and so you know when you look at these types of things that can be done at the federal level I've been right there exports we need an administration and we need a Congress and others that are going to continue to export our agriculture products our farmers only get whatever that you know the prices for that last part of that last bushel or whatever we have to expand our markets I'm hopeful that President Trump and his renegotiation with some of these some of these deals that he's got going whether it's an after the Pacific Partnership other things the pirate and lateral agreements we need to be expanding our agricultural exports well we're going to be in trouble here in southern Minnesota so those are some of the ways that I look at the issue some of the ways I think we can be helpful for farmers and our world communities if I'm elected would be a strong advocate for you across the point

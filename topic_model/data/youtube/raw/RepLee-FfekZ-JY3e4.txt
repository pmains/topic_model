thank you very much you want to thank yourself and Congressman hunter for this motion strong support of it it would strike the massive tax breaks in this bill and ensure that no American lose access to health insurance is completely unconscionable that this so-called health bill continues Republicans assault on the poor low-income individuals families just struggling to make ends meet does it by ending Medicaid expansion and ripping health care away from 24 million Americans but we know this really isn't even a health care plan at all let's call it what it really is it's a massive tax cut for the wealthy disguised as a health care plan this bill is a 600 billion dollar tax giveaway which is the largest transfer of wealth from working families to the rich in our nation's history period what's more tens of Americans will suffer just so my Republican colleagues can hand the wealthiest to 400 wealthiest families in America a 2.8 billion each year by paying for it this is how they do it using Medicaid and insurance exchanges as a piggy bank to pay for these enormous tax breaks it's really a disgrace

dear friends my best wishes to your invention it is an important gathering we have to come together to face a new world n2o fell / children a new agenda the new world contains play dangerous in great hopes specifically when it comes to Israel the intro is of an Iranian nature namely the country that threatens to destroy another country user to face it we have to understand that this is not just a danger to Israel it's a menace to the entire world your own is trying to build a coalition of evil forces have agencies like Hezbollah and Hamas and tried to convince auto conquer other countries against this evil coalition we have to form and act as a coalition of light and security headed by the United States I can see that the president of America is trying to be into such a coalition because the danger is all over the places and mostly does that they spoke with recognize it and feel that unless the danger of Iran which is a combination of terrell and trying to build a nuclear bomb will be over Israel will be a very loyal member in this coalition and all of us agree the default step should be not a shooting war but other means if we can achieve it to overcome this danger by other means it's much better then on 10 site there is a great hope hope for peace and they were specifically for peace in Israel I do believe that must of the Palestinian leaders I do believe that the heads of the Palestinian Authority mr. Abbas and Fayette I'll convince that peace is the best answer for them as for us we made a long way because peace you have to build notice to negotiate and in the meantime the Palestinians are building a state of their own with the support and agreement of his own there's not a solution but a two-state solution otherwise you can make one state the two people will call endlessly and bitterly within this state it won't be a bi-national state it will be a state of war between two nations endlessly and I think this is more or less accepted by most of the leaders in the world I think by the Arabs and you sell to people are trying to say it's how to retrieve well any great think anything is how to atrevo but it is achievable I know that you support the two-state solution and we appreciate it very much I think we have to keep our link together endo fell in your agenda for a young generation I think that this new agenda should be based on the preference of the mole call in whatever we do Druidism without morality is untrue to its past and doesn't have a message for the future the Ten Commandments our document that we kept and we have to keep for the then the Jewish people were always hunger for wisdom for knowledge for science the future of humanity depends today more on wisdom dinner was more on science then on land vol Norwich then on ignorance and this great tradition in Jewish life must be enhanced and enforced end of l2 every young women oh man and the third point is to make peace the world today is made of so many differences and biases biases and prejudices and disagreements and dangerous weapons to make peace all over the places and to make peace here in the Middle East is a great call and a great challenge find any video rich people will never satisfied with the existing situation our orientation is in the future for a better man a better world for a better hope to posterity tikkun olam I'm sure that you can contribute as you do to make our life better more secure mobile more honest more attractive god bless you you

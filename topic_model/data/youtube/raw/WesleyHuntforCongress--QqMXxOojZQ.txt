wesley hunt won the republican primary back in march and would hardly seem like a fair fight he won by 34 percentage points over the former mayor of bel air cindy siegel leaving the other four people in the race well back in the pack not bad for a guy who's never run for public office before what's the attraction you ask good morning to wesley hunt you can ask him i'm going to ask him actually congratulations on your primary win mr hunt good to see you here so why do you think you were able to win that primary so handily you know i think um you know the big thing is my team and i put a lot of work in we knocked over over a hundred thousand doors uh we made the phone calls did the phone banking had a very strong coalition of a lot of people ranging from young and old black white we loved it and i think that hard work was really what got us through and most importantly i think people also appreciate the service aspect of my background and somebody that is a west point graduate my brother is also a west point graduate my sister is a westport graduate as well so all three of us went and my dad did 23 years of active duty here in the us army and so when you start to add that up and people seeing a service-minded person that wants to continue to serve on the next level i think that's really what god's over the hump you're part of a concerted effort by the national republican party to field a more diverse group of candidates that's what's been happening across the country what message do you have to your constituents your potential constituents beyond the chance to have more diversity what what is it that you think that will resonate with your folks who are going to vote potentially for you that will tell them okay you're going to be able to beat lizzie fletcher what is it in that process you think it's going to help you beat her certainly certainly my time in the army taught me about how to work together we don't when you're in combat and you're flying i was an apache pilot in the army and you know i deployed to iraq in 2006. and where you're flying combat missions no one cares if you're a d or an r we need to get things done for this district and quite frankly lizzie fletcher broke her promise for day one from day one when she voted for nancy pelosi to be the speaker of the house and she has since then voted with her 98 of the time and this is a moderate district it's actually an r plus seven district and that's just not um the voice that we need up in washington right now we need jobs this is the energy capital of the world the energy corridor is fully encompassed in this district and right now our energy jobs are hurting and nancy pelosi's agenda and lizzie fletcher who has voted with her 98 of the time it's just not what we need right now we need a voice for our industry here in houston dc and that's why i'm here and that's why i'm running so it sounds like you are more inclined to vote the opposite of what lizzie fletcher has voted which means that you are more aligned with president trump are you aligned with president trump on issues across the board how closely aligned are you with him reason i asked you that is because the 2018 a lot of republicans were knocked out of office because of political experts will say some backlash against president trump what do you think about that and how closely aligned are you and will that hurt hell or hurt you helped or hurt you sure sir great great question uh certainly from from a policy standpoint i do agree with with president trump on a lot of things uh particularly and how he wants to handle the oil and gas industry um right now the presumptive nominee is going to be joe biden he has already committed to no new fracking do you know what that does to houston texas and i'm here to tell you that if joe biden called nancy pelosi and nancy pelosi cause calls lizzie fletcher they're going to have her vote but they're not going to have my vote in this in this latest round of of spending an explosive proposed a three trillion dollar bill and not a single dime is going to the oil and gas industry that has been hit extremely hard over the course of the past few months and what i do know about president trump in that administration is that there are certainly pro oil and gas they are certainly pro-energy and the best way for us to get out of this crisis with current virus and with the oil and gas and with the fall of the oil and gas industry is to make sure that we get people back to work rebuild our economy and bring jobs back and the one thing the trump administration has done is that created one of the best economies that we have seen in the history of this country and also the lowest unemployment for all races for all people and moderate in the modern era of this country certainly got to get back to that and quite frankly i think that's going to win the danish district certainly it was a continuation of an economic turnaround that had happened previously and it was a continuation and it made it better uh i certainly don't want to give credit what credit does not do in terms of creating it but if you win you take an office at a time when the nation is more divided than ever in a lot of different ways politically and now racially with the uh tragic death up in minneapolis what are you going to be able to do to help change that dynamic working together working together and the one thing that i always like to talk about is being an african-american man you know we want i like to look at people and give people as much opportunity as they can again i always go back to economics i always go back to creating jobs that's the great equalizer that actually jobs don't care what race color or creed you are and that's what we have to build back in this country and also talk about you know being bipartisan there's nothing more bipartisan than voting with the speaker of the house 98 of the time as lizzie fletcher has done and so being able to take those values that i learned from the military mission first how to work together to accomplish a mission that's what i want to bring to to washington and what's also interesting especially right now in the height of this this racial contention that i can't ignore is the idea of we gotta work together the only way that we can solve the ills of this country is if white people work with black people and hispanic people across all people all walks of life across the board it's not just one group of people that hurts americans hurt wesley has to make sure their identity is just that wesley thank you so much for your time this morning congratulations again on your primary win thank you for your willingness to serve the people of the 7th congressional district thank you thank you god bless you be safe thank you

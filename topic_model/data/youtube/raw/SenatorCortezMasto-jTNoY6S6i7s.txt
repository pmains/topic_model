thank you madam chair um mr. Genachowski let me let me follow up on some of the questions that Senator Manchin asked you with the rpe program what would you do in your capacity is the director to advocate the value of the arpa-e program to the secretary and to the president I would point to that the external management evaluation the National Academy of Science is used they've got a lot of research that they've done many publications they've got companies that have been formed they've got products that have gone into the marketplace and actually changed the environment so I think there's there are other citations of major publications there are patents applied for etc there are a lot of different external goals I think that the National Academy had about seven or eight that they looked at a a lot of those are interim goals that are adding to knowledge which is important and some of them are I'd say ultimate goals which address the the phrase in the statute of deployment a deployment of the assets some of those things are the geothermal well with the laser beams going down the middle to soften up the rock there's the BASF venture capital working with slips to increase the viscosity and not have any kind of attachment against the walls of a pipe or whatever there's smart wire there are many things that have made it to the end of the marketplace that have actually changed the way the market works and changed the way electricity moves the way power musli energy moves and help the environment so those are a handful of things out of a lot of projects which seems to me like the right ratio some failures some projects that add to knowledge that haven't yet hit the market and then some things in the marketplace so I guess it seemed to me they're doing their job and they should be continued for that reason that's why that's how I guess I would advocate it okay thank you mr. Cooper would you please share your general position on whether Yucca Mountain in Nevada should be a federal repository for the nation's nuclear waste my position would be that the department would follow the statutory mandates on Yucca Mountain and I would advise the department to do so it's a role of Congress to speak to that nothing Congress already has would you recommend that the secretary accept the framework established by the route Blue Ribbon Commission which was later accepted by your general counsel predecessor and the Secretary's predecessor I'd have to review that the Commission's findings I haven't I haven't done so do you require would you support legislation requiring consent by state and local governments by all means that's a decision for the Congress to make and it would not be a decision that I could make in my role as office attorney I don't think the Department of Energy would take a position one way or the other on whether or not there should be consent-based siting I'm sure that it would depend on the particularity of the proposed legislation okay On January 8th FERC unanimously rejected do E's grid resiliency proposal to provide support for failing coal and nuclear plants saying that there is no evidence that any passed or planned retirements of coal-fired power plants pose a threat to reliability of the nation's electric grid and then subsequently a leaked do a memo from on dated May 28th would compel the memo stated they would compel that the do he excuse me would compel grid operators to buy electricity from at-risk plants under the auspices of national security considering there is no emergency existing emergency to respond to it's hard to envision how propping up those at-risk coal and nuclear plants plants might be implemented in your legal opinion what would such an emergency look like that would keep these plants online that couldn't be rectified with the grid system and resources we already have today I really couldn't speculate on a fact pattern that I haven't seen that exist today or what my corine the future all I can commit to is that I would advise the Department of the what the law says and then try to make a reasonable application of the facts to the law but at this point I'm not in a position to give an opinion thank you and I was 14 secretary Perry was quoted as saying the government must ensure that the US has baseload capability that only coal and nuclear can bring the wind doesn't always blow the Sun doesn't always shine and gas pipelines are interrupted from your experience in the national gas natural gas industry would you agree with this assessment at a top-line level yes and any other comments at a top-line level yes what does that mean well I'm saying in the energy sector is is robust has come it's it can be complex and I think that to do a full and complete analysis of how each part of the energy industry fits into the whole is more that can more than I can succinctly state here today ok thank you I knows my time is up thank you very much

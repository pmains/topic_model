good evening like me you just heard president joe biden's first address to a joint session of congress sadly this address left a false impression of what president biden's first 100 days has really been about this is a president who in a matter of three months has propped our border open yet kept our school shut he's put in place policies that destroy jobs and our energy independence and he's demonized many americans instead of bringing us together i attended president biden's inauguration and i was optimistic when he spoke of healing unity and coming together but tonight's address was unfortunately more of the same empty rhetoric empty promises and empty solutions there are folly a socialist wish list for his liberal base instead of something for all hard-working americans tennesseans want to put this pandemic in our rearview mirror we want to rebuild our economy we want to reopen our schools and see wages rising again instead president biden has proposed the largest tax hike on americans in a generation this will not only kill jobs it will destroy any economic recovery we've seen thus far spending spending spending is what we heard tonight instead of jobs jobs jobs as a lifelong businessman and as the former commissioner of economic development tennessee who helped our state recover from the last recession this is the wrong approach he called tonight on congress to continue this spending spree that congressional democrats have already started growing the size of government regulating small businesses and making it harder for the american worker to compete i can assure you countries across the world are laughing all the way to the bank because they'll be the beneficiaries of a weaker america tennesseans also want to be safe and secure yet president biden failed to put forth a meaningful plan to combat the largest surge in illegal immigration that we've seen in 20 years a surge which is entirely the result of his administration's knee-jerk decision to reverse the successful policies of the previous administration this wasn't a speech for the american people it was a speech for the liberal base of the democratic party who want higher taxes open borders less secure elections they want to pack the supreme court and they want to see the green new deal biden has put us on a dangerous path to socialist policies that will weaken us as a nation as your senator i'm going to fight this socialist wish list every day by standing up for your constitutional rights advancing pro-growth policies that lower taxes that grow jobs and help the american workers succeed as well as reduce the size and scope of federal government president biden failed to acknowledge many of our serious challenges but i won't from mountain city to memphis it's an honor to serve and represent the people of tennessee as your united states senator thank you and may god bless

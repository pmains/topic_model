40 minutes past the hour live look at LA why are we doing this we love California we love the state of California not miss california no no Chris stop doing that to me in my ear with a snide Emma cratic representative from California and member of the House Financial Services Committee in the House Judiciary Committee congresswoman Maxine Waters thanks very much for being on the show this morning it's good to have you on you're welcome how are you doing Mika oh we're good we're powering through right Willie I'd say we're doing more than powering could I ask for a question I know he's gonna be in just off the top I'm not congresswoman waters we want to get to the health care in a moment but obviously top of mind in your great state this morning chaos as a Donald Trump has asked Miss California Isis to step down there's a crisis in your state how will the vacuum of power be filled there and what role will you play well let me just say this we have a real serious problem in in my state the state of California has a deficit of about 24 billion dollars we're not going to have summer school we're cutting all levels of education from K through 12 right up through the University we're cutting our medical medical we're we're just about to lose some of the services for in-home supportive services on and on and on this is serious thing we have run out of money so you're not concerned about Miss California no now she's anything about it not a girl all right here congresswoman waters it's mica again really I don't even know I apologize for that and i actually just gave me a great idea whenever some silly little news thing like that comes across we ought to take the state and look at the bigger story there and say there's something with Miss California but we're not going to cover it there's a budget crisis in California we're going to go you go make a look at you go you and I have you know what that's why we have maxine waters on this morning so please tell us more kids not getting summer school yes how are you guys going to get through this crisis what are you gonna do I don't know how we're going to get through the crisis unfortunately there's a big divide between the Democrats and the Republicans Schwarzenegger has come up with a plan to make dig deep cuts those plans are not agreed to not support it by many are in the legislature they're saying that they need to take another look at alternative ways by which to reduce that budget I just don't know how it's going to be resolved they have come to the federal government and they've asked us to guarantee some bonds for them I don't see any movement on that at this time so it's a serious dilemma that we have all right I'm so in waters uh in all seriousness by the way I was kidding about Miss Calif yeah well you you invaded it very nice things not by the way I want to ask I want to ask you Oh Johnny I want to ask you about health care you know Joe writes in his book the last best hope about how he has a funny passage in there about you working with him I'll be sent to polar opposite sides of the aisle but saying that you know you guys were able to work together to get some important things done how important will bipartisanship be in getting real health health care reform passed and how realistic is it for us to expect that you all will work together well I think it's very realistic to expect that we are going to have cooperation on health care reform I think there has been a growing consensus that we have to have universal comprehensive health care for all Americans we have 45 million people without health insurance we're spending 2.5 trillion dollars on health care in this country we've got to reduce those costs we've got to expand the opportunities for all Americans and I some earlier discussion right here on the show this morning about prevention that's extremely important that's right Donnie you were talking about that yeah I have a tax plan also important reform toward clean it up tomorrow tort reform education prevention tax the wealthy hundred thousand Americans from extra hundred thousand a year we pay for it that's it consciously waters are you willing to discuss tort reform in all this well we're always willing to discuss tort reform we may not come out on the same side of the issue but I am open to discussion anytime anyplace anywhere with any of my colleagues and that's exactly what you were reading out of Joseph book because that's we have Maxine Waters on our radio show and actually congressman waters it was funny our listeners on Joe's radio show we're surprised that you were a guest you know I know people are often surprised because they don't know about the relationships they see only the sound bites about how far apart we are how confrontational we are but there are many of us who get along quite well across the aisle we not only talk with each other we have dinner with each other we share stories about what's going on in our families our grandchildren but that's not seen then talk to me that's like you know I think what Maxine is talking about with her Joe is very symbolic of what is the real that we don't get in the media is that ninety percent of Americans I think agree on most things and genuinely like each other but obviously we cover the fringes so that it is it is nice deal and I think that's kind of a microcosm what really does go on in this country which is which is great well and I we love having you want and we love having the conversation and that's what this show is about and our radio show as well I think people are beginning to catch on to that do we have the sound bite Chris of Barney's we do all right um congressman congresswoman waters I'd like to play for you sound bite Barney Frank yesterday talking about executive pay take a listen I do think you have to go further and say for example if you take a risk and it pays off and you get an extra bonus but if two months later it turns out that that was a very temporary payoff and now the company is losing money that has to be what we call a call back and you have to return the money that you got if you make a big bet and it loses money then you want to lose money seems to make sense congresswoman waters that was from Andrew Mitchell show ya little responsibility you can't have a system where you are taking all of these risk and then when it backfires on you and people are losing money that you stand aside and say well I want my bonuses and I want to be compensated that's not right are you have to accept responsibility by the way you manage the portfolio I can't agree more business the entire compensation system has got to be re J GERD we pay not for performance we pay for that today there is such a built in entitlement on Wall Street the expectations that I get five million a year i get 10 we're morons I've worked with me one now hugs already know on board we just aren't entitled business community bloated I can't agree with Frank another three and a couple of other words I won't use congresswoman waters thank you so much for being on the show please come back you're welcome tell Joe I said hello and I've got to read the book to find out what he said I think you should we will get you a copy thanks very much thank you

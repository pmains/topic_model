thank you mr speaker i believe every person born or unborn is worthy of our protection a majority of americans nearly 60 percent agree that federal tax dollars should not be used to pay for the destruction of life hide protections to prohibit taxpayer funding for elective abortions have been in place in this country ever since ford even president biden supported them as a senator but now house democrats have abandoned nearly a half a century of bipartisan consensus i offered an amendment in the aways and means committee to include hyde protections which have saved more than 2 million innocent lives in this 1.9 trillion dollar bill i also joined my colleagues in submitting a similar amendment for for consideration democrats rejected both this is a moment that calls for healing not destruction for saving lives not ending them for bringing americans together not tearing us apart it's sad to see partisanship take priority over the most vulnerable among us the unborn i urge my colleagues to join me in protecting innocent life by opposing this bill and i'll yield back

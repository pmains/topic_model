congressman let's turn to the debt ceiling something that you and I both share a mutual disdain for and I understand you have proposed eliminating it something that I fully support since it serves no useful purpose but I wanted to ask you about your assessment of the president's strategy he came out and has basically eliminated the 14th amendment to the Constitution option he's essentially eliminated all of the ways of getting out of the debt ceiling without having Congress make the decision themselves do you think that's the right strategies essentially put the ball in the court of the Republican House caucus and said you guys have the choice are you going to raise it or are you going to cause a default and deal with those economic consequences well I don't know if it's the right strategy i frankly wish he hadn't ruled out the 14th amendment or for that matter the platinum coin he is betting that the Republican Party is not completely insane I hope that's a good bet I'm not sure it is because essentially what the Republicans are doing is saying you know that's a nice economy like a 1930s gangster movie that's a nice economy you got over there pity if it should happen to blow up if you don't pay me off with what I want and that's a direct threat and the hostage is the entire economy because if we don't raise the debt ceiling we will default and if we default we will have a depression I mean a real depression the interest rates will spike on every public on every private loan in unlock the economy for loop will have a mass mass unemployment beyond what we have now I hope the Republicans are not crazy enough to do that congressman I love when you make mafia analogies please keep it up let's talk to that vein about the sandy relief bill which became really politicize disaster relief is not supposed to be politicized we saw 179 Republicans in the House vote against it including people from Congress people from Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Gulf states why did this bill become so politicized and have such a hard time getting through well I don't know maybe it's just because it's the first time that we've had disaster relief of a large amount since this Congress got elected in a republican-dominated Congress certainly there was a list of something like 67 Republican members who had supported asked for voted for demanded disaster relief for their communities in their states when natural disasters hit in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast and so forth and then refused to vote for it now there is no rational answer to that I'd like to believe it isn't that because they're prejudiced against New York or the Northeast for some reason it's hard to reach such a conclusion hmm congressman jerry nadler thank you so much for for joining us

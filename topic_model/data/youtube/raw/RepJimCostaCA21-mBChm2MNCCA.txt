I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to this Republican partisan bill just a few days ago I traveled to San Diego with several of our colleagues to see firsthand how current immigration policies being enforced there were children separated from their parents and migrants seeking asylum our immigration system is broken and everybody knows that and this administration is making a challenging situation worse our immigration system needs to be dealt with why don't we try sitting down and working together on real bipartisan reform this is a partisan proposal that holds dreamers and vulnerable children hostage and does nothing for California farm workers what's worse it builds a twenty five billion dollar wall that by itself does not provide comprehensive solutions for our border security which we all believe in by the way didn't the president promised that Mexico would pay for this wall I urge my colleagues to do the right thing vote no let's get back to working on bipartisan reform reform that provides us with border security we need and fixes our immigration system and respects the dignity and the humanity of aspiring Americans I yield back the balance of my time

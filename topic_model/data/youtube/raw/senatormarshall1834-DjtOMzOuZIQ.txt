senator from kansas mr president over the last few weeks i've been back home and many many people were finishing up wheat harvest absolutely one of the joys of the entire year when a year's work of hard work comes to fruition and every corner of the state was speckled with combines tractors grain carts and trucks all doing their part in the harvest process inside those implements were fathers and sons sisters mothers brothers and my cousins all working side by side to harvest the crop that will provide the financing for land payments equipment loans operating loans and next year's inputs like seed and fertilizer now agriculture is a capital intensive industry much more than i could have ever imagined harvesting wheat requires at least four different pieces of machinery many costing two hundred and fifty thousand dollars five hundred thousand 000 or more each it takes years for a farmer to build enough equity to purchase a new piece of equipment or land and for many families it's only by passing down the land and equipment that a family farm can remain viable this is the only way a young farmer can truly survive now the common saying in kansas is that farmers live poor but die rich now across this great nation contrary to most people's beliefs 98 of farms and ranches are family owned 98 family owned those families produce much of the food fuel and fiber we consume here in the united states and around the globe these family farms many in their fourth like mine fifth generation and even sixth and seventh generation farms and ranches are out there now they endure turbulent weather inconsistent market conditions and tight labor markets it seemed like growing up a week never passed that my dad never looked at me and said you know farming has to be the biggest gamble there is in america in 2017 government passed passed the tax cuts and jobs act which provided sweeping tax changes to encourage private entrepreneurship and economic growth the tax cuts and jobs acts the exemptions for the state estate tax as we call it the death tax more than doubled keeping most family farms safe from from redundant government taxation but now the current administration and some of my friends across the aisle want a task hard-working agriculture producers with the financing of the roughly five trillion dollar reckless tax and spending bill i think president eisenhower or ike as we call him a fellow kansan hit the nail on the head when he said and i quote you know farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles from the cornfield in quotes first they propose not only eliminating stepped up bases on realized property but also in unrealized assets at the time of the owner's death their proposal would tax unrealized capital gains over 1 million dollars at ordinary income tax rates which would be levied at the top marginal rate at 39.6 percent that means the next generation inheriting land and equipment would have to pay taxes on the increase in value even if the property is never sold secondly the administration's proposed lowering the exemption to the death tax from 11.7 million under the tax cuts and job act to 3.5 million per person and increasing the top tax rate from 40 to 45 percent consequently a family farm commonly would have to sell off a third of their land to keep going from generation to generation and the buyers unfortunately will be large corporations or foreign entities according to a report published by texas a m's agriculture food and policy center under current law only 2 of their 94 representative farms would be impacted by an event triggering a generational transfer of property 2 out of 94. to contrast this up to 98 percent of their representative farms would see how high higher tax burdens if certain parts of the administration's plan were enacted from 1997 to 2020 in kansas cropland values raised 220 percent and some parts of the united states they've increased over 500 percent if there was a 20 capital gains tax on those valuation increases the average kansas farmer would have to have a new tax obligation nearly a quarter of a million dollars these numbers are simply unbearable you know i paid stop and pay homage to my grandfather and both of my grandfathers who had fourth fifth generation family farms these farms were bought in the early 1900s both farms have been in the family over a hundred years i would suppose my grandfather's paid less than a hundred dollars per acre today those farms maybe they're worth a thousand two thousand dollars an acre but if you could imagine the tax burden of trying to pass down that farm and pay for that stepped up basis for the tax on the increase in that property it simply isn't going to happen there's none of us have brothers and sisters and cousins that had that type of cash available we want to encourage the next generation to return home to the family farm not tax them into bankruptcy america will see millions of acres of lands and billions of dollars of equipment change hands over this next decade while the current administration contests and only a small percentage of our farm families will be impacted by their proposed changes all evidence really indicates otherwise the administration fails to consider the several realities of multi-generational farms with some siblings staying on the farm and some selling their interest any changes to the estate tax and opportunity to pass assets from one generation to the next will lead to further consolidation in the ag industry fewer young families returning home to their rural communities and more rural main street businesses closing shop we can't allow this administration to saddle our hard-working farming families with the responsibilities of funding their socialist agenda agriculture is still responsible 40 percent of the kansas economy we must all do what we can to ensure our family farms have every opportunity possible to continue their way of life and bring the next generation back to the farm and keep rural america alive and well thank you mr president and i yield back

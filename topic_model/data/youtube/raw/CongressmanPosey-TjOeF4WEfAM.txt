go the gentleman from Florida mr. posies recognized thank you very much mr. chairman and and thank you gentlemen for appearing today I'll have any of you who read the book one second after it's a novel by we enforced and it was a New York Times bestseller well it was obviously written from a report about the EMP electromagnetic pulse threat our nation faces and if you're in the energy business I would really commend the book to you to read a little over a year ago the Earth's orbit missed by about one week a solar eruption which seems would have taken out all our satellite communications and and probably destroyed our power grid my question to you is what you think we should be doing to protect our citizens against that threat about 60 seconds each where to be appreciated with dr. Saunders first so first let me say that I am NOT personally an expert on this topic but we did have expertise in our committee and I've on this matter Tom Overby from the University of from Texas A&M University is an expert on this topic I talked with him about this issue and this is a issue of intense research this is an issue of intense study and there are solutions that are beginning to emerge but they're in the early stages they include raising awareness to the potentially severe impacts of gmds there's software now to plan for the impacts of GMD on systems and people are using that to do studies we're at the stage really where engineers are getting down to looking at what the real issues are there are magnetometers are being stalled across the country to measure these kinds of disturbances in fact the University of Illinois has won on some land that appartment owns right off-site and research is ongoing with narcs with groups like Newark and every helping in this effort so in summary we don't have all the solutions we need now but progress is being made thank you sir follow-up nor my an expert but I will say the following we have a number of disparate activities in the country related to electric magnetic pulse we have a spread of tools but what we don't have as an integrated toolset nor do we have a common reflection across the three different waveforms e1 e2 and e3 and we need to get to that so that we can provide guidance to industry to for them to better shield and protect the new devices that are being produced for the grid for which we are modernizing and investing heavily each year so there is work underway there are coordinating groups trying to drive that but I think we need a more focused national effort to move towards a common set of integrated tools that reflect all three of those II 1 e 2 e 3 waveforms and the challenge is as some of the solutions for geomagnetic sometimes might interfere or confound the solutions for the EMP waveform so that's why we need this integrated the other waveform so we can get a common voice to industry on how to design around this issue thank you I would have to say dr. Sanders and mr. Emhoff are the experts here and I did a good job and as far as explained stuff I learned something there but I cannot speak to this issue and I would say you know this is an issue that that is being studied right now every The Electric Power Research Institute is conducting a multi-year study on this where they are also releasing what they find every every few months and all different types of utilities investor owns municipal Aeons coops are participating in that every report I know there are my my feeling is the first thing we need to do is study and figure out what if any technical changes needs to be made to the grid but I think you need to do the study and research first there are people out there saying we've got this quick fix that if you buy this tie of Faraday cage or this type of new equipment you know then then you'll fix your problem but I think you need I think we need more study first and and and then decide what if any new equipment needs to be made ah thank you which agency do you see having taken the lead in this or do you think should be taking a lead in it we've had hearings on this before and I've found the industry had very little interest in this so my understanding is a group called the Mission Executive Council is actually working on this and I believe that that council has representatives from the Department of Energy and from the Department of Defense and other agencies that are linked to the satellite systems etc so I would start with that mission executive council I don't know a lot about them but I believe there already is some coordination across the key involved agencies ok I thank you mr. chairman seaman time has expired okay thank you mr. Posey

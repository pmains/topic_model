uh thank you mr chairman uh look just like the bill exempts airports from superfund liability this amendment would similarly exempt community water systems super a superfund triggers automatic and permanent liability for anyone who comes in contact with waste as i pointed out my opening remark this bill curiously exempts airports from liability however community water systems that are simply trying to dispose of pfas laden filters would be targeted for litigation now simply put without this amendment this bill will put the rate holders of water systems on the hook for costly litigation families are already struggling with rising costs now congress is about to be essentially increasing their water bills really look polluters not rate payers should be held liable under super funds so mr chairman let me let me just try to summarize this if exempting airports is a responsible move and recognizing that more ppas firefighting foam is used annually at america's airports than used in medical devices kevlar and semiconductors combined and so let me let me let me get this straight so the worst culprit of pfas use is getting an exemption i i i gotta say mr chairman if if exempting the airports is appropriate then exempting water utilities is also a correct and fair thing to do and i urge support of my amendment and yield back my time

thank you well it's nice to see you I'll be really brief let me end where where or begin where Senator Lankford ended which is you know it used to be that we said that that partisanship ought to end at the water's edge and uh at a moment when we see the kind of partisanship that that we've seen in our domestic politics I have to say it was a incredible privilege to be in the Middle East with these six other Senators Democrats and Republicans showing that there is bipartisan support for the Abraham Accords for the relationships that are being established on economic terms on on National Defense terms and to encourage the normalization in the region and to encourage its expansion and every single one of us until this moment actually I thought I did agree with everything James Langford I'm just kidding but but but but I really think it was when we sat down with leaders in every one of these countries it was compelling to them that they were hearing the same thing from Democrats and Republicans when it comes to Abraham records and in the 14 years that I've been going to the Middle East I don't think I've ever been as encouraged as the by the progress that I've seen it's we have a long long way to go people who shouldn't be Pollyanna about this but when you see the the number of people that have traveled from Israel to Morocco for example the number of people that have traveled from the iaea the iaea to Israel or from Israel to the to the United Arab Emirates it's incredibly impressive and when they forecast things like five billion dollars of economic activity over the next five years or so it's not it's it's it's it's easy to see how how the numbers might Eclipse those numbers in the end of course what we want in that region all of us is peace and stability and I think this is the path toward that so moving forward I can just say from Colorado's perspective we hope to learn a lot about the work that's being done to try to deal with drought and deal with the shortage of water in the region we're facing many of the similar challenges in the Rocky Mountain West and with that that let me turn it over somebody who's not from the Rocky Mountain West my colleague from New York senator gillibren

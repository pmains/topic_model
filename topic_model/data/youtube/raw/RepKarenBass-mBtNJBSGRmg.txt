you for that reporting Jeff out front tonight is Democratic congresswoman Karen Bosch she is a member of the House Judiciary and House Foreign Affairs Committee thank you so much for joining me tonight congressman I would first get your reaction to the news that CNN is breaking tonight about Robert Muller's interest in Kushner going beyond his Russia contacts the special counsel now looking at conversations Kushner had with non Russian foreign investors including some from China and this of course was where as we were reporting during the transition what's your reaction well my reaction to it I mean it'll be interesting to see how it develops but my first reaction is is that it's such an extreme conflict of interests and it just seems as though it makes him completely compromised maybe it's one of the reasons why he has been unable to complete his security clearance but if you think about what his responsibility is within the administration on the Foreign Affairs angle from the Middle East you know etc to be a billion dollars in debt and to possibly be fundraising before he goes into the White House and who's to say that that's not to continue the deals might have fallen through but maybe he is in his order of business maybe he's trying to raise money for when this administration leaves so it just is an extreme conflict of interest he seems compromised and I'm really hoping that they will bring this to a close either he gets a security clearance or he does not congressman I just want to add that that this reporting is about the transition and before joining the administration Kushner said that he was working to divest his interest in the Kushner companies including 666 5th Avenue that that investment that we were talking about but exactly I want to play God who's to say that that didn't continue after the transition and also the fact that he is known to make more requests of intelligence information than anybody else except for the people in the National Security Council are you saying that you don't believe that he divested I'm saying who's to say even if he did two vests that doesn't mean that he couldn't continue with his contacts with foreign governments it's interesting that after they did take office Ivanka was able to get several trademarks from China it just raises all of the questions about the role of the family in the white house that's the main point I'm making in Congress when I want to play again what President Trump said in July he drew a red line in this investigation listen to what he said and he went on to say I think that's a violation look this is about Russia his point being if Muller goes into the whole notion of finances and his financing his family finances that's a red line is that does that concern you it comes to Muller's ability to keep his jaw a job and questions about whether the president could fire him it absolutely concerns me and it concerns me that this president doesn't seem to think that he should follow the rule of law you know his family is not exempt if his family is doing things that are not right then that's up for investigation too he is the one that brought his family into the Oval Office he didn't have to do that he chose to do that you heard our white house correspondent Jeff Zeleny talking about the fact that Jared Kushner still has only interim security clearance I know this is big I've been a big issue for you the fact that the White House chief of staff ordered that top-level security clearances be discontinued for any staffer whose background investigation or adjudication process has been pending since before last June Kushner's clearance is pending exactly that is an open question about what it's going to mean for Kushner I do want to just show you what Kushner's to attorney said in a statement about this he said my inquiries to those involved again have confirmed that there are a dozen or more people at mr. Kushner's level whose process is delayed that it is not uncommon for this process to take this long and a new administration that the current backlogs are being addressed and nope concerns were raised about mr. Kushner's application it is true that it can take a long time for anybody to get their full security clearance do you think that and do you have any indication that this is just part of the normal process well from my understanding it is absolutely not part of the normal process we are talking about 13 months now and we are talking about as I understand over a hundred people in the administration who have not completed the process but remember about Jared Kushner remember that he has had to make several amendments to his to his clearance to his application and so issues have been raised from day one so it is not my understanding at all that somebody of his level who makes consistent requests for classified information can have a position like this now the interesting thing is going to be who is going to win is it going to be the chief of staff will the president listen to the chief of staff or will the president overrule his chief of staff that's going to be the issue that we'll find out before the week is over Reacher well I want to ask you about one other thing regarding Russia and that's something that the president tweeted today he tweeted quote Obama was president up to and beyond the 2016 election so why didn't he do something about Russian meddling now we know now that the Russian operation to mess with the 2016 election started in 2014 it was halfway through President Obama's second term do you think the President Obama should have done more you know I think in the context of what was happening during this election in 2016 it would have been shocking if President Obama would have in a very forceful way said the Russians are interfering but you do remember that they did issue a notice to the press they did have a press conference and said that there was Russian interference but it happened to be the same day that the Hollywood access tape was released and so it didn't receive the coverage the amount of attention that it should have congresswoman Karen bass thank you so much for joining me appreciate it thanks for having me on

uh sure recognizes mr mckinley for five minutes uh thank you mr chairman and and this is this panel you all have to be exhausted after being grilled all day long like this so my questions are to mr zuckerberg uh when you came before our committee in 2018 you acknowledged that facebook had had used what you just said clear standards preventing the sale of illegal drugs on your site but you were shown you were shown examples of active posts that traffickers were still using that platform unlawfully to sell prescription opioids now you did apologize and confirm that quote social media companies need to do a better job of policing these posts close global now three years later it appears a show game is emerging facebook seems to have cleaned up its act but you're now allowing instagram one of your subsidiaries to become the new vehicle even though instagram has the same policies against the sale of illegal substances you're still allowing bad actors to push pills on your site look it didn't take long for our staff to find numerous examples for example here's uh oxycodone that that was is being sold on your site here's ritalin that's being sold on your site here's xanax an adderall that's being sold on your site so these posts have they're not new they've been active since last fall if we can find posts this easily shame on you for not finding them you're for yourself apparently you're not taking the warnings of congress seriously after drug manufacturers dump millions of pills into our community killing thousands ravaging families and destroying livelihoods congress responded by passing laws to hold them liable if a retail store is selling cigarettes or other to underage kids that store is held liable so why shouldn't you be held live or as well don't you do you think you're above the law you're knowingly allowing this poison to be sold on your platform into our communities to our children who are vulnerable adults look i've read scott galloway's book before i encourage all the members on this committee to read as well it's a perfect depiction of the arrogance of big tech companies like facebook google apple and amazon he develops a very compelling argument as to why big tech companies should be broken into smaller companies much like that occurred in att in 1984 maybe it's time for congress to have an adult conversation about this loss of liability protection and the need to reform our anti-trust laws i don't think congress wants to tell you how to run your company but maybe it should so mr zuckerberg let me let me close this one question and so don't you think you'd find a way to stop these illegal sales on your platforms if you were held personally liable keep on getting muted uh congressman we don't want any of this content on our platforms and i agree with you that this is a huge issue we've devoted a lot of resources and have built systems that are largely quite effective at finding and removing the content but i just think that what we all need to understand is that at the scale that that these communities operate where people are are sharing millions or or in messages billions of things a day it is inevitable that we will not find everything just like a police force in a city will not stop every single crime so i think that we should ask you the question very directly mark i did it should you not be held liable when people were dying because your your people are allowing these sales to take place we did it with manufacturers we do it to the stores why aren't we doing it to the salesman that allows this to take place well congressman i i don't think we're allowing this to take place we're building systems that take the vast majority of this content off our systems and what i'm saying three years mark we've been doing three years this has been going on and you said you were going to take care of it last time but all you do is switch from facebook over to instagram they're still doing it now and you're saying we need to do more well how many more families are going to die how many more children are going to be addicted while you still study the problem i think you need to help live congressman we're not we're not sitting and studying the problem we're building effective systems that work across both facebook and instagram but what i'm saying is that i i don't think that we can expect that any platform will find every instance of harmful content i think we should hold the platforms to be responsible for building generally effective systems at moderating these kinds of content gentlemen's time is entire time i'm not going to get an answer mike thank you

congresswoman's Stefanik it is great to see you thank you so much for joining us great to be back Liz so a very busy news cycle at the moment I do want to get your reaction to reports that the president ostensibly is going to announce that he'll allow sanctions to go forward on Iran which is the first step toward withdrawing from the nuclear here my understanding is that that is something you would support I would support increased sanctions on Iran I opposed the Iran nuclear deal I had great concerns with what happens after 2025 I have concerns that ballistic missiles were not included in the Iran nuclear deal so I think we need to be tough on Iran we need to work with our allies in the region and last week we heard from Prime Minister Mac Ron who also talked about the need to strengthen the deal he has a little bit of a different approach yes the burden on us not right did not leave the deal yeah he did talk about we need to answer questions as to what happens after 2025 to ensure that this deal does not pave the way towards Iran's nuclear weapons capability do you have confidence in the Trump administration's capability of handling this situation I mean the administration is in turmoil we've seen a lot of Exodus going on just the latest report that the the the FBI had that the president had selected who would be the first woman actually tried to withdraw her name and then subsequently did not plus you of the stormy Daniels situation going on and the president or at least Rudy Giuliani's suggestion that the President did in fact reimburse this private attorney for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars worth of hush money I mean all of this is sort of a swirl while these very important international matters are occurring well first of all when it comes to some of the accusations regarding the president I do support the Muller investigation I think that is the way to get to the eight ball or investing I have I have said that from the very beginning so I wholeheartedly support the Moller investigation and assume that some of those accusations will be part of that process separately when it comes to Iran and national security issues I have faith in our excellent national security team I've served with Mike Pompeo who is the Secretary of State he served in Congress while I was in Congress for my first term I think he is a tremendous voice I also have faith in people like the ambassador to the UN nikki Haley I think our Secretary of Defense Jim mattis who I've gotten to know because of my service on the House Armed Services Committee this is a strong national security team and I do have faith when it comes to the international stage on national security issues that we have the leadership team in place in this administration to achieve our goals rebuild our alliances and strengthen our national security but the key would be that the president actually allows that team to work in fact and does not undercut it which he has demonstrated he has a habit of doing well I think that if you look at ambassador Haley for example she is very independent she has I think walked that line of being an effective advocate for the administration's policies but when there has seemingly be under cuts from the administration she has stood up for her values and I think we again we have a very strong national security team I do a lot of change also going on in your conference so many members seeking or deciding not to seek reelection including the speaker who you have a long-standing relationship with Paul Ryan you assisted him when he ran for vice president are you worried about the future of your conference I'm not worried about the future of our conference I think that historically you are going to see more turnover now than you did let's say 20 years ago I think that's good for the institution and I think when it comes to speaker Ryan's decision this was a personal decision and it's a challenging time no doubt in terms of being in that position with a Republican majority work Senate and administration but I know Paul pretty well personally his oldest daughter is 16 that's the same age that Paul was when his father passed away and when he spoke to the conference and then a smaller group of members he really spoke from the heart and I wish him the best in the next chapter I think we have a lot of talented members who are rising up the ranks and what I'm really excited about is we have a lot of great incumbents in New York State in particularly upstate New York these are Republicans who are working hard representing their districts I think of people like John Catco John Faso who I work with every day and I think are doing a great job well I mean both of those are top targets actually now that you mentioned them of the Democrats in DC also yourself I mean there's a whole passel of Democrats who are seeking to unseat you and who are predicting that they will be successful because of the so-called blue wave your district has changed hands several times it was traditionally GOP and then subsequently went back and forth are you worried about the blue wave I'm focused on representing my district as you know Liz I've had tough elections since I ran in my primary and I'm very proud of my independent record and I'm very proud of the outcomes of those elections in my 2014 race I won by over 20 points and this last race I won by over 35 in my race in particular there's a very crowded Democratic field they are struggling to break out and they're not talking about issues that are really important in my district which is why I focused on dairy pricing issues and the upcoming farm bill veterans care making sure that I was an independent voice on the tax issue for example yeah they accuse you of being AWOL really I mean they say that you're not actually frequently in the district and you are not permanently living there what's your response to that my response is I've out worked everyone I've done over 700 district events I live in the district my voters know that they have sent me to Washington to vote on their behalf twice in overwhelming numbers it's not like I just got the Republican vote if you look at my voter outcome I've earned votes from Democrats and independents overwhelmingly and I'm going to continue to run that way I always at work my opponents just just last week during our district work week I had a dairy roundtable in Beekmantown I had a VA roundtable in Plattsburgh I visited two manufacturers in Fulton County the last District work week before that I had two high-profile town halls that went very well a one was in South Glens Falls the other was in Mariah so I you know that I work my district very hard and I am familiar with the issues but most importantly my constituents know that Liz and they know it's a it's a big district I have 194 towns and villages right and I make it a priority to get to the twelve counties as much as possible you bring up agriculture in the agriculture bill one of the key components of that is food stamps and we're having quite a battle over that and in fact the administration's effort to require more work requirements and you have you mentioned your colleague John Faso who's really taking some criticism on that what's your position my position is I support the farm bill that is working its way through the house we anticipate it will come to the House floor probably next week with the copy center proposed just to be clear so I support modernizing the SNAP program there will be no changes to snap programs for the seniors or for disabled or for single parents with young children but I do think having a pathway towards Economic Opportunity trying to think outside of the box when it comes to incentivizing educational programs training programs that's a good thing because every time I visited business in my district list they have available jobs and they're looking for the skillset to fill those jobs so I think having innovative solutions at the state level to provide increased training opportunities again increase educational opportunities that's a pathway out of poverty and I think these are important conversations we need to be having so these are positive reforms to the SNAP program without pulling the rug out from under seniors and for the from under those who are under the age of 18 as well as singer parents with young kids under the age of 5 the Congress told me before we ran out of time I know it's outside your purview but we're going through a significant situation here but we're all ticks with with the soon-to-be former state attorney general who is accused of sexual abuse and some very significant and disturbing allegations first I'd like to get to your reaction but also sort of on a broader platform if you will the me2 movement I mean there was for a while rumors that there would be a whole list of names of people who were outed from Washington DC that didn't happen necessarily and sort of efforts in terms of addressing sexual harassment kind of put on the back burner could you first respond to the to the Schneiderman scandal and then secondly do you think enough is being done in DC on sexual harassment well I was deeply desert disturbed when I read The New Yorker article last night regarding Schneiderman he made the right decision to resign his behavior there is no excuse for his behavior and I'm glad that members of his own party called for him to resign and we have a number of very talented prosecutors who I think should be considered by the assembly in the Senate to fill the attorney general role when it to Congress we need to take seriously updating our sexual harassment laws I'm pleased that the House passed on a very bipartisan basis updates to our standards in Congress I mean it is it is unacceptable that prior to that legislation that we passed it was unclear where victims would go they could go to the ethics committee they could go to a separate ethics committee and we need we needed to clarify that to make sure there have been some members that have resigned and stepped down due to sexual harassment so this is something that we need to continue to grapple with and it's why I'm focused on recruiting women I know there's a lot of focus on the number of democratic women running for Congress but as the NRC sees recruitment share I'm very proud that we have the highest number of Republican women ever running for the house ninety-one women running some of them have to get through primaries that includes our incumbents but we are moving in the right direction obviously there's more work to be done but that was one of my focuses as recruitment chair and you feel comfortable in Washington as a woman I do feel comfortable in Washington I have not been sexually harassed in Congress you know as a young woman you face different challenges in terms of how the media covers appearances for example I think any woman would tell you that was in the public eye but no I have not been sexually harassed in Congress well congresswoman we thank you very much of course New York 21 is one of the races that we're watching very closely we do appreciate your time and we will be talking with you again soon

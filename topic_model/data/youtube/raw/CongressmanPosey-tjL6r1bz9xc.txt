i'd now like to yield two minutes to the congressman from florida's eighth district bill posey but i'd also like to say he serves on financial services committee which has a big part in jurisdiction and and this bill that we're discussing but i'd also like to point out the distinction he had in working and serving in florida's senate whenever we had the election laws much was spoken about that over today and in some of the one minutes but worked in the florida senate and help work on the reform laws to what happened with the 2000 presidential race and so with that i'd like to yield two minutes to my dear friend from florida i thank the uh thank the gentleman from oklahoma madam speaker you know ironically it was my bill the elections reform act of 2001 after the closest presidential election in history decided by about 350 votes in my elections reform act after all that hostility passed 38 38 to 2 in the senate and 120 zip in the florida house and that's how election reform bills should pass if they don't pass with overwhelming majority of both sides they're not fair and they shouldn't be enforced americans are feeling a rise in prices at the gas pump and in our grocery stores favorite products are in short supply and some are even unavailable to make matters worse they're discovering that the resolution before us is full of wasteful spending and big tax increases the administration only responds to economic crises by making excuses and pointing fingers claiming supply chain disruptions and inflation are just high class problems is incredibly wrong you can call it what you want on tv but at the end of the day is just plain and simple bad policy and all this resolution does that we're asked to vote for is to green light more of it i i urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution and i yield back the balance of my time thank you

Nothing brings West
Virginians closer together than our love and
appreciation for the wild and wonderful outdoor
playground that we have been blessed with. For
generations, it has provided us endless
opportunities to explore and recreate with our
friends and family while improving our mental and
physical well being. That's why I'm incredibly
proud that my Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee voted to advance my bipartisan
America's Outdoor Recreation Act, which will
improve our recreation infrastructure, make it
easier for businesses to thrive in rural areas in
West Virginia and across the country, and ensure
our treasured public lands are accessible for
generations to come. As chairman of the Committee
and a lifelong outdoorsman, I am
committed to working with Ranking Member John
Barrasso from Wyoming and our colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to get our historic legislation
across the finish line and signed into law.

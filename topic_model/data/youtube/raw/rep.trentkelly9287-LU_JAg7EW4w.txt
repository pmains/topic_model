general Trent Kelly you're from Mississippi is recognized Thank You mr. speaker and I want to thank chairwoman Velazquez and ranking member Chabot for working to bring the VA SBA act to the House floor I also want to thank my friend mr. crow and co-sponsor from Colorado for working on this very important legislation I want to thank all of them for being champions of both our veterans and our small businesses all across America as we've heard in the hearings held in Small Business Committee the VA proactively verifies service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses while the SBA allows business owners to self-certify this process creates inconsistent outcomes such as a business qualifying as a service disabled veteran business for VA contracts but not other federal agency contracts while the SBA certified businesses awards are subject to scrutiny the lack of a front end verification leaves the door open for fraud and abuse we've already made significant strides in the right direction the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 instructed the SBA and VA to unify the definitions for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and became moving regulatory responsibility from the VA to the SBA additionally this administration has made substantial improvements in streamlining certifications for small businesses federal procurement programs the VA SBA Act marks the next significant step towards unification of the two programs under one umbrella at the SBA and reduce red tape and confusion for veteran small business owners thank you again for supporting this bill and I yield back

standby for a few moments because we want to bring in Illinois Democratic congressman Brad Schneider congressman Schneider from Illinois lobbied Israeli diplomats here to allow Ishita to leave an even Omar to enter Israel he joins me now a congressman thank you very much when you were talking to Israel's ambassador or other diplomats and persuade trying to persuade them that this should not be blocked what were you hearing from the Israelis well I had a long conversation with ambassador Dermer and I heard their concerns about the perspectives that both to leave in Omar have and quite obviously I've been critical of their positions on Israel long before this trip but the Ambassador had made a promise last month that all members of Congress would be welcomed to Israel I think that was the right policy I think the decision this week to block their entry was the wrong policy it puts Israel in a bad light I think it's short-sighted but I think it's also wrong democracies and in particular democracies like Israel like the United States should be celebrating the the work they do allowing people to come and see like the United States Israel is an imperfect democracy but show the strength stand the record should stand for itself this is our most important ally in the region and it can withstand the criticisms of two members of Congress or really anyone else in the world and congressman the the large amounts of foreign military aid to both Egypt and Israel coming out of Camp David all the way back in 1979 with James with President Jimmy Carter that has been sacked and Republican and Democratic administrations despite at times tension with Israel over settlements for instance from from previous presidents Democrat and Republican presidents that's not going to be touched is it there may be some controversy over it do you think that that could be at stake if this policy continued well I worry about it I worry Israel has two significant existential threats the first is Iran in all of its forms and we need to make sure not only that Iran can never get a nuclear weapon but push against them in in Syria their support of Hezbollah but the second is the bipartisan support of Israel within the United States Congress if that is lost than the the support for that aid the support for the our work our critical work together is put at risk last month I had the privilege of leading a resolution we got three hundred and ninety of members of Congress to vote in support of Israel the u.s. is a relationship Israel security and the commitment to a negotiated two-state solution and the condemnation of the global BDS movement there aren't a lot of issues where you can bring Congress together like that Israel's one of them and we've got to work to consistently make sure that remains the case the timing is also terrible from Israel's perspective when you think about the fact that they are always under fire at the United Nations General Assembly meetings when the world gathers at the end of September and unfairly under fire in many cases from different parts of the world and now there's going to be a lot more criticism of them for dupe for caving in to the president's pressure well part of the reason BDS is is so awful is that it divestment and sanctions movement it denies the Jewish aspiration for a state it refuses to support a two-state solution negotiated solution between Israelis and Palestinians it stands in the way in the way of peace but it is an effort to delegitimize Israel and it will find fertile ground when the UN meets next month that's why the bipartisan support in Congress for Israel remains so important why I wanted to make sure we had to vote on the resolution last month that shows that 398 members more than 95% of Congress supporting an issue I think is a pretty strong statement and I'm gonna work to make sure that we retain that support congressman Schneider thank you very much for being with us thanks again thank you you bet and let's bring back Chris

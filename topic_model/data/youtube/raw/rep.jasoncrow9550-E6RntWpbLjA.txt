well let's bring in democratic congressman jason crowe of colorado a member of the armed services committee he is also an army veteran who served in both iraq and afghanistan welcome congressman i forgot to talk with you about this um and look it's not a pleasant subject for someone like you particularly to hear but the trump administration is rolling out more defenders today amid all the fallout that reports are that the president denigrated u.s soldiers who were either killed or hurt in combat here's a little more let's listen to it a veterans affairs secretary robert wilke earlier have you ever heard the president disparage u.s service members or veterans well absolutely not and and i would be offended too if i thought it was true some of these sources that you cite are general officers i was born in khaki diapers i've spent my entire life around the military and i've never known any general officers to hide behind stars so what i'm looking at is the donald trump that i know the donald trump who has turned around veterans affairs so i'm curious what you make of that defense do you agree that the president has turned around veterans affairs has he done a lot for veterans for people like you well with the veterans that i represent in my community there is still a very long way to go and it's no surprise that the president's going to roll out loyalists and people that currently work for him to try to defend him but uh it's also no surprise that this happened i mean the president has a very long history of disparaging veterans of disparaging service members our fallen soldiers you know when he says things like that my mind automatically goes to the men and women that i serve with my friends that didn't come home from iraq and afghanistan you know if he's going to disparage our service men and women in our fallen he should name names so we know what he's talking about it's disgraceful that's the last full measure of his disgrace as i said on friday and it's time for the country to stand up and repudiate this man that is incapable of actually respecting and honoring a service and public service overall well let's take a listen together as the president speaks up in his own defense here's that nobody's done what i've done with the budgets with the military budgets with getting pay raises for our military i've done more for the military than almost anybody else it's a shame when a second rate magazine i don't read it i know very little about this magazine but when a second-rate magazine can write things like that about somebody that's done much so much for the military are the facts when you look at his record with the military well first of all i've been a member of congress for several years now and i actually sit on the armed services committee it's congress that makes the budgets i've sat in those hearings and i've actually helped put together the defense department budget it's congress that gave the pay raises to the troops not the president he signed the bill but it was our bill uh it was our budget uh they got that through and in terms of uh saying nobody has done anything more for the military than the president has that that is just uh absurd uh and beyond uh any a kind of realistic measure uh you know we we have a lot of challenges in our military this is somebody who has repeatedly turned his back on our allies uh who has pulled us out of syria and left our alliances and partners uh behind who you know goaded iran into attacking our soldiers in iraq and now we have over 100 soldiers in iraq that came under a missile attack and had traumatic brain injury there's incident after incident of him using the military in a transactional way or for political purposes and of course let's not for you forget ukraine one of our allies at war and withholding 250 million dollars of critical security and military aid for his own political purposes so i could go on for a very long time about this president's history of politicizing and using our men and women in uniform for his own benefit uh but you know it would not uh help to pile on at this point now we just have to repudiate this man and this president and move forward as a country i want to take a look at some parts of michael cohen's upcoming book with the washington post reporting that some of his major claims the former fixer and trump attorney alleging that trump made overt and covert attempts to get russia to interfere in the 2016 election and writing about the hush money payments which is long said trump was involved in you sir were an impeachment manager are any of his claims new or are they different from the information that you had well i have to be honest with you michael cohen is irrelevant to me uh you know there's a long history of this president uh being corrupt uh nepotistic using the powers of the office to further his own campaign and personal uh personal benefit over and over and over again the fact that we have just one more person that's piling on this very long and established record of corruption by this president and misuse of official resources and collusion with russia you know we don't need michael cohen to tell us that there was collusion with russia we know it uh dozens of other people have proven it uh there are facts out there despite what uh the president and his enablers and uh other folks might say uh so this is just one more example and you know whether michael cohen puts this in a book uh for his own benefit or not that doesn't concern that do you think though had michael cohen uh been more forthcoming at the time if some of the things that are in this book were uh proven to be true during the time in the impeachment would that have helped your case during the impeachment well i don't think we needed additional help by our case and impeachment we proved our case during the impeachment in fact many republican senators admitted to us as much that we you know beyond any doubt proved that what we were saying happened with regard to ukraine happened and they believed us they just weren't willing to impeach because they didn't have the personal or political courage to do so so i don't think we needed any additional assistance i think we established a you know very clearly what happened uh and uh you know whether michael cohen puts in the book or not uh or whether you know ambassador bolton puts it in a book or not doesn't matter the facts and the record are pretty clear and pretty well established right you are to bring ambassador bolton in that conversation as well democratic congressman jason crow of colorado very nice talking with you sir i look forward to seeing you again thank you

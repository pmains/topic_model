thank you madam chair uh and ranking member melanie i appreciate the uh it's important hearing and uh the legislative proposals though create some peace of mind i think for our financial institutions cfpb created uh under dodd-frank uh it has been identified to fail to safeguard some proprietary information given to the bureau by financial institutions let me be clear we all agree that we need to have stride stringent consumer protections but these reforms are much needed common sense measures i believe specifically my bill h.r 3871 the proprietary information protection act immediately closes a loophole created under the cfpb creation unlike current statutes regarding other federal agencies assessing relevant information accessing that relevant information dodd-frank failed to provide such protections the simple truth is that the cfpb could largely legally share privileged information with third parties at this point absent specific congressional legislation the courts have permitted this practice in the case of other federal agencies uh richard cordray director of the cfpb appointed by president obama recently testified that this was a quote oversight and that he supports a legislative solution to ensure privileged information is not leaked to third parties through the cfpb my bill is that real legislative solution a common sense fix that would put an end to needless uncertainty and legal costs to both the cfpb and financial institutions i appreciate the opportunity to be here today with us thank you mr conseco for one minute

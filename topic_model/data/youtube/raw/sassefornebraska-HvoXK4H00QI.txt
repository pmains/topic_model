Wow the rascal senator Ben Sasse is here to talk about the Republicans who are running for president on his scale of conservatism good morning to you senator good morning Steve thanks for having me let's start with your colleague Ted Cruz Ted's a consistent guy he's a constitutional conservative and he's shown it before the Supreme Court a lot of times fightin for the Constitution when he was the SG of Texas okay it would you say some have said he's the most conservative would you say that I think it's we're blessed we have an abundance of riches in this party there are a whole bunch of pro constitution guys and gals running in this primary I'm excited about it absolutely another one is Marco Rubio another colleague of yours yeah I mean marco is an optimistic storyteller who paints a vision of American greatness in this next century and it's built on a constitutional set of commitments it sees an exciting guy in candidate what about Carly Fiorina I mean she's obviously a competent able practical leader we need more Outsiders this the city doesn't work well and I think Carly's a breath of fresh air the way she communicates makes everybody hi no in Nebraska want to hear her on a debate stage with Hillary Clinton what about my governor from New Jersey chris Christie that guy is not only tough in the fact that as a former prosecutor he would want to take the fight to Isis and al-qaeda residue and talk about the global jihadi fight he's willing to tackle the heart issues with voters and talk about entitlement reform and we need more of that blunt speech what about dr. ben Carson he is so inspirational I'm so grateful for the way dr. Carson gives everybody hope again about America we need more servant leaders like ben Carson and Washington who come here to promulgate a framework for ordered Liberty not trying to make Washington the center of American life and dr. Carson is an exciting inspirational figure for us and finally and this should be the best one how about Donald Trump who referred to you as a gym rat in a tweet mr. mr. Trump that not only witty and funny frankly as the son of a football and wrestling coach I will embrace gym rat he could have critiqued my teeth or go at a lot of things that would have you know made me a little more anxious but frankly gym rat I'm going to own that one hundred percent mr. Trump is an unknown though this is a guy who says if people screw you screw them back feels like he might be advised by Lois Lerner that's not the kind of thing we need to make America great again we need a constitutional republic again and what I hear from Nebraskans is while mr. Trump is great at diagnosis we don't really know what he's for he's right that America is in a crisis but that isn't a joke it's a serious matter so you just say you know he's an unknown quantity so it's hard for you to grade the guy doesn't talk about the Constitution he doesn't talk about limits on government he doesn't talk about rolling back President Obama's executive unilateralism all right Ben Sasse the senator from Nebraska Ben thank you very much for joining us

johnson republicans senator ron johnson says he wants to rein in federal spending as the biden administration moves forward with its massive infrastructure reform plan worth trillions of dollars spectrum news one washington correspondent torreira small catching up with the senator about his recommendations for fixing the country's old bridges and roads members of the president's cabinet as they make pitches to several house committees over the coming weeks face a tough sale to gop lawmakers it doesn't seem there's any effort whatsoever to reach some kind of bipartisan consensus which you would probably find on an infrastructure bill i think we all recognize that so much of our basic infrastructure highways bridges are have gone without proper maintenance for for decades and they need to be addressed the hang up for republicans a hefty price tag under the american jobs plan the administration looks to spend 2 trillion on improving infrastructure increasing energy efficiency and other items senator ron johnson believes increasing the national debt isn't the answer especially after washington passed several covet relief bills worth trillions more the first thing i would suggest is you know right rather than spend it on non-covert relief you know why don't we reallocate that 721 billion dollars it'll be spent if we don't repurpose it and what let's repurpose that toward infrastructure senator johnson like other republicans slamming the proposal are calling for more targeted spending instead of wide-reaching reform is there anything specifically in wisconsin you would like to see address or or targeted and that could fall under the umbrella of infrastructure reform that is necessary well since i entered office we've been concerned about the the locks and dams down the mississippi to you know for transportation of agriculture products and other products so i think that's an issue we have the same issue in terms of aging highways and bridges as well uh we have ports that need to be addressed so there are a number of things that we do need to address in wisconsin but again 721 billion dollars would go a long way without further mortgaging our kids future in washington taurean small spectrum news

adding the White House's latest opening Salvo appears to have touched a nerve among Congressional Republicans we have Republican congresswoman Kat kamek of Florida member of the House Homeland Security committee here with us today congresswoman thank you for giving us a little bit of your time this holiday week and happy New Year to you it's going to be interesting in the new year to say that the least now there's no secret that the GOP is going to launch a flurry of Investigations they've been seeking answers answers already or just really some of the things they might use to ultimately come to answers your thoughts on how the White House is approaching this before things really even get underway well Happy New Year to you and and everyone out there watching but you know this is the this is the part that is really frustrating for the new incoming majority you already have the White House coming out playing political games and saying they're going to slow walk everything but what we have seen is really just a continuation of what they've done for the last two years I can tell you as the ranking member for a subcommittee on homeland security it took nearly eight months to get responses and receipts for 130 million dollars that the bite Administration took from a homeless veterans program and redirected to the Border they did it really quietly but they didn't want to share any of that information so you can imagine that going into this majority they're going to do everything they possibly can to stop any request from every committee that is an oversight committee which of course in Congress every single committee is an oversight body and they're going to do everything they can to turn the spin machine gene on to misdirect and show the American people that oh look over here there's something going on when reality is that there are some really nefarious things going on within this Administration do you think that the White House can slow things down but ultimately answers will come forth absolutely you know the one thing that the Republican majority is focused on is walking and chewing gum at the same time which in Congress they haven't really been able to see that out of this Democrat majority not only are we going to be holding all these accountability measures uh holding this Administration uh to account for all their failures but also working to do the things that we need to get done on behalf of the American people bringing down Energy prices firing the 87 000 IRS agents that the bite Administration hired at the expense of working class folks we're going to be doing these two things of in a very aggressive agenda to help Americans get back on their feet while securing our borders and holding the bite Administration accountable I think the American people need to see both because that's what they've demanded in these midterm elections and I'm excited for us to get started come January 3rd of all the things you want to get answers on you know there were so many on that list what do you think is the most important uh I mean really there's so many things that have gone awry you can point to of course the Border crisis which is the largest border crisis that we've experienced uh the failures the the negligence the dereliction of Duty there the Afghanistan withdrawal which cost the 13 service members their life uh you can go on and on and on about Conor Biden you can go on about my orcas you can talk about the crime wave of the 300 people A Day in the United States that are dying from fentanyl as a result of the open borders there is a no shortage of items that we have to address but at the end of the day we are responsible for our national security and so we've got to secure our borders we've got to get this economy back on track and we got to reduce the size and scope of government that has infiltrated every aspect of Our Lives a little shift in topic here the Wall Street journals Kimberly strassel writes in this op-ed House Republicans plan committee and sensors and snoops an expert a sources tell me that the House Republicans plan to set up a panel under the Judiciary Committee tentatively called the a select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government the title kind of a recognition that the recent Revelations about government meddling in speech and politics go Way Beyond the FBI the Twitter files have also shown the FBI was facilitating censorship requests from other parts of government add this to the other disturbing government moves to use its power to silence or track citizens your thoughts on a potential effort to delve into the role that government not to mention agencies like the FBI have played in in our social media the ability of Americans to communicate in free speech absolutely I mean if anything that we've seen over the last two years has shown us is that the Biden Administration will go to any length to really weaponize every single agency at their disposal including the IRS in which we saw them hire 87 000 new IRS agents not to address the backlog where we still have returns from 2019 being processed but to audit working class Americans or the doj which we saw weaponized uh weaponized to go after parents who were concerned about their children's education you look at the FBI and their collusion with these big tech companies to censor our first amendment rights and speech If there really is no end to where this goes I mean we've seen under the USDA where they have picked and choose and uh chosen who gets their loans paid off completely but you have to check a certain box I mean this is really what is so egregious about the Biden Administration that they are picking and choosing winners and lose users and so when you look at a subcommittee a select committee like this it's really critical because we need to explain to the American people how this Administration has weaponized these agencies but more importantly how we are going to dismantle that and fix it so it doesn't ever happen again you know President Biden also signed that massive funding bill into law yesterday another 1.7 trillion trillion dollars tacked on to sort of the spending Legacy well it's true that the bill did get some bipartisan support most on the right are pretty miffed about some of the items that have been stuffed in there's some of the pork uh here's what critics call pork the liberal goodies the Sky High spending Bill the the white house but this is the Optics of this the White House actually flew this massive bill for signing to Saint Croix uh and on the taxpayer dime as well just the the Optics of that the bill itself and then the Optics of the signing absolutely disgusting not only does this 1.7 trillion dollars uh just basically pour gasoline on the record historic inflation that we have seen and dealt with for the last year and a half plus but we are now funding all these pet projects like the Michelle Obama hiking trail in Georgia and a bunch of community centers around the country named after Senators it's absolutely ridiculous that when folks Across America are dealing with decisions like do I pay rent or do I get gas in my car what do I do about putting groceries in the refrigerator this winter when the heating bill has gone up four times these are the things that we normal Americans are contending with and the president of the United States has the nerve to not only be vacationing at a super mega donors uh island in the ver in in the tropics but then has to have the bill flown at taxpayer expense so that he can sign this 4 000 page monstrosity it's disgusting it's under acceptable and he should be ashamed Americans across this country regard of political affiliation ought to be absolutely outraged there are a lot of Republicans that feel that way as well uh congresswoman thank you so much for

[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell I'd like to welcome you to the latest edition of to the point our country is long overdue for meaningful tax reform that helps middle and working class families succeed for too long the American middle class has seen wages remain stagnant while special interest groups in the wealthy have exploited the system to their own benefit Democrats have been fighting to give the American people what they want a fair tax code for everybody which will provide relief to the middle class and put Americans back to work in good-paying jobs that's what we want unfortunately we have not been able to walk a bipartisan Road on tax reform the Republican tax plan that first passed and the Ways and Means Committee provides large corporations with about two trillion dollars in tax giveaways while dismantling and number of middle class tax relief provisions most notably in my state the state and local tax deduction better an assault which provides a long standing measure relief a deduction for over forty four million Americans throughout this great country according to the Tax Policy Center the largest beneficiaries of the Republican tax plan be higher earners especially millionaires and billionaires many of whom have come out against the tax plan anyway it would prepare that the Republicans are dead set on increasing taxes on working Americans while giving huge breaks to our nation's top earners including the President himself many of his cabinet members for those who are well-acquainted with the particulars of tax policy like my guest this Republican attempt at providing tax cuts for the wealthy may seem all too familiar representing Massachusetts 1st Congressional District Congressman Richard Neal is with us today congressman Hill is a former teacher like myself served as president of the Springfield City Council I was a councilman I was a mayor before him being elected and what when he was mayor 1983 that's when he was sworn in he's been a member of the House of Reps since 1988 and I've had the pleasure of serving with him on the house of ways and means committee since 2007 which he serves as the ranking Democrat he's my boss kindness McNeal has been a leader on economic policies for an emphasis on tax reform and I want to start off with this question if I may very important question where are their heads this is a nonpartisan program I've had Republicans on Democrats on Ritchie I know you're straight guy you'll say it like it is we're what do they want to accomplish by the tax bill that by this time the viewers will see it bill that passed the House of Representatives and the Senate will we will work and debate their bill what I intend to accomplish with this bill well I think as they dismantled many of the middle-class benefits that are currently in the tax code they've advertised this as a pro-growth economic agenda but when you have a chance to sort through the details of what they're proposing you quickly come to a different conclusion I can't for the life of me understand how you would want to take away the student interest loan deduction I can't understand why you would want to shave back the mortgage interest deduction I can't understand why you would want to take away the state and local tax deduction those are all very important to the middle class we when we were starting out looking at homes for the first time the rule of thumb for all of us was that you should never buy a home that was more than 25% of your income is correct well that's all changed now for many young people across the country they're putting 35 and 40 percent into the home because that is not only their most important asset but it's their bank account too right and I think with this argument that all of a sudden you can shave back the mortgage interest deduction to essentially provide a tax cut for people at the very top by repealing the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax which only four point five million americans pay and they're all for the most part upper income americans and the estate tax we took care of the middle class in the all-tournament of attacks a few years back two years ago the middle class doesn't pay AMT anymore now we're dealing with the Trump's of the world yeah that's exactly right and what finn's with this doing away with the AMT for those folks well they abolish it yeah when you remember when you do tax reform you need money right so if you take this revenue stream away from the federal government then you have to go someplace else in the tax code because after all we do have to support Social Security and Medicare and our military and our veterans all of those are parts of the obligations that we hold based on future contracts and I think that in the instance that we're discussing here the middle class is being asked and again sacrifice what they have right so that we might get rid of the estate tax or we might get rid of the alternative minimum tax or four people in Paterson New Jersey I think that something that's again very relevant the historic tax credit right I mean that's a large city that's a killer that's a lot a lot of people who might have lived outside the city to decide that they want to come in and fix up an old brownstone or they want to redo a neighborhood right so then that strengthens the tax base of Paterson while simultaneously bringing people back to the city who have a vested interest in the success of the city and for the states that are high-touch States because of services need for a number of people that are there the infrastructure etc etc what are they do lay off state troopers in New Jersey in order to deal with you can't use this as a deduction that the state and local taxes that's a huge part of the revenue well the other part of this that's entirely speculative based upon the the term may be this has been advertised as a pro-growth tax measure and someone has they are guaranteeing that you're gonna have growth north of three percent you can't find a mainstream economist who says that that guarantee is to be embraced but this is what they're telling all of us it didn't happen in 2001 2003 tax cuts it in fact we saw what the result of that was there was negligible economic growth the slowest since Herbert Hoover with the Bush tax accounting collapse well you had the collapse but you also had two point three trillion dollars taken out of the federal revenue stream and then if you recall by the time we got to 2004 the other idea that was going to be about pro-growth economics was repatriation so there was a significant tax holiday talked about them I'll show in our in our tax system because we tax income on a worldwide basis until that revenue that's made offshore is returned home you don't have to pay tax on it and when you do pay tax on it you essentially take a tax credit against the revenue that you returned home even though you bring it back right and what happened was that money was said to be for job growth a new economic plan and it was brought back at 5.25% that's all I had to pay on it 20,000 people were laid off almost immediately that's not your rate that's not my way that's right not to people the first District of Massachusetts not not the rate of the people in ninth district because of the of New Jersey my district either in many districts throughout this country and the money was used for stock buybacks and dividends and salaries for people at the top now I'm fine with that if you tell everybody that's what you're going to do with you then let's have the argument but we know this it wouldn't pass right but when you say we're gonna bring it back for job creation and we're gonna invigorate the economy right and encourage more risk-taking none of that happened so you had three huge tax cuts during that period of time and the result was again very slow economic well that's what I'm getting and that they're saying because they're doing this for those one or two percenters or 10% or that that money's gonna be invested in jobs that did not happen in the past axe cuts that we've had why is it gonna happen this time it won't happen this time none of the economists thing that seemed to think it'll happen you have the Wharton School that says this is bogus right you have in addition to the Wharton School you have goldman sachs and many republican mainstream economists right Doug Cole taken all right do you have Mark Zandi right you have Bruce Bartlett who all the Republicans are involved they are the ones that Bruce Bartlett authored the temp the Jack Kemp tax cuts he authored President Reagan's 1981 tax cut he said this idea that is being promulgated that tax cuts pay for themselves is not censoring and what it what kind of a deficit what kind of a hole in his deficit that this country has in his complain about all of the Hawks on the hill well they only complain with Bill Clinton's president that's right or when Barack Obama's president right so when Clinton leaves let's take a look at in the rearview mirror on January 19th of 2001 the budget of imbalanced for four years in a row right the most profound economic growth in American history occurred 23 million new jobs and a five trillion dollar projected surplus this is the trouble with making projections nobody could project the events of 9/11 nobody at the time would have said later on that oh there's gonna be a recession that you're gonna start losing 800,000 jobs a month at the end of the Bush years and you need a cushion but because the money had been returned in the tax cuts advertised again is everybody getting a tax cut but when you looked at the distribution tables it was a very different conclusion or people at the top drew massive tax relief and people at the bottom had very small but tax gratification after that so when you get rid of all of these deductions that are really hurting people the Alzheimer deduction for crying out people have serious injury serious sicknesses are no longer gonna be able to deduct that well not only now we're late saying we regularly celebrate increases in American longevity yeah we say oh isn't it great that now the average meal I think is at almost 80 years old and the average females at 81 but those numbers keep going north right but it also has a another tangible impact and that is as people live longer there's going to be more dementia that's current there's going to be more Alzheimer's right so they're saying essentially with this tax cut that you're on your own that's exactly what they're saying and the other place you know that you take the inheritance tax state tax the thing they've convinced people over the last ten years that everybody's going to get a windfall when Uncle Louie passes away or when your dad passed away father god forbid but the fact that the matter is were only talking really about 5200 families in the whole country so they made people think this is the death touch the government is killing you when people aren't paying federal taxes it might be playing some state taxes on your estate that's a different thing we have nothing to do with that only 5200 families and there are Democrats who want to remove farmers from that altogether over the past several years the last compromise that we reached on the estate tax was that individuals could keep five and a half million dollars in a married couple could keep 11 million dollars well without any taxes either I mean Gary Cohen who is the president chief economic adviser he recently said and I quote you got to be stupid to pay the estate tax ooh anybody who knows anything about tax law you would know that life insurance gets people around the estate tax and the other part of it that I think is really important on the estate tax to acknowledge is that America is about upward mobility say we don't live and work in the House of Lords where peerage dominates based upon hereditary right instead ours is if you've got some ability and talent you move and I think that the problem with the estate tax as it sits is that it would create a permanent sense of aristocracy in America the same people would go to the same medical schools in the same law schools in the same accounting screen I mean the idea of America is you get a chance right and I think that by maintaining the estate tax it encourages more entrepreneurship and upward mobility with no risk taking we're talking about a fair of fair tax system this is what the guys and gals worked on in 1985 Bill Bradley the state senator me and I say senator from New Jersey Reagan Tip O'Neill Jack Kemp they all worked on this they worked hard it was bipartisan from the very beginning they had many hearings right Richard they had over 400 witnesses or 200 or 400 50 150 what is we had no witnesses from the time that Dick Gephardt and Bill Bradley filed the bill in 1982 yeah there were three years they had 30 hearings 450 witnesses in the secretary of the treasury said in the Ways and Means room where was my notion by the way there was no representation I thought I was ready I'll be very honest with you when he said that New Jersey is being subsidized by West Virginia Alabama Louisiana when we get 60 70 cents back on a buck that we said every buck we send down here and wrestler Ginny gets four dollars and 40 cents from every dollar they send on her who's subsidizing home look we're in America Charlie Rangel and I had a bill in 2007 to reduce the corporate taxes right from 35 to 25 we thought that was fair at the time that was although it wasn't that we did we did anything they had the majority we at that time we had the majority let's do it he couldn't get the cooperation to do it why are we always being accused of being the tax-and-spend party we want to be fair for the billionaire want to be fair for the guy that's a labor we are taxing labor now we are not taxing assets of what they used to be tagged we're not cattle running a class at a meeting at the White House in 2001 within a matter of days after George W Bush became president he invited me to the Oval Office to talk about taxes and he told me what he was thinking of and he asked me what I thought Cheney was there as was a Paul O'Neill the secretary of the Treasury there about seven or so of us in the room and I said you know mr. president there's enough money there why don't we just do a middle-class tax cut and continue to pay down the debt it was ignored and when I look back at that that was a moment where we could have really given the middle class a handsome tax cut yes the rich in America at the time we're not asking for a tax cut they weren't asking for it their attitude is look the economy is doing ok we'd like it no you're right we don't need this tax cut right now let's invest it people in the middle class they spend a tax cut right people at the top don't save it they don't create jobs either they saved the market jobs a different way than the one we're trying to plan and we're taking money out this huge deficit is a burden on our children and our grandchildren well it's 2.3 trillion dollars that is being borrowed for the purpose of giving tax cuts to the people at the top so it's really like taking this the nation's revenue system to the casino yeah and they're gambling maybe this will happen but what happens if it doesn't doesn't I want to talk about one other thing we've been talking about the fact that American corporations are being taxed so high I was over in Germany this summer we get a whole economics symposium the average corporation in the United States is not paying thirty five percent taxes it's paying 18 19 and a half percent a half percent how are they doing that it's by taking advantage of preferences deductions and exclusions in the tax code and some of those for good reason are justified and others are the work of clever advocates and I understand that yeah I have no legal reason to do that but that's right people are not gonna pay more than they have to right I understand that and there is a difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance right then one of the problems we have now internationally is what we call stateless income all right its profits that are booked in nations where there's virtually no rate at all so all of a sudden let's say you make the money in Berlin but you decide to report the transaction as having taken place in Bermuda right because there's no corporate tax they don't corporate things and so that money just so should be will be shot let me see the Apple pension all federal taxes well I think that what you look at is that they are now in a corrective period in Dublin for example where they had two addresses in in Dublin at one time and recall that in our system we say we want to see economic substance right that's the key term right and stateless income at the time there were two addresses one of which there was no economic substance and that's where the profit was booked and the Irish government by the way they've begun to address this issue right okay can we force corporations to invest in jobs when we get them to bring the money back no you can't and I think that that's something we need to be concerned about because I think there are going to be more stock buybacks and pavements and I think that it'll be reported as good management which is fine but I also think that the the more important consideration here is we had a chance in this round to invest in some human capital the Labor Department reported this week that there were six million jobs available in America right now that goes onto this before I want you to be very very specific about this it's very important for people year we have a skill set problem in America part of it is due to globalization part of it is due to technology part of it is due to the gig economy there's more temp work right but one of the real challenges we have is that we don't have the workers that are capable of filling a lot of these jobs hear that hear that and I think investment in community colleges investment in internship program textbook and something that you and I that's exactly right as mayor we were both know you can't even find teachers today to work in vocational schools and yet the economy is begging for vocational school graduates right and I think that we went through a parent that's human capital and I also think that the rewards are immediate we have 18,000 precision manufacturing jobs in New England right now the smallest geographic area of the country than average $65,000 you angel full benefits that's right good benefit we lost good-paying manufacturing jobs we want to get those good manufacturing jobs back as much as we can we're never gonna be the same manufacturing giant that we were no but there's a lot of manufacturing jobs that go on in America today solutely and we should be afraid of people getting their hands dirty we want all of our kids to go to college many of them would do it better in the field right by putting bread on the table if they had a skill if they had a technical there's nothing embarrassing about that anymore not only there's nothing embarrassing about it they tend to have great careers yeah and but it's gonna require something beyond high school but maybe short of a bachelor's degree need welders you need welders we do need them yeah one asked well I doubt you sure what are we doing in what do you in I was ranking member of trade I'd ask you this question but as congressman to congressman and citizen to citizen what heck are we doing developing this trade policy what is the trade policy I've laid out principles for us to deal with we need multilateral deal I'm not a very nation my nation would have enough time for that how do you see what direction you see us going in in trade well III think that I was disappointed that we have not engaged TTIP the trade agreement with Europe I think that is extraordinary potential and it's hard to argue that they don't have a similar lifestyle they live longer than we do and many of their quality of life calculations are pretty solid and they also tend to be seafaring people they have the history of trade so I think that there's an opportunity there to engage on TTIP I'm okay with reviewing NAFTA it's 23 years old let's not bombing but I don't think that it's a good idea for us to threaten Canada which is our number one trading partner we had our meeting with Trudel that's right and it proved to be very interesting the very things that he talks about in terms of labor and the environment for instance and security cyber security right down the line we proved with the bilateral agreement with Peru that you could include environmental concerns the right to organize a union and human rights right and they accepted it that all three counts and I think that that's the that's the standard that we ought to employ going forward I mean one of the things that we can guarantee in these agreements is the right to organize a union sure and not a government-sponsored union that was the problem with TPP I think Vietnam right was paying such a low wage and and I'm in favor of the idea of taking a tougher position on wages as it relates to Mexico as well but you know America our America leads the way and if we start to walk away from some of these agreements you know recently if you recall after the President removed us from TPP he said that we could engage these bilateral agreements and then after the Brits left brexit used brexit the president said we'll have a bilateral well I want to assure you by the time that starts and by the time it finishes that'll be so far down the road there'll be a different president and that's all there is to it years to do these things yeah the wage thing is very very we need to put pressure on anybody week week and and Kenner doesn't have any problems without anything no they don't the way Trudeau is going is very interesting their next round which is going on I think next week a fifth round yeah is a being them being Mexico right and and we will learn we are trying to stress the fact of article one such a name the Congress makes the trade deals and administration has its role as well I think in the past on the Democratic and Republican presidents we've been very hesitant to second-guess the administration whatever it was I don't think that's good for us either well I also think that part of the the problem that we have with trade today is that we suggest by some of our positions that we don't think we can compete in the world we can compete in the world on right nobody does in Auto charity productivity nobody does innovation and creativity the way we do one of the challenges we have today in the modern world is that you can do production anywhere right they replicate what we create and they sell a cheaper because it's yours down the road I mean it's the example of the iPhone look at China you know China is manufacturing more the products that come to United States from other countries but they don't event them no there are in other countries they're all it employs us we need to compete with them Obama one dose right if we don't get now I was against the TPP for a number of reasons her we couldn't work this out right well the other part of it is that I think you correctly note is that why would we not be working with Australia we're forfeiting that to that part of the world in Asia or an ally in India yeah why wouldn't we be engaging in that sort of a back and forth apps to make it work and and I also think that the danger is that if we walk away it creates a huge void you've been very strong advocate of trade I've been a strong advocate of fair trade and yeah another to Train shall meet but the question of the matter is how do we get all these sides together the the the chairman of the trade subcommittee good friend of mine Dave Reich a Republican from Washington was tiring by the way he's reluctant to have meetings because his president is nowheres near what he's thinking about trade had I'm closer to the President on trade than he is many times well if you live on the East Coast of the United States and you consider the day-to-day activities that take place at for example in the port of Boston right Logan Airport our economy in Massachusetts is one-third trade related there you know I mean those are the kinds of statistics so I understand reshaping them to our satisfaction but I use the other example of Panama why would we not have a trade agreement with Panama I mean you just they just got done doubling the size of the Panama Canal right and now we're all right which we're all competing now for dollars so that we can dredge our ports up and down the East Coast because those tankers are gonna come up the East Coast so I think that that's a very sensible trade policy and by the way piano MA has a decent living standard yes it does is it not he still understands you know when we go back to the campaign last year and the president blasted all these trade deals I voted against some of those training I do too SH what the fact but the fact of the matter is you can't just destroy it and then figure that you're gonna deal each country at a time when that's not going to happen we need to deal with the sections of the country of the world and many times we have this multilateral agreement that or possible agreement that we could work with them so I think when you look at TTIP you probably would agree with 95% of what's in there what's TTIP tell her on TTIP or the agreement that we would have at Europe right European Union and why we gotta shut that good job why we would not have a trading relationship with Europe at the I mean that's was part of our discussion was when I went to Germany this this summer I mean they getting there getting mixed signals - that's like look Richie I really believe that your presence and I'm blowing smoke you know when I disagree I disagree with you you let people know yesterday ya know but you you have been such a breath of fresh air on the Ways and Means Committee as as the leader of the Democrats and you you know you've always worked with the other side which is what you all I'm doing we never had a shot on this fact now that was the problem we were they didn't want a stadium on us there they didn't want us there and you know the chairman had his way and this is not bipartisan by any stretch I'm glad the American people are with us on this even they could pass all the bills that they want they said let's get a victory and then find a policy well they needed a victory this may not be the one they're looking for I don't know but they have it now I want to thank you for watching this edition to the point Ritchie Neel was a great guest today this tipic a topic típica this topic is timely but complicated I appreciate your attention you've heard our thoughts and I want you to hear what you think about today's show so you have any comments concerns or questions stay tuned on address our phone number the

u.s. senator walking all the way across the state of Connecticut Chris Murphy he says people are much more open when he's not wearing a suit and tongue the people I meet were working 60 hours a week who barely have health insurance they tell me their problems I pick up ideas about what I need to be doing in Washington we talked about health care I'm chatting with him closely about gun control they're grounded me in the issues that I'm focused on in the Senate he fights for the people of Connecticut they deserve to have a strong voice in Washington I'm Chris Murphy and I approve this message

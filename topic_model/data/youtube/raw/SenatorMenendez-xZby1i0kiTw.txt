A SENATOR: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MENENDEZ: MR. PRESIDENT, I COME TO THE FLOOR ONCE AGAIN TODAY TO SEEK UNANIMOUS CONSENT FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE DANIEL ANDURAL JUDICIAL SECURITY AND PRIVACY ACT OF 2021. I SAY ONCE AGAIN, BECAUSE A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO, I CAME TO THE FLOOR SEEKING UNANIMOUS CONSENT FOR THIS SAME EXACT BILL, WHICH WAS REPORTED OUT OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE LAST DECEMBER WITH OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN INSPECTORS AND WHOSE NAMESAKE IS DANIEL ANDRUL, THE 20-YEAR-OLD SON OF U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE ESTHER SOLIS. THE JUDGE IS IN THE GALLERY TODAY, HOPING WE COME TOGETHER AS A BODY TO DELIVER REAL SOLUTIONS TO HONOR HER FAMILY BY ENSURING THAT NO FEDERAL JUDGE OR THEIR FAMILY EXPERIENCE THE SAME VIOLENCE SHE AND HER FAMILY FACED. ONE YEAR, TEN MONTHS, AND 27 DAYS AGO HER SON DANIEL WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY A GUNMAN WHO TARGETED JUDGE SALIS FOR HER GENDER, ETHNICITY, AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ACCEPT HER JUDGMENT IN A CASE THAT REACHED HER COURT. EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE JULY 19 OF 2020, JUDGE SOLIS AND HER HUSBAND, MARK, HAVE ENDURED THE IMMENSE GRIEF OF BURYING THEIR ONLY SON. MR. PRESIDENT, NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SUCH A DEVASTATING LOSS. YET, IN THE FACE OF SO MUCH PAIN, JUDGE SOLIS HAS CHANNELED IT INTO PURPOSE, EMBARKING ON A PERSONAL MISSION TO INCREASE THE SAFETY AND PRIVACY OF HER FELLOW JUDGES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE MURDERER WAS ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS HORRIFIC HATE CRIME USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, TRACKING DOWN JUDGE SOLIS TO HER HOME IN NEW JERSEY, GRAVELY INJURING HER HUSBAND, AND MURDERING DANIEL IN COLD BLOOD WHEN HE ANSWERED THE DOOR. AS I SAID THE LAST TIME I CAME TO THE FLOOR SEEKING UNANIMOUS CONSENT, NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE SUCH A DEVASTATING LOSS. BUT IN THE MONTHS SINCE THEN, AND NOW, OUR COUNTRY HAS SEEN THE TRAGIC RESULTS OF INACTION. ON JUNE 4, A RETIRED COUNTY JUDGE IN WISCONSIN WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN HIS HOME BY A GUNMAN WHO APPEARED BEFORE HIS COURT. JUST FOUR DAYS LATER, A MAN WAS ARRESTED NEAR JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S HOME IN MARYLAND AFTER BEING FOUND WITH A GUN, A KNIFE, AND A PLAN TO KILL THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. REPORTS SUGGEST THE PERPETRATOR FOUND JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S ADDRESS ONLINE. WE CANNOT TAKE THESE EVENTS AS ISOLATED INCIDENTS. THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JUDGE SALAS' SON, THE HORRIFIC KILLING OF A RETIRED JUDGE IN WISCONSIN, THE INTENT ON JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S LIFE DEMAND CONGRESS ACT TO PROTECT THOSE WHO SIT IN THE JUDICIARY. SIMPLY PUT, WE MUST PREVENT ANY OTHER JUDGE FROM HAVING TO ENDURE THE THREATS AND SENSELESS VIOLENCE THAT THESE FAMILIES HAVE EXPERIENCED. AFTER THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY JUDGE SALAS AND MARK SUFFERED. SENATOR BOOKER AND I MADE PERSONAL COMMITMENTS TO HONOR DANIEL'S LEGACY THROUGH ACTION. WE TOLD HER WE WOULD NOT REST UNTIL WE ENACTED GREATER PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO SERVE ON THE BENCH, TO PROTECT ANY OTHER JUDGE FROM HAVING TO ENDURE THE SENSELESS VIOLENCE JUDGE SALAS EXPERIENCED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THIS BRANCH OF OUR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO RENDER DECISIONS THAT ARE FREE FROM FEAR. FREE FROM FEAR. THAT THEY WILL RENDER IMPARTIAL JUSTICE FREE FROM FEAR OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO THEM AS A RESULT OF THEIR JUDGMENT. WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT WORK TODAY IN THIS CHAMBER. THE BIPARTISAN BILL I SEEK UNANIMOUS CONSENT FOR IS AN EFFORT I'M PROUD TO LEAD WITH 12 COLLEAGUES, INCLUDING SENATORS BOOKER, DURBIN, GRAHAM, KENNEDY, CRUZ AND GRASSLEY. OUR BILL WOULD PROTECT THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ASSAILANTS HAVE USED TO TARGET JUDGES AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S A COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE THE U.S. MARSHAL SERVICE TO MONITOR ONLINE THREATS AND DETER FUTURE ATACTS -- ATTACKS. IT WAS VOTED OUT OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WITH STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I'M TALKING ABOUT A 21-0 VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. IT'S SO COMMON SENSE THAT IT SHOULD BUILD ON THE WORK THE SENATE JUST DID A MONTH AGO WHEN IT FAST-TRACKED IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND THEIR FAMILIES. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, NEARLY A MONTH AGO THE SENATE ACTED HERE IN MERE MINUTES TO INCREASE PROTECTIONS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE NECESSARY WHEN POLICE APPREHENDED JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S WOULD-BE ASSAILANT. YESTERDAY, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES VOTED TO MA PASS THAT -- TO PASS THAT BILL. TODAY, WE SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT ALL FEDERAL JUDGES. THERE'S SIMPLY NO EXPLANATION OR JUSTICEIFICATION TO PROTECT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHILE DELAYING LEGISLATION TO PROTECT JUDGES AT EVERY LEVEL OF JUDICIARY WHO FACE THE SAME, IF NOT GREATER, RISK. NO JUDGE IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE TO FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR FAMILIES AS THEY WORK TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OUR DEMOCRACY, AND ENSURE ALL PEOPLE HAVE EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. WE HAVE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION OVER THE PREVIOUS MONTH, BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT IN THIS MOMENT AND ADVANCE OUR BIPARTISAN BILL, THE DANIEL ANDERL JUDICIAL AND PRIVACY ACT, WHICH CONTINUES TO GARNER SUPPORT. THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT RIGHT OR LEFT. IT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG. ONCE AGAIN, I ASK MY SENATE COLLEAGUES TO LET US HONOR THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF DANIEL ANDERL WITH DECISIVE ACTION AND RESOLVE. LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING TO HONOR DANIEL'S LEGACY AND UNANIMOUSLY PASS THIS LEGISLATION NAMED AFTER HIM. MR. PRESIDENT, AS IF IN LEGISLATIVE SESSION I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THE SENATE PROCEED TO THE IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION OF CALENDAR NUMBER 190 S. 2340, FURTHER THAT THE COMMITTEE REPORTED SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT BE WITHDRAWN, THE MENENDEZ SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT AT THE DESK BE CONSIDERED AND AGREED TO, THE BILL AS AMENDED BE CONSIDERED READ A THIRD TIME AND PASSED AND THE MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER BE CONSIDERED MADE AND LAID UPON THE TABLE. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS THERE OBJECTION? MR. PAUL: MR. PRESIDENT, RESERVING THE RIGHT TO OBJECT. FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, WE'VE BEEN OFFERING MY COLLEAGUE A COMPROMISE TO PASS THIS BILL. WE COULD PASS THIS TODAY IMMEDIATELY. ALL WE'VE BEEN ASKING IS IT NOT ONLY PROTECT FEDERAL JUDGES BUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AS WELL. I HAVEN'T HEARD A COGENT OR ANY ARGUMENT WHY IT COULDN'T. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE COMPROMISE. TO PASS THAT YOU CAN TAKES COMPROMISE, TAKES PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AND DWREAG. THERE HASN'T BEEN -- AND AGREEING. THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY MOSM OR EXRO -- ANY MOVEMENT OR COMPROMISE. WE CAN PASS THIS TODAY TO INCLUDE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. IF RECENT YEARS TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH NEED PROTECTION AS WELL AS THE JUDICIARY. THAT WAS CLEAR IN 2011 WHEN CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIFFORDS WAS TRAGEDY SHOT WHILE DOING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF HER JOB, MEETING WITH CONSTITUENTS. WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW HAPPY AND INSPIRED I WAS TO SEE CONGRESSWOMAN GIFFORDS IN THE CHAMBER WITH HER HUSBAND, SENATOR KELLY, WHEN HE WAS SWORN IN AS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY. BUT WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS THE PAIN OF THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WAKE-UP CALL TO PROTECT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND IN DOING SO, BETTER PROTECT THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM. BUT JUST A FEW YEARS LATER A SHOOTER NEARLY KILLED CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE DURING A PRACTICE GAME OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL TEAM. I SAID AT THE TIME THAT OUR LIVES WERE SAVED BY THE CAPITOL HILL POLICE. EXTENDING PROVISION PROS OF THIS BILL TO IT THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WOULD BETTER PROTECT US AND OUR FAMILIES AND CONSTITUENTS. I'VE BEEN OFFERING THIS FOR TWO YEARS. MY AMENDMENT, WHICH I WILL OFFER FOR UNANIMOUS CONSENT, SIMPLY EXTENDS THE SAME PROTECTIONS IT WOULD OFFER TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. THIS IS NOT A NEW REQUEST. IN DECEMBER 2020, WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR, I OFFERED THIS COMPROMISE. I SAID I WOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER SIDE TO TRY TO GET A BILL THAT WE COULD PASS. BUT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE. IF WE WANT THIS TO PASS, LET'S COMPROMISE. LET'S COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN GET THIS TO PASS. I KNOW OF NO ARGUMENT OR NO CONSTITUENCY THAT IS COMING TO WASHINGTON SAYING, WE DON'T WANT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO BE PROTECTED. THERE IS NO SUCH CONSTITUENCY. THERE IS NO SUCH ARGUMENT, AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T PASS THIS TODAY. IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO YEARS. LET'S PASS THIS BILL TODAY. AS I'VE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I PROVISIONS, AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT OUGHT TO BE BLOCKED MERELY BECAUSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALSO NEED PROTECTION. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THE SENATOR MODIFY HIS REQUEST TO INCLUDE MY AMENDMENT TO THE MENENDEZ SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT, WHICH IS AT THE DESK, THAT THE AMENDMENT OFS BE CONSIDERED AND AGREED TO, THE BILL, AS AMENDED, BE CONSIDERED READ A THIRD TIME AND PASSED, AND THAT THE THE MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER BE CONSIDERED MADE AND LAID UPON THE TABLE. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS THERE OBJECTION TO THE MODIFICATION? MR. BOOKER: MR. PRESIDENT, RESERVING THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, I THINK THE POINTS THAT THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY IS MAKING, MR. PRESIDENT, ARE WORTHY. THAT WE ARE FACING A REALITY RIGHT NOW WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF THREATS THAT ARE INCREASING AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS ALL AROUND OUR COUNTRY, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT SENATOR MENENDEZ AND I JUST WROTE AND BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR. THIS IS A BILL THAT WE WORKED THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS. IT WAS A LONG AND ARDUOUS PROCESS THAT WAS DONE IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER. AND DURING THE DISCUSSION THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD, THE POINT THAT THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY BROUGHT UP WAS BROUGHT UP AS WELL. THERE WAS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE COMMITMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE A BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE, EVERY SENATOR IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID WE SHOULD LET THIS GO RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL HAS BEEN VETTED, WORKED OVER IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER, IS READY TO PASS. THREATS ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY HAVE GONE UP 500%, AND, GRANT YOU, THREATS ON MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE DOUBLED. BUT THE THREATS ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY ARE RISING, AND WE SAW THAT IN THE CASE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. AND THIS BODY THOUGHT IT ENOUGH NOT TO HOLD UP THE PROTECTION OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES TO PROTECT THE 535 OF US. WE PASSED A BILL TO PROTECT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. AND SO HOW HERE WE NOW HAVE A BILL THAT HAS BEEN VETTED THROUGH COMMITTEE, HAS BEEN WORKED ON IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION AND CAME OUT, AND WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FOR THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY TO SAY WE HAVE COMMITMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE IS NOT RIGHT. WE HAVE SENATORS WORKING A BILL THROUGH COMMITTEE, THROUGH REGULAR ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HE'S HAVING. BUT THIS IS MY CONCERN -- THREATS ON THE JUDICIARY HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THIS BODY, AND TO GRIND THIS BILL TO A HALT RIGHT NOW PUTS AT RISK MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY WHEN WE HAVE THE POWER IN THIS BODY TO PROTECT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THAT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WHY WOULD WE STOP, WHEN THERE IS GOOD WILL IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, TO WORK ON THE CONCERNS? THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE COMMITTED TO THIS BILL, AND VERBAL COMMITMENTS FROM EVERYONE. SO TO STOP THIS TODAY CREATES A WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY THAT WE KNOW IS REAL BECAUSE WE JUST SAW A THREAT ON A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND SO, FOR THE SAKE OF MERCY, FOR THE SAKE OF CAUTION, FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROTECTION OF PEOPLE IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, LET'S PASS THIS BILL AND I COMMIT MYSELF TO JOINING WITH SENATOR TED CRUZ, TO JOINING WITH SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR, TO JOINING WITH CHAIRMAN DURBIN, AND RANKING MEMBER GRASSLEY, WHO'VE ALSO SPOKEN TO THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK A BILL THROUGH REGULAR ORDER. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. OUR JOB AS SENATORS, IF ANYTHING, FIRST AND FOREMOSTROTN CITIZENS. WE HAVE A BILL THAT IS WIDELY BIPARTISAN, THAT IS PROVEN TO BE URGENT, A BILL WITH A NAME OF A YOUNG MAN THAT WAS SLAUGHTERED IN HIS HOME. TO HOLD THIS BILL UP IS CRUEL, IT IS CREATING RISK AND JEOPARDY TO PEOPLE WHO SERVE IN THE JUDICIARY. IT IS WRONG. IT IS WRONG, IT IS WRONG. I ASK MY COLLEAGUE WITH ALL HUMILITY AND WITH ALL COMPASSION AND EMPATHY TO PLEASE LET THIS GO. I COMMIT TO HIM THAT I WILL FIGHT AND WORK WITH THE BIPARTISAN COALITION THAT IS WORKING ON WAYS TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN THIS BODY. I YIELD. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS THERE OBJECTION TO THE MODIFICATION? MR. MENENDEZ: RESERVING THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, FOR ALL THE RUNS THAT SENATOR BOOKER JUST MENTIONED AND WITH AN EQUAL EQUIPMENT TO SENATOR PAUL TO WORK WITH SENATOR KLOBUCHAR AND SENATOR CRUZ WHO ARE WORKING AND LOOK TO ADVOCATE FOR THE SENATOR'S LANGUAGE TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT LEGISLATION, THE SENATOR COULD HAVE DONE THIS ON THE SUPREME COURT JUDGES, BUT HE DIDN'T. SO AT THIS POINT I'LL HAVE TO OBJECT. OFFICER. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS THERE OBJECTION TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST? MR. PAUL: RESERVE BE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT -- THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY IS RECOGNIZED. MR. PAUL: RESERVING THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. WE'VE NOT HAD ONE MEETING. THEY HAVE NOT ACCEPTED A MEETING, MUCH LESS A COMPROMISE. A YEAR AND A HALF. THIS COULD PASS TODAY BY SIMPLY ACCEPTING THIS. A PROMISE TO DO IT AT A LATER TODAY WHEN WE'VE WAITED A YEAR AND A HALF. A YEAR AND A HALF WENT BY BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD MEET WITH US. WE'VE NOT HAD ONE MEETING. WE HAVE OFFERED TO MEET WITH THE STAFFS OF BOTH OF THE AUTHORS OF THE THIS AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED A MEETING. THERE'S BEEN NO DISCUSSION OF THIS BETWEEN STAFF, NO DISCUSSION OF A COMPROMISE. WE WOULD TAKE A COMPROMISE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THERE HAS BEEN NO ARGUMENT MADE TODAY WHY CONGRESS COULDN'T BE ADDED TO THIS BILL. THEY COULD HAVE ADDED THIS BILL OR TALKED TO US OVER THE YEAR AND A HALF. NO ONE HAS TALKED TO US OTHER THAN TO COME FOR THE PUBLIC THEATER. NO ONE HAS TRIED TO GET THIS THING PASSED. I OBJECT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE OBJECTION IS HEARD. MR. MENENDEZ: I KNOW THE HOUR IS LATE, I AM UNAWARE OF ANY SUCH REQUEST. AND I AM UNAWARE OF US NOT BEING WILLING. OF COURSE WE ARE WILLING. IN FACT, JUDGE SALAS IS HERE, SENATOR PAUL, TO MAKE HER CASE. YOU WOULDN'T GIVE HER THE TIME OF DAY. MR. BOOKER: MAY I BE RECOGNIZE? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR IS RECOGNIZED. MR. BOOKER: I TURNED TO MY STAFF, HAS SENATOR PAUL REACHED OUT TO US? THAT'S NOT THE CASE. WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT FEDERAL JUDGES AS IS THE UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND SO THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING THAT WE DIDN'T STOP THE SUPREME COURT JUDGES. HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO THAT. BUT FOR SOME REASON OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY, I JUST FIND THAT PROBLEMATIC. I'M WILLING TO NEAT WITH HIM. I'M NOT IN OPPOSITION TO HIS BILL. THE MEETING THAT SHOULD BE HAD, I WILL DO IT BUT WITH THE TWO SENATORS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. BUT TO HOLD IT UP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING PROTECTION TO ME DOES NOT MARK THE NOBILITY OF THIS BODY AND THE SELF-SACRIFICE OF THIS BODY. I YIELD THE FLOOR.

I'm Barry Loudermilk and I approve this message quite simply the reason that unemployment is at historic lows in almost every demographic areas because there are jobs available now because of the policies that we've put in place four years ago with the economy in slow motion there were very few jobs available and there was a huge pool of people looking for work we've reversed that trend now there are actually more jobs available than there are people to fulfill those jobs at this point [Music]

uh thank you mr chairman uh councillor how are you good morning congratulations thank you so much do you think the constitution should be used to create new rights uh senator i think the constitution is an enduring document and that uh yeah i agree with you it's been around a long time it's enduring um and i'm fond of it you love it i'm fond of it too but do you think it ought to be used to create new rights uh senator i think it is constantly being interpreted and the supreme court has through the 230 years of jurisprudence has found rights in it and if i am confirmed as an appellate judge i would faithfully apply supreme court president yeah but are you going to use it to try to create new rights uh senator uh appellate court judges don't create new rights they take the record below them sure they do counselor we've been we've both been at this a long time they do it all the time and then it goes up to the supreme court the supreme court says yeah or nay or sometimes they don't say anything let me interest what what barometer should we use to decide whether a federal judge ought to create a new right are the people's elected representatives through a congress or legislature what's this what's the standard you use there senator we have co-equal branches of government the legislature does the policy-making the judiciary but what's the standard i'm sorry to interrupt you but we had this problem in the last administration and we haven't done in this administration if you could just answer my question because five minutes just goes like that what standard do you use personally uh to decide whether a new right ought to be created by a federal judge or by the united states congress if it's a federal right senator i would be applying precedent and precedent i stipulate that you're going to apply precedent i'll stipulate that so let's take that off the table what standard should be used to determine whether a new right ought to be created by a court a federal judge unelected appointed for life or a united states congress senator appellate courts have standards of review when looking toward lower court decisions and i would come on council you're not answering my question it's a real simple question and you're very smart and you know what i'm asking you believe in a living constitution okay i get that that's a legitimate point of view you say you don't understand what an originalist is but i i think i don't think you're being candid there but this is what let me ask my question again what standard should be used to decide if you're going to create a new right in the constitution whether that right ought to be created by a federal judge or the people's elected representative very simple senator the federal courts are of limited jurisdiction the appellate courts sit in between a supreme court okay you're not going to answer it i get it um when you were at the brennan center you're still there right i'm on leave sir okay well but when you were there did you advocate uh federal courts create new rights under the constitution no sir you never did no sir okay uh when right to vote is protected in the constitution and it's protected so you never asked for new rights you just said they're already there yes sir okay how do you know a right's already there if it's not explicit uh in the case of voting no no just in general if if i read your resume and it's not something's on there well that's a bad example if you look at the constitution and it doesn't let's just say let's say reparations okay um and it doesn't talk about reparations how do you know whether a rights should be granted if it's not fair that's what i understand you to be saying with the living constitution senator again a case would not come before an appellate court unless parties presented an argument i get that i understand how lawsuits tried how let me ask you again how do you know if a right's not explicit in the u.s constitution that it's really there it's hiding it's lurking and we just have never seen it uh senator uh in marbury versus madison the supreme court said that the supreme court uh interprets the constitution right i would look to precedent i would look to see what if there's no precedent there's always some precedent here's my problem council this is where i think you're headed i think what you want to do on the federal bench is advance the social agenda and rewrite the constitution every other thursday to advance a social agenda that you can't get by the voters through their elected representatives senator now that's a legitimate um thing to be far this is america you can believe what you want but you spent your whole career doing that and it bothers me that you're not defending that here that you're dodging my questions senator you're not the only nominee who's done that it happened under the prior administration must be something in the water at the white house but i'd respect you a lot more if you just up front said it senator i believe in the value of precedent i think it makes our system so do i but that's got nothing to do with our discussion we both know that and i understand that you've been advised to say precedent president president when in doubt what's is it raining outside precedent but it inhibits our ability to have a rational discussion thank you mr chairman

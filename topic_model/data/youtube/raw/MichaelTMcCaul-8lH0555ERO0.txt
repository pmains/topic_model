I think the Chairman I think the Secretary's for being here and general Dempsey thank you for being here as well next week we commemorate the 12th anniversary of 911 it was Al Qaeda that hit the World Trade Center it was Al Qaeda that hit the Pentagon down the street from here al Qaeda is the enemy and before nine eleven al Qaeda that was the enemy as chairman of Homeland Security Committee I want to make sure that never happens again and I know you share that as well I think what gives the Congress great pause the American people great pause there's no good outcome here they don't see a good side versus a bad side they see Assad as a bad actor who's used chemical weapons there's no no question about that but then who is the other side who are the rebel forces who are they i ask that in my briefings all the time and every time i get briefed on this it gets worse and worse because the majority now these rebel forces and I say majority now a radical Islamists pouring in from all over the world to come to Syria for the the fight and my concern is any strike against this regime as bad as it is will empowered these radical Islamists these extremists and we've seen this movie before we've seen Afghanistan we've seen what happened in Egypt we saw what happened in Libya we saw what the Arab Spring has brought us and it's not good they fill the vacuum they have filled the vacuum so my greatest concern when we look at Syria's who is going to fill the vacuum when the Assad regime Falls which we know that it will who is going to fill that vacuum or that are the rebel forces the extremists going to take over not only the government but these weapons because they are the ones most likely to use these weapons against Americans in the United States and while you know those images of children in Damascus are horrific I do not want to see those images in the United States that is my my grave concern and this is a very dangerous step that we are taking and what I believe that we have to be very careful and how we proceed and so with that and with all due respect I think this is well intention but I have these concerns and I want to hear from think those secretaries in the general as to whether you share these concerns and what you are doing to stop that outcome because that is the absolute worst scenario worst outcome that could happen congressman I was just trying to make sure I apologize for interrupting that I think would be helpful to you as you were asking the question because I'm very concerned about the foundation of your question the premise of it a woman by the name of Elizabeth bag maybe a GL why just wrote an article she works with the Institute of war she's fluent in Arabic and spent an enormous amount of time studying the opposition studying Syria she just published this the other day very interesting article which I commend to you the fact is sitting behind me incidentally is ambassador Robert Ford is about is our ambassador Syria he has spent an enormous amount of time with the opposition working with them in helping us to understand this dynamic III just don't agree that a majority are al-qaeda and the bad guys that's not true there are about seventy to a hundred thousand oppositionists about somewhere maybe fifteen to twenty five percent might be in one group or another who are what we would deem to be bad guys there are many different groups I'll no Sorel genre there are different entities and sometimes they're fighting each other even now the general belief there is a real moderate opposition that exists general Idris is running the military arm of that and our allies in this effort our friends from the Saudis to the Emiratis the gutter ease and others are now in a disciplined way funneling assistance through generally dress and the moderate opposition who are getting stronger as a result of it I get forty cents but I there are moderates there but the briefings I've received unless I've gotten different ones or more inaccurate briefings is rate fifty percent well and rising the freedom these fighters coming globally or not coming in as moderates they were coming in as jihadis and that's my concern in there rj arterial i don't want to hear from the secretary also in the general as well well i agree with secretary Kerry's analysis but let me let me just remind us all and you know this very well congressman especially with your responsibilities as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee this is an imperfect situation there are no good options here this is complicated there's no clarity every point you made the complications of the various terrorist groups which we have noted are there there in play this is a specifically difficult part of us trying to sort out who we would support how we would support them so I don't question that but I do think that Secretary's carries points are correct that we are seeing some movement on the inside of in the right direction

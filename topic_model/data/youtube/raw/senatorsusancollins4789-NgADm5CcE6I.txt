this hearing will come to order good afternoon it is my pleasure to convene this afternoon's hearing to assess our nation's progress in combating alzheimer's disease since the enactment of the national alzheimer's project act which i co-authored would then senator evan bai in 2011. i don't need to tell the people in this room what a devastating disease alzheimer's is it exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on the individual the family and our society in addition to the human suffering it causes alzheimer's cost the united states more than 220 billion dollars a year including 153 billion in cost to medicare and medicaid these costs will skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages already our nation's most costly disease alzheimer's is projected to cost more than 1.1 trillion dollars in 2050 if nothing is done to change its current trajectory alzheimer's is also one of our nation's leading causes of death the cdc lists alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death overall and the fifth leading cause of death for those 65 and older other estimates put the mortality rate much higher at number three right behind cancer and heart disease moreover and most frustrating alzheimer's is the only one of our nation's deadliest diseases without an effective means of prevention treatment or a cure it is now estimated that nearly one in two of the baby boomers reaching age 85 will develop alzheimer's as a consequence chances are that the members of my generation will either be spending our golden years with alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it in many ways alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this generation if we are to prevent alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease of the next generation it is imperative that we dramatically increase our investment in alzheimer's research just take a look at this chart at a time when the united states is spending an astonishing 226 billion dollars a year to care for people with alzheimer's we are spending less than three tenths of one percent of that amount less than 600 million dollars a year on research and believe it or not that's an increase that many of us have worked for you can barely see the expenditure level on that chart alzheimer's receives funding that is clearly disproportionately low compared to its human and economic toll look at the second chart we currently spend 5.4 billion dollars a year for cancer research 3 billion a year for research on hiv aids and 2 billion for cardiovascular research all investments that have paid dividends these investments and research for other diseases have yielded tremendous results patients have access to new treatments death rates for some diseases are decreasing yet at the same time mortality due to alzheimer's is escalating dramatically surely we can do more for alzheimer's and other diseases of dementia given their tremendous human and economic price fortunately there is promising research that holds hope for alzheimer's patients and their families the research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets but adequate funding is critical to advance this research the national plan to address the alzheimer's disease has as its primary goal to prevent and effectively treat alzheimer's disease by 2025 to meet that goal the chairman of the advisory committee on alzheimer's research care and services dr ron peterson whom we will hear from shortly told our committee last congress that we will need to devote at least 2 billion a year to alzheimer's research well at first blush that may seem like a lot of money but when you compare it to that 226 billion that we're spending caring for people with alzheimer's it's less than one percent and that's the context that we need to put it in and that's why i've introduced a resolution with several of my colleagues stating that the senate will strive to double the amount of funding that our country spends on alzheimer's and fiscal year 2016 and develop a plan to meet the target of 2 billion over the next five years this afternoon or perhaps tomorrow the budget is on the floor today i also will be offering an amendment to the budget which i'm pleased to say is cos co-sponsored by my ranking member senator mccaskill as well as senator warner senator toomey and senator manchin and we will also be calling on the budget to reflect that kind of investment this is an investment that we simply must make to alleviate suffering and to prevent our health care programs from going bankrupt i want to acknowledge all of the advocates who are here today from all over the country we need your help we need you to educate members of congress and we hope that your presence today will be a powerful statement to all of our colleagues that they too need to help us solve this devastating disease senator mccaskill

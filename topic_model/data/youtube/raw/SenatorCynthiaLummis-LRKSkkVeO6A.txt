thank you Mr chairman thank you all for being here there's a bit of a flogging element to what's happening today but there's also an opportunity for us to learn from each other so I hope that you'll provide that when I ask questions of you and I want to thank Senator Kennedy for pointing out that you know America is the leader in World Financial Services but that said it's a privilege and there are other countries that are working at a transformative pace in innovation so uh the having China come up at the conclusion of Mr tester's conversations with you I want to start uh with that issue Mr Diamond um I want to ask you about a comment you made last month you said China looks at America and they say you have been incompetent and lazy and then you said there's some truth to that um so I too am concerned that too many in the financial services industry have been lazy and they don't see the transformative Pace at which the rest of the world is innovating uh Payments Technology For example is far too slow and costly so your bank is currently testing JPM coin it's a type of stable coin for faster settlement uh could you talk a little bit about um our duty to responsibly innovate to stay a world leader same question to Mr cesare yeah I mean America already is the world innovator and world leader and China is a serious competitive strategic issue we all have to deal with and so I totally agree with that I don't think Americans should be embarrassed I mean we still have the most prosperous Nation to Planet all the food where energy we need free enterprise the gifts of God the gifts of our founding fathers they have autocracy not enough food warrant energy they need 15 million barrels of oil a day they get four from themselves or their immediate neighbors stuff like that we're in very good shape the The Lazy part I'm talking about is policy is things we got wrong or we could have done better immigration taxation regulation Health Care litigation all those things I think it slowed down America and I think we should be focusing more how can we grow more and create more wealthier afford more military et cetera et cetera and innovation in cryptocurrency they are they're probably head in a couple of areas and I think we should recognize that and combat that and I'm not really worried about it as long as we get our act together Mr sister I agree I think one particular area of innovation that's critically important is money movement and payments activity and I think the banks are working together with each other as well as our regulators and activities like real-time payments Zell even fed now all those things I think will put position as well for future payments activity um anyone else want to weigh in on this well I think our colleagues spoke to it but it the real-time payment system the ability to get a 24x7 wire system at the FED would be critical to it in their new real-time system ought to provide that but one of the disadvantages and payment system technology is ability to pay on the weekends and most substantial amount of money that actually clears t plus zero security settlement would be doable if you actually could have the money move during the night and so I think we're all aware of that we've connected our real-time payment system or connecting it to other parts of the world that we've put together through the Clearinghouse that'll enable money to move real time you connect that with Zell and things you can move it with no cost to another banking client as long as someone doesn't step in and say oh that is not sufficient to have sand today or in Spain you do the kyc so we can rely on it we we need some enabling things and I think you know if we do that right we can take you know you will see the Innovation this is already set up and already moving and by the way we moved trillions and trillions and trillions dollars a day very efficiently um you know so I think people's view of what's inefficient is kind of into interesting but you have to look at what really moves well we're aware that money was transferred in uh cryptocurrency as donations to Ukraine they were spending it the next day and if it had been transferred in U.S dollars it would have taken about 10 days for it to reach uh I I see some of you shaking your heads disagree Mr Diamond right now we're moving 10 trillion dollars around the world zipping and zapping through AML systems ofac systems regulations AI systems cyber systems safely immediately a lot of it's real time you're talking about retail payments yes I am yes and I agree with that that's a thing that we all can work on and fix but that's a very small thing relative to the other thank you for being here I yield back

[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell and I'd like to welcome you to this latest edition up to the point as a nation we are still coming to grips with the events in Charlottesville Virginia this summer as well as president Trump's response it's been several decades since images of white supremists gathering publicly have been splashed across the media outlets many of my viewers may have learned about the Ku Klux Klan or the Nazi regime in school so it may be easy to write it off as an unfortunate part of history and nothing more than that yeah even in 2017 the United States is faced with the issue of white supremacy for those who are experts in such fields like my guest the rise in radical right-wing ideology comes as no surprise in 2009 Darrell Johnson ordered a report on homegrown extremism as a department of homeland security analysts unfortunately that report was discarded by the Obama administration under pressure from a Republican Congress in a right-wing media today we'll discuss that report the resistance he faced when he published it and the current status of those extrapolations Daryl Johnson I want to thank you for being here today I'm proud of you as an American you're a fun tears man as far as I'm concerned thank you both ah last year I organized a briefing you were at it I thought I thought it was interesting we talked about right-wing extremism from a number of people and you have been at the forefront since 2009 will discuss that report in a few moments but the New York Times wrote this about you you better listen New York Times wrote this about you quote his words drew fierce criticism from Republican lawmakers and conservative news media labeling the report in unfair assessment of legitimate considers isms of the government the document was retracted after Janet Napolitano who was then the Homeland Security Secretary apologized the veterans and the extremism and radicalization branch was quietly dismantled which is that a fair assessment or or what would you add to it that is a fair assessment and it's quite surprising that that happened I mean I had worked as an intelligence analyst for the US government at that point for 15 years Wow looking at these issues you had the credentials yeah you worked on the Republic administration and democratic administration s and I was a senior intelligence analyst a team lead right so I actually went out and hired people that had similar qualifications as myself to look at these groups and we were building that expertise in the department Homeland Security we were receiving a lot of positive feedback from state and local law enforcement officials and other government officials that we served so you were working for the government before there was a homeland security committee yeah I started in 1991 1991 yes that's interesting to know you weren't just a figurehead you've been there someone might say I don't say but you sometime I say you're a career person with the government looking at those folks who want to do us armed yes and what was the first thing what's the first thing comes to your mind me talking about that period of time what's the first thing down that struck you about your review your investigations up to that moment I was just doing my job what I was trained to do and so this whole report that I wrote in 2009 actually began with a phone call from the Capitol Police in 2007 they wanted us to monitor the internet look at extremist websites that were publicly available to see if there was any threats to Barack Obama once he announced his intentions to run for president right right did you do any of that work we had analysts under my team right that looked at those websites and we monitored that for a few months and nothing originally happened but once he won that Democratic nomination that's when we started seeing the uptick and three opened up she had opened up and people became brazen about the fact that what god we may have a black president yes now what kind of things did you look at at that time we were looking at the Internet chatter we were looking at you know how many groups we had out there the level of criminal activity and violence that were perpetrated and we were actually in kind of a dormant period for far-right extremism back in the mid 2000s we you know had a uptick an eco-terrorism and things like that but really it was with Obama's announcement that he was running for president that led to a huge recruitment boom now let me ask you a question go back to the end of the 90s during those latter period when Bill Clinton was a president we had a horrific situation in Oklahoma City mm-hmm Timothy McVeigh he certainly was not recruited by Al Qaeda or anybody he was a homegrown guy and he destroyed and killed many people in the whole Oklahoma City bombing he wasn't admitted supremest he was an admitted person that went out to kill people and blow up some building the building besides and of course I remember the president going to Oklahoma City trying to bring calm and security and comfort would you say that was the most significant expression of extremism since the time you started to work for the government yeah from the domestic coming there were elders but was that the most extreme yes and resulted in the most deaths what we call a mass casualty producing event and so what we had in the aftermath of Oklahoma City is you know media scrutiny of these groups we had a public backlash against these groups so the things quieted yeah law enforcement crackdown on these groups yeah and so leading up to the millennium y2k is kind of like once that happened these groups kind of you know got bored with the revolution that never came they kept predicting the end of war everyone happened or the economy was gonna collapse or what-have-you and combination of states passing paramilitary laws banning paramilitary training States banning militia groups from forming and conducting firearms training we had those laws passed people got bored with the revolution the law enforcement crackdown and so all of that led kind of to a lull in right-wing extremism in all of this resurfaced in 2007-2008 okay so there's a time period there there's a lull and then we're back into the game as we're fighting al Qaeda as we are in Iraq Iraq and we are in Afghanistan these are the things that are happening now that is the report that you presented 2009 member and the Homeland Security Committee Secretary Napolitano sitting in front of us and telling us that this wasn't gonna go any further and I blew my stack mm-hmm this is not about me though this is about you I blew my stack for a very specific reason that they were deep-sixing it my words for the simple reason that they're getting a lot of flack from the right wing of the Republican Party from Congress members and that's exactly what they did in fact they ended the radicalization branch the extremism and a radical issue at that point so they were done they were finished done completely done and what did you do what was your response to this whole thing did you say these guys are making a big mistake what what we what in you report and I read it several times to you is the most important thing that we should have taken away from that report so the most important thing you should have taken from this report is that the threats threat landscape was changing okay as you imagine after 9/11 the US government's counterterrorism efforts and rightfully so was focused on overseas threats al Qaeda for me trying to prevent the next 9/11 right and that was all well and good however a new threat was emerging and we needed to let federal state and local law enforcement know that hey you're gonna have to devote some resources to this as well and sere homegrown here yes people who believe that the government is either out to get them the government doesn't want them to be able to say what they want to say almost like an anti-government movement at that particular time yeah you can split the movement into two large spheres you have the hate motivated groups like the white supremacist KKK neo-nazis skinheads Aryan prison gangs Christian identity which is a racist religious philosophy and then you've got the anti-government groups like the sovereign citizens the militia extremists and other anti-government people now when I read your report and then I look at what happened in May of this year we're talking about Charlottesville this happened this report came out the Joint Intelligence bulletin on the 10th of May 2017 tell me your take on this what does it say well I appreciate is the report that I gave you to look at and you have read it right I appreciate your staff sharing that with me I mean it's it's definitely a good attempt to you know let the nation know and to let policymakers know that hey the FBI and DHS are aware of this white nationalist or an extremist threat after looking at it the one thing that kind of stood out to me is I felt that the tradecraft could have been a little bit better they mentioned that there were six violent attacks by white supremacists in 2016 they listed four you know in the report and written on a graph they actually show that there was only one attack in 2016 so and one effort you're saying there's six and then you described four of them but only show one on your chart well I can think of other in my take on that and you tell me if I'm off base I got it I got a feeling when I read that and I've read it several times and I didn't read it until after after Charlotte's felt mm-hmm I didn't read until after Charlotte's fell okay so I read it it's a shout out but reserved mm-hmm conditional and the numbers are low and the numbers are very low so why be alert in America is this the way this report should have been presented to the American people no because number one it doesn't accurate accurately capture all the lethal violence that has happened and within the white supremacist movement against minorities and other communities but if you actually look at the graph there's years where they show no attacks 2010 2011 they say there were no white supremacist violent attacks that's not true yeah and if you look at from 2013 to 2016 on their graph it shows that it's decreasing when in reality it's increasing and like I said I know of at least you know three or four more incidents just off the top of my head that not even included in this report so it's one thing for a president for a candidate Obama that's one thing gets people upset and in right-wing circles it's another thing now he's the President of the United States mm-hmm do you know for a fact if there were threats on the president's life yeah in fact we discovered numerous threats that we refer to the US Secret Service during this time you know started poll if rating so much that the Secret Service had to stand up its own unit just to keep up with all these new threats that were coming in you're on I've seen in some of the news reporting that you know there were more threats against President Obama than like the previous four presidents combined Wow so they were alerted because of these threats that were direct they protect the president that's their job they do a sensational job as far as I'm concerned and at the same time these groups are not going to give up and they didn't disappear this time right so figure President Obama is no longer the president of United States they're gonna go home the Boldin well they're enabled am I too strong no you're not in fact what's happening right now goes against all of the trends that I've seen in the 25 years now that I've been looking at this issue normally right-wing extremists we're talking white supremacist militias Sambas they increase and become more active under Democratic administrations because they're fearful that their guns are going to be taken away or that there'll be some sort of gun laws passed or you know in the case of Barack Obama they had their worst nightmare confirmed and the fact that we had an African American and in the White House typically during Republican administrations we see a dial back but that has not been the case in 2017 in fact what we've seen is continued heightened activity continued violence continued recruiting going on and it has a lot to do with the 2016 election with the rhetoric that was during the campaign some of the things that candidate Trump talked about from his platform such as building a border wall right there patient rights on the rally mass deportations of illegal immigrants right not allowing certain people to enter the country with travel bans these were things I read about on white nationalist websites ten years ago but now they're being spoken from a political platform if the judgment is complicit and doesn't or doesn't do anything because certain members of Congress feel that it's gone too far I'm not I am not in any way implying that members of Congress certain members of Congress want this violence to go on but they certainly have turned a deaf ear to what the heck is happening I mean you and I are not making up these situations where there has been violence you didn't create Timothy McVeigh I hope I didn't create them at the McVeigh and any other Timothy McVeigh's that before that and after that have been found to be tried to destroy this government or many parts of this government now well the gut while the people supreme the government is needed to keep law and order here in this country and I'm very suspect that people keep on tearing down the government say it has no place in our society anti-government whatever you say about the government's role we don't need a government or we minimize the effect except one hurricane Harvey comes calling then all of a sudden we need the government in fact we need the government unlike we we we had when we had our storm in New Jersey of Sandy when they turn their backs on us the very people who are part of this right-wing junk that's out there which I call them the enablers I think that they enable these people to feel stronger tougher and gonna do whatever ever the heck they want yeah the one thing that needs to be realized by politicians is you know you need to understand the effect and the impact your words have on the mentally ill and people that are embracing fringe ideologies and extremists speak Brent yes so you need to be aware that there you're playing with fire when you say these things from the campaign trail to try to you know get a base of support so you can get the votes to win the election you're playing with fire is very dangerous to play would anger you play with fear paranoia you play with the anger of somebody coming in that doesn't look like you taking a job and that's been disproven so many many times you play with your heartfelt resentment of anybody getting ahead of you particularly if they don't look like you would don't cook their foods like you you plan that you like you keep on lighting matches they're bound to go off I personally think that if we would have done what you had recommended and suggested back in 2009 well before that but it was actually we did away with it in 2009 and the organization that put it together we could have prevented a lot of things from happening now how do you prevent things from happening you don't prevent things from happening by ignoring them that's true and you know during my congressional testimony in 2012 after the Sikh temple shooting I recommended another number of things as in California that was up in Wisconsin at Oak Creek Wisconsin there were six people killed at a Sikh temple yeah what was the source of that who who were the murderers a white supremacist mistook the Sikh temple as a mosque and went in there and killed people because he thought they were Muslims and they weren't they were Hindus but anyway I don't know Muslim shall appear and approach the country the borders what the heck we don't yeah if that isn't if that isn't prejudiced outright okay that's not free speech that's downright violent talk yeah more violence against Muslims by you know white supremacist and others who have yet been identified there there have been Muslims attack and whites I mean there's been has that been exposed enough in your mind no in fact when we went through a series of mosque arsons in 2014 there was not a peep from the FBI or Homeland Security about this increase in mosque being burned across the country the fact that we've got armed militia groups conducting protests trying to intimidate Muslims the fact that they perpetrate these lies about how Sharia laws being you know implemented throughout the country or trying to be you knowing you know these things are just ludicrous but yet the very victims of these crimes are Muslims and we think that they're the threat I mean I hit you right here that we could have prevented this are you saying congressman you could have prevented Charlottesville well the night before Friday night when they assembled on a campus of the University of Virginia not only did they have the torches but many of them had weapons now how can the president equalize this stuff say hey they're nice guys on both sides I mean that's floored me when he did that yeah and I was what was your response I couldn't believe some of the things he said to sit there and accuse you know both the left and the right as being equally responsible I think as reckless and an outright lie in the past we have seen a lot of agitators at the you know KKK rallies and stuff from the far lab they're only they engage in property destruction they have disrespect to law enforcement but to sit there and say that they rank up there with the white supremacist threat is just ludicrous I mean white supremacists are the ones that kill people they're the most lethal threat that we have here in the country but we do have some extreme left-wing groups yes and they have used violence yes at times and not only to protect themselves they've done it to make to incite almost doing sight but what I have recognized over the past five or six years is the amount of right-wing groups that have brought hell to bear on police officers very seldom do we talk about that either yeah very seldom do we talk about that so other folks out there there are folks out there who wish harm not only to the government the representatives of the government itself police officers most the time they're outgunned in these sorts of situations yeah you know so everybody says let everybody carry and depends on what state you live in and by the way you brought this out and you report it 2009 the amount of artillery that was out there yeah by many of these groups one important statistic that I brought up in my congressional testimony was I looked at all two hundred and thirtysomething terrorism cases against Muslims here in the United States up until from you know 9/11 2001 all the way up to 2012 when I gave my testimony right okay and I looked at all the court documents and I compiled all the weaponry that these two hundred and thirty some-odd Muslim terror suspects had amassed yes and would you know that one militia member who was actually acquitted up in Michigan had more firepower in his basement than all two hundred and thirtysomething Muslim terrorists combined and it wasn't even close it wasn't even a close did was that put out an in report put it in my congressional testimony and dick durbin actually was stunned with that very fact you get me that report well sure I didn't see that require that slip I'm an apology most of the terrorism charges against Muslim Americans are for providing material support to terrorists whether it's money food clothing and that's horrible enough but right it's we're talking about people that have bombs and machine guns and grenades and things like that and yet nobody talks about that well let me ask you this do you think we do enough in terms of you know can we do enough in combating left Islamic terrorism the extreme Islam rather than vilify the entire religion which many right-wingers do do you think we do enough in that regard and we could and could we do a better job in the United States about that well without inciting the entire Muslim community sure I mean we are doing enough there's you know dozens of federal agencies that look at you know international terrorism you have a whole intelligence community and a whole Department of Defense that's engaged on counterterrorism against Isis and al Qaeda but when it comes to domestic terrorists that you know American citizens you're talking one agency and that's the FBI they're a law enforcement agency why haven't we cited your report or the report which came out just two several months ago in May about right-wing white supremacy why haven't that why has it been cited more by the media or whatever parts of the media as to alarm us to communicate to us that we better know and better watch what we're doing here mm-hmm well get hurt it's a combination of a bunch of different issues number one you know we become conditioned as a society because of 9/11 because of these horrific attacks over in Europe that in order for to be terrorism you have to have hundreds of people killed when we're talking about white supremacist they kill you know one person here five people there and so a lot of times people just dismiss these things as hate crimes or just you know mass shootings are just a isolated you know violence that's occurred so we as a society have kind of preconditioned ourselves as to what terrorism is but we also have an administration that does not even acknowledge that there is white terrorism okay when they scale back the countering violent extremism program and take grant funding away from the very few organizations that were even focused on trying to counter the white nationalist message by bringing them and say that the only violent extremism is the Muslim variety you're doing a huge disservice to the country and you're doing a huge disservice to the community because there are multiple types of threats are not just Muslims right and of course we don't have much more time but also that I want to talk we don't have time to talk about and we should be thinking about what causes this what what is that the foundation whether left or right of you becoming violent against people within your own community in society because of a political point mm-hm I mean that's a big question we need to talk about yeah and you know we could talk about social conditions we could talk about that to what blue in the face but the fact of the matter is these are the things we need to be alerted to the community needs to be related so I want to thank you personally I want to say thank you for your service and what are you doing right now by the way doesn't consulting work on the side for state and local law enforcement rate well I'm proud of you and I want you to know thank you for your service I'm sure our listeners and our watches here

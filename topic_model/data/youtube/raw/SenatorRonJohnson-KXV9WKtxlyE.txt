thank my colleague from kentucky for his consistent over the years consistent fighting i'll use that word fighting for the constitution i truly appreciate and i appreciate him raising this constitutional point of order in in an hour or so the issue he raises is one of constitutionality versus unconstitutionality and i've been reading positions on both sides and i understand there are legitimate arguments on both sides of that question but the fact of the matter is three weeks ago we came together in this body and we collectively decided that it was not wise it was not smart regardless of the constitutionality or the ability for us to do so was not smart for congress to over rule overturn the wishes of voters and of states that certified the electors we felt that was not wise so again in a couple hours we're going to be voting on we won't be able to debate which is why i'm rising today or at this moment we're going to debate whether a trial of someone who's no longer a president no longer a civil servant a private citizen whether that is constitutional or not constitutional and again there's good arguments on both sides and senators will vote differently and have justification for whatever side of that argument they take what i would like my colleagues to consider when they decide how to vote on that is not the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of that i want them to consider is it wise will a trial of a former president of a private citizen will it heal will it unify i think the answer is clearly it will not a trial of a former president is simply vindictive it will divide it is like opening up a wound and throwing salt in it that is not a healing process so again the question when we vote on this in a couple of hours for every sender should be is it wise is it the right thing to do i think from that standpoint the choice is very clear it will not heal it will not unite let's put it into this now let's dismiss this trial and rule unconstitutional thank you mr president yield the floor

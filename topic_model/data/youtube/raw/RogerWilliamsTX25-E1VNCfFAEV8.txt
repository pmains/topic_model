before president obama leaves for his two-week long vacation martha's vineyard he has a lot of work to do contrary to what he said in austin texas this month americans are not better off than we than when he took office in 2009. in fact his policies are hurting families and businesses everywhere he should focus on what white on on house republicans and what house republicans are doing and cooperate by getting his party leaders in the senate to act on more than 40 bills to get our economy moving get people back to work and roll back his administration's harmful policies like dodd-frank and obamacare the major force behind the transition to part-time america under president obama the average unemployment rate tops eight percent we've got 47 million people on food stamps 48 million people between the ages of 18 and 64. the very heart of our workforce hasn't worked one day in the last 12 months and nearly 91 million people over age 16 aren't working at all almost 50 percent of the unemployed have stopped looking for work and 76 percent of americans are living paycheck to paycheck and the list could go on and on we can fix this through real tax reform getting the government out of health care energize the energy business and ensuring america remains the world superpower with a strong and well-equipped military as a business owner and job creator for more than 40 years i know that the constant threat of tax hikes over regulation massive government overhauls hurts businesses it burdens families lowers income and stifles the economy everyone is simply playing defense in america that's why the house continues to pass pro-job bills that empower americans and strengthen the economy these are real solutions that will improve the quality of life for generations to come so i urge harry reid and the democrats and senate to take up these bills now before president obama leaves for vacation and god we trust i yield back

the Sundown close-up we sit down with Democratic congressional candidate Annie Kuster we'll get her take on healthcare gas crisis and the probable rematch against one Charlie bass also on the show former governor john sununu with Mitt Romney's finally locking up the nomination we think we'll guess his thoughts on how the race changes for the presumptive nominee morning everyone thanks for joining us I'm Josh McElveen a couple of years ago Democrat Annie Kuster nearly pulled off an upset and what was certainly a big year for Republicans narrowly losing to Charlie bass in 2012 the landscape has shifted a bit and customers back for what she hopes will be a rematch with a different outcome this time around and welcome back to the program gonna see you Josh thanks for having me back no problem is I was only wondering about this how much does the last year's have you spent thinking if I had only done this a little bit different or said this maybe I bid you know up for re-election at this point well you know I don't I don't have regrets I don't look back it was a big Republican sweep and we ran an incredible campaign I mean I'm very proud of the effort we put in and you know sometimes it's just a tough break at the end of the day and so I'm back at it and we're going to win it this time looking forward not so much looking but what did you learn from the last game oh it's an incredible process I love getting out and campaigning around New Hampshire you know I've lived here my whole life and just the small towns and the neighborhoods and people are really engaged here in New Hampshire they really care and they are looking at opportunity and fairness for their families and a lot of hope for the future even in tough times people are really looking ahead how can I get my kids to school get my kids to college give them the opportunity that they deserve sure 2010 obviously a huge year I just said for Republicans 2012 the landscape has changed a bit how are the talking points different this time around do you think well the biggest difference is running in a presidential year so there are thousands of voters who didn't participate in 2010 everybody's still very concerned about the economy we're talking about jobs and creating good jobs but the biggest difference for me is that people are very negative about the Republican Congress they see that Congress is broken that the special interests are controlling the day that their interests aren't being heard and they're very much wanting to reelect the president but more importantly turn that Congress around so they have a voice in Washington think that the American voters looking at and blaming the Republican Congress at this point I mean I mean we are with the Ryan budget I think people realize that this is not about fairness it's not about their families the middle class families people are very tuned in to the the buffett rule for example they want to see tax fairness they want to see millionaires and billionaires pay this in as secretaries and postal workers and so they're looking for that opportunity for their own family and they just want a fair shake they just want a fair shake from the government that they will have the opportunity and that their children will have a better life talk about the health care debate obviously everybody's waiting on on the Supreme Court decision on whether you know it's all of its constitutional part of his constitutional we'll see what happens how much do you think this will impact the debate moving forward in November if part of it is found what part or all of it is found to be unconstitutional well to be honest I don't think the voters are hung up on which parts are close to shore unconstitutional I think what they're concerned about is the cost of health care delivery right here at home and so what I've said throughout this debate about health care I think it's great to increase access but we have to focus in on costs and this is where probably my Republican over this if the Supreme Court decides it's been well kill laws unconstitutional but here's the bottom line they need an alternative and we haven't heard an alternative from the Republicans and their you know voters are concerned about the out-of-pocket cost to them small businesses are concerned about the high cost of health insurance for their employees so what I started say these are my Republican roots coming out I think we need competition in health care and we need to bring down the cost earlier preventive treatment earlier screenings so that people can get the care that they need in a timely way and then back to work and get on with their lives all right how about I mean the economy is still a big issue things are better than they were a couple of years ago but for any voter that goes to the gas pump at this point they still see if there's a long way to go are you convinced the president I mean Democrats a closing rank you're under President we're seeing him improving into poll numbers here we'll get some more in the polls in just a second but are you convinced to come November we're still paying four dollars for down the gas that the president get reelected well first of all we won't be the Tuck the price is already coming down but I think what people are much more focused on again this special interest politics in Washington they know that it's congress that is voting on these deep deep subsidies for oil and gas companies at the very same time that those oil-and-gas executives are getting record profits and we're paying high prices at the pump so this is the fairness that I'm getting at this is where people want their day-to-day lives they need to get to work they need to get their kids to school they need help and I completely agree we've got to bring down the cost of gas but why are we subsidizing the oil and gas company with our tax dollars to the tune of billions of dollars so that's what I'm running on fairness giving middle-class families a fair shake and look we've got to bring down the deficits we've got to cut those budgets we can't afford to be putting our tax dollars in the pockets of oil-and-gas executives sure do you think the president is being aggressive enough I mean yeah he called on Congress to end the four billion dollars and in subsidies to oil companies are getting a lot of that's for R&D and things along those i'm still at any rate i mean speculation is to blame for a lot of this i don't know what kind of role the primates play take it they can make a difference in speculation and i think that they should but here's what i'm talking about when you have oil and gas companies pumping money into congressional campaigns like congressman bass and if you take a look at his FB see reports in the country donors to his campaigns oil and gas companies nuclear cold you know these are the special interests down in Washington that are driving the debate I'm saying let's elect someone who presents a new hampshire family's New Hampshire values people in their day-to-day life and I'm incredibly proud that our campaign is being funded by individual donors average contribution $53 that means that the people will have a voice I'll be down there representing the people of the second District one other issue that wasn't even mentioned brought up in 2010 we're certainly hearing a lot about 2012 is contraception yeah obviously it is this is a state-level issue a federal issue what do you make of it to be honest I it's a throwback I can't imagine people in our generation thinking that the Congress is going to be seriously debating whether or not family should have access to contraception and family planning look this is an economic issue most families cannot afford a big family they want to be able to provide for college for their children they want to be able to save for their own retirement buy a home and so people want control over their own lives and to me this is all about New Hampshire values you know the people the 2nd district believe in Liberty they believe in Liberty to control your own personal life and so I'm a strong proponent less government interference in people's personal lives let people get on with it and frankly I think it's a distraction from the real issues of the day people need to get to work and they want good jobs and they want a good opportunity for their families let's talk about your campaign recent poll WMUR Granite State poll just came out shows that you and Charlie bass obviously seven months away anything can happen so long way to go basically neck-and-neck now for Charlie Bassett also showing a little bit of momentum for him because he was struggling there in the polls for a while what kind of a campaign you expect this to be we're very excited about the news from the pole in that we're know we know that voters are really hearing this message about fairness and opportunity they've got grave concerns about Congress they know that Congress is broken and you know he's voted now twice for this ryan budget that has deep deep cuts to programs that affect their daily lives Pell grants for children to go to college and food stamps social services and the like but most importantly dismantling Medicare and voters across the state of New Hampshire know that they've paid into that program and that seniors need and deserve to have the support so I think again you talk about the tax fairness issue you talk about opportunity for the middle class I'm very excited about this campaign I think we'll have a robust debate on the issues and I'm very confident that we're going to win this race it's quite exciting and it does talk about this being a presidential reelection year attempted reelection year we'll see what happens excuse me pardon how much do you plan to align yourself I mean where do you part ways with the president issues that i have taken positions that are different than the president I want to bring the troops home quickly from Afghanistan you know I shared his opposition to the Iraq war but look I think we've got to cut these deficits I don't think we can afford to keep the troops in Afghanistan as long as he's intending and but but the contrast there you have Governor Romney talking about winning the war on the battlefield what does that even mean I think I think there are very few new hampshire voters that want that to happen so there will be a robust debate on the issues you know look I was with President Obama the first time around and I'll be with them again and I'm proud of the Democratic positions here and then the campaign but we're going to be talking to independent voters non-aligned voters you know New Hampshire voters they're very independent and they're going to be voting all over the ballot and I just want to make sure that they that I serve the needs of those who want to make a change in Congress congressman bass in the seventh term having voted for these deficits having voted for what got us into this difficult time a chemically in the first place and I'm all for opportunity and fairness and we'll we'll give it a shot speaking of fairness he's not here to defend himself right now but I'm sure they do buddy you know the good thing is it's not personal between Congress and acid me it's just we disagree on the issues and what you have it I've noted my whole life I mean lots of people like him and and you know my own feeling is I'm equally likeable so they call him uncle Charlie you know soon they'll have they'll have maybe on a knee in the Congress and somebody that they know they can call on and that has live the life that they lead you know my husband and I were put into kids through college we we struggle with our own college loans and paid those off and we have the same the same concerns that other middle-class families do across the state and you know i think i think the the Republican ticket Governor Romney congressman best they've lived a different life they've had more opportunity more advantage and I think sometimes that's hard to translate the lives of everyday people and that's the last question I have them we I know you got to go what will be the defining issues of this election opportunity fairness I think what people are looking for is just a fair shake from their government they're looking for a chance that their children can have a life that is as good or better than their own and work we're all working for that it's about the future and it's about looking ahead and and I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and very patriotic and proud proud person and looking forward to serving in Congress to represent the people of the second suspect well that's like moon point campaign come back absolutely we'll be back

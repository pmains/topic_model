I'm so excited to see so many members here after a late night last night when we heard the great state of union address by the President of the United States we were so pleased that he mentioned violence against women and recognized the leadership of vice president biden as you know yesterday the Senate passed the bill i know mr. Hoyer are whip its love to tell you the numbers after all i'll leave that to him to do but here we are again last year the senate overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way passed the Violence Against Women Act last night the Senate did too now is we're calling upon the majority in the house to bring that bill to the floor delay is not an option every moment of delay is harmful to women a delay when so many women are still forced to suffer in silence in the face of abuse it's not an option when many women fear for their lives really in their own homes are in the workforce it's not independent it's not an option when the safety of millions of Americans members of the LGBT community Native Americans and immigrants are at stake particularly with the delay in the house there's no time to waste and so we're just going to I'm going to yield to mr. Roy we'll talk to you about the Senate whatever else he wants to do but I want to to mention that you'll be hearing from three some of the women leaders in the house on the subject as you know Gwen Moore has been the champion has been the author of the this bill the bill we had then the companion bill we have in the house in this Congress congresswoman slaughter was an author of the lead author of the bill when it was initially authorized in the 90s congresswoman Kirkpatrick is with us who has a large population of Native Americans in her district and can speak firsthand for the need for this legislation of course we're very honored to be joined by the once chairman hopefully future chairman of the Judiciary Committee mr. Conyers our ranking member who's been a leader on this issue as well mr. Hoyer thank you very much madam later I am pleased to be here with all of you there are mostly women on this platform this is not a woman's issue this is an everybody's issue every father every husband every brother this is an issue about everybody yesterday the Senate once again passed a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act 78 to 22 all the Democrats voted for it a majority of the Republicans voted for it and every woman member of the Senate Republican or Democrat voted for it when I co-sponsored the original act in 1994 we had strong bipartisan support in both houses of Congress there is no reason and the Senate is a perfect demonstration of this why that shouldn't be the case today ard leader Cantor said during my coloquei on the floor last week that he cares deeply about women who are victims of violence at risk and I quote we need to get them the relief them being the women of our country the relief that this bill offer that's our priority we must move and act on this bill close quote of Eric Cantor I agree with mr. Cantor and the how soft acts swiftly ASAP to pass the Senate's version which is supported by law enforcement civil rights groups and those who care for victims of domestic violence I strongly urge the majority leader mr. Cantor and mr. boehner to put this bill on the floor right away one of the things the president said last night with which I hope everybody agreed the American people deserve a vote they sent us here to act some will vote no some will vote I but the American people deserve the right to have us vote I'm now pleased to yield to somebody who was my co-sponsor I was a co-sponsor of his I should say it the right way mr. Chairman I was a co-sponsor of his on the Violence Against Women Act of 1990 for John Conyers the once and future chair of the Judiciary Committee thank you thank you very much Steny Hoyer madam leader and to all of the women that are here I want to hear what they have to say and so now that it's established that i was on the Judiciary Committee in 1994 was working on the measure in 1993 and we have now had over a year when this law has not been in effect and we are proud of the fact that the president included it in his remarks of only a yesterday and so all I want you to know in addition to what's already been said is failing to authorize this proven effective legislation in dangers the health and safety of women children and all victims of domestic violence and the needs of law enforcement and service providers let's move now now is the time thank you very much Thank You mr. Conyers we're while we're celebrating the sentence passage of the Violence Against Women Act and now it is time for the house to take up this bill we have 201 co-sponsors of this bill and there's a letter that's been circulated signed by 17 Republicans who say that they want to join in a bipartisan way to pass the Violence Against Women Act that is the magic number of 218 mr. Cantor there is an aspiration among members of the House Democrats and Republicans to pass spill don't delay please live up to what you have said that we must move and act on this bill now we have the chance thank you and I would yield to miss slaughter one of the original co-sponsors of the women Violence Against Women Act in 1994 thank you so much Gwen and I'm happy something to be here today and with the good news from the Senate in 1994 when we worked on this bill this was not an issue that was talked about very much it was sort of inside the family kind of thing and nobody discussed so it wasn't so easy then either to pass it I had a chance to speak with vice president about it last night and remind him of the fight that we had all gone through and Pat Schroeder and I were putting the bill together we're very happy to have had his assistance over in the Senate to get that done but as a tell you that the notion of what is being as going on here now was something that never occurred to us in 94 the idea that certain categories of persons in this country would be exempt from this kind of protection is an assault on our conscience and we can't live with that but the most important thing that I want to tell you this morning is the ranking member of the Rules Committee I can assure you that for the last three working weeks we've had here we have worked on bills that were play let's pretend let's make believe we're doing something nothing fits that category more than what we're going to do this afternoon and the rest of the week we'll be through at 1 30 today we're going to just pass a rule tomorrow we can't do suspensions because it's not on suspension it's not allowed and then we'll still hang around here to friday what I think we have to insist on is that eric cantor put this bill on the floor and let us pass it and go home before friday we know the presence is anxious to to sign it i was greatly pleased and cheered by what our colleagues did in the Republican caucus and his Gwen is pointed out if they don't do it right away we should have a critical mass to get it either done by during a special making sure that we get it onto the floor with 218 we have to get it done it's very disgraceful it does not say things good about us as Americans that we allow this kind of thing to go on uselessly so now let me call on Miss Kilpatrick i think is up next Thank You Colin swimming mm-hmm I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of this legislation and I'm hopeful that it will pass in a bipartisan vote in Arizona's congressional district one we have twelve tribes Native Americans make up twenty-five percent of the congressional district unfortunately Native American women are two and a half times two and a half times more likely to be assaulted in their lifetime than any other woman in the United States I was born and raised on tribal land on the White Mountain Apache nation I've experienced firsthand the challenges that our tribal communities face this legislation is important to my constituents it's strengthens tribal criminal jurisdiction over those who assault Native American spouses and dating partners while on tribal land it clarifies jurisdiction for civil orders of protection it improves grant programs to help tribal communities and it's strengthens assault statutes once again we need to do all we can to keep victims safe and hold perpetrators accountable I hope the house will work together to pass a strong bipartisan bill and I yield back to leader Pelosi thank you very much I have to warn my colleagues that a vote has been called over 300 members have not voted yet so we have a few moments but I want to commend a congresswoman Gwen Moore congresswoman Louise slaughter and congresswoman Kirkpatrick for their leadership on this issue i do want to know a notice note and then he will remember this that Nita Lowey rosa DeLauro and many of us on the Appropriations Committee work very hard for the funding for this legislation that implemented it as well so it was it was it was a time though we're a lot of congresswoman slaughter said this was silent like in my community which is very diverse I was hearing from advocates again a for domestic violence legislation but saying our people won't speak out in the immigration immigrant community they won't talk about it it's a silent silent problem they're Native American community in the military Jack Murtha was a hero he got he was criticized for bringing up the subject that it would even exist in the military and now we know what the challenges are much of it is improved obviously because of this legislation many women and men have been protected from from violence what is the answer to the question of why is this bill not coming up let's let's vote on it with that would be pleased no my colleagues other than those who spoke would be resource to and any questions you may have yes ma'am well mr. Hoyer well as I said yeah I've talked to Eric very briefly eric is indicated that he supported wants to move this legislation indicated talk to Joe Biden as you know he and vice president have a relationship coming out of there and negotiations on the cliff and but he also animates I don't want he says he says that a lot of his members have had problems which you which is why they haven't brought the Senate bill to the floor last time however with the with a majority of the republicans in the united states senate majority voting for it it seems that there is little reason not to bring this legislation forwards been worked on hard they've taken care of the blue slip the funding issue that was the problem that was articulated why they didn't bring to the floor now there is no no such impediment and i would hope they would bring it to the floor as miss Laura said Franklin they could bring it to the floor this week I doubt they'll do that but they ought to certainly bring it no later than the week we get back and another reason why we should not be taking a break to go home sequester is on the horizon we want to avoid that we have a responsibility to work hard to do so violence against women add triumphantly past enough strong bipartisan way 78 222 those numbers are stunning yesterday and why can't we just bring up that bipartisan strongly supported bill in the Senate bring it up in the house so it while they may have some members that have a problem with it many a number of the Republican members that come to me and said we really need to do this bill I don't want to vote against my leadership on when we took the vote the last time but i do want to send them a message that i know that this is a problem i know that we should pass the bill and i think i hope that that that will way that the number who do want something to happen will be as important as that the number who do not want something that but if they don't want it to happen at least take a vote and we could lose or we could win but the American people will know and other questions okay what's the time dis only one yeah just fun in terms of their problem is that they say there's a constitutional issue with Native American with tribal lands having sovereignty over being able to prosecute people who have committed these crimes that are not from but they're on tribal lands and they're on tribal lands that's an excuse it is not a reason it is a glaring hole in injustice for Native women who are being abused in fact we have heard reports where perpetrators deliberately drag women back on King tribal lands so that they can circumvent justice the counties or the state law enforcement have no jurisdiction on the tribal lands and the tribal courts have no jurisdiction while they're there on tribal lands so the solution they say is to go to federal court you take up resent their 11 tribes in Wisconsin so you take bad River for example the tribal lands it's five hours away from a federal court so what has happened is is of those rapes sexual assaults domestic violence breaches fifty-two percent of them are not dealt with in the legal system and of those fifty two percent sixty-seven percent of them are sexual assaults and you heard and say earlier representa Patrick say earlier that you know it might speak volumes as to why you got two and a half times as many as much violence against Native American women because you know perpetrators know that they can do this with impunity thank you you

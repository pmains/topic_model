i'd like to continue on the discussion of the dual eligibles dr rogers can you explain the benefits of dual eligible integration and how this will help states improve care once it is implemented absolutely if you look at south carolina for example and you've got someone that has a mental health crisis they end up in a hospital that is often going to be paid for through medicare but let's say that person needs to go into the community and they need wrap-around services they need services for if they're homeless they need other services that may not be covered by medicaid many of those are going to be covered by medicare i mean those going to be covered by medicaid in south carolina and so i think that figuring out how to blend federal dollars and state dollars has been one of the ways that south carolina has been able to manage our way through that because many of the services that now aren't blended the state has actually stepped in to cover many of those services and it usually is around areas such as social determinants for example coordination of care for example talked earlier about the fact that many individuals need medical care as well as psychiatric care much of that psychiatric care is not necessarily provided in a doctor's office but may be provided in a community may be provided in a community residential treatment facility so finding ways to actually figure out how to blend funding to be able to have that integrated care in a single setting is often very very important and dr raj we're talking about a nationwide a significant population nearly 12 million senior americans are dual eligibles and so this approach that we're seeking to establish through the aim act could have a tremendous impact on providing an enhanced level of care and assistance to those who may need it the most is that fairly accurate that's very very accurate because the problem we're seeing in south carolina with having an elderly population there's the same problem that we're seeing around the entire country yes um it's it's state to state um oftentimes you see that disaggregation of care um because of the way it's currently funded thank you sir another question for you dr rogers is i think through my opening comments about the important role that law enforcement plays in so many crises around the country and specifically at home the importance of finding a path to having co-responders mental health experts also responding to the challenges that law enforcement officers are responding to seems to me to be a very important part of a new apparatus that could perhaps de-escalate one of the reasons why i've worked with a senator cornyn and many others on the law enforcement de-escalation training act to find a way to help those two worlds come together in order to serve the communities who desperately need perhaps more assistance dr rogers could you share the outcomes that have resulted from the partnership between the south carolina department of mental health and local law enforcement absolutely i think this is an area where we really have excelled as a state currently we're embedded with 17 of our local law enforcement agencies in south carolina the things that we have seen is we have our crisis intervention teams where we have officers that are actually going out with a trained clinician usually a master's level clinician that's actually out with them in the field if it's related to a mental health crisis they're able to dually engage we also have individuals who are in call centers and so we're able to really triage those calls on on the front end for those areas that don't have an embedded clinician we have mobile crisis that's available in all 46 counties in south carolina those mobile crisis teams can be called out by a family by law enforcement really by anyone that allows us to respond i think to anything that's coming up in a fairly short period of time if we go out for example and it's a difficult situation law enforcement will often clear the scene make sure there's it's a safe environment and then mobile crisis will actually move in and continue to work with the family or individual and allows the officer to really move on to something else and then thirdly something that we have done is we have what's called first teams we recognize that law enforcement often are encountering individuals in very difficult times often there's not a place to talk about it so as a department one of the things that we have done is to develop mental health services specifically for first responders and so those individuals are actually able to come to a different location able to engage with therapists that are specifically trained to work with law enforcement agents throughout the state that has been a really incredible program that has benefited us a great deal frequently we're law enforcement's engaging with folks that are at their worst they're in crisis at the time and so trying to figure out whatever we can do to be able to support law enforcement as well as the individuals who are in crisis has been something critical to us to do in terms of our law enforcement uh partnerships thank you dr rogers one of the things i'd like to say before a number of times run out chairman is the importance of that scene that you've just described the ability to clear a scene to let the mental health experts address the challenge so often the folks who are calling the law enforcement officers to the scene are the family members who love the individual who needs to figure out how to de-escalate the situation i think that's one of the reasons why it's so important that we don't just sugarcoat the issue but dig a little deeper into how we create an apparatus that actually works for the family who's trying to figure out how to de-escalate a situation not to watch it explode on their very in the very homes so thank you very much for that answer jeremy

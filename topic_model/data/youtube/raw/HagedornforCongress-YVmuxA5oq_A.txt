that's the bee gees how deep is your love here on a kk oj radio we have overcast skies the current temperature of 51 degrees it is 1009 and we have a guest in our Studios this morning we're being joined by Republican candidate for Minnesota House District one Jim Hagedorn and Jim thank you very much for taking the time to stop down here it's a pleasure to be here Dave thank you for the opportunity and you've been you've been a busy guy here's the last several months well we've been out campaigning crisscrossing across this big district it's 21 counties all the way from South Dakota to Wisconsin and then Iowa up about 0 75 or 80 miles and recently just this past weekend we received the endorsement of the first District Republican Party we left our Mankato convention energized and unified in our race against liberal congressman Tim Walz and we're just excited to get out and meet the folks especially here in Jackson County where we we were on the ballot last time in we won Jackson County so we talked we talked a little bit about it before and it's a completely different landscape and game from two years ago as two years ago you actually went to the primary was able to you didn't get the endorsement from the party but it was able to win the primary election in August and actually put up a really really close election in November well yeah we did surprise some people and our 5446 result against the incumbent was I think pretty good especially since we only we were outspent 621 and but we did the retail campaigning we were out there meeting the folks we're doing much of that this time we've started earlier we're organizing better we're going to raise some more money and and I think we're going to finish the job here because like you said things are different two years ago in that election some of the issues just weren't quite resonating the way they are today we're seeing Obamacare in the way it's costing people some twenty twenty-five thousand a year it's just it's not affordable and the congressman's vote on that was very hurtful to the people he represents radical Islam is something now Isis wasn't really even in the news in that last election just just barely now we see that it's expanding the Middle East is in trouble Minnesota has a terrorist recruiting problem we just saw that recently with the trial of the Somali who were refugees and Isis at people so the issues are resonating I think unfortunately the the economy is on people's minds because it's tightening and and so we're taking our reforms in our vision straight to the people well that's something to we talked about the last election cycle is you you are probably the most on the street candidate I think I have ever seen you I don't think there was a town parade or a town festival or affairs that went on in your district that you were not at well unfortunately they don't allow cloning here so II otherwise we've tried to be at all of them but and we're going to do the same thing this time around we're going to hit every parade and all the county fairs and and we'll be at every possible event and then we'll get into the coffee shops and on top of that though we do go squarely at the congressman on the issues and talk about his record and talk about my vision and that's something he doesn't do wherever he goes he talks about process and he talks about generalities doesn't talk about his voting record so I'm always happy to get into that so as you're out on the street talking to people in the district what are what are the big issues that you hear what our people concerned about in district 1 well this is an agricultural base district so people are concerned about the AG economy they feel that things are tightening we have low commodity prices we have still high input costs a glut of product median farm income is at a 20-year low unfortunately and what farmers they understand the ups and downs of farming and I myself I grew up on a grain and livestock farm over by Truman my father Tom Hagedorn and grandfather great-grandfather all farmers so we get it farming's up farming's down but what we don't get is when our congressman goes out there to Washington and represents a rural district and votes for all these EPA regulations all is extreme liberalism when it comes to global warming and energy policies these things that are driving up farmers cost their production costs so putting the squeeze on farmers we need a congressman it's going to go out there and do just the opposite for instance on the regulations I support a thing called the reins Act which would require the Congress to vote and approve every major rule we need to neuter the EPA not let them come down and abuse our farmers we're visiting with the Republican candidate for Minnesota House District one Jim Hagedorn here on a kk o JN shifting gears a little bit nationwide looking at the Republican Party a very hotly contested presidential race and at least for now it appears that the dust is settling and now we're moving forward with though what a lot of people consider a little more on unconventional candidate in Donald Trump being the leader and how I guess how do you feel working with somebody like that well the race sets up very very for big contrast between the two parties and I said all along whoever wins the Republican nomination comes out of the Cleveland Convention as our candidate I will support that person it looks like it's going to be Donald Trump so I am happy to run this election with him and we will offer a big contrast look Hillary Clinton and Tim Walz and the Democrats they they offer the voters Obama's third term nobody wants that they also offer a Supreme Court that is going to be stacked with justices especially one to replace Justice Scalia is going to take away the individual right to keep and bear arms going to take away our religious freedoms and probably a lot of our other liberties so you know we on the Republican side will run on big bold solutions to take the power from the Washington politicians bureaucrats interest groups give it back to the states and the people we need to make big fundamental substantial change in Washington or we're going to lose our country the way the forefathers put it together and so we need to defend our country secure our borders protect our people from radical Islam get the economy going weed out excessive government and then protect our god-given right so i think this election sets up very nicely for the republicans and i'm excited about it just you mentioned a little bit on there and what what do you see are the key differences between you and representative waltz in district 1 Tim Walz has been in Washington for 10 years and frankly it hasn't been a good 10 years for the country he went out there his his premier issue was going to be he was going to help the veterans for instance and I'd say unfortunately the veterans are worse off today than when he went to Washington they're dying at the hands of the US government the VA is a bloated mess I've offered several solutions in the areas of veterans care to help them first and foremost should hold the VA accountable when the bureaucrats heard a veteran that bureaucrat should be fired or demoted expeditiously the Republicans had a bill on that last year walls voted no so there's a big difference right there he supports the bureaucrats I support the veteran then when it comes to their medical care I think every veteran should be allowed to go out and choose the doctor that they want and go get medical care whenever and wherever they need it whether that's from the VA or the private sector walls opposes that he says that that will somehow undermine the VA and it will hurt veterans I think that's ridiculous I mean here's a guy in Tim Walz who supports choice abortion on demand choice to basically murder babies in the seventh eighth and ninth month of pregnancy but when it comes to choice for veterans to go out and choose their own doctor he's against it he's got it just opposite the people of southern Minnesota are traditional people their beliefs and values I would represent them more in the Congress than with the congressman so we're going to end here with a little bit of a curveball people who who follow politics follow government there's 435 members in the US House of Representatives how can one person what can you do to help change that and get things done the House of Representatives is an institution the forefathers put together to be a powerful institution to to promote our laws it's run by the majority one vote more than half gets you the majority you control the committee's you control the agenda and that type of thing I would be in the majority as a Republican and the way I could influence is one person is be part of a body that is going to influence fundamental change for our country we need to have laws and ideas and so forth coming out of Washington that are going to make that place less powerful and frankly I think we have better solutions than the incumbent and he's going to vote for instance for things like Obamacare he's going to vote for cap-and-trade energy he's going to vote for weakness against Islamic terrorism he's going to have open borders and amnesty that's where he is I'm on the other side and I'm going to promote that agenda and as part of that body I would make a difference we've been visiting with Republican House candidate for a district one in Minnesota Jim Hagedorn would just like to state that

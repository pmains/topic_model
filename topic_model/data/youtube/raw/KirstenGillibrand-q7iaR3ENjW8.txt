the voters will decide what kind of president they want they'll decide what type of vision they want and who's gonna have the courage and bravery to stand up to the special interests so many people feel left behind because Washington works for the powerful it works for the special interests and every decision that's made is typically based on who has the power that is literally rooted in the greed and corruption that decides things that's why you know when Medicare Part D got passed it was written in the dead of night that drug companies they will not negotiate in bulk with the American people it's why we pay too much for drugs under Medicare you look at the NRA they are largely funded by the gun manufacturers the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales it doesn't matter if the person's on the terror watch list it doesn't matter if they have a violent criminal background it doesn't matter if they've beaten their wife that's why they're against the violence against women's act which is outrageous so let's call it what it is it's greed and corruption and you need a president who's going to be strong enough to stand up to that and to do what's right especially and even when it's hard and that's why I'm running I cannot tell you how called I feel to run for the right reasons and run to actually serve others and that means speaking to all Americans in the red places in the purple places and the blue places and unlike many people running I actually win in red areas I win in the red places upstate New York the purple areas Long Island and I have a higher vote threshold in my state than anyone who's ever run in the history of the state at 72% and not only that I bring people together in Congress in the last Congress alone I passed eighteen pieces of legislation that helped people like more money for rural broadband or more money for manufacturing things that will help all the places that are feeling left behind mica oh I told everybody when I first met you Kirsten do not underestimate her

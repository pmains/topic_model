hello I'm Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego I am honored to be joined today by my predecessor as Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton our current Arizona congressman representing district 9 Washington DC is a key partner as we fight Cobin 19 and as we make sure that we keep Arizona safe congressman Stanton thank you so much for your hard work whether it be fighting for our healthcare workers or Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport or our first responders we are grateful for your partnership in this difficult time may I really appreciate you having me on in this important conversation and I really do appreciate your strong leadership in these unprecedented challenging times it is not easy to make some of the important but incredibly difficult decisions that you've had to make as a leader of our city and I really admire you and appreciate that we need that strong leadership we're going to continue to need it as we fight this horrific pandemic Thank You congressman thank you for your partnership I thought this would be a great opportunity for Phoenix residents to get an update from Washington DC so thank you for taking the time to share a little bit about the important work you are doing perhaps we could get started with an overview of the major bills around corona virus yeah I appreciate that look the the Congress has passed three bills important bills already as it relates to the pandemic early in March we did pass our first bill which is eight point three billion dollar bill mostly to provide support for community health centers and for a healthcare community as you know the president asked for two and a half billion dollars we realized that what that wasn't going to be enough and we significantly increased that to provide those important resources then after that just a couple weeks later we realized how devastating this pandemic was going to be for families across America across Arizona here in Phoenix and we passed the family first act which was the bill that greatly expanded unemployment benefits it increased Medicaid benefits as well and really wanted to do all we can to support families it did provide paid leave which is so important for families so they don't have to provide that difficult decision about whether to go to work when they potentially feel sick and then the bill that's getting so much attention is the cares Act that was Pat light there was a five members of the Arizona delegation flying across the country on a red-eye flight to make sure we got there because one member of Congress wanted to force a actual vote instead of a do it by acclamation and so we had to fly back to vote on the cares act and that's the bill that's getting so much attention right now that does include the Paycheck Protection Act 300 and about 60 million for that other resources to help the airline industry and others also it did provide for a direct payment to about 150 million Americans of 1200 dollars a person and $500 per child to help through this time now it's a two trillion dollar bill the largest bill in the history of the United States of America but you know what you know this mayor that ain't enough there's still a lot more support that needs to be given to small business across our community and likely the more support directly for families we don't know how long this crisis is going to last these are incredibly important decisions that you and other key leaders are going to have to to make over the next few months is how we reopen the economy how swiftly reopen the economy how we can go about it etc we do know the pain is going to be going on for a long period of time and so we're in the planning stages right now of even passing another act to better support small business and the American people wonderful thank you we understand that right now in Arizona only about 7% of our small businesses with 500 or fewer employers were able to participate in that first round of the assistance so we really appreciate your work to make sure that that is expanded I recently participated in a mayor's conference call with the Trump administration and tried to urge them that they do more work for underbanked and credit unions include community development finance institutions so that we can get money to the full diversity of our Arizona small businesses who cause you have been an advocate for those small businesses create the vitality of our community they're what make it a special place then and we want to make sure that they get through it here at the City of Phoenix we've done a grant program in partnership with the Community Foundation for our smallest businesses $10,000 grant huge interest in that program and we know that it that it is just a start in what the need is so will you talk a little bit more about that small business program and where you'd like to see it go in the next round yeah I refer Stoff congratulations on taking the lead on providing direct support from the city and I hope other governmental entities in the state of Arizona the county the state and others also do similar type things we this we have to take an all-in approach everyone needs to be part of the solution not just to look to the federal government obviously we're an incredibly important part of providing support for the community but every layer of government needs to be as supportive as possible so thank you for stepping up once again and showing great leadership what you mentioned about small business is 100 percent accurate we want to help these small businesses not just because you know it's a horrific thing we're going through and we feel bad and we want to make sure we support people in need the reality is once the economy is ready to be reopened it's going to happen a lot more quickly if people didn't leave their employment that they didn't go on to the unemployment rolls that they are able to stay employed and stay on healthcare to the extent possible during this pandemic the more people we can keep employed keep those small businesses going this is going to be a lot faster recovery so we're doing it because it's the right thing to do from a human level and it's the right thing to do from an economic level if we want the United States to recover as quickly as possible so as you pointed out the PPP was an incredibly popular program 360 billion dollars got out the door in just a short period of time I as a member of Congress we're studying who got their resources what parts of the country what industry size a business the truth is I'm pretty disappointed it looks like some of the big banks did not get out nearly the resources to small business as they should I want to make sure we get to the final analysis before painting with too broad of a brush but the reality is is the initial information is not very is not very positive and so the next round has to be more geared directly to small business and the big banks oh it to us oh look to the American people we've supported them in the past they need to support us now they need to be putting in the hours 24/7 to work with small business get those applications in so that Arizona small business benefits from the next round right now there's conversations going on in Congress about two hundred fifty billion dollars plus for additional support for the PPP program in addition the caucus that I'm a part of the house Democratic caucus is also asking for additional support for state and local government I was remiss earlier and when we talked about cares Act one there was a significant amount of money for airports for which Sky Harbor of course benefits so from you've been such a strong advocate of airports it benefits universities throughout the United States America Arizona State University got the highest allocation of any university in the United States of America and you and I both know how incredibly important they've been to the economic success of Phoenix and what they've done in downtown helped transform in such a positive way their success their continued growth is essential for the Phoenix in the Arizona economy so University support aviation support and state local government I think we make a mistake when we use the term state local government because it almost like dehumanizes what we're talking about you know we're talking about more than anybody we're talking about core services that the city provides police and fire of parts and libraries that if you have to cut one hundred plus million out of the budget that can't be done magically that has to be done unfortunately in terms of cutting core services and that's where the federal government needs to be the strongest partner we can be with state local government we're negotiating right now to make sure that we provide more support for cities like Phoenix and Tempe and Mesa and Scottsdale and Chandler I mentioned those because they're all in my district cities across Arizona and the country and state governments as well state governments are going to need that support it's worth fighting for and so I know there's you're gonna hear a lot of discussion about whether we do PPP just by itself or other things look you know I'm gonna be supportive of what comes before us because we need to get that support out there but whether we do it now or later we're gonna have to do more support for hospitals for cities and we need to provide more SNAP benefits for those that are food insecure this is a really important issue more and more people are going to rely on the federal government for support for food security and we need to make sure that the support is there so that no one goes hungry during this time of pandemic thank you we really appreciate your leadership so many of those things you touched on such as hunger were challenges before Kovach 19 and it has only gotten worse with kovat 19 grateful for your leadership on securing funding for our universities especially Arizona State they have been a key partner of ours they're working with us to test our first responders and also to implement the surveillance data so that we know throughout the community what is happening in Arizona and when it is safe to make changes to the protections we have in place they also shared great data with us that we are flattening the curve here in Maricopa County that social distancing and all the measures we are taking are working and in saving lives so grateful for ASU and and for the support that you have gotten them particularly their their partnership with our first responders and again I want to thank you for helping lead the way to make sure we can get equipment for our first responders at reasonable prices an n95 mask cost 85 cents before coronavirus and now we have vendors who are charging us $6 per mask huge increases in prices so appreciate your leadership in that area can you tell us what to expect it would in terms of what's coming in terms of supply chain for protective equipment and for testing all right mayor there are a lot of things for people watching this video to be really angry about as it relates to the response well in my opinion the lack of leadership the flash but a response to this crisis testing lack of support for testing lack of planning for testing is number one and lack of using the real levers of government to control the supply line so we can get that protective equipment into the hands of our heroes the nurses and doctors and and health officials working in directly with patients too with our police officers and firefighters and Emergency Management folks and to those working at Safeway and at Fry's and other grocery stores in the valley are the grocery store employees who are really the unsung heroes of this whole thing making sure that our food security systems are as strong as possible and putting their own lives at at risk you know I'm I'm really angry about that look you know that the original test kits that were sent to Maricopa County Public Health were defective and they were sent in early February we found out about it in late February I immediately wrote a letter to the vice-president who's been put in charge of this by President Trump saying that's not acceptable we lost weeks and weeks during the key month of February where we had defective test kits out in the community that we couldn't use and we were not utilizing the laboratories around the country to be able to build their own kits and support the supply systems there so that we could get testing up and running in a more significant way and we've been behind the curve on testing and mayor that's going to make your job even more difficult because as you make decisions as to under what circumstances we open the recount for the economy and how we go about it the lack of an effective and thorough testing system makes your job so much more difficult and I'm really mad about that and we've got to do more to kind of hold people accountable in that regard and then if the failure of the administration to take advantage of the defense production Act this insanity of having Phoenix police and fire having to compete against states and hospitals and everyone else and and therefore driving up the price unnecessarily as opposed to doing this in an organized way to make sure that the production systems are in place the logistic systems are in place and we get the PPE into the hands of the people that need it imagine the frustration of our fire chief and our police chief as not only did they put in orders for the entire Valley and the price is six hundred percent higher than they thought but then you have the federal government actually mint redirecting that equipment that they rightfully ordered to other agencies around the country I mean this is we're shooting ourselves in the foot so I and others have called upon the President to fully utilize the defense production act get control of the supply lines this is an emergency situation president likes to describe himself as a wartime president hey one thing you got to do if this really is a wartime is take advantage of the power that you've been granted by the defense production act and to get the PPE in the hands of people that need it sorry for venting a little bit there but I mean like you I am unbelievably mad and frustrated by the flat-footed and in my opinion ineffective response from the administration it has been so frustrating when we place an order for protective equipment we are told it is coming and then it gets diverted by our federal government we have a great team at incident command that's trying to manage the supply chain but we do find it frustrating when we have to compete where we should be collaborating so as we hope that your words are heard by the right people because it has been so frustrating with just basic issues around our supply chain and it's been a real frustration for for me on both supply chain and on testing particularly in our low-income areas Phoenix we have not had a lot of people tested and we're hoping to work on that it's a little bit of a surprise to me we have to turn to our universities which are not usually the folks you turn to to get testing for first responders but thankfully they did answer and are helping us but lots of room for improvement and we're looking forward to the day when people in Phoenix who need tests can get them that's great marinelli add one more thing on the issue of price geology because that's what we've seen is plain and simple price gouging no questions about it that's why congressman guy go and I wrote a letter to the Attorney General saying you got to get on this right away the President did do an executive order on price gouging our governor did an executive order on price gouging we need our law enforcement officials our Attorney General here in Arizona the Attorney General the United States to investigate right away when when we wrote that letter and we publicly talked about a company that was doing it guess what that company changed their mind and they decided not to accept any profit for supplying PPE we believe that sunshine is an important disinfectant on the issue of price gouging and as more and more companies we want to keep the anonymous if they're engaged in this really bad activity we got to name names and and have those companies publicly answer for themselves when they get caught I think you're gonna find more and more companies are going to say you know what we're not going to engage this bad behavior we're not going to take advantage of this an overly profit during this pandemic period on much needed protective equipment for first responders and our health care heroes absolutely thank you and it's also been a strong lesson for me on the importance of local business because it's so often the local companies that have been willing to step up and provide supplies whether it be our breweries who have pivoted to making hand sanitizer or local manufacturers who are now making and 95 masks or or gowns it really is a great reminder that local businesses are the ones that get you through hard times so look forward to working with you to support them because they are doing so much for us and as you know never underestimate on the issue of being mayor of a big city the bully pulpit is and when you ask people to step up you know what they do they do step up and so thank you for pushing the community to move in that right direction it really really has been wonderful to see when we ask for help this community has stepped up we did a supply drive for our first responders and companies like on semiconductor showed up with boxes and boxes of n95 masks that surprise supply drive was significant was actually sufficiently successful we were able to send equipment to the Navajo Nation and also to a heroic organization circle the city that that provides shelter for our homeless community locally and that's actually the focus of my next question you did a lot of work as mayor to to provide additional resources to fight and end homelessness in this community it was a challenge before Kovach 19 but like every challenge has gotten bigger with the virus can can you talk a little bit about that area sure it only carries act it did provide I think 51 million dollars for homeless services around the country Phoenix did very well in that regard state of Arizona got resources to support more direct support for people experiencing homelessness but none of us are naive we know that during this time of pandemic the issue of supporting people that are experiencing homelessness is going to get worse and not better that's why I really applaud your leadership in reminding people that the solutions to homelessness it's not the federal government's issue it's not the City of Phoenix issue it's not the state of Arizona the counties the make the faith community the nonprofit's under our state constitution no one's really in charge per se of homelessness everyone is and so I really applaud your approach because it's not directly your or the city responsibility you didn't lean away from it you leaned into it and said we all have to come together as a community to provide better solutions that includes not just resources but also locations of service which really should be done on a regional basis and not have such a disproportionate amount of the services provided in one city if we're going to expand more services in Phoenix we also need to make sure that services are provided in other cities I'm proud if I can brag about my district which includes Phoenix Tempe and Mesa those are the cities that have more than any others have really stepped up to the plate in the valley and it really is time for the other cities to do more and the state of Arizona has to do a lot more and not just depend on the government but as they develop budgets in the future because homelessness is going to be an increasingly important issue to provide those resources and then of course in terms of the provision of resources it has to be done the most strategic way possible with wraparound services so-called housing first and you know that's the most effective model and communities all across the valley have to be willing to kind of do their part as we work to resolve homelessness no one suggests it's going to be easy but everyone needs to do their part and I really respect your leadership and vocalizing that a month or so ago making that important point and I appreciate your leadership thank you and it has been wonderful to see Mesa step up and make additional investments cities receive money called Community Development Block Grants that we can use for any number of projects in lower-income communities large cities receive it it is my top priority that we put that towards fighting homelessness and we're excited to see if other cities are going to be interested in joining us we may also be getting into the hotel business on Tuesday and trying to provide additional housing units in a hotel sitting that way you're told is better for reducing the spread of kovat 19 than more traditional denser settings so a lot of innovation coming and hopefully good solutions and we appreciate the federal government being a partner for us we need more what I mean by that is a state of Arizona did more in terms of housing tax credits so that developers produce more affordable housing in our communities we need do the exact same thing at the federal level provide important tax credits so that way we can incentivize the development of affordable housing in Phoenix throughout the valley throughout the state of Arizona and around the country and we need to provide more support for renters as well this is going to be a brutally difficult time and we need to all we can - in addition to supporting people experiencing homelessness is getting in there and trying to prevent homelessness as much as possible in the first place so increasing the supply of affordable housing as well as supporting those that are on the edge that might end up experiencing homelessness we have to do more to support those individuals that's the best way to fight homelessness is to prevent it in the first place absolutely most cost-effective and best for the people involved the City Council did have a big vote on eviction assistance this week and as you've said we're gonna have to keep doing more because this is such a huge challenge you have been during this and before the coab in nineteen crisis a strong voice for our daca recipients deferred action for childhood arrival there is huge legal uncertainty right now those individuals are a key part of our response to Coba 19 can you talk a little bit about the work you're doing in that area yes and thank you to yourself for being such a strong supporter of our immigrant communities particularly those that are participating in the daca program look is there an issue that represents dysfunction in Washington more than our inability to really get comprehensive immigration reform overall done you and I both know no city or community in the country would better benefit from a true comprehensive reform system than Phoenix Arizona okay we can't get that done unfortunately because of politics even though we should President Obama did implement the daca program so at least those young people who are adding so much value to our communities they don't have to fear deportation people who are brought here as young children that grew up here and there is Arizona nor phoenician as URI that they shouldn't have to face deportation and we did pass in Congress what's called the in the House of Representative the dream and the promise act which would provide an opportunity to citizenship for these young daca recipients okay that didn't work out we couldn't get we couldn't get even the dream in the promise Act passed now in this pandemic look what we've learned in Arizona alone almost 7,000 daca recipients are working in essential jobs essential field over a thousand of them are working directly with coronavirus patients in the hospital setting why in the world under those circumstances where these people are working in industries that we need right now more than ever why would we even consider doing something that would put their status at at risk but that's exactly what's happening there is that this is before the Supreme Court right now the Supreme Court is deciding on the legality and constitutionality of the daca program could you imagine the middle of this pandemic the United States Supreme Court saying that these doctor recipients are somehow not legally able to stay in America and we begin deportation proceedings and not only is the horrific from a human perspective how self-defeating for our fight against corona virus that's why I've called I mean first you know the Supreme Court's gonna do what they're gonna do and I hope and pray they do the right thing but at least the federal government should automatically provide renewal job renewals for these daca recipients most of the offices are closed right now it's taking a long period of time let's not mess around let's just say for the daca recipients they should be automatically renewed allowed at least for the period of the renewal to stay in America to keep doing these and critically important jobs let's not put them at risk and therefore put everyone else at risk by engaging in such a self-defeating thing as not allowing these young people to remain in our economy in these critically important essential jobs absolutely it would be devastating to lose thousands of essential workers all at once and I send my thanks to those essential workers as you just did we would be in such a more difficult position without them so thank you for your advocacy in that area we are in a census year right now and so much of the funding that Washington DC sends to cities including Phoenix is based on population whether it be that essential aid for families for food many of whom who are struggling with hunger right now cares Act dollars much of it delivered based on population what what is your mess to us about the census right now well mayor you've just laid it out as as strongly as possible it is so critically important that every person get counted no matter where you live no matter what city big or small no matter your nationality race religion sexual orientation we need everybody counted because number one it will impact whether or not we get additional representation in Washington DC get an additional congressional seat and it'll impact hundreds of millions of dollars of important federal benefit you talked about fighting homelessness and your leadership there our ability to receive our fair share of Community Development Block Grant monies LIHEAP which helps low-income individuals during the worst of the summer heat not to have their air conditioning turned off affordable housing you name it as so many of the federal programs are based on population Arizona already doesn't get its fair share because we've been a fast growing city and many of the funding formulas are still based on 1960s population models wherever so many more people lived on the East Coast and then the western part of the United States we're already at a disadvantage we don't need to exacerbate that disadvantage by not doing as well as we have in the census I wish the state of Arizona had allocated some resources additional resources so that we could dig as deep as possible into our communities like California has done they provided supplemental resources we didn't do that and so cities like Phoenix have to really do it the old-fashioned way through a lot of volunteers calling their friends and neighbors and making sure that census is filled out I know that the up the much I think about forty six or seven percent of the folks have already filled it out that's a lot that's good it's not great we need to get even more we need to get much closer to a hundred percent the forms are gonna be mailed to households throughout Phoenix in the next few weeks we need everyone to to fill that out so we're gonna have to be as fun and creative as possible to motivate people to participate in the census we need to make sure that communities are not concerned that if they fill out the census that's somehow that's going to be sent over to other agencies immigration agencies etc it's not going to happen I want I want people to have confidence in that regard that you can need all the people counted all the bodies counted so that we get our fair share of federal resources and Mayor I know you've been putting a lot of time and effort to that I really say thank you and admire that and let's do all we can it's critically important thank you I hope we will do our part to get the data that you need to fight for our fair share of Washington DC dollars it was fun for me it was my three-year-olds first census and it was fun to make sure he was counted and counted for education dollars and I hope that other people watching this if you haven't already filled out your census no need to wait if you're watching online you have internet so it's less than 10 minutes for mine and I would encourage people to do that so that we can get our fair share in these very difficult times well I want to thank you for meeting with me virtually we are trying to support social distancing and celebrate that we're flattening the curve look forward to the days when we can all be together but for now we're gonna work for that that testing the contact tracing and all the support we need to to have a safer community and to get back where we need to be thank you for your partnership in these difficult times mayor look we've had some challenging times in the City of Phoenix but let's be honest likely not will be as challenging at least in our modern history as what you are facing right now and I know you're probably trying to you've got your game face on and you're doing the best you can I know this is this is an incredibly difficult period and I just want to say the leadership you provided so far has been outstanding and I'm really happy that you're at the helm of the city during this time of crisis and I have more confidence that will come out of it stronger on the other end because you're in the position we're in so thank you for your leadership wonderful thank you and good luck in Washington DC and with the district office we wish you the best stay safe thanks thanks mayor have a good one

on my team he assists me by furthering my relationships with our local veterans rob also helps veterans and constituents in my district with veterans affairs and defense casework and we are very lucky and privileged to have rob in the office you gentlemen ready to get started for questions of course bill i'm going to start with you what years did you serve i served from 1967 through 1971 and can you just share what were some of the reasons you initially joined the air force actually i was uh just graduated from junior college and my uh changed to one a so i knew it was going to be pretty soon i was going to go into the service so i opted to decide well if i'm going to go in i want to decide what branch i want to go in so i took the test for the air force i passed it and i was able to uh raise my hand and say i do before i got my letter from the president for the united states army and how did your family and friends feel about this air force choice well they thought if i had to go in they felt well go in for something that you want to do and i was able to go into the communication field so it worked out well for me because uh it gave me an opportunity to open up into another field that i had never been involved with before so it was a good choice okay now bringing it fast forward how did you get involved with veterans affairs i started with the cook county actually when i came out of the service in 1971 i worked for a banking industry for a while and non-for-profit organizations and i started working for the treasurer's office and then came over to cook county when i first came over to cook county i was asked to work with an organization called veterans assistance commission of cook county from there i worked there for about a year uh learning the ins and outs of the veterans and what their needs were and what they needed as for terms of moving forward to their life so i was there for a year in that keyport downtown to the uh main office there where uh robin kelly who was my chief staff at the time and president pere wrinkle they had asked me to put together a department of veterans affairs to kind of reach out to our veterans and to see what we can do to provide more assistance for our veterans and how did your service and experiences affect your life well i felt it was very very positive because one of the things i found out being a veteran a lot of veterans do not like to talk to people who are not veterans so the fact that i was overseas i served during the war and i was able to talk to veterans when they came back from home i was able to at least make them aware that there are many many many resources out here for our veterans and we always try to work to encourage them to take advantage of those resources i would imagine that they felt that you could really understand where they were coming from yes they felt comfortable talking to me because they know i had been in the same situation they had been at one time and what advice would you have for anyone considering a career in the u.s armed services i would suggest to any uh young man or young lady that if they do not know exactly what they want to do in life right now it would not hurt to go into the military for either two years if you're in the army or myself i went to the air force for four years just to kind of get a better idea of what's out there what resources out there you get a paycheck every month and you get to learn get the chance to learn a new skill and through your uh what you've done as your livelihood and being a veteran yourself how could our nation be more supportive i would like to see the our nation do more for our current veterans today there's many veterans coming back now i was doing the vietnam era but i've talked to vets who served in iraq afghanistan and whatnot and they've come back home and they don't know where resources are available to them plus when they do get out uh when veterans are looking for jobs they're looking for uh to get a home and things of this nature they don't know where to go and i think their government should be more proactive in trying to provide more resources available for our veterans today well thank you for that advice and i will certainly take that back to uh washington dc is there anything else i haven't covered that uh you want our audience to know i would like to just say uh i thank uh everyone for the idea uh what a place would allow me to be recognized for these past 10 years of service this is one of those jobs where i have truly enjoyed my job it's very easy to talk to people and relate to people when you enjoy what you do so and i think the veterans have appreciated too because uh veterans have no problems in reaching out to me by way of calling me sending me emails and just saying bill what do i need to do to do this or how do i apply for this or how do i go my get my education benefits so for that i feel glad i was able to participate in that in fact i'm going to continue to do that even though i'm retired now i'm going to i'm a veteran all my life so i'm going to continue to do whatever i can well thank you so much and thank you for everything uh that you've done i've witnessed you up close and personal so thank you so much thank you very much i want to turn uh to rob uh tell me a little bit about your family of course um so my family's story starts back in germany west germany actually at the time uh back in 1986 my dad was 26 years old he was stationed um like i said over there um and he was a chief warrant officer and a helicopter pilot my mom went over there for a few weeks to visit her friend and two weeks turned into essentially three years she met my dad she got married she had my older brother and a month later she was pregnant with me um unfortunately on flag day uh june 14th 1988 the helicopter that my father was piloting did crash into a place called lake steinberg it's the second biggest lake in germany um and he was missing for about 10 days before they found him and unfortunately i was born eight days after his crash so i was born on june 22nd you know my mom was overseas she was widowed with my brother who was less than a year old and myself so that was you know obviously traumatic um and then we fast forward 15 years and uh you know a little backstory my dad was married prior to my mom so they had a bit of an age gap so i had an older brother from his previous marriage um once 911 happened he felt a call like so many other people and decided to join the military around 2002 um and he was deployed in iraq and baghdad um and on october 27th of 2003 uh he was attacked by a roadside bomb the humvee that he was in um you know he was obviously killed during then um and after he passed away he was awarded the um the bronze star and then he was also a paratrooper so they awarded him his final jump as well um both my father and my brother were both 82nd airborne so that was that was very awesome um and here we are 18 years after that and i'm here with congresswoman kelly you know we're all trying to do our part so your family has certainly sacrificed what initially made you want to join the gold star family fellowship program and you can tell the audience a little bit about it of course um the gold star family fellowship program is an awesome awesome program that the chief administrative office does they allow employment opportunities for to school star family members anywhere federally on a state level whether it's congressional office or many many avenues within the government they're just great great great opportunities and what initially made me the joint there were multiple reasons but i think my initial driving force was actually the um the january 6 insurrections and just the rampant division that has taken over our country i believe to my core that my father and brother died for a better america and that's not the america we saw on january 6th um you know during the months that followed the insurrection i like most of us i was incredibly angry and frustrated at what was going on and when this present this opportunity presented itself i had a couple friends forward me the information about this i couldn't help but think like this is my chance to step into the ring and make a difference and you know to honor my family's sacrifice and honor that so here i am and since you're here what would you like to accomplish during your time as a gold star family fellow i would like to bring awareness to our overall veterans situation you know i want to make sure that the people that fought for our country are properly taken care of that they have all of the resources available and when i say taken care of i mean physically mentally financially and psychologically i think those are the four things that really we need to focus on in helping them and i know is there any other thing we can do to support gold star families more or how do we um do you feel like people in your uh situation that they know that there is even a gold star family fellow program or is there something more we can do in that area we could definitely endorse the program more you know i found it on linkedin but like i said as i also had a couple people send it to me i think that if we were able to bring awareness to this it would be great to have more gold star family members and people who actually understand the sacrifice on the other end within the government you know that keeps a level of morality there other ways we could assist and support gold star families is just getting involved with your local vfw and your local vso office contacting your state and federal officials and advocating on behalf of them and letting them know that you still care and that they're not forgotten about you know just staying engaged and informed and making sure that their family member is continuously honored and just not pushed to the wayside goes so much farther than what people really know i couldn't have said that better myself and uh that's a great way to end so i want to thank you so much bill and rob for joining me and for all the work you do for illinois 2nd congressional district i especially want to thank you for you i want to thank you and your family for all of your sacrifices and service to our country we must remember that freedom is not free and it's not a guarantee and that it takes brave people to keep us safe so thank you so very much and um i wish you happy veterans day thank you so much congresswoman thank you very much

in our society there is zero tolerance for anti-semitism and in the last week during Hanukkah we have seen an incredible spike in attempted murders assaults and basically anti-semitism on the rise throughout this region in particular well as America's largest Township we stand unified all faiths all elected officials to say we will not tolerate this not in our Township not in our country not in our society and we are going to raise our voices and stand together in both symbolic and to lobby both our state on our federal officials to make sure every faith in our nation in our area and in our township is protected represented and allowed to practice exactly what they want to practice their god-given right and what is basically the foundation of our our country's founding and that freedom there are nine hundred and thirty-two towns that are members of the association of town which means just about the entire state of New York and as their past president and their executive board member I am certainly I know that we will get the support of each of them so everybody working together not all face let's make it one that's must be one person when it comes to making sure that everybody is safe and everybody has a right a right to practice the religion or whatever it is they have they want to this isn't an event that we would like to host but we came here this morning in solidarity we want each and every resident of the town of hempstead nearly 800,000 of them to look at this photo and understand that what we're dealing with here in the town of hempstead in Nassau County on Long Island in New York across America this isn't a Catholic issue this isn't a white issue this isn't a black issue or a Jewish issue or a Baptist issue or I'm from Garden City ish you or I'm from the Southshore issue this is an American issue I've heard from local elected and religious officials for months that they need help that's why when we head back to Albany next week I will continue exploring legislative remedies to help our houses of worship by working with local and state officials because the common bond that we all as elected officials take is to keep our citizens safe we are confident that we we pray to God to protect us from all those who try to to hurt us and we are confident in our elected officials that they will have us they have our backs and they will do whatever it takes to secure our our institutions that religious institutions we're here today to say that we have a zero tolerance policy of violence of any kind so we come today to join forces with our elected officials clergy and community to root out all of the evil that is are with us one of the things that we do know that we will pray more than that we will have faith in God but faith without works is dead so we're here today just to make sure that we join those who are fighting all of these evils that are plaguing our society we can respond with unity an example of what we're doing here today to counter the effects of evil and destructive actions we can respond with love with the hope to rebuild what is affected or what is being lost to rebuild hope we could respond in wisdom to prevent this from happening again we are a society that needs to step forward and stand up and make our voices heard and that's why we're here today unified to show the residents as the new year starts here in the town of hempstead we are going to be a unified community unified both in our elected officials and our spiritual leaders saying we are not going to allow this to continue

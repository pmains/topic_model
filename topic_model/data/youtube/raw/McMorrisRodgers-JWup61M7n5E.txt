madam Speaker I rise today to reflect on the promise of America what is the promise of America what does it meant for us and what does it mean to us today America has been around for a few hundred years that's really not that long and in that short time our dreams have informed the imaginations of people around the globe it all started when our founding fathers drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence it set us on a path for our nation to be the greatest experiment in self governance that the world has ever known our founders were our first innovators who risked it all for America to be free sure there are times that we have fallen short but our experiment has been overwhelming for the good it's here in America that we've led and cultivated history's greatest breakthroughs we fought a war to end slavery we liberated Europe from the Nazis we invented flight put men on the moon split the atom invented the microchip the internet and more at great expense all of this was accomplished might by maintaining fleets and armies for America to be a beacon of hope for freedom loving people around the world we've done more to lift people out of poverty raise the standard of living than any nation in the history of the world madam Speaker I'm sure our founders never dreamed that any of this would be possible but it was because they made their vision for America a reality rooted in the promise that our rights are self-evident sacred and undeniable America was born with purpose it says it right here in the Declaration of Independence we all know the words or at least we should know the words we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are rights of life liberty and the of happiness these are more than just words it's a faith statement a distinctive national credo the moment we fail to believe it the experiment is over this nation will fade away like all nation states that have lost belief in themselves and forgotten their identity if we forget our purpose and let the promise of America be broken we are lost the future is lost it's our job our highest responsibility to transmit the promise of America to our children and to all who are a part of this great experiment it's not enough that we merely assert these as ideas we must live them as truths and show the world that they work America is where freedom has made its greatest mark it's where creativity is unmatched by any time in history it's where justice flowers more generously than any place on earth the torch must be passed to the next generation that is what John president John F Kennedy said and madam Speaker we must do just that so I will keep coming back to this floor to the people's house to make this case that the promise of America is for every person in our country there's a battle going on right now for the heart and soul of America so it's worth repeating that we must never forget our purpose that's what's that's what unites us as Americans and it's where I find hope that we can come together around shared values that built our great nation I'm committed more than ever to restore trust and confidence in the in the promise of America it's a promise that will keep us free empower our children in the next generation to shine and strengthen the moral fabric where our identity rest thank you and I yield back

I rise today to share the story of one of my friends Jesse Cline elder Jessie and her husband own and operate one of Reno's most successful businesses it's the under the Rose brewery they are also the proud parents of a beautiful baby boy Jessie her family and her business are doing great but when I met Jessie last year she told me that her path to this point in life had not been easy in 2012 Jessie left her job at a large firm and the health insurance it provided to pursue her dream of starting a brewery with her husband Scott about a year later she learned that she was pregnant during a routine check-up nine weeks before her due date Jessie's midwife advised her to see an ob/gyn Jessie though didn't feel sick so she hesitated but the Midwife urged her to go see a specialist anyway midway through her visit the OBGYN became concerned that Jessie's life was in danger he diagnosed her with preeclampsia and rushed her to the hospital Jessie's son was born a few hours later via emergency c-section the doctors who delivered her baby agreed that had Jessie waited even 24 hours to see an ob/gyn both she and her son would have died in no uncertain terms Jessie told me that she and her son Oh their lives to the Affordable Care Act without the affordable coverage purchased on the silver state exchange Jessie would not have been able to see a specialist and she and her husband certainly would not have been able to afford the million dollars in medical costs Jesse's son incurred over the course of a month-long stay in the NICU unit Jesse's son is now a happy thriving toddler but he has a medical issue that interferes with his growth Jessie and her husband Scott fear that president Trump's efforts to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions will make it impossible for them to afford their son's health insurance Donald Trump has not yet been able to get the support in Congress he needs to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions but he has taken steps to circumvent the will of Congress and hack away at these protections bit by bit in August he signed an executive order expanding access to what are called jump plans these are health insurance plans that don't cover essential services like pre-existing drugs emergency room visits or maternity care these plans are designed for short term use only and don't include protections for people with pre-existing conditions that means if you go to sign up for one of these plans and you are a cancer survivor or a pregnant woman or a war veteran you could be charged a higher rate it also means you could be forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for the care you receive in an emergency junk plans come in all shapes and sizes but none of them comply with consumer protections established by the Affordable Care Act the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at junk plans in 45 states and found that 43 percent did not include coverage for mental health services 71 percent did not cover outpatient prescription drugs and not a single one covered maternity care junk plans appeared cheaper than comprehensive health insurance plans that is until you read the fine print junk plans have low monthly premiums and astronomical out-of-pocket costs president Trump's executive order allows insurance companies to trick consumers into signing up for these plans consumers think they are getting a good deal only to find out as soon as they get sick that their medical bills are not covered the American Cancer Society Action Network says that junk plans pose a serious threat to cancer patients ability to access quality affordable health coverage they also said that the president administration's rule will likely leave older and sicker Americans in the individual insurance marketplace with few if any affordable health coverage choices and that patients living with serious conditions will be left paying more for the coverage they need if they can afford coverage at all president Trump's executive order to expand acts to junk plans is not just an attack on our healthcare system it's an attempt to send us back to the days when families like Jesse's couldn't afford the health care they need Jesse told me she owes her life to the health insurance she purchased through the ACA where would Jesse and her family be without it what if she had not been able to afford a comprehensive plan what if she had purchased a junk plan instead 1.2 million Nevadans lived with pre-existing conditions that's nearly one and two that number includes nearly one hundred and fifty nine thousand children and nearly two hundred and seventy thousand people nearing retirement the junk plans rule directly threatens their health care heather carbolic who's our executive director the Silver State health care exchange summed up - the risk that junk plans pose she said junk plans are designed to basically take your pre-existing condition and charge you more or tell you that you can't be on those plans at all she continued if they find that you've got disclosed to pre-existing medical condition then you're left high and dry with no insurance now I don't want to go back to a world where Nevadans with pre-existing conditions can't get the care they need or where insurance companies aren't required to cover basic services like maternity care I was a proud co-sponsor of senator Tammy Baldwin resolution to overturn president Trump's executive order in failing to pass this resolution the United States Senate has done a profound disservice to families and communities all across the country I will continue fighting to restore protections against junk plans and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same Thank You mr. president and I yield the floor

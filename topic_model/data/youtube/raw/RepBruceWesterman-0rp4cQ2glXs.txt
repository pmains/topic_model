house natural resources along with former acting chair of the white house council of economic advisers thomas phillips and we welcome both of you gentlemen to the show thanks for joining us uh first two congressman the president blames trump for inflation your reaction well inflation really hit its pace when joe biden became president it happened long before putin invaded ukraine so joe biden's been pointing fingers but he needs to realize there's three pointing back at him this is solely to blame on biden and his administration inflation with food and energy all the above he's the one that needs to be taking responsibility for that you know at its current pace to the congressman's point thomas inflation could exceed nine percent by the end of the year u.s inflation is higher than europe and inflation was trending at around 7.9 percent before putin invaded so the president's plan is to to battle inflation is increase government increase taxes increase regulation increase government spending when we need more workers more industry to clear out inflation ignited by the trillions of culver relief aid right so that means unleashing u.s energy unleashing u.s manufacturing yeah i think it was kind of interesting today when the cpi report on inflation came out because it was basically a direct shot at the president's speech yesterday which we he basically went through the two main causes according to him on inflation in the past was energy and pandemic uh you know bottlenecks and if you look at the this month's inflation report actually what happened is that energy prices took a huge dive and we didn't make much of a bom you know impact on overall inflation so essentially this is not about energy which has been saying and this is the first time now that the inflation data is showing that right out yeah thomas just mentioned the president he's uh making more gaps today the often wrong but never in doubt white house uh is the president is at it again you know he said his agriculture secretary congressman has forgotten about farming and watch the other gaffes like claiming spending by the government is not behind inflation watch this we're the only nation in the world the only nation in the world that has come out of every crisis stronger than we went in it every single time regardless of what it was no other nation has done that it's one of the reasons why in some places we're called the ugly americans we think we can do anything we travel the state tom has forgotten more about farming than most people ever learned i'm sure this this room knows as much but so then just to make sure like what he's saying is the pandemic is distinct from the spending in response to the pandemic and he does not believe the size of the spending matter with regard to inflation again uh no i agree with what chairman powell said last week that the number one threat is the strength in that strength that we built is inflation number two uh i think that um you know it's they're not focused there's all they're focused on understandably is the problem they're facing i think our policies help not hurt we control all three branches of the government well we don't really okay so those mixing those gaps was the point about government spending congressman you know saying government spending is not a problem is like dick cheney saying deficits don't matter that's like saying ketchup is a vegetable it's like the dumbest thing we've ever heard i mean let's show the money supply show the data coming in about government spending congressman we threw a trillions into a hot recovery after 22 million jobs were destroyed we didn't have the workers there to mop up inflation we didn't have the productivity to mop up inflation so you see the money supply and government spending walloping you know an economy that was trying to come out from shutdowns that's inflation yeah and that has driven process high and i think we've only seen the beginning of it i think the body administration was taking a playbook from fdr when they injected all the money into the economy when there were no jobs and when you needed government spending this administration has put money into a red-hot economy that's made labor supply short it's made all kinds of yeah but congressman republicans but republicans signed off on the government too you guys are signing off on 40 billion to ukraine you guys are also talking about more covet aid relief we found out we did the cares act we didn't do the second infusion of funds which happened right after biden came into office and i think that's really where the government spending should have stopped uh this is solely at biden's feet it's bad policies and we're paying the price for and we're going to see worse going forward because of the cost of of energy which leads into higher food cost what do you think thomas well i think i mean you talked about causes of inflation you also talked about how to fix it and he said basically the white house is the best has the best solutions to fixing inflation that's like an arsonist being asked to you know shut out a fire essentially his policies have sort of all guided us towards this space where it's a sort of triple threat to inflation he's he's pumping up demand which raises prices he's cutting down supply with racist prices and he's monetizing the debt raises prices it's pretty clear that this is the white house problem yeah and the the real astonishing thing congressman walgreens cvs other drug stores are talking about rationing baby formula there seems it looks like 40 percent of the supply is not in stock let's listen to senator john kennedy on what's going on watch this sometimes i think president biden just doesn't eat enough fiber he he said today for example as you pointed out that he bears no responsibility whatsoever for inflation i think most americans are thinking right and jimmy jimmy hoffa died of natural causes the truth is that the bible administration just keeps kicking its own ass the truth is the president biden won the nomination because he promised not to be bernie sanders who was he tried to emulate bernie sanders and the american people see this they see that after 14 months nothing is built nothing is back and nothing is better when will the white house take off the smothering pillow of hyper regulation from u.s manufacturing and u.s energy so i i don't know when they will take it off but they certainly laid it on thick about 200 billion dollars worth of regulations it factors into inflation directly and it's hard for anybody to say it better than senator kennedy does but you know we're talking about a president who tried to shift blame on republicans and saying we were pushing for a tax increase i think even the washington post gave him three pinocchios and was talking about a fourth one on that one so you can't really believe anything that's coming out of this white house they're playing the blame game and they try to shift their responsibility onto others congressman

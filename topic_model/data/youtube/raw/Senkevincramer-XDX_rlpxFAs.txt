thank you senator thank you both for being here and for your service um mr secretary last month your deputy said that the department as directed by president biden aims to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. then she said she mentioned the danger posed by china illegal russian aggression in europe persistent threats from iran north korea and other state actors you both and and others that work with and under you consistently and appropriately reference the importance of modernization uh lethality readiness obviously my question is do you think china russia iran or north korea are going to be slowed in their military development by climate change concerns i i don't believe so and i don't believe we will either senator do you know if they have plans to reach net zero any any of them uh senator i uh again uh i've asked you for uh 773 billion dollars to support the capabilities that we we think we need and i i certainly appreciate what you've done for us in the past but i think there's also things that we can and should be doing uh to uh to address the climate issue as well it affects our installations uh it causes uh problems uh uh that cause mass migration and other things in the areas that we operate in uh you know our forces are committed to fighting wildfires and and uh and helping in the aftermath of uh severe storms on an increasing basis so i don't think this is a thing that we can discount and i think that the the defense department has to do its part i appreciate that and i frankly i hope that we can give you a lot more than you've asked for actually to do those things mr secretary but as you as you're talking i'm imagining um the calculation the calculation that would it would measure the negative impact of of say our failure to deter russian invasion of ukraine in other words i appreciate that you have this concern but i also hope we can keep the main thing the main thing because just like more energy development in the united states and providing that energy to our allies actually brings down greenhouse gas emissions i think deterring the same polluters that have benefited from a lower standard than ours would also do the same and so we want to make sure you have the resources to do exactly what you need to do to get to accomplish all those good goals um i i general millie maybe i could just ask you if i notice you you didn't don't mention it much in fact you didn't at all the the secretary mentioned climate change five times and has written opening comments it's referenced in the national defense strategy sort of highlighted um we'll see if it's if it's in the national military strategy when you provide that but do you think climate change is a military objective the department should be focused on tackling it's a it's a departmental objective for the for the military though for the uniformed military uh it is a condition under which we will operate and it's something that we have to take into consideration in the conduct of our operations for sure because uh you know if you look at lake chad as just one example you look at a picture in 1950 and look at lake chad and look at it today well the reason that there's a lot of instability in that particular region is because there's no water there's a lot of resource struggles going on so climate change has an impact on military operations to be sure and it's going to be a predictor for where likely instability will occur in the future so it's a condition under which we operate as opposed to a something that we can fix thank you mr secretary i want to talk a little bit about um the fear of escalation that's uh that we hear that a lot it seems that um that many times the fear of escalating the situation in russia depends on us and a lot less on vladimir putin and i just think we've we've made too many my personal views we've made too many decisions based on how we think vladimir putin would respond uh to the situation things like limiting the kind of help we would we would provide ukraine how quickly we'd provide that help uh postponing and then canceling a minuteman test uh that was scheduled minimum three tests and not facilitating the transfer of migs just a few of the examples do you have any evidence that vladimir putin has ever worried that his massacre of women and children civilians would be escalatory i you know i i don't know what uh what's in the mind of uh vladimir putin and a lot of a lot of other people don't either senator i would you use the word fear uh and and putin in the same uh in the same sentence and i just want to point out that it's my job one of my key responsibilities to manage escalation uh and make sure that uh that we don't find ourselves uh in a uh in a nuclear contest uh if if that's avoidable uh and uh and again there's there's nothing about mr putin that we fear uh you and you see the evidence of the kinds of things that we've done and rapidly deploying combat power to europe and the eastern flank and what we have done and continue to do to provide assistance to ukraine and uh you know not a military issue but uh the sanctions that we've imposed on mr putin uh are gonna have a significant impact on his economy for for years to come

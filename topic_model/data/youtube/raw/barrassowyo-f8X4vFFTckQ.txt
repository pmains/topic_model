all right president biden continues to claim the country is in a climate emergency he hasn't declared an emergency yet but he thinks we're in one the gentleman on the right-hand side of the screen is senator barrasso republican from wyoming mr senator do you agree with the president we're in a climate emergency no stuart the president is completely out of touch with the needs of the american people we have a lot of emergencies and crises in this country climate's not one of them we have we have a crisis of energy of inflation a crisis at the border a crisis a crime in the cities and the white house has their own crisis of competence and credibility but two-thirds of the american people say that the president is focusing on the wrong things and exhibit a is the new york times that said only one percent of americans only one percent steward think that climate is the primary concern for them only three percent of democrats people know what they're concerned about and it's inflation it's being able to afford to fill a tank of gas or to fill or to buy a full week worth of groceries or now here we are at the end of the month it's making sure they have money left over for bills the president is focusing on the wrong thing stuart well the administration just announced that they're going to sell an additional 20 million barrels of oil taking it out of the strategic petroleum reserve how much relief will that give to drivers at the pump well very little stuart look i just saw your excellent report with hillary a few minutes ago what we have is a president who doesn't have the right solutions for the problems facing america today they're taking a million barrels a day out of the strategic reserve we are now down to the lowest level of amounts of this is an emergency supply the lowest amount amounts in 40 years what do we do if there's actually a true emergency in this country and what did we find out recently that a million barrels went to china stuart we are producing a million barrels of oil less a day now than we were right before the pandemic we need to get that energy out of the ground we need to get it out of wyoming we need to get it offshore public lands alaska we need to producing american energy not draining the strategic reserve mr senator wyoming is an energy state could you produce more oil tomorrow morning if the president would let you is there something you could do to produce more oil from wyoming tomorrow morning abs absolutely this this is a stretch this is a decision by the administration to keep the energy in the ground you need the permits to build you need they need to be holding lease sales they need to be approving the permits to build the infrastructure we have it here in america this administration is sent a hell bent on these on cow towing to the climate extremists and it's to the detriment of the american people joe biden seems to like high energy costs because it's going to force people in his mind to buy electric vehicles look stuart we're facing two-thirds of the country is facing energy shortages to the point of of blackouts this summer gas is still two dollars a gallon higher than it was the day biden took office and now they're telling people with electric vehicles don't plug in this summer for a number of hours a day because it's going to cause further blackouts and conditions of lack of energy we have an energy crisis in this country we don't have a climate crisis i i'm sure you saw this poll we reported it yesterday it's a new poll and it shows that the top five most populous senators well they're all republicans and you sir are number one you've got 70 percent approval in the great state of wyoming why is that mr senator why are you so good i am very blessed to represent the people of wyoming steward i saw that cynthia lummus the other senator from wyoming is is right up there we go home every weekend we travel our state we listen to people it's a small state people get to know their senators it's a politics in wyoming is very personal face-to-face town to town and uh both cynthia lummus and i do that every weekend you are the inverse relationship to the president who has a 70 disapproval rate and you've got a 70 approval rate that's a nice place to be mr santa thanks very much for being on our program wyoming is a nice place to be stuart thanks so very much i have been there once or twice and i'll get back there soon bring the grandkids i saw you had the grandkids there today bring them to wyoming that's an invitation for my grandchildren to go to wyoming okay i am glad you saw them they might just be there senator john barrasso thank you sir we'll see you again soon thanks all right thanks stuart

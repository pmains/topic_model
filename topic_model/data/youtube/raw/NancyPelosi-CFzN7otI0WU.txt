fit directly from those subsidies and many more will feel the squeeze a point hammered home by Nevada's Republican governor it's going to hurt kids it's going to hurt families it's gonna hurt individuals it's going to hurt people with mental health issues it's going to hurt veterans it's going to hurt everybody after his one-two punch the president invited Democrats to fix what he's breaking the Kratt should come to me I would even go to them because I'm only interested in one thing getting great health care for this country and we're joined now by the top Democrat in the House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi thanks for joining us again Ronnie this morning you just heard the president right there he wants to sit down and talk will you I think it's a little far down the road for that but before we go into him and that this Sunday morning we have to be very prayerful for what's happening in California on top of Puerto Rico Texas Harvey Oswald where's the wildfires in California hurricanes throughout our country that violence and matter people are hurting we have to be very prayerful about that and at this time you're suggesting that we sit down with the president president says repeal and replace where's the replace we haven't seen anything I don't think I think that this week the week of Friday 13th is the week that President Trump went rogue he went rogue on women's health in particular Affordable Care Act the Iran disk decision that he made ish as he continues his war on the middle class with his unfair tax plan so through so many things that are not based on evidence and that's problematic administration whatever knew about it well I tried to suggest to him that while we understand our differences we can find our common ground if we have evidence-based decisions you have governors Hickenlooper and Kasich or Republican and the Democrats saying that this is wholesale chaos that he's inflicting on the system you see what the governor of Nevada a Republican signed of all has said about what it will do he the president doesn't know or he doesn't care and so what we'd like him to do is face facts as I say they're doesn't know or it doesn't because payments are gonna stop next week now that the president's taking this action so what do you do how do you get them back will you and those payments to keep the government open in December for example well we are not about closing down government the Republicans have the majority they have the signature of the president it's up to them to keep government open we don't go down that path what I will say this that the Republicans in Congress have to be responsible right now we're fighting them to get children's health insurance the chip program of reauthorized and fund it to go forward they're holding that up all of this to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country a war on the middle class it is very very sad so in terms of the health care we're saying let's follow what senator Murray and Senator Alexander are doing the Alexander Murray whatever we're hunting but then in the Senate they're trying to find common ground and that should be encouraged and that's one of the white house is saying make Mulvaney two out of the office management budget is saying the president doesn't support that on its own he's going to want some of his priorities in return well what are his priorities building a wall for example you keep dealing Obama care please well he wants to negotiate the health care bill by repealing the Affordable Care Act and building won't know what I think that in other words some of the things he did the other day like saying you can buy insurance across state line that's already in the Affordable Care Act you know so I'm just saying what are what are his priorities except the priority for many of them is there should be no government role they never really the Republicans never really supported Medicare when it came into being they now say it should wither on the vine this is being a better public rule associated with public with the good health of the American people and and and what they're doing with their tax plan and with their health bill will hurt but in the absence of action by Congress isn't the president getting what he wants and repealing by Obamacare step by step by step well is it what he's doing hurting the American people isn't about Palace the politics about the American people and if he if he is if he wanted to do that why would he hurt people and say now that I've taken the American people hostage let's talk we have a path in the Senate Democrat at least I wonder if he even knows what that path is because from what he says it doesn't sound like he has knowledge knows the facts bases his decision on evidence and and that's a problem you say you don't want to shut down the government but the White House has made it pretty clear if the president doesn't get his priorities like the wall with the government funding bill in December that he is not that they are not going to have the votes to keep the government open well why are you putting that on us they have the majority in the House and the Senate and the president's signature they have the power to keep government open and if they don't if they can't get there on their own what price will the Democrats demand for their votes well it's a it's a negotiation it's not a price you demand certainly we intend by the end of the year to have the DREAM Act passed to protect young people that President says and I take him in good faith if you told us he cares about the young people I think he cares about them because the American people care about them and he's going to hear from the American people on the health care bill as well but we're moving from one thing to the next because that's the chaos that is exist in the White House right now and I just maybe he's being ill-advised I don't know but I do know that when he speaks he does not speak from the basis of knowledge that's why it's so hard to deal with him I said to have said to him when we've had our differences with Republicans across the aisle or down Pennsylvania Avenue we've always been able at least to go forward based data evidence facts a bottom line in terms of a number that to say unless I get a wall I'm going to shut that government down is totally irresponsible for President of the United States and it's part of this war on the middle class because he wants again a tax bill that is unfair to them if he doesn't get that repeal the Affordable Care Act if he doesn't get that let me ask you another question about your own leadership one of your fellow members of Congress Linda Sanchez fellow Democrat came out this week saying it's time for change at the top our leadership does a tremendous job but I do think we have this real breadth and depth of talent within our caucus and I do think it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders how do you respond to that well I I think we do have a great array of talent and I have promoted it all along the way I think when you see some of the people who represent the House Democrats like Adam Schiff and the rest people I have promoted and in the party getting them ready it's up to the caucus to select its next leadership's I enjoy the support of my column you're not going anywhere well I I'm here what the Affordable Care Act as you know is very important to me and I when the president became president I saw the threat to it I said I've got a study to take care of the Affordable Care Act and that's my fight that's my mission but also to have women and women at the table at the leadership table I'm here to fight for our our better deal better jobs that are pay better future for the American people I think that the biggest evidence for lack of experience in a job is the President of the United States so I fully intend to make on the basis of my knowledge my legislative I think I'm a great legislator I know the budget and I don't I don't believe that I have self promotion is a terrible thing but clearly somebody has so beautiful Oh see thanks for your time this morning thank you my pleasure let's go on to the Republican side now GOP senator Susan Collins joins us now from Bangor Maine senator Collins thank you for joining this morning you also announced this week that you're sticking around you're going to stay in the Senate rather than run for governor and one of the reasons you said is that you

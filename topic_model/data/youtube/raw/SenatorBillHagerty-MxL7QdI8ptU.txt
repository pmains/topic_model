joining me right now is tennessee senator and senate foreign relations and appropriations committee member bill hagerty senator it's great to see you this morning thanks very much for joining us do you know the answer to this is it four hundred thousand dollars per family or four hundred thousand dollars per individual who's going to see their taxes go higher whichever the number is maria there's no way this is the cut off he's imposing the biggest tax increase in history certainly in my lifetime and to think that that's going to do anything to accelerate the economy is folly he should look at what we do in states like mine right in tennessee how do we grow our economy we lower taxes we have no income tax now we deregulate we keep us you know a solid and secure border at the southern border and we really do our best to create the business environment that creates job growth not crushing regulations that he's talking about so so what's the difference here i mean why does he see it so differently i mean he's got wide open borders we're here we witnessed it firsthand yesterday and the day before i'm gonna witness it firsthand again in about an hour when i go out uh with the unions i mean how does he see things differently in terms of tax movements and and and border uh policy why it's it as steve said just before this is a socialist wish list he's punishing corporations he's punishing job creators and by opening the borders and i appreciate your being there and bringing attention to this maria because this is the crisis that he tried to avoid talking about last night at the state of the union he listed a litany of crises and didn't get to the border till the very end but what he's look what he's doing i think is flooding the border creating massive you know massive disarray to our economy putting pressure on the lowest end of our workforce and he's turning every town into a border town because as he implements this turnstile at our southern border they're pushing these people into the interior of our nation as rapidly as they can it's a true crisis and i'm so glad i appreciate that thank you um let me ask you about appropriating this money you you're on appropriations and i want to understand what the priorities are because we've got all of the spending more than five trillion dollars and yet there's no increase in defense spending the threats are rising around us china iran not to mention what's happening at the border and the national security issues we are jack keane has been on this program a hundred times and he says we're out gunned when it comes to china so what can you tell us about defense spending and president biden's priorities well first mariah say jack keane is a great american i'm pleased to call him a friend and as you know my previous job was serving as u.s ambassador to japan very tough neighborhood there and i've seen firsthand china's aggression they're building their military at a very rapid pace we have more military stationed in japan more us military station in japan than any place else in the world for a very good reason the last thing we need to be doing right now is building down our military we have china's aggression moving forward the world needs a strong america and i don't understand why the biden administration thinks that the opposite should be true look at them cow towering to iran they're doing everything they possibly can to weaken us to dealing with with com you know countries like iran that certainly don't have our best interests at heart we need to stand strong right now now more than ever well how are you going to stand tall against this radical agenda i mean i spoke with former president trump in the last hour and here's his commentary about the biden administration's tax proposals watch this the taxes it'll be the largest tax increase in the history of our country and when you say it won't affect middle class middle class has 401ks and when you look at the capital gains tax that's going to have a massive impact on the middle class when you talk capital gains you're talking about everybody you're not talking about just for so-called wealthy people you're talking about everybody if they buy a stock no matter what they do you're talking about everybody is going to be affected by that but they're going to be affected in an even more important way companies are going to leave this country so we just got a gdp of 6.4 percent for the first read on the first quarter senator uh is this going to put a damper on an economy that's coming back well it was interesting last night maria we heard president biden come on and open the whole speech last night with all of the successes what he described was the greatest economic comeback that any nation is seeing right now what he did was take credit for it rather than give credit to operation warp speed that president trump put in place that's plagiarism something we've seen before from this president what we're doing right now though is talking about the biggest tax increase certainly in our lifetimes maria that's going to have a major dampening effect and what he's going to do is turn down take away the great blue-collar comeback that president trump put in place and what he talked about last night it wasn't a blue-collar you know blueprint this is a blue collar job skiller that he's talking about with these tax increases what what about big tech you're looking to take on the censorship that we've seen putting forward the 21st century free speech act that would abolish section 230 and prohibit censoring by technology giants this week you wrote an op-ed in the wall street journal titled it goodbye section 230 hello liberty what are you trying to accomplish there i spoke with president trump about section 230 as well let's hear what he said and then i want you to walk us through this uh act you know when they say that these are private companies that can do what they want well they are private companies but once they're given this tremendous immunity of section 230 they're no longer private companies as far as i'm concerned because they're given a gift that no other type company has in this country in this world probably no other country has section 230 section 230 takes all their liability away senator well it's interesting i appreciate the fact that president trump is describing this if i think back to his election in 2020 president trump didn't have to just be joe biden he had to beat the media and he had to beat big tech big tech has really gone out of control in this section 230 protection what i'm proposing is eliminating section 230 we're going to do away with section 230. we're going to treat these large public utilities is what i would call these large private companies have become essentially the modern day public square but what they're doing is they're censoring language there if we treat them like common carriers which is what i'm proposing then they're going to have to be open to all comers in a non-discriminatory fashion we're going to eliminate their ability to use political bias to censor americans well will you be able to get your colleagues on the left to go along with this will you be able to actually push this through the finish line maria i've heard a lot of conversation from the democrats side they're concerned about big tech too as the president said they've really run out of control and when political speech is censored when you have situations where you know major mainstream political actors like the president of the united states can be censored here in america yet ayatollah khamenei can talk about eliminating israel and even talk about how to do that on big tech platforms there's something very wrong there when they can suppress a new york post story about hunter biden something's very very wrong yeah it's quite extraordinary actually senator it's great to get your insights this morning thank you sir we'll keep watching your efforts

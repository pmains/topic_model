i need to get to democratic congresswoman from california karen bass here congresswoman bass of course one of the lawmakers that led the passage of the george floyd and policing act in the house she is also the former chair of the congressional black caucus congresswoman uh thanks for your time this afternoon or this morning i guess there where you are uh just just first of all your general reaction to the opening statements from the prosecution from the defense um what do you make of it so far congresswoman well frankly you know the opening statements especially from the prosecution it was just difficult to hear and it was very difficult to see that tape again and frankly i saw parts of the tape that i don't remember seeing before and to see his knee on his neck long after he was conscious and he just kept it there it just seemed so cruel and to me it's just very hard for me to see that and not believe that he was really just punishing george floyd and then when i heard the defense talk about george floyd's you know perhaps being intoxicated and all of that it just seems like such an incredible stretch not understanding what one thing had to do with the other and i really appreciate it as a person with a medical background really appreciated the prosecution saying that every person that is dead has died of a cardiac pulmonary arrest that people needed to understand exactly what that meant and when the defense tried to um say well because he didn't have certain aspects in terms of the um the scarring on his neck or also the petiki eye in his eyes that is consistent with the strangulation that that meant that he didn't die of that was just absolutely ludicrous so this is going to be a very painful couple of weeks as we go through this and it's painful listening to the defense because i just feel like their arguments out of the box are just so absurd congresswoman to your point about the video uh there were parts that i i don't think i had seen before but also i found it striking to hear the running commentary from the bystanders from the folks who when you could who had gathered there to watch this that was not something i recall hearing as well um i know you spent some time with the family over the past year um i've spent some time with the family as well and every time i talk to them they talk about the george floyd justice and policing act uh and this perhaps being the greatest legacy potentially for george floyd pass the house prospects in the upper chamber congresswoman bass well i do think that the prospects are strong and i will tell you that although there is no formal negotiation going on conversations bipartisan are absolutely continuing and so i hold out hope that we will be able to do it and i just want you to know that personally i feel the pressure of everything that is happening with that this trial on my shoulders because we have got to deliver for the american people there has got to be hope that we can actually transform policing and if there was ever a case that you can just not argue it is this one this trial has got to come out the right way and we have to deliver i believe that we will get a bill on the president's desk i know the white house and the president absolutely wants us to move forward move forward and we have to deliver congresswoman in most as you know in most significant pieces of legislation there's typically there's that one sticking point uh that keeps it and well and oftentimes there are multiple sticking points but in this particular piece of legislation is there one sticking point that seems to be um greater than the others that's holding it back yes there's two sticking points qualified immunity and then section 242 which is reducing the standard for prosecuting an officer and so with this case for example you know should you argue what derek chavin was thinking in terms of did he willfully mean to kill george floyd or frankly anybody with any kind of common sense knows that if you put your knee on somebody's neck that it could result in death and that is reckless and so what we want to do is reduce the standard i want to argue what he was thinking i want to say that what he did was reckless george floyd died and he should be prosecuted so holding officers accountable qualified immunity means the ability to sue the officer and holding the officer personally liable and and the section 242 i think those are that those have from the very beginning been the two sticking points but there has to be a way to show that we can hold officers accountable otherwise how do you stop this from occurring congresswoman bass we always appreciate your time and your perspective i know you've got to run but do keep us posted please ma'am if you will on the legislation we want to continue to follow that part of the story very closely long after that this trial is over congresswoman karen best there from california

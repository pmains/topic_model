as america's youngest attorney general the his wife is jennifer miskowitz a grateful polish american heritage allen's going to read a letter from retired army general mick zais who is the former president of newberry college and elected statewide as superintendent of education being the first elected the statewide office in south carolina due to prior commitments mick cannot join us so alan will read a letter now from xace actually kelly was 11 years ago yeah it feels like 20 years ago some days but it is great to be all of you i want to thank our congressman who happens to also be my father joe wilson for inviting me here today as a member of the united states military obviously i understand firsthand the geopolitical implications i understand the international security issues involved as well as the national security issues involved with the aggression that we're seeing on the borders of russia and the ukraine and that's why i'm incredibly excited today to stand up here a bipartisan way to show south carolina's support of ukraine it may not seem like much of a gesture to be here today on the steps with these folks up here on on the steps of the state house but a pebble thrown into a lake will ripple out and in this symbolic gesture we'll have ripples that reverberate across the state and to send a message that we as one people will stand with those who seem like so far away ukraine doesn't seem like would have any bearing on what happens here in south carolina but i can tell you right now if you appease aggression in eastern europe it will find its way to your doorstep and you don't have to go too far back in history to understand that concept i was asked today to come in and read as kelly mentioned a letter uh as he said general former superintendent mick says could not be here due to a prior planned trip to london but i'm going to read this letter on behalf of general's ace in the late 1890s my grandparents arrived in america as children their parents having fled eastern europe in the face of pogroms raging against the jews at that time almost all of eastern europe was part of what was then known as the russian empire since then wars famines and other conflagrations have swept across the region consuming the lives of scores of millions creating and eliminating nations and redrawing the borders of countries such as prussia germany poland russia belarus and the ukraine some have to describe war as diplomacy by other means others would characterize it as a harsh demonstration of the limits of diplomacy whatever your definition war is always an abomination and peace only exists until both sides agree to it it is tragic that yet again the ukrainian people are facing naked aggression against their sovereign lands such a confrontation benefits no one except perhaps a small click of the ruling oligarchs of russia in the face of this crisis i am proud to stand with congressman joe wilson and other representatives and other public servants and citizens who are here today to demonstrate their support for and solidarity with the ukrainian people thank you thank you attorney general alan wilson now we're going to welcome a former uh democrat exumi former democratic member of the state house let's get that up here and also a democratic governor candidate former veteran from afghanistan who's here to read a letter from representative beth bernstein this is james smith thank you kelly i am pleased to be here on behalf of my uh dear friend and former colleague representative beth bernstein she regrets that she cannot be here she had a loss in her family but she wanted us all to know that she is here in spirit with us and in talking with her i've put together some remarks to share with you all i also want to thank congressman wilson for his leadership in bringing us all together today uh for this important gathering but we are we are not here as republicans and democrats but as south carolinians and as americans standing united in support of ukraine of the ukrainian people because it is putin's actions that have threatened the long-standing peace and unprecedented prosperity in eastern europe our president joe biden has made it clear the principles of our nation's support for ukraine they are who we are and they have what we've always stood for that we are united in supporting ukraine's independence sovereignty and territorial integrity we are united in supporting ukraine's right of self-determination to include the right as an independent nation to enter treaties and agreements with other nations of its choosing we as a free nation are committed to strengthening our relationship with ukraine and support of a prosperous future for all and to quote our secretary of state tony blinken we are resolute that a democratic prosperous and secure ukraine is in the interest not only of the people of ukraine but also of the united states and the international community so no matter what we hear from the kremlin no matter the words that come from putin's mouth the fact is this nato is a defensive alliance there is no risk that a nato country would threaten the territorial integrity of russia and no matter what we see in here over the next hours and days let there be no mistake that it is putin and putin alone who will be wholly responsible for the bloodshed and violence that will fall on both ethnic russians and ukrainian lives should he invade ukraine thank you thank you james all right now congressman joe wilson is the ranking member of the organization for cooperation in europe the helsinki commission member of the foreign affairs committee and armed services committee 31-year army national guard veteran judge advocate congressman joe wilson thank you kelly and ladies and gentlemen thank you for being here today i want to thank all the participants every single person i contacted when i told them that we would be standing with solidarity with ukraine everybody immediately said let's participate let's show our support of ukraine and uh let's do all that we can to deter an invasion by russia or by putin it's really appropriate that i'm here in that when i had the opportunity to serve in the state senate i hired the first russian page to serve in the state senate uh he was from saint petersburg i had the opportunity to visit with his family and so i had such high hopes that the united states and russia would work together on behalf of the world the stability for economic progress for the jobs worldwide additionally i had the opportunity with mayor bob coble who will be speaking at a moment he and i went to moscow we went to chelyabinsk which is the sister city of colombia i actually had the opportunity to visit novas of beers where we were welcomed with a sign in english it said welcome to nova scotia the chicago of siberia and so sadly russia has evolved due to the authoritarian rule of vladimir putin he has with his oligarchs have really abused the people of russia and now he is attempting to take over ukraine and i was prevented or presented to you an op-ed that i had printed in the washington times two weeks ago and it's sadly very clear that this affects american families because the whole intent of what mr putin is doing is to take over the supplies of oil to the 44 million people of ukraine and then to proceed to take over and control the oil to germany through north stream too and so i am just grateful that indeed it's bipartisan i want to quote from tuesday president biden he said to the citizens of russia you are not our enemy i do not believe that a you want a bloody destructive war against ukraine a country and a people with whom you share such deep ties of family history and culture president biden also continued and again this is the ultimate bipartisan and because of this more than just russia and ukraine it's about standing for what we believe in for the future that we want for our world for liberty for liberty the right of councilors countries to choose their own destiny to the right of the people to determine their own futures for the that principle can't change a country's neighbor's borders by force and finally when it comes to north stream 2 the president's made it clear that if there is an invasion north stream two will not be completed and uh we will uh maintain the independence that we have for our very dear and uh significant allies throughout uh europe and nato and around the world and so i'm just grateful to be here today and uh for everybody working together and i'm just hopeful we can send a message uh to vladimir putin that the people of the united states uh he has done something really uninverting i mentioned this at an organization security corporation europe he has done something that is really good he has united republicans and democrats to stand firm against aggression and then i'm really grateful this week uh the german chancellor oliver schultz was in uh keem on monday and he was in moscow on tuesday and so there's been an effort to try to divide germany from nato from the united states uh from osae it's not being successful mr putin is actually united the world on behalf of ending aggression anywhere in the world thank you and god bless you and happy everybody's here and if there are any questions i i will do that after we hear very wonderful comments from mayor bob coble all right thank you congressman and as he alluded the former mayor of colombia is with us he led the city delegation to moscow and he's warned me to not attempt this word but i will give it a shot celebinsk to enter a sister city relationship to promote warm relations with the people of russia and america this is the former mayor of columbia bob coleman thank you kelly you did a great job with that pronunciation general congressman representative smith and others let me say in the late 1990s we took a trip to chelebots russia our sister city at the time of course prior to that we went to plovdiff bulgaria and collusion to poco romania then state senator joe wilson and his son wonderful son ad who i know is still in the navy and a physician we're on that delegation uh many of the issues then are the same issues now this was the end of the yeltsin era before putin got there uh they had uh for bulgaria and romania they wanted to be in nato and dead in 2004. uh you could tell the quest for freedom was very strong there and the friendship with the russian people in chelebens was also very obvious and a lot of economic ties we are saddened i know the congressman is and i know i certainly am to see where we've come from there and what has happened to russia and our relationship we think uh for a number of things partnership and hope was what we felt then and it just has not worked out and it's because of putin um today i'm the chair of the columbia world affairs council on this tuesday uh the palmetto forum will be understanding the russian ukraine crisis in addition to the obvious moral and security issues that are at stake with this crisis there's also one of economics being part of the global economy is very important to south carolina and this crisis manufactured entirely by putin threatens that economy for not only south carolina but the world and that's a shame and we need to stand united and in today's world you don't see many bipartisan democrat republican press conferences but this is one that's important it's important to all of us and we need to keep that going and work hard for it thank you so very much you sir and uh thank you to congressman wilson for organizing this thank you to all of our great speakers for coming out if any members of the press or anybody else has questions they're going to join you out in front here in just a moment but again thank you for joining us today and may god bless the united states and of course the ukraine as well

there is a lot going on in Washington right now and we have more on the firing hearing for Donald Trump's acting Attorney General taking questions from Democrats in Congress for the first time and congresswoman Karen bass was one of them she serves on the Judiciary Committee and she was all over the hearing thank you for being here you questioned Whitaker on his role regarding ethics complaints that were filed for a conservative group let's look at that sure we did file if his complaints against members of both parties you file the ethics complaints against Republicans can you tell me which Republicans you filed ethics complaints against all of again you know I'm here for an oversight hearing yes you are and so my questions are leading to that so can you answer that fact file all of its complaints on its website and I would rephrase it I don't have time to look into the website I'm asking you a question now you were the executive director that was one of the tense moments the congresswoman as I mentioned is here along with Neal Koch all as well what were you driving at in that exchange so what my concern was he's the executive director of this organization right before he joined the DOJ and he had a long list of Democrats that he had investigated including one of the members of the Judiciary Committee representative Hank Johnson and so how could he be objective in investigating Democrats I don't believe they investigated any Republicans otherwise he would have been able to have named some he goes into the Justice Department and so did he initiate investigations against these same Democrats while he's in the Justice Department I think the overall thing with him is that we don't really view him as a legitimate person to take that role we've youÂ´d him as essentially the overseer of Jeff Sessions as opposed to being his chief of staff he was a hack who was working on behalf of the President watching over Jeff Sessions and when Jeff session leaves he takes the position like one of my other colleagues pointed out what were his qualifications to even be in that job in the first place and that's a theme that's come up from people even people who have a deference to the idea that the president can pick who he wants for a range of posts let me play for you another point that you and your colleagues were pressing which was whether he was hiding conversations with Donald Trump about these open probes in New York which are back in the news and in a big way tonight take a look right I want to know whether you talked to President Trump at all about the Southern District of New York's case involving Michael Cohen congresswoman as I've mentioned several times today I am NOT gonna discuss my private conversations with the president United States what are we to take from that in your view well his overall strategy throughout the whole hearing was to run out the clock which is why he had to preface every answer with a long explanation he couldn't answer yes or no so to me that was the same thing he was avoiding answering anything which is pretty much the way he handled himself throughout the whole hearing he was incredibly arrogant and disrespectful especially to the chair of the committee I noticed that too and look I worked as an aide in the in the Senate and there's plenty of brawling that goes on raiven by the death standard I have to tell you just my observation which he was he was remarkably rude he was at times just a jerk to to the people asking fairly straightforward questions I suppose we should note that rather than just ignore it although it sounds itself a little mean to observe stay with me I want to bring in a neocon troll who you know served at high levels in the Justice Department and play for you another exchange about pardons that's especially relevant given what Muller folks just told a court about manna for take a look have there been any discussions at the department about pardons congressman as I've been into acting Attorney General I have not been involved in any discussions of any pardons did you ever create direct the creation of C or become aware of the existence of any documents relating to pardons of any individual I am aware of documents relating to pardons of individuals yes one of those moments where a good question forces him under oath to actually figure out if he is this comes as we're learning a story that any other night might be the top story in the country the president's former campaign chair who was busted for breaking his plea agreement is now in court facing allegations from Muller that he was lying to them in the hopes of a recent attempt at apartment exactly so yesterday night we learned about this those sealed transcript was was released in redacted form and this is of the the man of Paul Manafort who's the campaign manager for Trump his plea deal and whether or not he complied with it or not and in there at page 84 there's a remarkable thing I don't think we've ever seen anything like this a Muller prosecutor is saying one of the reasons man afford may have lied was in order to help his bid for a pardon with President Trump now up until this point there's been a lot of speculation that the president and his lawyers have been dangling pardons in exchange for more favorable witness testimony and the like John Dowd his attorney was accused of that with Michael Flynn and with Paul Manafort a year and a half ago but here now we actually have a molar prosecutor saying look this might have happened in some way shape or form now it's redacted we don't know everything but boy that is a big big deal you put it so clearly a congresswoman I'm over on time I want to give you the benefit of responding to that that there is a wide broad pardon power but if it were being offered in exchange for a potential federal crime according to Muller's folks with that in your view be an abuse of power absolutely and I don't have any doubt that that's exactly what happened now I don't have the proof but do I have Dallas I don't hmm congressman bass who was all over the hearing there thank you for sharing with us your views

Thank You mr. chairman Madam Secretary welcome thank along with my main colleague senator King and represented poliquin I recently wrote to you about the unfair subsidies provided by the provincial Canadian government of Navy Nova Scotia to a paper producer in Port Hawkesbury I very much appreciated you're very prompt response our highly-skilled Paperworkers main can compete successfully whenever there's a level playing field but they cannot compete when a foreign government is providing more than a hundred million dollars of subsidies to a mill that is manufacturing the same kind of product I understand that the Coalition for fair paper imports which includes Madison paper industries which employs 2240 workers in my state will soon file a petition for countervailing duties covering the imports of super calendared paper from Canada in response to the more than 125 million dollars in subsidies already provided by Nova Scotia can you update me on what the next steps would be in dealing with these unfair subsidies once the petition is filed which will happen shortly senator Collins first as you know we take enforcement and compliance very seriously at our department this is something ensuring a level playing field is one of our number-one priorities at the international trade administration and enforcing trade remedy laws is something that is a is very very important to me personally we will keep you informed as we can there are rules about what we can say at different points during the process but as appropriate absolutely we would be happy to keep you informed thank you very much

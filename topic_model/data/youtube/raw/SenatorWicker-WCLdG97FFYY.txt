the Armed Services Subcommittee hearing on seapower will come to order we convened this afternoon to receive testimony on achieving the 355 ship Navy and we received testimony today from former Reagan administration officials we welcome our three distinguished witnesses the Honorable John F laman jr. former Secretary of the Navy the Honorable Everett Pyatt former assistant secretary of the Navy for shipbuilding and logistics and the Honorable William Jay Schneider jr. former associate director for national security and international affairs at the Office of Management and Budget welcome gentlemen our subcommittee is grateful for your decades of service and willingness to appear before us your experience and counsel will be invaluable as we consider options for increasing the size of our Navy and protecting our nation's security today's hearing represents another step in this subcommittee's effort to examine the Navy's 355 ship requirement we have received a classified briefing on the basis for the requirement we've heard from shipbuilders and suppliers held a shipbuilding hearing with Navy officials and will meet with naval analysts next week our actions this year will set a firm foundation for an intelligent and responsible expansion of the fleet in the future to that end I would note that all members of this subcommittee have co-sponsored the ship's act legislation which would codify the Navy's requirement for 355 ships as US policy the full committee has adopted the ship's act into the FY 18 in DAA and our House counterparts have done the same the seapower title also authorizes additional funding for five ships above the administration's budget request while maintaining effective cost control measures on existing programs the navy's 355 ship requirement has received plenty of attention on Capitol Hill and in the press it is important to put the desire to grow the fleet into proper hist Oracle context the United States has embarked on naval buildups roughly every 30 years over the past century in the 1910s then in the 40s and 50s and most recently in the 1980s in response to emerging threats technological development and the condition of the fleet this is now our time to lead our task is to increase the fleet size from 276 ships today to 355 ships as soon as practicable an increase of seventy-nine ships in comparison during the 1980s build up the Navy added 75 ships to the fleet in eight years from FY 1981 to FY 1988 according to the Congressional Research Service I would stress that the need that we need the optimal mix of ships tomorrow's Navy should not replicate the one we had in the past or the one we have today in other words this subcommittee has no intention of funding shipbuilding only for the sake of shipbuilding our witnesses took the 1980s build up from a vision to reality and proved many naysayers wrong along the way the 1980s build up was based on a comprehensive naval strategy thorough analysis and sound acquisition practices our witnesses thought outside the box thank you for example they supported outfitting our ships with cutting-edge technology but also brought battleships out of mothballs perhaps most important once the Navy established the famous 600 ship requirement the senior leadership uniformed and civilian rallied around it subcommittee is interested in lessons learned and insights for how best to proceed with the task at hand today specifically I hope our witnesses will discuss the importance of strategy for embarking on a buildup and the necessity of getting buy-in from the White House Secretary of Defense the congressional defense committees and Industry clear lines of authority and accountability for executing the shipbuilding program fixed price contracts and competition delivering ships at or below cost on schedule with the promised capability evaluating options relating related to existing ships including extending service lives and reactivating decommissioned ships and maximizing the use of the commercial industrial base it should be an interesting discussion gentlemen we're delighted to have you I look forward to your testimony

first of all it's amazing to me that he can stand there for an hour and be that good for that long I was governor for eight years I would give a state of the state address every year be 45 minutes I was exhausted and didn't do nearly as well as he did so I'm just kind of amazed up as someone who's done this kind of thing before as a governor to be able to see him perform at that level for that long I he looked back without boasting talked about the great progress we've made in adding jobs in the last 66 years he talked about how much the deficits come down the progress that we're making now finally taking the fight to Isis and an era beating them down and reducing their the land of that they hold he also acknowledged that even though he's growing economy a lot there's still too many people that are hurting too many people who are looking for jobs and you've got like several million people over here on the one hand who would love to have a job but they don't have the skills to fill the millions of jobs are over here bugging going begging and the plane that he let out I think it's a good one to use community colleges like Dell or tactical can get community college in order to provide help people who don't have this like kind of skills for today's jobs in today's economy help make sure that they get those I thought that was a real real smart approach the other thing he talked about how political we are and overly political and it goes back to when I was at Roulette to the house representatives in 1982 I'm 435 US representatives about 300 of us were centrists center left center right Democrats and Republicans and we worked the other find consensus to make consensus today it's like fewer than 100 and we desire to have a system where we carve up these congressional districts and so that only a very conservative Republican on the one hand could win them are a very liberal Democrat on the other hand could women and then you end up with the very liberal democrats or conservative republicans in the house where presenters and it's hard for them to work together and then a bunch of them end up in the US Senate and sort of contaminate the system there and what the president said most people didn't even notice but it's really a big part of our problem in America today we have to have a way where politicians don't get to choose their voters but we have a you know common-sense ways of creating congressional districts that are people you know created by the politicians for their own political game but are created by by folks that are more objective and who have really good government at died heart

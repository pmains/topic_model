  DELEGATION. NANCY PELOSI NO LONGER SPEAKER. JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON IS  ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT FROM  BURBANK, PASADENA AND GLENDALE,  CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AT LEAST  UP UNTIL JANUARY. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR  TAKING THE TIME. >> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. >> SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT YOUR ALLY, YOU'VE BEEN A  CLOSE ALLY OF NANCY PELOSI'S. SHE WILL BE LONG REMEMBERED AS  ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL  SPEAKERS IN THE -- IN AMERICAN  HISTORY. GIVE US YOUR ASSESSMENT AS TO  HER LEADERSHIP AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA NOW THAT SHE'S  LEAVING THE LEADERSHIP IN THE  HOUSE. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, AS WE GATHER  AROUND HER ON THE HOUSE FLOOR TO HEAR HER FAREWELL ADDRESS AS OUR LEADER, YOU KNOW, I THINK ALL OF US FELT THE SAME WAY THAT WE  WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF  GREATNESS, THAT THIS WAS A  HISTORIC FIGURE THAT WILL GO  DOWN AS PERHAPS THE GREATEST  SPEAKER IN HISTORY WHO WAS ABLE  TO DO MORE WITH THE NARROWEST  MARGINS THAN ANY OTHER. AND SHE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT  BECAUSE SHE COMBINES SO MANY  TALENTS KNOWING EACH OF THE  MEMBERS, KNOWING WHAT THEY WANT, KNOWING MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT  THEY NEED, THEIR DISTRICTS, AND  UNDERSTANDING THE LEGISLATIVE  PROCESS, KNOWING HOW TO USE ALL  OF THE LEVERAGE WHETHER YOU'RE  IN THE MINORITY OR MAJORITY, SHE OFTEN GOT MORE IN THE MINORITY  THAN THE REPUBLICANS DID WHEN  THEY WERE IN THE MAJORITY  BECAUSE SHE WAS SUCH A SKILLFUL  NEGOTIATOR AND OBVIOUSLY TOUGH  AS NAILS WHEN SHE NEEDED TO BE  AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD FIND OUT. I THINK WHAT SHE WILL BE MOST  REMEMBERED FOR IS EXTENDING  HEALTHCARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS  OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY THAT  DIDN'T HAVE IT, AND DEFENDING  DEMOCRACY IN ITS DARKEST HOUR. >> WE HAD SOME REPUBLICANS SAID, LISTEN, NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN A  TARGET OF THEIRS, BUT THEY  ADMIRED CERTAINLY ONE THING  ABOUT HER. SHE WAS ABLE TO KEEP A  DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE IN LINE IN A WAY THAT MAYBE FAR MORE  DIFFICULT FOR KEVIN McCARTHY IF  HE WERE TO BECOME SPEAKER. I'M INTERESTED, WHAT DOES YOUR  SIDE THINK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING  ON THE OTHER SIDE? DO YOU BELIEVE THE BAKERSFIELD  REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO BE THE  NEXT SPEAKER? >> WELL, I THINK HE WILL BE. THE QUESTION IS WILL HE BE ABLE  TO STAY SPEAKER FOR VERY LONG? AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY  DOUBTFUL PROPOSITION. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT NANCY PELOSI, SHE WAS NOT ABLE -- NOT ONLY  ABLE TO KEEP US TOGETHER, A I  HAVE DIVERSE CAUCUS, BUT ABLE TO WITH THAT NARROW MAJORITY USHER  IN MAJOR LEGISLATION, THE MOST  MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN ATTACKING  CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR HISTORY,  THE LEGISLATION TO HELP SAVE  LIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC,  MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, YOU NAME IT, SHE DID THAT WITH NO  VOTES TO SPARE. McCARTHY HAS NONE OF HER TALENT. AND NONE OF HER INTELLECT. AND SO IT IS GOING TO BE VERY  HARD FOR HIM. AND THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE HE'S MISSING THAT NANCY PELOSI HAS  AND THAT IS HE HAS NO IDEOLOGY. THERE IS NO -- THERE IS NO  IDEOLOGICAL GLUE TO HOLD HIS  MEMBERS TOGETHER. AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS  GOING TO WORK, BUT I AM AFRAID  IT IS GOING TO BE A CIRCUS AND I SAY I'M AFRAID OF IT BECAUSE THE COUNTRY NEEDS OUR GOVERNMENT TO  BE FUNCTIONAL. AND IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE IT  BEING VERY FUNCTIONAL WITH KEVIN McCARTHY.  >> LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE, POLITICO IS REPORTING THAT YOU  CHOSE NOT TO SEEK A LEADERSHIP  POSITION WITHIN YOUR CAUCUS AND  THAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON A  POSSIBLE RUN FOR THE UNITED  STATES SENATE PERHAPS WHEN  DIANNE FEINSTEIN IS UP IN 2024. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT? ARE YOU INTERESTED IN RUNNING  FOR STATE WIDE OFFICE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, AT MOMENT I'M REALLY KEEPING MY FOCUS ON THE  SPEAKER AND I THINK THIS HOUR  SHOULD BE ABOUT HER. I DID CONSIDER A ROLE IN  LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE, BUT I  WAS PERSUADED BY MANY OF MY  COLLEAGUES IN THE CALIFORNIA  DELEGATION IN PARTICULAR AND  GIVEN THAT WE'RE LOSING FROM  LEADERSHIP A REAL POWERHOUSE  THAT IS NANCY PELOSI, I'VE BEEN  URGED TO CONSIDER RUNNING FOR  THE SENATE IF SENATOR FEINSTEIN  DECIDES NOT TO RUN FOR  RE-ELECTION IN TWO YEARS. SO I AM EXPLORING IT. BUT I REALLY WANT TO CONFINE MY  COMMENTS THIS MORNING TO SPEAKER PELOSI BECAUSE I THINK SHE  REALLY DESERVES OUR ATTENTION  AND OUR ACCOLADES.  >> GIVE ME YOUR SENSE OF DONALD  TRUMP SEEKING ANOTHER TERM IN  OFFICE. WHEN YOU SAW HIM MAKE THAT  ANNOUNCEMENT THIS PAST WEEK, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT? >> WELL, I WATCHED HIS  ANNOUNCEMENT AND I SAID I WANT  THAT HOUR OF MY LIFE BACK. BUT WHAT I WAS HOPING, FRANKLY  IN THE MIDTERMS AND AMONG OTHER  THINGS, IS IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN UPSETTING THE HISTORY OF A  MIDTERM OF A PRESIDENT'S FIRST  TERM, IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN  UPSETTING THE EXPECTATIONS AND  WE WERE, THAT IT WOULD CAUSE  REPUBLICANS TO CONSIDER  ABANDONING -- FINALLY ABANDONING DONALD TRUMP. IT HAS BEEN CLEAR, CONAN, OVER  THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD NOT HAVE  BANNED TRUMP SIMPLY BECAUSE HE  WAS DISHONEST. THEY WERE WILLING TO LIVE WITH  THAT. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ABANDONED HIM WHEN HE PROVED HIMSELF SUCH A  DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY, SIDING  WITH RUSSIA OVER OUR OWN  NATIONAL INTERESTS. BUT THEY WILL ABANDON HIM IF  THEY DECIDE HE'S A LOSER AND IF  THEY TIE HTHEIR WAGON TO HIS,  THEY'LL BE LOSERS TOO. THEY'LL BE LOSERS IF THEY  CONTINUE TO CLING TO THIS DEEPLY FLAWED HUMAN BEING. THE MIDTERMS MOVED US ONE STEP  FORWARD IN MOVING THE COUNTRY  AWAY FROM THIS UGLY TRUMPIST  ERA. BUT THERE IS NO CERTAINTY AROUND THAT. AND THERE IS STILL A LOT OF HARD WORK AHEAD OF US TO DEFEND OUR  DEMOCRACY FROM THE LIKES OF HIM. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF,

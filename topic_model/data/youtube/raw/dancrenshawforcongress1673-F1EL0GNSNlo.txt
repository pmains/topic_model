- I agree, the answer is yes. The Federal Government has
exceeded its authority. The Constitution is very clear what the role of the Federal Government is and the 10th Amendment
makes that even more clear that the states take up the powers that the federal government
is not expressly given. The fourth branch of government is real and congress has advocated
it's role decades ago. Advocated its role in
overseeing regulatory policy. We give this power to unelected officials in bureaucracies and
what do we expect them to do with it? We gave them a mission
and congress advocated its role to oversee that mission. And on top of that, it's
given too much power to the federal government in other ways that take away from states' rights. Any problem we have as conservatives we should always asked
where is it best solved. Well that answer is at the local level, state level and then Federal Government. That is what the Constitution tells us, that is what we must adhere to. Thank you. - [Member] Thank you.

mr. president I thank my colleague from Maryland and second the comments that she's made about the status of our employees who've been jeopardized and I am excited to work together on the legislation that was introduced last Friday to provide them some protection but I do rise on behalf of an amendment that will be voted on within the next hour cain amendment 21 18 which is a bipartisan amendment to the every child achieves act and it's a it's an amendment to promote career readiness indicators and make sure that our students when they finish high school are not just ready for college but they're ready for careers and this is part of a series of amendments that I've worked on a bipartisan basis some of which have been included in the underlying bill one of which was passed by floor amendment last week I thank the bill managers senators alexandra anne marie for working together to support this bipartisan amendment we need to work to make sure that we help all of our students graduate from high school ready for post-secondary education and workforce over the past 40 years the percentage of jobs that require some form of post-secondary education has doubled from twenty nine percent now to nearly sixty percent but the education system hasn't kept pace with the demand for a more highly educated and skilled workforce and importantly we need to define what that is highly educated and skilled to incorporate career and technical training which for a variety of reasons in the last generation or so was sort of an undervalued part of the spectrum of American public education within a very few years by 2020 when our pages are now going to be out in the workforce a two-thirds of jobs will require Lee some form of post-secondary education but projections demonstrate that as a nation we will fall short by nearly five million workers and we're already seeing these shortages and having to deal with them for example through specialty visas that's fine for the economy but wouldn't be it'd be better if we could train those who are in school right now to be skilled in the areas where the jobs are are needed the career readiness amendment addresses this problem by encouraging not requiring encouraging States to include in their accountability systems that type of indicators the demonstrate students are ready for post-secondary education and the workforce these indicators would include state design measures to integrate rigorous academics work based learning and Career and Technical Education or technical skill attainment and placement and that will be the core of this bill by doing this we send a strong message to schools businesses parents and students that it's critical to be prepared for the workforce of the 21st century regardless of post-secondary education plans and as I've talked to educators and counselors and parents they've often commented upon the degree to which career and technical trainings sort of downgraded students aren't encouraged in that area even though there's great professions to to achieve in this area under the amendment schools and districts would have an incentive to partner with businesses and industries to provide career pathways for students and it's important for state accountability systems I say this as a Virginian very proud of the Virginia accountability system it's currently kind of managed by my wife who's the Secretary of Education in Virginia but it's important for these systems to measure in award schools for helping students earn industry-recognized credentials or in credit for college while in high school mr. president just an example if you're a Virginia student and you take the Virginia standards of learning test and you passed that doesn't necessarily mean anything in North Carolina much less Oregon but if you're a Virginia high school student and you pass a cisco systems administrator exam you can take that credential move to Oregon and get a job tomorrow these industry credentials are in many ways more known more valued and more portable than high school credential state by state schools across the country are providing this kind of important learning opportunity just two examples and then I'll conclude in Alexandria just across the Potomac the Academy of Finance of TC williams high school instruct students and money management skills financial planning and business development students complete a three-year sequence program start working at an on-site in the school credit union and they get early college credit for that financial literacy in the other end of the state Southwest Virginia vinton near the Roanoke City rono William Byrd high school cool after struggling during the 1990s to prepare students for college and career the school side input from nearby businesses and the implemented programs in engineering community communications and business and marketing to match local local job needs these partnerships are helpful in helping students find jobs and they've also in gender and student interest in curriculum the school has a ninety percent graduation rate eighty-three percent of students go on to post-secondary education I want to thank Senator Portman and baldwin thinks in the department was planning on speaking and may still senator Portman involvement for working with me together on this particular amendment and on the Senate CTE caucus I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative and again I thank the bill managers for working with us together on it and with that mr. president I'd be glad to yield for

thank you today i rise on behalf of the millions of americans with disabilities millions of americans who live in a major city with a major public transit system but are unable to utilize it because it's not accessible to them if we want to build a world-class public transportation system in america it has to start by ensuring every station every bus and train across our nation is equally accessible to everyone that is why i introduced the all stations accessibility act or asap act of 2021 which would establish a federal grant program to support transit authorities to upgrade stations to meet or exceed ada accessibility standards i'm pleased to say that we've secured this grant program in the invest in america act now i urge this body to pass that legislation so that we can better ensure our public transit services are for all riders especially those with a disability thank you madam

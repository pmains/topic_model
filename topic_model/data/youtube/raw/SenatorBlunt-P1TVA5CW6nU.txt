I met with farm groups at the Ozark Empire fair in my hometown Springfield Missouri on Saturday every one of them their number one issue since they can't control the weather is what do we do about trade and they're hopeful and I'm hopeful that the Speaker of the House will decide to bring the u.s. MCA trade agreement to the floor there is clearly a majority to pass that agreement on both the house side and the Senate side of the building but you have to have a chance to vote on that agreement it makes a big difference farmers don't want any kind of extraordinary aid what they want is an opportunity to compete around the world more of that will happen if we get to vote on this bill and if we don't and so I hope the speaker decides over this August break to bring this bill to the floor and bring it to the floor in September

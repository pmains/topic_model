thank you mr chair i will at three points i want to make and i will try to be brief i know we have business uh on today's agenda to get to uh and like centerlink i didn't come in expecting or prepared to talk about what we're talking about but i also can't sit silent as i observe a couple of things um yes we should be alarmed not just at the leak but at the substance of the draft opinion don't let concerns about a leak from the supreme court distract from the threat that the draft opinion that is now public represents roe v wade has been considered a matter of settled law for nearly 50 years the vast majority of americans agree with roe v wade and so the draft opinion that was unveiled that it it it turns the potential removal of those protections from a potential to an imminent here and regardless of what your thoughts are on a woman's right to choose and i support a woman's right to choose i will fight to protect a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body regardless of your thoughts on that matter the rationale you used in this draft opinion to take back the protections afforded by roe v wade call into question so many other rights in so many other areas of what has been considered settled law whether it's interracial marriage access to contraception or so many other fundamental rights so it is alarming colleagues it is alarming don't be distracted on damage of the leak don't ignore the significance of the substance of the draft opinion it's that passion that you see playing out on the steps of the supreme court and in cities across the country that's number one number two senator elijah spoke pretty passionately and eloquently senator cornyn spoke earlier about the need to denounce threatening language that is out there now publicly through the press online targeting supreme court justices and their families i agree but to what senator durbin said a minute ago threatening language showing up in people's homes the implicit threat of violence has to be denounced in all its forms there's members of congress that have been subjected to that members of the senate that have been subjected to that secretaries of state in recent years state and local elections officials that have been subjected to that if it's wrong when it's targeting a supreme court justice it's wrong when it's targeting elections officials and so many other public servants across the land and if you're going to denounce it denounce it consistently and lastly if we're going there and clearly we are this morning we also have to denounce things like conspiracy theories that democrats are on the verge of expanding the supreme court to rush and seat recently confirmed judge catandia brown jackson soon to be justice catandra brown jackson so that we can protect roe v wade stop with the conspiracy conspiracy theories please thank you mr chair

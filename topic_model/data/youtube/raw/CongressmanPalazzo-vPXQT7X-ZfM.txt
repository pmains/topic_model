through those issues we you'll see that in the audit report okay well I look forward to seeing the audit report let's talk cotton for a minute cut you know cotton is extremely important to my state and surrounding states in the south I believe you you've been asked by the AG chairman Conway and others several other people of Congress have requested that cottonseed be designated as an oilseed and I think to the date you said that you do not have the authority to do that and we somewhat disagree with you because it feels like you've taken actions in regards to the commodity Credit Corporation to bolster an industry in your home state and then again in 2015 you've worked with the Department of Energy to provide half a billion dollars and bio-based jet fuel to the Department of Navy and then again just this last May you use the CCC to increase biofuel infrastructure another hundred million again this was all without any new legislative authority from Congress and so we a lot of members of Congress think you already have that authority under the same Act can you just tell me and I guess this committee is there anything that's preventing you from using the similar authority for the cotton industry i would say that there are two things number one the case of marks versus general revenue corporation which is a 2013 supreme court case establishes a well-established principle of statutory construction and that is if Congress knowingly amidst something from an act then the provision cannot be reasonably interpreted to allow the omitted Act Congress when it established the 2014 farm bill basically took cotton out of the program and put it into a separate program the stacks program the oil seats provision is designed primarily for emerging oil seeds to participate in a program during periods within between farm bills that's not the circumstance here basically Congress was fully aware of cottonseed fully aware of the oct cotton made the decision remove it and place it in a separate program the industry then came to RMA and asked for oil seeds to be included with cotton for crop insurance purposes so you basically take the Supreme Court case you combine it with with the actions of Congress and you've got a circumstance where we don't believe we have the authority you've mentioned CCC we have used that in the past but there was a provision within the 2015 appropriations bill that prohibited us from doing that if that prohibit that prohibition were removed we would obviously be in a position to use CCC well thank you for your explanation also reading through your report you you know I guess I looked where your devil in your quest to help socially disadvantaged and veterans I through your loan program to try to get them started I'm more in particular interested in your your help with our nation's veterans after all we've been at war for I think 13 14 years hundreds of thousands a young men and women have served this nation and so coming back you just elaborate a little bit more on how USDA is helping our veterans maybe if you have any specifics on the number of veterans that you have helped and any specifics to the program I'm headed to Fort Stewart in Georgia tomorrow to make an announcement I think on a regional conservation partnership program that of Fort Stewart was where our military liaison will not become I think was there last week basically lining up a membrane of Understanding between veterans organizations USDA to basically provide an opportunity for us to be on base as folks are disengaging from the military giving them an opportunity to consider a career in agriculture providing them information about our programs we just reformulated our website for beginning farmers so that you can actually go on the website you can plug in the type of farm you would like that farmer you'd like to be and then there is basically a menu specifically designed for you in terms of what the USDA programs are that could help you get started we are continually working with the Department of Defense to get information about our programs to returning veterans and we are working with a number of organizations we find returning veterans particularly interested in local and regional food and so we are basically providing grants loans microloans tunnel houses to extend the growing season for those folks and there are literally hundreds of those examples I will be glad to get you the statistics from our military liaison and be happy to have him come up and brief you in more detail on precisely what he's doing I would appreciate that Thank You mr. secretary mr.

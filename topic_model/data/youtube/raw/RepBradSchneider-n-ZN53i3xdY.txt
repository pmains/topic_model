now I want to introduce our guests who are doing a great work in our community spreading the word about the census and a sure ensuring that everyone is is counted we're joined today by Carmen Papillon who is the executive director of the hut of the Hollywood library and David McDowell manager for impact funding and advocacy at the United Way of Lake County I'll start with Carmen Carmen can you please introduce yourself a little bit more sure how the Highwood Public Library is engaging in the 2020 census Thank You Brad for this invitation and career allowing me to be part of this a venue yes my name is Carmen Buckland I had been the executive director of the Highwood Public Library for the last a little over a year working in a community that is has a dense hard to count population we felt that it was critical for the library to engage with tawny 2020 census work and we have been working very diligently since January engaging the population ensuring that they understand the impact and the importance of registering for the census great Thank You Carmen and now let me turn it to to David from the United Way David please introduce yourself and talk about what United Way is doing to help us make sure we get everybody counted in the 2020 census Thank You congressman the United Way's decided to get involved in the census fairly early on last year largely because most of the families that we noticed are liz' most of the populations that we noticed are under counted or also the populations that United Way and its community partners serve so we thought we've got a network of strong organizations trusted messengers and can talk to the families in those hard to count communities about the importance of the census and why they should be involved great well thanks to both of you and your organization's for all you're doing now I've got a few questions that I have that I'll ask our guests that I want to let folks know that we're also able to answer questions you might have about the census in the Facebook live comments so if you have any you can put them there but my first question I'll serve with you Carmen what are some of the common misconceptions about the the 2020 census and how it works and what impact it has so what I'm here from families is that that may be their information is not secure maybe their information will be shared with other branches of government there's still limits conception that that the immigration question is being asked and that the government is utilizing this data for tracking purposes that may impact them and negatively in the in the future and it's just more paperwork that the government wants from us so those are the the common misconceptions that I'm hearing from families in my community and its overall fear or an overall sense of what does it matter I don't even count I don't see the money coming to me directly so those are the those are the misconceptions that I'm hearing and those are the barriers that we're looking to overcome with families right and we just have to make sure people understand it is so important it affects everything that's going on in our communities so it's really part of how about you David what are you doing I actually think one of the biggest misconceptions about the census is that people don't care I don't think people understand the barriers that exist to people actually answering the questions there are four key barriers to folks the first one is people are hard to locate if if we don't know where they are we can't access either our outreach workers or the Census can't access people it doesn't matter what they think about the census they don't hear about it and they don't connect to it the second one is we may know where they live but it's difficult to get to because there are gated communities or they're in apartment buildings that you can't get access to or they've got barriers that exist gambits fear of strangers knocking on their doors the the one that most people talk about is just one of three and that is people who have a mistrust of government that is a barrier that needs to get over but the fourth barrier is that we may know where they are they may want to answer the census but there's a communication challenge this year that's especially visible through the fact that the Census Bureau is trying to do everything on the Internet and so folks that are not well connected or not well versed in using the Internet they may want to fill out the forms but they just they just can't they don't know how and again to remind people it is available on the internet the phone numbers will repeat them again that I think is one of the important reasons but Carmen thank you you know there's specific barriers that are distinct maybe not unique but distinct the Latino community barriers that are specific to people who are perhaps English is not the primary language in the home you want touch on some of those certainly so the main the main concern that we're hearing is the lack of trust and we're going to keep reiterating this as the conversation goes data you know as Dave mentioned bread it is the lack of trust families that especially new immigrant families have many barriers that they're facing right now they're in survival mode right now with co-ed in the picture and now especially with all of the rioting happening it's like a perfect storm against the census so it tends not to be a priority in families Minds right now so especially for Latino immigrants that are new to this country they don't understand what the census is for they have a mistrust of local government and of government period when you come and you ask them you know we need to count you because you're important and your information is critical for us to make sure that we have the the accurate statistics that will determine the benefits that are going to be coming to our communities they still it's like it's okay I'll do it later but then they don't do it and so I think that coming creating an atmosphere of trusted voices to target this demographic is key working with families having someone like myself or someone that I the people that I work with that are Latino engaging Latinos is making a little impact but again the overall sense is I'm afraid I don't want to give you my information I don't want to be put in any jeopardy I'm new to this country I don't know what this is and so I don't want to be counted and when you try to explain to these to the families that we're working with that you know if you count whether your status is is you documented or undocumented you and your children will determine how much funding will come to each of these communities if you don't count I always highlight the dollar amount that is going to be impacted for each person for the next ten years resonates with them and they kind of begin to break down those walls but it is very difficult expand of something you say you talk about people new to the country the census is about counting everybody and it is everybody whether they were born here or they immigrated here their respective their immigration status people who are new literally people who may have arrived in the in the last day or two whether by birth or by immigration that newborn infant counts every bit as much as the adult who's coming here for a job all of that matters because every single person is a part of the census and it's been that way since the founding of our country and it's important to know that this is how we establish our government and I appreciate the concerns about the fears certainly there are people and some people in high places in government who are trying to stoke those fears but I'm gonna quote Abraham Lincoln government of the people for the people by the people that is because of our census in part that a census allows us to have that and everyone being counted is a critical critical piece of that and David you touched on this a little bit earlier certainly the pandemic is affecting how we are doing the census you know as I said we've been doing this the entire history of our country at one point it was people knocking on your door riding up on horseback today we're using technology with the internet and phones but how is code affecting it and what should people be aware I think I think there are a number of things that are that are impacting this census we've talked a little bit about the immigration issue we're gonna talk about Co vid but I think we also have to acknowledge that the the protests that are happening are raising very serious issues about a large part of our population that also is struggling with full recognition with the african-american community I think what we've run into with the kovat pandemic is the first problem is we can't talk to people face to face much of our outreach plan was based on having trusted messengers talking to people about the importance that we can't do the other challenges that places where people gather or connect those have disappeared under social distancing and other trusted messengers like home visiting programs or health department's or health clinics those are the awesome places that we were going to try to reach our targeted populations and those they're overwhelmed with responding to kovat 19 and are not able to partner with us around the census at the same time I think the census is about being counted when you have a large part of the nation standing up and saying we're not seen and there is a quite frankly at the administrative level on the federal government an unwillingness to really listen to that message it's going to make it much harder for us on the ground to say the census is important you need to be counted when we're struggling with a federal government that is not quite sure whether or not the voices that are coming from the protests are important enough to hear and I think that's something that we need to acknowledge we're struggling against what's happening at the federal level as well absolutely and let me say that every voice is important to hear and that's part of the reason why the census is so important the other thing David you mentioned we've watched them in many ways protests contrary to that but we've lost the public square the gathering the places meeting in libraries and things like that but I'll raise a question two questions there I guess the link we are having gatherings like this we're on Facebook people are using other social media or video platforms to be together with family friends even though they're remotely so something that each of us can do as individuals is when we have these gatherings remind our friends to go get the counted to make sure they're taking the census and we've seen in certainly in in the tenth County but Illinois we're doing better than the national average we're about sixty seventy percent of the way there we have a long way to go we want to get a hundred percent because everyone has to be counted and so for both of us are determined within the context of Mexican early some of the initiatives were seen being taking in our communities to get that number to one hundred percent and some of the things that we might still try to do so what we've been trying to do here in Highwood when we set out to do this project we said that we wanted to get last census we got two 17.2% so we said if we get anywhere over eighty close to ninety percent we're going to be very happy so we were excited we had plans to do all some major events we had a lot of plans but then all of a sudden they all crumbled with Kovac so we had to become creative on how we reach the population and our heart to count community here so what we're doing is one of our trusted voices is a lunch mom so every lunch pick up she's reminding families register for the census this food is made possible because a funding that we're getting due to the census resources and so we are distributing information at every lunch pickup we have gotten stickers that we're putting on door Thea packs and on those other packs and on three litre cokes or sodas at our local local merchants local grocery stores to stay in front of families we were able to secure a lot of giveaways so every time families come and pick up food from our pop up food distribution we're giving families a frisbee we're giving families a water bottle and we're reminding them you have to register for the census is critical that you get counted that your three-month-old gets counted that your twelve-year-old gets counted and so we want to make sure that families that were in front of their face and so I think our efforts are working so far we're at sixty three point six percent completed here in Highwood so we're nowhere near our goal but I feel like we're in a good position right now that if we continue to stay on this path that we can reach that eighty eighty-five percent hopefully one hundred percent goal but yes there are many barriers that are preventing us from making things happen here for so right before the shutdown we had a churros con chocolate day event trying to be as culturally sensitive as possible to our community and so we had a great turnout and so we had planned on the other Nino and and ice cream socials but all of those unfortunately had to be canceled so we're becoming creative on how we target that audience so we're we ordered face masks that we're going to give away to families that have the census information on it and so anywhere that they go they're a constant reminder this is something that's critical and important that we need to defeat and so we want to stay in front of this and we want to stay in front of everybody's face that says you know get counted your numbers matter and you count absolutely um David how about United Way well we we made an immediate shift in how we had a very extensive plan working with community partners we made an immediate shift when early March when the governor [Music] it shouldn't stay at home order our outreach workers basically got on the phone and started calling we looked for places where there was still connection school districts are still reaching out to families food banks were going to be more more activist folks lost their job and we've been working to move fliers out electronically or delivering flyers to food banks into the organizations that were funding through our over nineteen community response fund to to get census information out while we're doing that and we've actually gotten a lot more contacts out with flyers than we had initially expected to but that still isn't as high-quality contact as talking to people face-to-face or actually having community leaders as there whether they're pastors or teachers themselves or other places of contact pushing the census message out as well the census as Carmen had mentioned is critically important for programs that are in really lifesavers for many of our families Medicare student loans for parents that are going to have kids going to college in the next ten years the money for student loans and Pell grants or proportion by the population school breakfast school lunches many of the things that are being delivered by school districts now even though they're not open those are funded through census grants WIC and Head Start these are all pieces that are critical to our families and we need to get the count up so it's it's going to become more and more important that pastors are talking about this with their congregations that places even when people are gathering around sort of memorializing George Floyd it's important that the census piece start to be a part of that conversation if you want to be seen if you want to be counted there are numbers of ways that that has to be done in being in the street and being vocal is one of them but being a part of the census is also one and so that's part of the message that we need to start moving out the other thing that I would want to would want to mention really quickly is that the census self-response time was originally scheduled to end at the end of July the Census Department has moved that up to October so the census will extend much longer than it normally does and there's going to continue to be opportunity for our community stakeholders as they begin to open up to be more active on the census and we're going to be reaching out and trying to make that happen as we stretch into late summer and early fall oh sorry I also wanted to add that one of the things that has really been impactful for us as well is that we have recruited 13 very active community members and there might come with us and so they're our ambassadors and they are reaching their own networks so I think that that is that grassroots effort that is really making an impact here in Highwood is that we get trusted voices from within the community to do grassroots marketing and engaging to their own networks yeah and I think that's absolutely right in common you mentioned this idea of community leaders I think you do have to convey as leaders the responsibility but also the trust and be very focused on that but also as others have mentioned the protests are going on over a 24-hour period an hour yesterday I guess Wednesday night I was at three protests within the community all student organized all organized by our young people and these leaders it's amazing what they're doing is they're pulling people together but so I guess this is a not-so-subtle plea to our young people to step up and lead as well this is your future because you touched on it is about education it is about what resources will get for our not just primary and secondary schools but for our universities it's about housing it's about roads it's every single aspect that touches each of our lives so getting counted matters and I think there's an opportunity for leadership not just from elected leaders not just from community community leaders students but everyone in the community and we can really make a huge difference so as we're starting to wrap up I want to give just a general opportunity for us to to to close with some thoughts start with you Carmen any specific things you want to say and I will repeat before we close the phone numbers and website again yeah so this flyer this little postcard is what we're handing out to people and so I'll just say it in Spanish as it reads here in English the census saguru is fussy es importante the census is safe it's easy and it's important and this is the message that we want to convey to as many family members as we have here especially the hard to count the immigrant population the young families that are new to this country we want them to understand that they matter that they count regardless of their status in this country so that's the final message that I want to share is that we're working hard to make sure that everyone gets counted that we keep all of our congressional seats that we get the funding that each community that requires to be successful in to thrive so thank you Brad for this opportunity to present these this important issue here thank you coming David I know that's thought yes the one thing that I would add is that figuring out how to get connected is one of the key parts that we're facing a United Way of Lake County has the 2-1-1 Lake County help line so if people are looking for a direct path to census information dial 2-1-1 and speak to the the folks at the other end of the line and they can help you get connected to the Census Department order organizations like the Highwood library or like mano-a-mano that can help work through any questions you have about the census it's also a great resource for anybody that has questions about kovat 19 or needs access to any other help so I want to make sure that folks are comfortable and aware that if you don't know where else to turn just call 2-1-1 thank you Anna two to one one's a great service and Ian thanks for setting that up so let me let me summarize real briefly I'm going to go through the five things real quickly again number one percent everybody counts we need everyone on board number two a census does not does not include a citizen citizenship question number three it's confidential number four it's easy really easy and number five it is so so important so let me close with the information of how to complete the census it takes less than ten minutes you can do it online 2020 census go up again 2020 census gov or calling English for four three three zero two zero two zero or Spanish eight four four four six eight two zero two zero

we could go by not allowing our great vice-president to see them and we give them hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and support tremendous numbers numbers that nobody understands that money is on the tape when that money is not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace president Trump less than a half-hour ago in Davos sitting with Benjamin Netanyahu who's praising him for moving the capital of Israel excuse me our embassy to the capital of Israel which is Jerusalem and we create a lot of enemies a lot of anger there in fact he felt as though as the president just said that he is we were two isolated countries at the United Nations and then saying the Palestinians just disrespected our vice president refused to meet with Mike Pence a couple of days ago and the presence of listen I'm not going to write you a big check if you're not going to talk peace and disrespect to a government like that in-studio nodding along is congressman Lee Zeldin a Republican from Long Island and use mentioned you have a chance to interact with the president kind of often you both New Yorkers obviously and first off your reaction to it the president said it's pretty direct the you saw it with the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was talking about President Trump there is a lot of pride over there amongst Bibi that we feel here and we are proud of our president the way he's approaching this issue that Israel is one of our greatest if not our greatest allies in the entire world there should be no daylight between our countries it was a good thing that there were flowers in between Bibi and Trump during those remarks because you could tell the day rate a hug I mean it there is no daylight there was flowers between the two of them right the president wasn't that way with President Obama President Obama and Netanyahu famously didn't get along President Obama tried to get his opponent to win the last election which is unbelievable President Obama's team was on the ground in Israel they were actively campaigning to Alice Bibi they're even on the way out the door secretary Kerry gave this over our rambling speech lecturing the world about Israel a very Pro Palestinian especially on their eggs of that of office President Trump made a commitment during the campaign he was gonna recognize Jerusalem as a capital of Israel he was right he was fulfilling not only his own campaign promises he was fulfilling the campaign problem is a past presence and he was the right thing because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel it makes sense that our embassy would be in the capital of Israel and you know as it relates to making sure that taxpayer dollars aren't funding the Palestinians when they are inciting violence and financially rewarding terror one issue after another president Trump has been great on his topic congressman Zeldin I was your Jewish American right so you you obviously know that the Israeli government usually is friendly to you right you have a conversation do you have a relationship with the Prime Minister I've been there I've interacted with the other Prime Minister and his team they come here they love our country and I'll tell you what when I was in Israel I was this place called X restaurant in Tiberias the owner gets on the microphone she starts preaching her love of the United States and how much he values the relationship to United States and Israel as she's doing it a boat pulls in off the Sea of Galilee and starts blowing off fireworks as the fireworks start blowing off the owner of the restaurant starts playing god Bless America over the loudspeaker and everyone's singing along if they know the words they were lip-synching it there are a lot of restaurants in the United States let alone other countries in the United States where you don't have that happen they love us what's your reaction to the report that John Kerry told Mahmoud Abbas resist President Trump and I'm going to run 2020 he'll be out in a year if this reports are true it is absolutely outrageous secretary Kerry's policy and approach his rhetoric the policies that were coming out of the Obama administration while he was Secretary of State was wrong right now his efforts to undercut the Trump administration when they're doing the right thing it's absolutely outrageous secretary Kerry should know better as a former Secretary of State not to go this far out of his way to undercut our diplomacy in our efforts to do the right thing you did not like the president's tax plan because it didn't affect New Yorkers positively because you no longer write state tax and our state tax is way too high what was the president's reaction to you not going along with it well actually you know we were together just afterwards at the White House you know we have interacted very well together the on the corporate tax side I mean there's you know there's all sorts of great components to this bill we're seeing the impact of it right away I do believe that we need to bring spending under control in our country if we want to reduce the corporate tax rate I'd rather see that paid for with spending cuts I want to see our economy growing faster than government is I want to see deficits turn into surpluses on the personal income side I was advocating for something that would better protect middle income atomizers in my district and in my region I would say though the reason why our state local tax deduction is so high is because our state local taxes are so high so the tax law now when you state local governments to do their part and we have an expert Iverson you really end their choice you represent a bunch of people who might be paying more money you got to do that to be honest you're Republican but you got to represent your people lastly we have this issue of daca you know we have Cory Gardner Lindsey Graham on one side and Tom cotton just within Republicans on the other side where's it's going to go where's the rubber hit the road for you I would predict I can't guarantee it at some point between x2 and six weeks for the first time it's been so elusive for a long time that we're gonna have an immigration bill and we're going to address the daca issue we're going to get funding for the border wall we are going to make important changes to chain migration Visa Lottery just as the president Trump outlined so we're Senator Schumer is out there accusing president Trump of being jello Senator Schumer before last weekend was against a border wall during the weekend was for a border wall after the weekend was against a border wall Senator Schumer in the congressional Democrats are the jello but we know it no matter what we're going to still do the right thing we're going to make a great compromise that the American public is going to love understanding that we have other issues whether immigration system need to be addressed as our listeners WR CN know with you this is a major issue for you you and your district there are a lot of people who came here illegally who have kids I coached a lot of them I'm finding out over the last few days their parents are here illegally I had no idea they're calling me to find out you phone must be broken up the hook on no doubt and I'll tell you Long Island loves and we're proud of Brian Kilmeade it's great to be on with you but your hometown is proud of you all right thanks so much congressman as I say they are very happy that you represent

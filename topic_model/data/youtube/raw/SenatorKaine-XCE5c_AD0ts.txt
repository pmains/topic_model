in November 2013 the United States and five global powers the p5 plus one announced an interim deal to freeze Iran's nuclear program and negotiate a diplomatic resolution to one of the most challenging issues affecting global security since then is a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees i participated in scores of hearings classified briefings meetings and calls about this topic in virginia washington and during five trips to the Middle East including two trips to Israel I've listened to the administration to allies and in the Middle East and elsewhere to current and former Senate colleagues especially former Armed Services chairman John Warner and Carl Levin to national security and foreign policy experts to critics and proponents of the deal to American military leaders and troops and also to my constituents I helped write the Iran nuclear agreement review act under which Congress is currently engaging in a 60-day review period to approve or disapprove of the suspension of congressional sanctions as part of the final deal in acts July 15 based on my review of this complex matter I acknowledge that every option before us involves risk with upside and downside consequences and mr. president I understand how people of goodwill can reach different conclusions but I also conclude that the joint comprehensive plan of action is a dramatic improvement over the status quo in improving global security for the next 15 years unlikely longer in this deal America has honored its best traditions and shown that patient diplomacy can achieve what isolation and hostility cannot for this reason I will support the deal prior to the interim negotiation in November of 2013 and even in the face of a punishing international sanctions regime Iran's nuclear program was marching ahead Iran had amassed more than 19,000 centrifuges to enrich and rhenium and that number was growing Iran had produced more than 11 thousand kilograms enriched uranium and that number was growing Iran had perfected the ability to enrich uranium to the twenty percent level and that enrichment percentage was growing Iran was constructing a heavy water facility in Iraq capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium in Iran only allowed limited access to its declared nuclear facilities and shield shielded the operation and inspection of the covert nuclear sites the program when diplomacy began was months away from being able to produce enough your enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations in September of 2012 quote for over seven years the international community has tried sanctions with Iran under the leadership of President Obama the international community has passed some of the strongest sanctions to date it's had an effect on the economy but we must face the truth sanctions have not stopped Iran's nuclear program we must face the truth a punishing sanctions regime did not stop Iran's nuclear program the nuclear program will only stop by a diplomatic agreement or by military action and while military action has to be an option it is in America's interest and the interest of the entire world to use every effort to find a diplomatic resolution in fact that was the purpose of the Iranian sanctions to begin with to open a path to a diplomatic solution we now have a diplomatic solution on the table the jcpoa is not perfect because all parties made concessions as is the case in any serious diplomatic negotiation but it has gained broad international support because it prevents Iran from getting sufficient uranium for a bomb for at least 15 years it also stops any pathway to a plutonium weapon for that period and it exposes Iranian covert activity to enhance scrutiny by the international community forever under the deal arai does the following it affirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek developer acquire any nuclear weapons it reduces the quantity of centrifuges by more than two-thirds it slashes its uranium stockpile by 97% to 300 kilograms for 15 years this is dramatically less than what would Iran Iran would need to produce even a single nuclear weapon it caps the enrichment level of the uranium aning uranium stockpile at three point six seven percent it reconfigures the Arak reactor so that it can no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium it commits to a series of limitations on R&D activities to guarantee that any nuclear program will be for exclusively peaceful purposes in full compliance with international non-proliferation rules and finally Iran agrees to a robust set of international inspections of its declared nuclear facilities its entire uranium supply chain and in suspected covert facilities by a team of more than 130 international inspectors after your 15 the unique caps and requirements imposed on Iran are progressively lifted through year 25 after year 25 Iran is permanently obligated to abide by all international non-proliferation treaty requirements including the extensive inspections required by the NPT Additional Protocol and its agreement that it will quote never seek develop or acquire any nuclear weapons continues forever mr. president if Iran breaks this Agreement nuclear sanctions can be reimposed the United States reserves the right to sanction Iran for activities unrelated to its nuclear program including support for terrorism arms shipments and human rights violations finally and importantly the US and our partners maintain the ability to use military action if Iran seeks to obtain a nuclear weapon in violation of the deal the knowledge of the Iranian program gained through extensive inspections will improve the effectiveness of any military action and the clarity of Iran's commitment to the world in the first paragraph of the agreement that it will never pursue nuclear weapons will make it easier to gain international support for military action should Iran violate their unequivocal pledge this deal does not solve all outstanding issues with an adversarial regime in that sense it's similar to the nuclear test ban treaty that president kennedy negotiated with the soviet union in the midst of the Cold War Iran's support for terrorism remains a major concern and we must increase efforts with our regional allies to counter those malign activities but at the end of the day this agreement is not about making an ally out of an adversary it is about denying an adversary a path to obtaining nuclear weapons this deal takes a nuclear weapons program that was on the verge of success and disables it for many years through peaceful diplomatic means with sufficient tools for the international community to verify whether Iran is meeting its commitments I hope this resolution might open the door to diplomatic discussion of other tough issues with Iran in conclusion mr. president monitoring this agreement and countering Iran's non-nuclear activity will require great diligence by the US our allies and the IAEA and there will be an important role for Congress in this ongoing work I look forward to working with my colleagues on measures to guarantee close supervision and enforcement of this deal that work will be arduous but it is far preferable to allowing Iran to return to a march toward nuclear weapons it is also far preferable to any other alternative including war

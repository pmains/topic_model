Mr Speaker I rise today to express my gratitude for the st. Louis County a volunteer rescue squad located in northern Minnesota and their quick response to an emergency that took place in my district a little over a month ago at the end of July a group of Girl Scouts traveling to northern Minnesota to experience the beauty and magnificence of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area their trip unexpectedly hit a rough patch when severe thunderstorms rolled in and lightning struck close to their campsite a few of the girls reported feeling something from the ground potentially a ground current and needed precautionary medical attention the Boundary Waters Canoe Area is very remote making any rescue attempt more complex and rigorous never Lola nevertheless the volunteer st. Louis County Rescue Squad members immediately sprang into action navigating five Portage's by motorboat and then canoe escorting the girls back to safety Mr Speaker I am thankful that the Northland has such a capable and well-trained group of individuals dedicated to the safety of our neighbors and visitors due to their hard work over the years many emergencies have been averted and lives have been saved thank you and I yield back

joining us now is congresswoman nancy mace congresswoman welcome to the program thank you so much for having me this evening well congressman is it more than just the mask and speaker pelosi and republicans in the house oh absolutely i mean this is an authoritarian regime right now at this point when i heard when i walked into my office on the hill on thursday morning and heard that nancy pelosi had directed the capitol hill police to arrest staffers and anyone visiting the capitol who was not wearing a mask i lost it and members of congress who were not wearing a mask were supposed to be reported to the police um this is insanity and she's it's nancy pelosi gone wild i mean really and you heard you know the the republicans were trying to be villainized and i had four words for nancy pelosi come and get me there's something called civil disobedience where we can and we should peacefully uh protest some of these demands and i'm i'm old enough to remember when it was you know former president trump who was authoritarian but this truly is what they're doing authoritarian right now and it's time to push back and you saw a few hours later folks on social media including media with those bright blue uh official stars by their names saying well gosh if we're going to arrest people with mass why don't we arrest people that haven't been vaccinated where does this end well i think that's what most people are worried about and i think it's bigger i'm not even convinced the democrats really even care about keeping everybody safe and i really don't care they care about keeping republicans safe i think this is all about power it's about villainizing everyone including president trump do you think it's a midterm election ploy and will it backfire on them oh it's totally about politics and power it's about advocating for fear instead of facts and i know that the left likes to say republicans are the only ones who are unvaccinated well i have news for the left if you actually dig into the data and you can look at data scientists who are democrats online and you'll see that it's not just republicans there are are concentrated areas of low-income and uneducated which include democrats and republicans it includes african-american and white communities it's it's all of the above and they're trying to take a very serious illness and weaponizing it for political purposes rather than investigate the oranges of coveting hold china accountable nancy pelosi absolutely refuses to hold any congressional hearings on it and you've got the president and the administration essentially giving china a slap on the wrist they're not doing anything about getting back at china and holding them accountable at all and this is a not just a national crisis this is global it's affecting everybody around the world so congressman lastly where does it go here for you i i know you probably will wear your mask on the house floor you you're going to not wear it otherwise maybe you're not going to wear it on the house floor i don't know what you find thousands of dollars on the floor if you don't wear a mask and i'm you know look i am a reasonable person i had covid19 i serious about with it i'm a long hauler i've been vaccinated i was wearing a mask before i got vaccinated but we are pushing back now and i don't mind wearing a mask in the chamber when there are four or 500 people you know in there i'm reasonable about it but what we shouldn't be doing is threatening people to arrest them if they don't wear a mask or if they're not vaccinated that is a choice that you should make in consultation with your physician and your family there are parents that may want to hold off on getting their kids vaccinated they should by all means be given the freedom to choose and do that you know congress we just played a video next to you it was the congresswoman swearing in a new member of the house from texas a republican uh with no mask by the way and she's swearing him in i guess breaking every single one of her rules uh if you can 10 seconds some that little action up on her part well we saw it on friday friday it's uh do as i say not as i do nancy pelosi yeah congressman uh woman mace thank you so much i appreciate you coming on the program today keep us posted on this battle we're uh we're happy you're waging it thank you so much

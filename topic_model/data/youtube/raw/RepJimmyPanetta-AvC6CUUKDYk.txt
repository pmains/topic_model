Mr Speaker I rise today to advocate for a national infrastructure plan I represent the Central Coast of California in this winter we got rain we got a lot of rain so much so that it caused millions and damage to the area including the closure of the famous highway 1 in Big Sur with major mudslides in the south and the loss of a 315 foot Pfeifer Canyon bridge and Big Sur that damage has left 450 people isolated kids can't get to school families are separated employers and employees are suffering including the loss of 8 million dollars in one month in the offseason but the effects of that damage extend beyond Big Sur to the surrounding towns counties and actually the entire state of California see people all over the world come to Big Sur they drive down from San Francisco they drive up from Los Angeles and they patronised towns all along their way to Big Sur we understand why it's the most beautiful place in the world it is my home and we want to be it to be open to all of you so it is time that the Congress and our president help Americans by investing in our American infrastructure Thank You mr. speaker

from the great state of Pennsylvania mr. Doyle I thank my colleague from California and my colleagues from New York and Connecticut many of us that you'll see on the floor tonight we're not regulars we're not people that come to the floor often to speak but I think many of us feel it's important for the American people to understand the nature of this task this battle that we face on their behalf you know we hear a lot from Republicans about the president not wanting to negotiate not wanting to talk the Democrats don't want to negotiate and they've been pretty good at saying that over and over and over again mr. speaker but what they're not telling the American people is the nature of the negotiation that they want to have and I think it's important that that that be revealed you know what makes me so angry and the reason I'm here tonight is what we face in the country right now is completely a manufactured crisis there is no structural economic reason that our country should be facing default come the 17th of this month there's no reason that 800 federal employees aren't working there's no no no structural no no reason for this to happen this is being manufactured by a party because they're trying to get something that they've not been able to get at the ballot box we have divided government the Republicans control the House of Representatives the Senate is controlled by the Democratic Party we have a Democratic president the Republicans had two goals going into this manufactured crisis one was to destroy the health care bill now this is a bill that passed the House of Representatives it passed the Senate it was signed by the president it was upheld by the Supreme Court and we had a presidential election and their candidate said on day one of his new administration the thing he would do if elected was to repeal the Affordable Care Act that gentleman lost by five million votes so what they can't accomplish at the ballot box they now we're looking for a way to accomplish here but it couldn't be done through the regular process mr. speaker it couldn't be done through the regular order so now comes this ingenious idea hatched by the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party to say here's what we'll do we'll wait for the end of the fiscal year to come and we'll say we're going to shut the government down unless you repeal Obamacare you know I was on this floor a couple days ago and and read something on the floor that I had saw in the internet by a young man by the name of Judd Judd legume I hope I've said his last name correctly and he put an analogy about what we were actually facing his said sort of like someone comes up the end says I want to burn down your house look at the guy who say no and he say well I just want to burn down the second floor and you tell them no and he goes what about your garage can I burn your garage down you say no and the guy said well let's just sit down and talk about what part of your house I can burn down hey you look at the guy you say no and he goes you see you're not compromising this is what we're facing in this so-called red negotiation what Republicans are saying is defund obamacare will open up the government we said no then they said well delay Obamacare for a year and we'll open up the government and we said no and then they said we'll just get rid of that individual mandate which effectively kills the health care bill and we said no and then they said well will you just sit down and negotiate with us and tell us what part of the Affordable Care Act we can get rid of and we said there's 20 million Americans that are counting on this bill it's the law of the land the answer's no and they look at us and say the Democrats don't want to negotiate the president want to negotiate well I Got News for my friends over there we're not going to negotiate the rights of 20 million uninsured Americans because they can't get this done at the ballot box so now mr. speaker what's the new strategy they've shifted off of the health care bill now because the American public by margins of over seventy percent have said we don't want you to shut the government down that try to get rid of the Affordable Care Act so now where they've moved to the Ryan budget what's the Ryan budget it's a budget that keeps us in sequester it's a budget that does not invest in our infrastructure it's a budget that does not invest in the education of our children it's a budget that makes it impossible for this economy to grow and it's a budget that threatens the social safety net that many of our senior citizens end on and they couldn't get it passed in the regular order they couldn't get it passed in the own house of representatives for a long time they were afraid to put the bill on the floor and they certainly couldn't get it passed in the Senate and they knew the president wouldn't sign it so what's the strategy now this new rig negotiation that we're being asked to have with our friends is give us pieces of the Ryan budget and in return we'll open up the government and will raise the debt ceiling but only if you give us what we want in the Ryan budget Mr Speaker we want to have a budget negotiation with our friends on the Republican side the house has passed a budget the Senate has passed a budget the numbers there's a great disparity in the numbers Democrats believe in investing in America we want to rebuild our roads and bridges and source systems we want to invest in the education of our children we want to protect our seniors in our veterans it costs money to do that mr. speaker so there is a difference but we're we're ready and we're willing to appoint conferees tomorrow to sit down and have a negotiation I want the American public to understand that we have asked 18 times to a point conferees to negotiate the differences in the Senate budget and the house budget and all 18 times the Republicans in the House have said no so Mr Speaker I would just say if there's someone in this house that's not willing to negotiate it's our friends on the Republican side of the AO the American people deserve a budget negotiation where we sit down and settle our differences we're not going to get everything we want mr. speaker it's divided government the Republicans are going to get something in this budget negotiation the Democrats are going to get something in this by negotiation but the country moves forward we pay our bills and we live to fight another day mr. speaker in closing let me say to the American people we will not be part of a rigged negotiation where Democratic priorities and principles aren't allowed to be discussed only that which the Republicans couldn't get in the ballot box that they're trying to get now by holding a gun to her head that's not the way you do business in the United States of America that kind of behavior has to be stopped mr. speaker for the goodies American people I hope Republicans will come to their senses pass a clean CR and let's sit down and negotiate a budget agreement for the American people and move this country forward I thank you for giving me this time and I yield back to you mr. Doyle thank you

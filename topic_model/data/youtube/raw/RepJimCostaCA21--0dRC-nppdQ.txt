well thank you very much clearly it's a team effort and our quarterback was so often and I must tell you as a third-generation farmer that food is a national security item and everyday farm workers and farmers work so hard through the fruits of their labor to put the best quality highest nutritional food on America's dinner table every night it is a national security item it gets taken granted too often but for the collection of this hard work that took place we are giving the farm workers the campesinos the dignity and the respect that they deserve and farmers dairymen and dairy women and ranchers understand that they're a team as well and when they work together well we have a lot of food for all of America and to export around the world god bless each and every one of you on to the Senate more success Thank You Howie thank you a party for all that good effort [Applause]

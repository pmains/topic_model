all right let's get the gop response from louisiana senator bill cassidy so senator cassidy you heard senator manchin lay out his arguments for this this new bill on climate and spending what's your response yeah much of what he says is just not true for example they are raising taxes according to the joint committee of taxation the taxes will be raised almost 17 billion dollars in the first year on those who are making less than 200 000 dollars and the percent of taxes raised for individuals increases over time for the middle class and the lower income they're raising taxes on people who make less than ten thousand dollars according to the joint committee on taxation and in terms of rate lowering the price of fuel they're going to raise excise tax on the every br every every barrel of oil by 17 roughly that is going to increase the price of the pump increase other fuel-related costs so much of what they're saying about this bill is not true and those are two examples you you and other republicans frequently pointed to larry summers and what he said about the original uh version of buildback better saying that it would increase inflation this bill though is significantly less expensive it is more targeted and larry summers now has an entirely different view at least on this bill take a listen to what he had to say i believe that this is disinflationary policy that's also going to make the economy more efficient it's also going to preserve the environment and also it's going to make us have a fairer society so here's the guy that you and other republicans pointed to over and over and over again uh in explaining opposition to biden's originally planned now this paired down plan he says is going to be disinflationary uh and lead to a fairer american society what do you say now to larry summers yeah it may be disinflationary by causing a recession they're interjecting an incredible amount of incredible amount of uncertainty into the economy just as we entered a recession number one number two fifty percent of the taxes on business are on manufacturers i just spoke to a louisiana manufacturer last week and he's just like having to increase wages to attract workers and now we're going to increase his taxes as much as we're going to manufacturers can choose to set up in the united states or choose to move to asia i think what we're doing is inducing them to move to asia you can have a disinflationary program by causing a recession i think this is going to lead to a worse recession okay so i i'm hearing you're definitely not going to be on board here this will be all democrats if it passes but let me ask you about the chips bill uh which passed right before manchin announced this deal manton and schumer you were one of 17 republicans that supported that bill to support domestic production of semiconductors here's what your louisiana colleague john kennedy had to say after after that happened he said we got our ass kicked it's just that simple looked to me like we got rinky dude that's a louisiana word for screwed so is he right did you guys get hoodwinked by joe manchin and chuck schumer yeah first john also said that he thought we should spend the money on national defense we are spending the money on national defense right now the u.s share of computer chip production has decreed decreased from 40 percent to 15 percent and if china attacked taiwan we currently get about six or the world's share of taiwan plus china is 55 if we wish to have a secure industrial base to provide the chips for our fighter jets for cars you name it we've got to have a domestic chip manufacturing this is all about national security i'm a china hawk if you're comfortable with china you don't mind this bill maybe you don't vote for if you're a china hawk like i am if you're about national security by golly you support this bill and by the way you mentioned whether or not schumer somehow pulled a fast one on republicans schumer pulled a fast from the american people when they say it's not going to raise taxes but 50 of the taxes raised on those making less than 200 000 a year uh he he pulled a fast on the american people all right and quickly before you go i've got to ask you about this bill to help uh veterans who were expo had toxic exposure fighting uh wars on behalf of our country uh you voted for this uh burn pit bill uh just a month ago and now you voted against it uh this week can you explain why why did why did you change on this yeah so the bill will pass i strongly support it we have to stand by our veterans who've been exposed to these chemicals there was a drafting era a 400 billion dollar drafting error that we that democrats promised republicans would get a vote on an amendment to fix uh they denied us that vote so what we're asking is give us the vote on the amendment let us try try and go after a 400 billion drafting error by the way more than matching claims that this bill will reduce the deficit by so that we can fix that and then move on to helping our veterans uh but to be clear you did vote for it uh in in in its current form yeah yes and i'll vote for its final passage too okay all right senator castillo final passage we appreciate your time coming up

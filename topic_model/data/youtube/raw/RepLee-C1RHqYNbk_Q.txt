hitting a book by President Jimmy Carter his autobiography it's called a full life I had the privilege to attend his Sunday school very recently where he taught Sunday School and I was in the congregation in his Sunday School class it was amazing and after that I went to the schools that he attended and of course it's been turned into a wonderful museum and I purchased his book a full life this man is an incredible human being he's brilliant he continues to be a true moral leader and he was a man really way ahead of his time and his book a full life conveys that very clearly it's well written it's very current actually and it gives a lot of history but it actually tells you who he is as a man as a person who's a believer in God and Christian but how he applies his Christian values in his public life in terms of feeding the hungry and sheltering the homeless and all of the great values that are taught through the Bible

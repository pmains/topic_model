this Biden classified information thing okay you know now we're being told it's become a Dr Seuss book it's on a goat on a boat on a plane with a train what a Corvette yeah this is not good man uh it's not good we got documents on the floor of the garage it's gotten a little crazy um and I you know we kind of laugh at the whole thing but it's so rich because I think the Democrats kind of made a weird bet here because I think they overplayed classified information by rating Mar-A-Lago with the FBI and guns drawn so it's kind of like they're being held to their own standard on some level isn't it kind of funny you know if if equal justice under the law still applies then president bides have a really big problem on his hands and I'm telling you we all saw the images of the FBI standing outside of President of President Trump's home I mean even I heard rumors that some of the FBI agents went through some of the former first ladies how do I put this unmissable okay and my guess is you are not going to see the FBI go to Delaware and and raid the first ladies Bloomers draw foreign of honesty and it's lack of treating everybody fairly is what the American public is absolutely fed up with they absolutely overplayed their hand and then now they got to pay for it I tell you what Jim Jordan is all over them yep so our Judiciary Committee is going to be all over this and they're going to have a very rough year but my dad had a saying he said it's all good and fun until the rap got the gun and now that we have the house and that we have Judiciary I hope they clear out their calendars and get ready for a lot of hearings a lot of explaining that they have to do to the American public it's going to be a busy time in DC

great to see you as always good to see you thanks for having me all right so what do you make of oregon's governor telling residents to call the cops on their neighbors if they see people violating coveted restrictions i mean six people from two different households i don't even know what thanksgiving gathering has that many people you know i have been told that you can have 15 for a funeral so people are starting to say it's a funeral for their turkey so there are ways to get around this but seriously i don't know who elected of this karen you know i mean these busybodies think that they can dictate to us everything we do in our life and how we live our lives nothing in our country nothing in our country's history ever indicated that we would live in a world where one person would dictate are all of our behaviors but even from a practical point of view if you look at the data on this the objective evidence is we've been putting more and more mandates on for the last six months we have now more mandates than we've ever had including these new ones and guess what we have more incidences of covid positive patients than we've ever had so there's no indication really that any of these lockdowns or any of these mandates have slowed this down in fact i think the wall street journal put it best when they said the virus is insidious it's largely spreading regardless of human behavior and really the only thing that's going to slow it down is a vaccine and i think we take our eye off of that prize the vaccine if we keep saying oh just wash your hands and this thing's going to go away guess what it's not going away until we get a vaccine dr tom inglesby the director of the center for health security at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health says this that we're seeing a new spike in cases because people aren't acting with a common purpose like they were back in the spring i want you to listen to this and react unlike the springtime when the country really was acting kind of in with common purpose around march and april at the start of this pandemic and where the virus was located in in comparatively fewer places the epidemic now is surging in almost every state in the country he's got it completely so you nodded your head you you disagree well he has it completely backwards if you look at mass usage in march and april the cdc and everybody the who were still saying maths don't work so nobody was wearing masks in march and april now anywhere between 70 and 90 of the people are wearing masks almost all the time if you go to a store anywhere in kentucky once you enter you're wearing a mask we have nearly full compliance with the masks in kentucky and the cases are exploding there's no evidence that any of these mandates are slowing down the vaccine and when he says things like that what he's telling you is he's ignoring the science he's ignoring the evidence that this virus is exploding exponentially right now but the other thing is there's an aspect to this that is good news we have five times more daily cases than we had in the spring but we have half as many deaths per day so that works out to about an eighty to ninety percent reduction in mortality still means we have a thousand people or more dying a day and that number is rising and that's that's terrible but the good news is if we were having the same death rate we had in the spring we'd be having 10 000 people die a day so we have come a long way therapeutics and the people who are spreading this are in a younger age group the vast majority of them don't even know they're having it so while there is a age group that's really affected it's not every we need to put this all into perspective

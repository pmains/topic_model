AROUND OF THE WORKING CLASS. THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES. BRIAN COME OVER TO YOU. >> Brian: WHILE THEIR PRESIDENTS TALKING TO HIM A LOT OF THE SENATORS WERE WORKING OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. WE'VE BEEN TELLING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS COMING TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN FRAMEWORK FOR A PROPOSED GUN SAFETY BILL THAT INCLUDES FUNDING TO HELP STATES IMPLEMENT RED FLAG LAWS AND SEIZE GUNS FROM THOSE CONSIDERED VIOLENT ALONG WITH MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOL SAFETY AND ENHANCE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR BUYERS UNDER 21. THIS MORE. TEXAS SENATOR JOHN CORNYN WHO IS ONE OF THE CHIEF NEGOTIATORS OF THE DEAL BEFORE GET STARTED. THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR GETTING THIS FAR. MOST PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WE KNOW. IT'S KIND OF BROAD. CAN WE GO OVER A FEW THINGS? >> CERTAINLY. >> Brian: MAJOR FUNDING TO HELP STATES PASS RED FLAG GUN LAWS. WHAT SHOULD WE KNOW? >> WE SHOULD KNOW FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS NO NATIONAL RED FLAG WHERE THESE ARE STATES WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS AND A CONDITION OF THE GRANTS WILL BE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGOROUS DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENT. WE ARE AFTER ALL TALKING ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BUT THE GOAL IS TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. WHICH IS CURRENT LAW. THIS WILL BE I THINK HOPEFULLY OTHER PROGRAMS DESIGNED FOR CRISIS INTERVENTION THAT THEY WOULD ALSO QUALIFY UNDER THIS GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL. >> Brian: FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOL SAFETY. THAT WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL SCHOOL SAFETY EXPERT. WITH EVERY PSYCHOLOGIST DISPATCHED TO THE SCHOOL'S BIG AND SMALL? >> THIS IS GOING TO BE APART FROM INFRASTRUCTURE TO STAFFING FOR SAFETY OFFICERS AND SCHOOLS. WE WANT TO COME UP WITH HIM ON OF BEST PRACTICES TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS. NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO SCHOOL FEARFUL THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SAFE. NO CHILD SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL FEARFUL FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY. THAT IS WHAT THAT IS FOCUSED ON. >> Brian: THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT EVER TALKS ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY BUT IT'S IN THERE. THE BOYFRIEND LUPO. CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT? BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS THIS QUALIFIER CURRENT LAW. IF YOU HAVE ABILITY CONVICTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, YOU CAN'T LEGALLY PURCHASE THE FIREARM UNDER THE EXISTING LAW. THIS WAS EXTENDED TO MR. MEADOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENSES. WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THAT. AS YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A NONTRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP. AND THEY ARE NOT MARRIED, BUT THEY BASICALLY ARE PARTNERS. THIS IS DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO COMMIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND POTENTIALLY WOULD USE FIREARMS IN THAT PROCESS ARE DISCOURAGED FROM DOING SO. >> Brian: YOU'RE NOT MAKING -- YOU CAN BUY UNDER 21. SOME THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THERE. HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES ARE NOT BANNED. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS OR NOT THERE. SAFE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL FIREARMS AND HOUSES WHICH WOULD BE LOGICAL, BUT IS NOT MANDATED PER LICENSE REQUIREMENTS TO PURCHASE ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS. THERE IS NO 21 DAY WAITING PERIOD. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT PRESIDENT WANTED AND DEMOCRATS WANTED. ERIC SCHMID WEIGHED IN PRETTIES IN MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL. >> VERY DANGEROUS ROAD TO GO DOWN. YOU WOULD BE EVISCERATING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT IN THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS ALONG THE WAY. THE RED FLAG LAWS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A GREEN LIGHT FOR GUN CONFISCATION. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE GIVE MORE POWER TO THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE WILLING TO ARREST FOLKS IN THE NAME OF SAFETY IN THE EMERGENCY WERE TAKING THEIR KIDS TO A PLAYGROUND DURING COVID AND LOCKING DOWN BUSINESSES, AND CREATING A MINISTRY OF TRUTH? WHY WOULD WE BELIEVE THAT THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO WEAPONIZE RED FLAG LAWS TO PUNISH THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS? >> Brian: THIS IS A REFRAIN THAT PEOPLE REALLY APPEAR WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE RED FLAG LAWS. YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE HE'S COMING FROM? >> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS READ WHAT WE HAVE WRITTEN. THERE IS NO NATIONAL RED FLAG LAW. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MISSOURI HAS ONE. AND THEY DON'T, THEY WILL NOT BE FORCED TO ADOPT ONE. SOME STATES, RED STATES LIKE FLORIDA AND INDIANA HAVE THEM. THEY SEEM TO BE WORKING RELATIVELY WELL. AGAIN, THERE'S NO NATIONAL REQUIREMENT. AND CERTAINLY, ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FUNDING WILL BE THE SORT OF RIGOROUS DUE PROCESS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CONCERNS HIM. I THINK HE WILL BE COMFORTED BY THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL. STATES THAT DON'T HAVE RED FLAG LAWS WILL NOT BE COMPELLED TO PASS THEM. >> Brian: SENATOR, I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE PLAYING POD. SENATOR MURPHY THE WHOLE TIME DID NOT COME OUT AND SPEAK WHERE YOU DIDN'T COME OUT AND SPEAK AND SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE OTHER DIES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE PROCESS ALONG THE WAY. SITTING WITH JIMMY KIMMEL TALKING ON THE TARMAC. HAS IT BEEN HARD OVERCOMING  THAT? >> NO, WE JUST PUT OUR HEADS DOWN AND WORK TOGETHER. SENATOR MURPHY AND I COME FROM VERY DIFFERENT PLACES. HE'S FROM CONNECTICUT, BLUE STATE. I'M FROM TEXAS, RED STATE WHERE GUNS ARE COMMON IN PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO USE THEM RESPONSIBLY. BUT WE HAVE DONE IS TRY TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND ON THINGS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS WE PASSED IN 2018. THE BILL THAT AROSE OUT OF THE SHOOTING WHEN THE AIR FORCE FAILED TO UPHOLD FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTIONS INTO THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SYSTEM. THE SHOOTER WAS ABLE TO LIE AND BUY A FIREARM AND KILL A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN A LITTLE BAPTIST CHURCH OUTSIDE OF SAN ANTONIO. SO WE FOUND A WAY TO COME UP WITH GOOD POLICIES ENFORCING THE CURRENT LAW. IN RESPECT OF THE RIGHT -- THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. >> Brian: WHEN YOU THINK TWO WEEKS TO COMPLETE? >> MY GOAL IS TO GET THE TEXT ON THIS WEEK AND GET ON THE FLOOR NEXT WEEK. I TALKED TO SENATOR SCHUMER THIS MORNING. HE'S GOOD WITH THAT. WE ARE GRINDING AWAY. >> Brian: IMPRESSIVE SO FAR. SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL IS IN SUPPORT OF WHAT WE READ. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. I APPRECIATE IT

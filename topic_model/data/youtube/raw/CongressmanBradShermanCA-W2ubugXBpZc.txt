we are back with California Democrat Brad Sherman here to talk about the history unfolding on the floor this week Congressman what's it been like to witness this is it a good thing that Americans can see the process playing out and and they're paying attention it's always good for people to be paying attention it's always good for people to see but what they're seeing is a kind of an ugly picture but not as important as what will follow after uh this is all over I mean Democrats are learning the word schadenfreude some of us can even spell it uh it it is the best thing would be to be in the majority the second best thing is to watch this total disarray of the Republicans but what matters is not is it Kevin is it Steve is it this how many votes what's going to happen to the American people this year are we going to shut down the government are we going to default on our debt those are the two things that the crazies can create and we've got to stop them why do you say that I mean what is it that they are asking for that you think would lead to what you're talking about what the specifics they're asking for I mean the idea of vacating the chair with one person raising the vote that's a gift to Democrats because if there's a vote on vacating the chair and it's just one person well that's just one person delaying the body but if it's 20 or 30 or 50 of them well then Kevin's going to lose his speakership if we don't if if Democrats vote to to vacate the chair we think and you would not necessarily um I think by tradition uh we are going to vote for our nominee for speaker again and again again there could be a departure from that but it's unlikely but a vote to vacate the chair oh there's no particular tradition on that sometimes you vote this way sometimes you vote that way and I look forward to Kevin asking for my vote on something like that and if the crazies want to put Kevin in that position or scalise or whoever it is um anything that empowers Democrats is a good idea there have been talks this week that Republicans whether it's Kevin McCarthy or others have been Reaching Across the aisle to Democrats to strike some sort of deal on this speaker vote are those negotiations are those conversations happening um banter is happening the thing is in the old days there used to be an overlap between Democrats and Republicans the most liberal Republican was more you know overlapped with the most conservative that's gone these are two very separate bodies and if the people are saying well why don't we just uh you know why doesn't Kevin just reach out to some conservative Democrats and pick up five or six votes once he picks up five or six Democratic votes he loses the under 20 Republican votes so uh if he wants to cut a deal he can't try to pick up five or ten of us uh and we're so United he can't pick off five or ten of us he's got to cut a deal with leadership but what I hope happens and I don't think this uh is a Kevin McCarthy that's cut a deal with Democrats rather than a Kevin McCarthy who has kind of deal with the craziest numbers because what matters here is is not party power what matters here is policy and if he puts the crazies in a position to stop him or to not allow Congress to vote on increasing the debt limit we could put the world into a major recession just because of the craziness going on the floor right now it's just entertaining is it fair to call them crazy it's uh uh I I it's it's shorthand uh they are they are taking positions uh that are extreme in terms of public policy uh now how many of them should sit on the rules committee and how many of them should be on the Republican steering committee boy I don't care um but what matters is are they going to say we're going to play a game of chicken on whether the United States defaults on the debt with the goal of forcing diminutions and Social Security benefits uh crazy is a is a polite term for risking the economy of the United States in an effort to destroy Social Security or undermine it one of the customers coming for is open rule on uh bills that come to the floor budget bills they want to be able to offer amendments is that a good idea would you would you appreciate that that's that's fine uh especially if it's put in a position where any member not just a republican member can bring up uh you know I I've always liked to open rules especially when I'm in the minority so um uh but ultimately uh you know look the Republican majority is going to do 40 hearings on Hunter Biden's laptop they're going to do 40 crazy messaging bills that Chuck Schumer is going to throw away all that's going to drive C-SPAN ratings no you don't have ratings but um uh but what matters is can we just get through this year well you need to pass an agricultural Bill we need a couple of bills and the key thing is don't shut down the government don't dishonor the dead and don't put us in a position where you're trying to force Democrats to accept Cuts in Social Security Robert Costa CBS news reporting this a quote from Kevin McCarthy entering the capitol today we're going to make progress we're going to shock you when asked about whether the framework of the deal the leadership presents at 10 15 will be enough to end the impasse and when pressed on whether he can get there today he promises progress uh they're 20. the 20 anti-mccarthy plus one uh uh Victoria is a a present vote have been very solid 11 votes uh I Kevin thinks he can pick off half of those and uh if he can that puts a lot more pressure on the remaining what's interesting is Donald Trump has no power my God he couldn't deliver one vote to Kevin McCarthy I mean any Democrat could deliver one vote to Kevin McCarthy we're not going to do it but uh he couldn't deliver one he's got baller he's being criticized on the floor of the house by Republicans um hopefully we've seen the end of Donald Trump let's go to Christopher who's in California Democratic caller is it Nevada Nevada California Nevada okay thank you go ahead you're up early yes I am um well I think the host got it right first of all your tone and your adjectives your personal attacks to the people that are up into Congress right now is not right you shouldn't say it on live television you should say that for the closed door sessions when it's just you and the other Representatives second I think you got it all wrong Democrats have the power right now um you said you need 20 or 30 people um you guys could be extending the Olive Branch to someone that's being attacked by their own party and you could set a president for the country right now that we can be bipartisan I mean if Democrats really think that they're going to get the house speakers should it's just not going to happen not right now Congressman we're we're not going to get a democrat-elected speaker uh nor have uh have we really floated that as a likely outcome uh I have been leaning forward on the idea of what Kevin McCarthy could propose it to our leadership uh that uh that would be useful for the country and those are two things first allow the Democratic leader to bring to the floor when necessary a bill to raise the debt limit a clean bill nothing else in it if such a bill were brought and it were really necessary it would pass the house the problem we have is if McCarthy sells his he puts himself in a position where either for his own desire or the desire of the most extreme in his caucus he refuses to bring up a clean debt increase a limit Bill we've got a problem the second thing we have to invest in the Democratic leader is the right to bring up a clean continuing resolution so when we get to October 1st or September 30th if we don't have the Appropriations bills we don't shut down the government right now the Republicans have those two strangleholds on America they can block a debt a limit increase they can shut down the government on October 1st and by God if the Republican majority in the house can do it there are some in that Republican majority who want to do it sometimes Kevin sometimes not another call from California Ron is a republican San Clemente go ahead so much Critter for taking a call and congressman Brad Sherman one of the writer people in the in the Congress uh always a great pleasure to ask you a few important questions Uh Kevin McCarthy is uh it flawed Goods to begin with and candid Goods secondarily so the question we have here is if you go to an open rule where everybody can add earmarks they can add you know questions about uh additional uh amendments to uh something that's going to clog the system up so badly that absolutely nothing gets done Senator hayakawa years and years and go used to fall asleep in the Senate because he said it was too boring because that's what would happen constantly so my question to you is it may be a benefit and a benefit for the Democrats to have an open rule but isn't it a net deficit for the Republicans I think that it it is a it it certainly weakens the speaker and the Republican leadership to have an open Rule and it's even better of course if it's open and should be to both Democrats and Republicans and so I I it empowers individual members and it makes for longer sessions um as to gumming up the system uh there are a very few things that are good that Congress is going to do uh in the next year we will hopefully as I keep going back to not you know raise the debt limit where we need to and keep the government open other than that they're just a couple of bills and then there's a whole list of bad things the House of Representatives might do and if we're too busy to do them that's a net plus Dan in Eagle Point Oregon independent the healthy exercise in the American system of government this is the way the the founders designed it it wasn't about necessarily about Unity it wasn't about going along to get along it was to protect the people they we needed a real spirited debate in order to hammer out these issues and not just go along with their with the status quo so I think it's a very very healthy thing going on right now even though it's it seems chaotic but really that's the way the American system is set up let's get a response to that congressman well I'd rather have a healthy debate on what should be the transportation policy uh healthy debate on what should be the tax policy a healthy debate on uh you know whether Donald Trump should be nominated as Speaker of the House of Representatives uh I think it's it's it's I I'm all for healthy debates and I it is uh good to spend time where we're all in person listening rather than on C-Span back in our offices uh what we're supposed to be debating uh this week is the Republican effort to stripped out the uh the IRS and uh the uh what we've seen is that the number of IRS employees per tax return um uh that's filed has almost doubled and the Democrats last year are able to pass the bill to return our staffing levels at the IRS to where it was under Ronald Reagan so I tell my Republican colleagues stand up for Ronald Reagan and and support this but you got to understand that every time a a billionaire successfully cheats on his taxes a member of the freedom of caucus earns his wings or pitchfork so uh they are they're in favor of disempowering the IRS preventing you know and all these all the new Auditors under this program are going to be auditing people with incomes of over four hundred thousand dollars you look at the Donald Trump tax return and you see example of after example of uh tricks that are used I'm the only Democratic CPA in Congress and they're all there and most of them would many of them are should be subject to audit and the IRS assigned one auditor to Donald Trump's entire Empire the IRS needs to be adequately staffed maybe in ordinary people really can't cheat on their taxes I don't think they would but they get a W-2 form they get their 1099s from their bank accounts and that's it whereas people in a Donald Trump economic position if they're not effectively audited you end up with them paying no taxes this is supposed to to be the next business the next piece of the first piece of legislation is this dealing with these 87 000 new tax agents well and a lot of them are devoted to service you know I remember I'm an old CPA I remember when you could call the 800 number and somebody would answer uh we need to return to that we need to put the service back into the Internal Revenue Service and we need uh the Staffing levels per tax return to be back to uh one uh one employee for every 2 000 returns so what has been the uh what have been some of the rumors about these new tax agents that you want to clarify well the idea that they'll be armed is absurd there are a very few Internal Revenue Service folks that are are armed there are little police forces and so many of our our federal agencies but that's that's eight out of eighty seven thousand second a lot of this is to so is not an increase it's to replace people people that are retiring I think a huge percentage of IRS employees are retiring over the next 10 years but the big thing is you're not going to see additional audits of wage earning Americans you're going to see additional audits of those with complicated structures and that's what annoys the Republicans because they think it's they're almost rooting for the tax sheet they want to disempower the federal government they're rooting against the IRS they want to defund the IRS and if you defund the IRS you don't have any money to avoid defunding the police the one goes with the other Catherine's a democratic caller in Burlington New Jersey hi Catherine he actually Greta uh this is Catherine from Burlington and I representative Sherman I'd like to ask you at what point would the Democrats consider helping the uh Republicans get across this stalemate that they have here so you can get on with the business of doing our work and happy New Year well Happy New Year uh first it would require Kevin indicating that he'd like to talk and if that became public that would cost him support in the Republican caucus um so if that ever became public he'd be betting his chances on being able to cut a deal uh second instead of empowering the most extreme right wing the folks that are so far to the right they won't even follow Donald Trump uh their trumpier than Donald um it would need to be concessions the traditional concessions you look for are how many Democrats versus how many Republicans are on each committee the committee ratios and uh Staffing because if we just follow tradition Democrats uh the Democratic committee staffs will only be half as large as those of the Republicans well heck we're 48 percent of the Congress maybe we should be 45 percent of the staff on each committee but the big things are this the right to bring a bill to the floor and usually that's best in the rules committee which the majority party completely controls but there are certain bills and certain actions that could be brought up by certain members of the minority or other and it the the key thing is a clean debt limit increase a clean continuing resolution those Powers need to be in Hakeem Jeffrey's hands so um we can't begin negotiations with a guy who's made it very plain that he doesn't want to negotiate But ultimately while schadenfreude watching the other side in disarray is frankly great politics for us and there is a certain uh hidden Joy maybe not so hidden Joy but as much as we like to see the um the other party in disarray what matters is what happens this year to the American people and we've got to prevent uh defaults and shutdowns Mary's in Wisconsin a Republican primary hi good morning good morning um I just want you the Republicans have not been in charge of the representatives the the house and in regards to the covet vaccine they had done a study in the European league for the athletes and before the vaccine there were 29 heart attacks in athletes after the vaccine was instituted 1500. have had heart attacks and two-thirds of them have died and if you guys were in charge you should probably pursue the idea that it's not misinformation and that the vaccine it has affected people's lives and that's a little bit more important than um going into a recession which you said probably would happen if the Republicans continue on discussing what they want to do for their future okay Mary Congressman I'm certainly not aware of that study I strongly recommend the vaccines we lost a million Americans to this disease we would have lost double triple and we'd still be losing at the same at a very high rate uh if if it wasn't for the vaccines and even if you reach herd immunity without a vaccine this virus mutates and if we don't have effective vaccines and updated vaccines this covet is going to be killing lots of Americans for a lot of years barbers in Kansas Democratic caller I want to say I am a Democrat but I think we need both parties and I you know support Liz Cheney I think we're missing the boat I think she would get enough Democrats to follow her to get a consensus uh and uh I I would like to have Liz Cheney as Speaker as compared to any other reasonable alternative at this time I do not know a single Republican member of the house and I guess none of us are actually members we're all members elect right I don't know anybody with a green pin uh who's a republican who would vote for Liz Cheney so the pin is new yes and that is the pin that you will wear even after you're sworn in correct the same pin and uh you're allowed to wear pins from prior congresses as well they all work for security purposes I own more pins than suits so I just leave a pin on every suit and and that brings up a good point you have been serving for for many years in the U.S Congress one of the concessions that these 20 Republicans are looking for is term limits I assume you are opposed to term limits we have term limits it's a two-year term then you go to the voters of the 32nd congressional district they know I've been there a long time some of them think that's a good thing some think it's a bad thing if the 32nd District wants to elect me who in the hell are these guys from other states to tell the 32nd District who they're going to vote for but that's the kind of we're going to have 40 messaging bills passed this year such we might pass that one that's an example actually of how their um the the 20 Republicans are kind of helping Democrats uh we'll have a vote on perhaps we'll have a vote on a constitutional amendment uh to Institute term limits I don't think it gets two-thirds in the house maybe whatever it is it goes over the Senate you know Chuck Schumer's got a big enough budget over there where he has a shredding machine a really good one and there it goes in so we'll have messaging bills like that but that may be a bill that's hard for some Republicans to vote on um especially if they've served more than three terms uh and uh so what McCarthy's doing is not diminishing heartburn for Democrats he's diminishing If he if he prevents a vote on that bill at least diminishing heart bill or heartburn for Republicans so uh yes indeed bring up bills that uh split the Republican caucus and cause some of them to vote this way and some to vote that way and many of them to feel a dilemma oh my God if I vote this way I'm going to look bad in the general election if I vote that way I'm going to look bad in the primary and they and bills that are that far over on the Spectrum are very easy for Democrats term limits is a little different but uh but on so many of these bills you know bring up a bill that that reduces Social Security I'll vote I'll vote against it in a few of of uh a few of them are going to have heartburn as to what do I'm not going to have any heartburn I don't need my staff to write me a memo but I don't want to cut Social Security we're talking with Congressman Brad Sherman first elected in 1996. we'll go to Jeff next Who's in Kansas City Missouri Republican yes hi good morning good morning um you know yeah one thing that really uh was standing out with you know some folks being upset about the amount of rounds the 12 and unprecedented and you know we're looking at the numbers and then these these 20 folks that are pushing back um you know when I look at the numbers I went back to 2000 our debt was five trillion dollars at the end of this year we're going to be at 33 trillion dollars you want to look at some numbers these are numbers I'm surprised there's not more than the 20 pushing back 50 percent of our oil Reserve has been drained inflation is running Sky High I want to look at those numbers yes and we've got good numbers and bad numbers today's employment numbers were good those food prices are are bad we are refilling the Strategic oil uh uh strategic petroleum Reserve now that debt limit is is certainly concerning efforts to prevent us from having an effective Internal Revenue Service and in effect make taxes almost voluntary for the billionaire class uh it would obviously increase that deficit going forward from uh from here forward so those are the important issues we need to deal with uh much as uh as a Democrat it's always nice to see the Republicans in disarray raised in Napa California Democratic caller good morning good morning I'd like to talk to you yes I'm here hello we're listening Ray so I'm right here hello Ray you have to listen and talk please listen and talk through your phone hello hello all right you gotta I'm gonna move on you've got to listen and talk through your phone mute your television please Christina in Shippensburg Pennsylvania independent good morning um sorry I'm not a good speaker so I have three things um one I'm tired I I walked away from politics when the whole Trump uh crap started happening um but the name calling it's very irritating for a lot of us um The Crazies the hijacking the held hostage I mean it's so irritating to hear this those 20 people are actually representing they're doing what they're supposed to be doing they are representing the people and you know not all of us feel this way but they're doing their job and um my third thing I'm not familiar with all the roles and everything how far is it going to go until McCarthy actually steps down and somebody else replaces him okay we'll take that Christina Congressman well the record is 133 votes all of the records about dysfunction were set right before the Civil War and um people say we're more divided more dysfunctional look you look back at the 1850s and it was worse of course that was followed by a Civil War I don't think they were I wouldn't draw any too many analogies between now and then uh as to how long this goes on um 133 votes uh is is the record and uh Kevin McCarthy's already said that he's broken the record for how long a speech he has been given on the floor of the house and uh maybe he'll break this record too records are made to be broken the thing is that if he steps aside it's possible that the 20 who voted against him will vote for scalise just because well they've got a head to put on the wall they haven't actually gotten anything substance they've wanted maybe scalise is a little bit more to their liking uh but um they won't get the the rules changes that they're pushing for uh but they'll they'll be able to say we won and sometimes uh politicians even if they haven't actually done anything to affect public policy or we'll uh bask in in what they call a victory uh I I don't know if there's McCarthy makes the point that he's got more Republican support than anyone else and that there's nobody else that can put together even 200 votes let alone the 217 218 that he needs so um uh I don't know when this ends I'm frankly hoping that it ends with a speaker who's cut a deal with Democrats rather than a speaker who's cut a deal with the folks in Congress that I disagree with most um and so for me this is not about how many uh messaging bills they pass and automatic how many honor Biden hearings we have it's all about the two points I keep coming back to do we shut down the government do we dishonor our debt and if uh if we can come out of this knowing that that isn't going to happen this year a Democrats achieve a lot House Republicans are holding a conference call this morning around 10 15 a.m Eastern Time to walk their members through this emerging deal that came about yesterday with the 20 defectors we will learn more as the morning goes on the house will reconvene at noon eastern time you can watch live here gobble the gavel coverage at noon eastern time here on C-Span on our website c-span.org or if you cannot be near television you don't have to miss a minute you can download the free video mobile app C-SPAN now Ron in New York Democratic caller you're next for the congressman yes thank you I'm so glad to be honest um these Republican nuts want Democrats to help them now that they need help but they didn't want to help us when we needed help when we were in control they wanted to block everything so the caller that called from California that said that they shouldn't be caught nuts you know he he needs to um rethink that because they are nuts um they complain about um immigrants you know like they're they're saying things like oh yeah you know we're going to build the wall I mean not build the wall we're gonna um stop um illegal immigration Trump ran on building a wall and having Mexico paid for it for his entire um presidency and and and and and what happened they had control of Congress um the presidency and they couldn't get that done they can't get anything done they call the Democrats a do-nothing Democrats when they are actually the ones that do nothing you know so they like to put a spin on everything and Fox News they sit there and watch that all day and all they do is tell lies spread lies spread misinformation and they don't answer questions when you ask them a question they they don't answer it they they they deflect okay I'm gonna jump in Ron so we can get a response from the congressman okay first I want to point out that a 10 o'clock Democrats are on the steps of the Capitol uh commemorating January 6th and uh that's a day that we'll live in infamy uh it's a day when there was an attempt to deprive America of democracy and to substitute uh Mob Rule and to prevent the peaceful transition to power and it's a day that that we need to remember as to the uh caller's uh comments um people say they they don't like do nothing Republicans I prefer do nothing Republicans to most of the things they want to do um and I don't think Democrats are at all interested in helping Republicans but we are interested in helping the American people and is there a piece of legislation like the infrastructure bill that you think Republicans and Democrats could agree on in the house this over the next two years uh I think we'll pass an agriculture Bill I'm not an expert on agriculture uh they tell me there may be a little if you improvements uh in our agricultural policy that frankly from an urban District I wouldn't necessarily focus on other nutrition programs are in that bill too but uh I would say that the policies adopted by last Congress when you had a democratic majority kind of a democratic majority in the Senate are policies I'd rather keep in place rather than policies that uh Kevin McCarthy and scalise and those to their right would adopt so a a a do-nothing republican Congress is like the best Republican Congress I can think of but doing nothing means don't dishonor our debt don't shut down the government don't do those things Brad Sherman thank you as always for the conversation thank you

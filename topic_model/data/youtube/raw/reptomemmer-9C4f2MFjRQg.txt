Minnesota Republican congressman and House Majority Whip Tom emmer joins us now Congressman good to have you thanks for joining us Good To Be With You Nora what issues can Republicans find common ground on with the president well I think we're we saw some of it last week right by President Biden and Kevin McCarthy sat down last Wednesday I had a beginning of a conversation that hopefully is going to lead to some very fruitful results for the American people not for Republicans Or democrats but literally for the American people that are counting on Congress to start getting some things done what will it take for Congress to lift the debt ceiling I actually I think it's pretty safe to say that we're going to be making sure that the U.S honors uh its debt obligations but at the same time we got to have a reasonable talk about what we're going to do going forward in terms of the spending issues how are we going to put this country on a better path to sustainability and prosperity for not just the current generation but generations of Americans to come Nora you can't sustain bringing in every dollar we bring in we're spending 1.29 that just doesn't work so we're going to have a conversation I think the president and Kevin McCarthy started this thing it's the responsible thing to do it's uh the reasonable thing to do and I think the more sensible we all are the better results we're going to get Congress member bring in John Dickerson here we've got the All-Star panel of smart people here at CBS News I want to ask you a question so but they're starting with me anyway Congressman when Republicans came into control uh I remember in the 90s uh John Kasich when he took over the budget uh he had had specific spending items he wanted cut used it as a way to talk about Republican priorities that specificity certainly Paul Ryan was making budgets even before he became chairman of the budget Committee in this instance what specific spending cuts would you or Republicans put forward as a way of saying this is what we believe and this is why government needs to be shrunk not just in the abstract but in specific terms yeah John if you think about this uh by law President Biden was supposed to provide a budget to Congress this past Monday the first Monday in February the president is supposed to put a budget out and then by law the Congress then has six uh six weeks from the date that they received that budget to put up a response so we're talking about spending reforms we're talking about uh some general terms right now the idea is you are going to take care of the debt setting but at the same time you're going to put this country on a more sustainable path uh in terms of paying our debt obligations and making sure that we preserve opportunities for all Americans in years to come uh with Banner it's it's Margaret Brennan good to talk to you sir um when you look at some of those promises that were made to some of the more conservative members of your caucus uh as we were looking at the election of speaker McCarthy there were specifics in there like capping spending levels at 2022 levels are those things actually up for negotiation or are there going to be hard cuts to things like defense spending yeah first off Margaret Republicans aren't going to cut defense we're going to make sure that our people that wear the uniform get the tools that they need to do the mission that they're going to be asked to do in in the coming weeks months and years in the meantime I your characterization of caps is not correct there was a discussion about returning in particular with the domestic spending that has taken place since the pandemic started it's just bloated these programs beyond recognition the idea was to try and take that back to an FY fiscal year 22 Baseline and work from there uh and by the way uh the the agreement that was made was a was a caucus wide or conference-wide agreement that Kevin McCarthy agreed to single subject matter bills making sure that amendments are germane to the bill making sure that the Holmen rule is is back in place which allows for allows for line item vetoes and appropriation bills and an easy one for Americans to understand a 72-hour rule rule I think most Americans would agree those of us that have election certificates should read the darn bills before we vote on them simple things like that that really haven't been honored in the last few years that's what the agreement was

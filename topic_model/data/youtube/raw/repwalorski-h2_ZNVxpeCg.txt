KEY, UM. CONGRESSWOMAN I KNOW THAT THIS MAY BE YOUR POLITICAL POSITION WE DON'T WANT TO BE NAIVE ABOUT IT AND ACTUALLY THINK THAT NANCY PELOSI IS GOING TO COME BACK TO TOWN NUMBER ONE EARLY OR EVEN IF SHE DOES TO SAY, OKAY, WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA. KICK HIM OUT OF OFFICE SO WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS? YEAH, YOU KNOW, LET ME TELL YOU THIS IS SO FAR REMOVED FROM POLITICS THIS IS A DEVASTATION THAT WE'RE WATCHING IN THIS COUNTRY AND AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS YOU KNOW, OF COURSE I'M GETTING CALLS ALL OVER MY DISTRICT AND IF WE ALL ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY DO SOMETHING. YOU KNOW THAT THIS COMMANDER IN CHIEF CAN NO LONGER BE TRUSTED AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, HISTORY IS REPORTING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HERE I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO BE ON THE RECORD WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS BACK AT THIS AND SAYS WHERE WERE THESE LAWMAKERS WIN? THIS HAPPENED? I WANT HISTORY TO KNOW I WANT MY DISTRICT AND NO AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO NO. I DO NOT APPROVE THIS I DO NOT THINK THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS MEANT TO BE ABLE TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY OUT OF THIS DISASTER AND I THINK HE NEEDS TO RESIGN AND I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING POLES AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW THEY ARE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DEVASTATED. THEY'RE TRYING TO WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND THEIR MINDS TO FIGHT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT IS HE DOING WE JUST LOST THE BLOOD OF OUR MARINES AND OUR ENLISTED YESTERDAY AND WE'RE WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT ON T V. I MEAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK IT'S I THINK WE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH WE NEED TO BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY AND WE NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF A PRESIDENT WHEN HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING TO GIVE US OUT OF A SITUATION WHAT HE'S DONE IS OPENED UP A NEW TERRORIST HOTBED. THE WORLD IS NOT SAFER AND WHAT HE'S DONE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THE UNITED STATES IS CERTAINLY NOT SAY FOR WHAT HE'S DONE THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO PLAN AS TO HOW TO GET US OUT AND WE ARE SECRETARY PANETTA TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND FIGHT THIS IS A DISASTER IT'S A MESS, AND I LIKE I LAY IT SQUARELY AT THE FEET OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. CONGRESSWOMAN MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME THAT LEADERS IN THE MILITARY AS WELL ARE ASKING FOR THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET AND THE VICE PRESIDENT TO MEET AND DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS FIT TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE FIT MENTALLY TO MAKE THE DECISIONS AND REPRESENT THE COUNTRY AND THE WAY THAT HE NEEDS TO. YOU MENTIONED WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER AUGUST 31ST AND WE HEARD JEN PSAKI JUST SAY EARLIER THAT THAT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND. COOPERATION OF THE TALIBAN TO GET ANYONE ELSE OUT THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF AFGHANISTAN AND KABUL. SPECIFICALLY WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING? HAVEN'T HEARD OF. I'VE HEARD A WHOLE LOT FROM DEMOCRATS BUT I WILL TEN WE'RE WATCHING THIS ON TV LIFE WITH ALL OF YOU, AND WE'RE SEEING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE COMMAND EDITOR IN CHIEF TALKING ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH THE TALIBAN FOR THOSE OF US THAT WERE ALIVE WHEN WE SAW AL QAIDA ATTACKED NEW YORK AND THE DEVASTATION OF 9 11, I REALIZED IT WAS ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO. BUT TALKING ABOUT MAKING HUGE MISTAKES THAT'S ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF OUR MILITARY OUR PEOPLE AND A WHOLE NEW BATTLEGROUND IN THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT GOING TO THE TALIBAN FOR MERCY GOING TO THE TALIBAN FOR DEFENSE AND FOR HELP THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AND I THINK THAT DEMOCRATS NEED TO STAND BY REPUBLICANS I THINK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY WE NEED TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT. THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE EVERYBODY'S FOCUS SHOULD BE AND GETTING EVERY AMERICAN AND EVERY ONE OF OUR ALLIES OUT OF THERE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I THINK HEATHER HAVE TO HOLD THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S OUR JOB AND I THINK WE'RE JUST DOING OUR JOB BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING THE PRIZE FROM OUR FELLOW AMERICANS WHO WANT HIM TO DO THE JOB OF GETTING US OUT OF THIS DISASTER. YOU KNOW, UM A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICES AREN'T HEARD IN WASHINGTON THEIR VOICES AREN'T HEARD IN THE MEGA MEGA METROPOLIS IS LIKE NEW YORK. YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE HEARTLAND IN INDIANA. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL THEM INSIDE THE BELTWAY THAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY RELATED TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN AFGHANISTAN.

thank you very much senator thanks to all of you for being here um i'm just going to talk on one topic briefly and ask each of the three of you up for for the tva to to respond to it as you know congress over the years and the decades has committed lots of dollars to to broadband build up particularly in underserved and unserved areas in fact in the last in this infrastructure bill the bipartisan infrastructure act we added i think 65 billion just to that to try and again make sure that every rural community in america has good libraries good access to education commerce medicine um we just need to have that that final mile filled in wherever at all possible so i've heard some rumblings and i'm going to confess right up front to me that's what they are at this point but i want to do a little discovery for you all or want you all do a little discovery for me and maybe maybe answer this question um i've heard reports that that some of the tva local power companies have delayed or inhibited broadband build out by restricting or significantly um raising the cost of access to their utility poles now i you know my six years on the energy income or four years on the energy and commerce committee over in the house this was an ongoing discussion it's become more of a discussion obviously tva like a lot of utilities have um shall we say beachfront property and um and access for for this infrastructure to to uh the polls would be great so really there's only the only way to do the type of have the type of reliable high-speed uh internet and educational economic health as i said opportunities is with with high-speed broadband so through its authority over the local the local companies and it's in your distribution contracts you have you would have authority to require the lpcs to offer timely cost effective poll access so my understanding is tva has been reluctant to exercise that authority i understand that but um i just want to know if if confirmed will each of you commit to quickly examining the poll access issue further and ensuring that tva is doing everything in its power to advance federal broadband deployment priorities on the to benefit obviously the entire country but especially the communities under your jurisdiction so we'll start with you ms gear yes sir thank you senator um i absolutely commit to to looking into it further and if confirmed to learning more i share your concern about broadband after moving back to uh tennessee to my rural hometown about 15 years ago i had dial-up so i'm totally with you um and i do believe that broadband is almost a basic necessity for most folks now uh both in their personal and private life so yes sir and i do believe again i don't know the specifics just yet but that tva tva is playing an important part as a convener amongst the appropriate parties to make sure that broadband is uh that people have access to broadband in the tva service area thank you thank you thank you senator the tva act does not address broadband act um mandates that tva provide electricity however i'm certainly not opposed to working with our local power companies in my opinion i believe that would be the the best avenue to address broadband sure and i say that it just so happened that i worked at the electric power board of chattanooga a distributor of tva we have we had the first mark grid installed in the united states in chattanooga sure so i know it can be done yeah well there you make an important point about the leadership role that your utilities at every level play the smaller the community the bigger the role right in facilitating what you're talking about but i would just add that tva maybe not have that charge in their act but they do have as part of their mission statement um the advancement of economic and social well-being of the community yeah so i think it would certainly i agree with that and if if confirmed i will tva working with the local power companies to install broadband throughout the seven state region uh up to and including the rural areas that that we have in the tennessee valley thank you ms moore you have four seconds but i'll bet the chairman would be ben yes absolutely and thank you very much thank you thank you by the way by the way it worked no and

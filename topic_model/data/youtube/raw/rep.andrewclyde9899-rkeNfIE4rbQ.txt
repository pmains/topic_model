Congressman good to see you thanks for being with us tonight Sean it's good to be on thank you for uh asking me you bet of course you're always welcome let me ask you what was it that got you on board well you know um yeah it was never personal with me it's not about personalities it's about uh fixing a broken Washington DC I think we can all agree that Washington DC has been broken and been broken for a long time so when we get fundamental significant changes institutional changes in the way Congress operates then that's a win not just for us as members but it's a win for the American people and that's what we were fighting for and I wasn't going to give in until we got those changes and I'm really excited that we got them um and so that's why I switched my vote because uh you know I'm okay with Kevin McCarthy being speaker as long as we have the conservative guard rails in place that can keep the speaker accountable to the American people that's what's important Okay so sir he needs some combination of of those final six he needs a couple of them to either vote present or some of them to get their votes of the final six is it you said it wasn't personal for you is it personal for them well you know I'm not sure I cannot speak for them um you can see what some of the speeches were on the house floor so I'll let you make your own judgment there um but uh but I don't think it should be personal in any way shape or form uh but I will tell you that uh you know if some of them just don't want to vote for Kevin McCarthy but yet they are willing to vote present I think that gets him there and that lets us get on with the the business of uh of the people's house so I asked this to your colleague Kat kamek I don't understand so many of these things that you guys got at least the stuff that I've read seems unbelievably common sense right it's it's good for uh frankly it's good for America why was it so hard welcome to Congress uh Sean there's a lot of stuff in Congress that doesn't make sense I'm a businessman I come from a place that makes sense um and so I'd bring my experience to as a as a businessman to Washington DC and go hey this place is broken this place needs to make sense and so we're gonna you know we fought for those things that are just logical in my mind like being able to read a bill 72 hours before it's actually uh you know introduced on the floor that would prevent someone a speaker like Nancy Pelosi from bringing an Omnibus to the floor and gives us less than 24 hours to read a 4 000 page bill that's just insanity and that's why people think Washington is broken things like being able to um uh you know to to have regular order which means a bill has to go through a committee process so we all get to read it and debate it before it goes to the house Lord that's common sense so I and I I agree with you as I said a moment ago it's like Schoolhouse Rock is there any other provision in that list that you think the viewers should know about that makes that you would want them to know or the People Back Home In Georgia oh sure there is like for example the fiscal year um uh 24 budget the next budget that we can actually um work on is now for discretionary the discretionary part of that budget is capped at fiscal year 22 levels that means that we're not going to be growing the budget we're going to be cutting the budget and that is so important because we need to be fiscally responsible and then the Appropriations the part that actually appropriates the money um act has to agree with the budget itself that hasn't happened Sean in a long time it's like they ignore a budget but now they have to abide by a budget and we have to have a budget that is so important okay well Congressman uh congratulations good job uh big win for the American people thank you thank you thank you

let me turn now to both Frank and Chris because i wanted a decision critical infrastructure protection we look at utilities and we look at my physical trait we look at oil and gas need to keep in mind all of these infrastructures were originally built one of those security is a priority concern from cyber perspective they credibly depended on wireless in credit analyst cos theta supervisory control and data acquisition there is as a result creates tremendous opportunity and concern for a sophisticated phone on so sophisticated that necessary to penetrate these very very vinyl utility infrastructure so that here first from my crystal turned Franco from the commercial world how you look at dealing with this issue and if you will the challenge of holding on security at the fact of these infrastructures as opposed to baking it in first of all totally she goes if you touched on a good point we are definitely vape airboat holding on security in some areas of our system just by the nature and let me see major systems are out there is always harder to retrofit security or on these systems and really do a complete cyber overhaul on systems on defensive put it in personnel security programs physical security measures that that they can cumbersome very manual process but that is that chrome very positive derivative you know but informal Honda we are subject to nine good was really helped us identify critical assets are fatter acids that are essential Bob raises her glasses included a comprehensive framework a cover cyber-physical and personnel security to protect those passionate it has a BDSM instead challenge but we're learning worship amongst appeared here and taking less important from the federal government on some challenges a bed early on with her fists on taking these guys applying that in our program so that's kind of where we're at is a company right now have been a challenge Frank it's like instead of that there's elements first it is old man wasn't really designed to do today and ultimately to sort of retrofit security and something that wasn't designed security line as we look at that problem space there are two key elements one is the criticality of chioma's in there in how we identify criticality second we have this notion in many of the film life of a bachelor whispers so in the simplest of terms over being the firm has some type of price for associated i right please let me say my credit rating this to me to go and get a home loan is X we can talk about driver insurance from an Acura basis as a person to be based we understand constructs of 117 / Mustang is going to do right we've got I'm non-prorated that's a couple examples so if we used acura based risk of looking infrastructure systems from the evaluation perspective in terms of likelihood compromise and then look at criticality of the systems we know we don't have eluded budget but what we can do is assign prior patrols that we have in place and how the next row into a noose that controls the lesson

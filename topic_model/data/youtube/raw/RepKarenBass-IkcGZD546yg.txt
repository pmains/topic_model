let me bring a Democratic congresswoman Karen bass now again congressman bass is a member of the House Judiciary Committee also with me Hans Nichols at the White House our justice correspondent Pete Williams former federal prosecutors at gleaned that kerchner and Cynthia Oxley both their MSNBC a legal analyst congresswoman let me start with you and we'll start I guess at the end of what we heard there from Senator Graham that advice to members of your party pursue what you think is important but at some point the public might become concerned that you're just out to get the president what's your response to that congresswoman well my response is Democrats have been in power now for three months we are beginning our constitutional duty of oversight and investigation and we have to remember that for the last two years nothing regarding oversight has been done by Congress so I think it's absolutely important that we not overreach but I think doing our constitutional duty is not overreach so this this was a very important milestone that the report is in but now we need to actually see the report we need to see the report we need to see the underlying evidence so I think we have reached an important milestone but we still have a long way to go do you accept the special counsels finding that there was in fact no collusion well I accept it on its surface but we do have to see the entire report and the underlying evidence I'm glad that this part is done collusion is very important but I'm also interested in obstruction of justice I'm interested in corruption I'm interested in abuse of power there are other cases that were referred to other offices within DOJ so again an important milestone but we are not finished with this process at all how much does the mother report change the conversation surrounding impeachment well you know I mean I think the conversation surrounding impeachment was very clear with what speaker Pelosi said it's not the number one issue that any of us are talking about and we won the election in November not talking about impeachment talking about health care talking about prescription drugs talking about jobs so the Democrats have always had a very healthy agenda that we are passing and working on while we are doing oversight while we are doing investigation it is not the only thing that is happening in the House of Representatives what's going to be the first item of business for your committee who do you want to hear from first well bar for sure and then potentially Muller but I know that chairman Adler is going to request that a turn the Attorney General come before the house but you would also like to perhaps Akina robert muller himself yes yes and I think there is you know just so much more to do so when we get the full report when we get the underlying evidence I would imagine there going to be a number of people that we're gonna want to come before the committee you were listening to Senator Graham there along with the rest of us did you hear senator Graham call for the appointment of another special councilor did I miss hear him well no I think that I heard that too but he also went back to talking about the Clinton event and Hillary Clinton and so I was surprised by that you know I kind of long for the Lindsey Graham of a couple of years ago so you know he's dramatically changed he I did hear him say that I'm not exactly sure why I think he said it was regarding the Pfizer report why I'm in the fisa hearing why that even happened so that was very surprising all right congresswoman Karen bass there congresswoman thanks for your time do appreciate - appreciate you

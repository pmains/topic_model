you want your name mentioned okay we are alive now so we'll just wait a few minutes see who joins us with Tanner's on we have trusted man is on for now have four people Preston says hi cliff well hi but perfume or second see what else joins us right all right yeah we can go ahead and start good well thank you so much for joining us today it's our first Facebook live experience and so I'm so happy you've taken the time to watch today we are in the 4b nursery and floral building in beautiful downtown Burns Oregon and my my assistant marine Bowers is here doing all of the all the hard work so Marie thank you so much for driving over today the of course the the virus has shut down all of our opportunities for debates and other experiences of meeting people so this is a very wonderful opportunity to appear before you online and we will be repeating this over the next couple of weeks I am sure let me just take you let me just take this moment to explain why I'm running for this office I'm many people have asked after 12 years ago where you legislature why would you want to go to watch from the DC and the short answer is because we have a president in Donald Trump who can help us achieve a lot of really great things for congressional district 2 which I'll refer to as CD 2 through the course of of our afternoon gathering here and and with with a president who would sign a bill for helping our forests or who would sign a bill for helping a store more water or help us with addressing how to appropriately implement the Endangered Species Act President Trump will help us do all of those things and that I can assure you has not been the case in Salem so my hope is when I get to Washington DC to be able to address those issues with of course the absolutely invaluable and necessary assistance of the president also we find ourselves as we all know on the edge of a economic abyss and this cove environs created incredible difficulties for people that were just on the edge of those difficulties just a few days ago I was speaking with some folks in the potato business and they told me that their businesses their sales and slowed down to nothing in the onion business the same thing these challenges will have to be met and they certainly will continue into I'm starting to say the next couple of years and so as we struggle to figure out how to meet these challenges I would like to be helping and it happens that years ago when I was on the it was not that long ago on the economic development committees in Salem I worked to say night and day but a lot in trying to address the economic recession back in 9 and 10 so I've had experience in that space is difficult and challenging I'm happy to see our president doing all that he is he do is doing - to address these issues and of course I want to protect the values that are so important to us here in Sidi - where I grew up and those values include of course the right to life they include our Second Amendment rights of course they include trying to reduce federal intrusion and federal overreach I don't know how many times I've heard when I was growing up the the government is the worst absentee landowner in the history of the world and that is proven by the incredibly bad condition of our forests and of course the challenges out here in in the and the range lands of Oregon and of course I wouldn't want I would want to do something about the the fires and and the smoke that are so damaging and difficult for people down in the Medford Grants Pass area of course throughout cd2 but in that space I've learned just how incredibly difficult the smoke coming up out California is and what it's doing to those communities damaging them terribly and we need to get back into the forests in some fashion so that we can reduce the huge amount of wood this growing up around them putting people at risk and entire cities at risk we need to do something there and of course I want to go to Washington DC because the people in it are my friends I've grown up here I've been in cd2 my entire life my family's been here for almost 100 years maybe a little more and the people here are great and they're the kind of people that are worth going back to Washington and fighting for and of course I know great Albany's a good friend and I would want to build on his legacy he's done some great things for this for this district so so those are the reasons I'm running some of them I should also say Who I am I'm a ranch kid I actually was raised only about 50 miles from right here in downtown burns burns was the big city we would we would come here to shop every once in a while we would also come here for the County Fair and I took my my my 4-h sheep here to to Harney County the first year we did it I got Reserve grand champion it was a great big deal and and Burns was it was an exciting place in it and it's it's interesting it's changed over the years and and I hope I hope that if I make it into Congress I can help Burns survive as a as a valuable community you know getting up at 5:30 every morning on the ranch and working 10-hour days six days a week and we pretended we didn't work on Sunday but we still had to milk the cows had to feed the calves up in a lot and had to do other things but we were allowed to go fishing and and do things on our own on Sundays after we went to church so I'm a right to life guy because my family is Catholic and and we've been raised that way so I also know how hard ranching farming is I know how hard it is to stack hey I know how hard it is to build a fence I know how hard it is to cap out caddy heifers and because I know just exactly how hard ranching is I decided to become a lawyer and and then come back into the rural areas and help ranchers and farmers with their legal matters which I've done for the past past 40 years I've been a Republican my entire life i i'm i think republican values fit cd2 perfectly everyone realizes you're going to rise or fall on your efforts but you also always willing to step and help your neighbors and that's it's one of the most valuable things you learn out here and I think Republicans are just like that and you see that happening right now in Washington DC as our president steps up and tries his best to figure out a way of stopping the economic tailspin we're finding ourselves in because of this virus so what would I do if I was elected as I've already mentioned I actually want to do something when I get to Washington DC I in Salem where I was for 12 years 10 years in the house and 2 years in the Senate I was always in the minority so I never had a chance to advance an agenda that would help our farmers and ranchers and small businesses my hope is that our president will be reelected and that we will hold the Senate and that then I can go in to that space perhaps still a minority but I'm used to it and and with the help of with the Senate and the president and other folks from perhaps the Idaho delegation who are all Republican we can do something good for this area and of course I would use my experience both as a lawyer and helping people with credit problems over many many years and with helping rebuild our economy in eight or nine Oh 10 I could put that to work for us because I'm sure that's gonna be necessary given the incredible challenges we're facing now because of the virus so what am I saying people say well you you're talking a lot did you ever do anything well I'll just point out that we 11 senators in the minority and Salem a year of lost not even a year ago stood up to people always say it was Kate brown but it was also all of the Republicans excuse me the Democrats that were opposed to be Republicans in in the House and the Senate they've brought a bill that was focused who actually brought several bills they brought the the bill that would have dramatically restricted our Second Amendment rights and they also brought a bill that would have dramatically increased the cost of energy it is referred to of course as the cap-and-trade bill and we stood up to we tried desperately to make something actually work not in the gun space because there was no negotiating with them there that was a bad bill could not be fixed on the carbon side of things we suggested any number of arrangements that would have not cost the people of Mornington money and still would have done something to try to address reading that reducing forest fires and try the rest of the story more water in other words adaptation we were ignored and we then stood up and we walked out we left and people may say there was nothing to do that but they don't understand the cost because not only did we have to reach for our wallets and pay for motel and hotel rooms in another state but we also had to in some in my case at least I sent back the the per diem that was being paid to us to pay our rent and everything else in Salem I wrote a check I gave it to the boys club so that people wouldn't say I had somehow Boys and Girls Club excuse me somehow been double-dipping by virtue of not working and still receiving that per diem so my point is we did standup it was expensive and we did succeed we killed both the the gun bill and we also killed the bill having to do with cap and trade and I'm sorry for that long and lengthy opening statement but I want you to know a why I'm running be Who I am and see what I do if I get to Washington DC finally I just want to give you a little update on how our campaign is doing it's doing great we just just had a u-haul trailer and truck go around the entire almost the entire 20 counties handing out some three hundred and some-odd your field signs we have many more to hand out which we will be doing we're also doing great online as this little meeting is evidence up and of course we're going to be going out with Bailey's we're going up on TV and we're continuing our fundraising notwithstanding the fact we can't mean any of you in person so with that I'll simply I'll simply say I feel very confident about our chances in this race my Senate District took up a huge part of CD two and I enjoy enormous and wonderful support I should also point out I'm so blessed in debt 32 of the 60 County Commissioners in CD 2 have endorsed my candidacy Senator Bill Hansel is also endorsed my candidacy and I want to thank him for his support many of the Senators in Oregon's Republican side have endorsed my candidacy and of course I think I have 17 now of the 20 county sheriffs who've endorsed my candidacy so the support for my running for this office has been just absolutely wonderful I also enjoyed this endorsement of former congressman Bob Smith who was from right here in burns wonderful gentleman I met with him several weeks ago and great guy I'm so happy for his support so with that I'm going to stop I understand that recently to help us with questions and again thank you so much for joining us this afternoon um do you want to talk about what you the letter you sent to Kate Brown yesterday right so we have a website and it's called dear Kate Brown very good novel a dear Kate Brown you might want to go to it take a look with the help of Maria several others we put together a letter to our governor saying hey there's some things that absolutely positively need to be done given this virus and the impact is having coated keep getting the number wrong the code virus and that's harming so many people back east and and on the coast thank goodness I don't think we have a case yet here in Harvey County and by the way in case anybody's wondering the folks helping me here today are all maintaining the appropriate distance so we're we were taking very seriously this this this disease and we want the governor also to be taking it seriously I'm sure she is but we want her to others and the in criminal challenges this disease poses for for our rural communities and we've listed a number of those challenges in the letter that we sent to her and were asking people to go online to dear Kate brown come and join us in signing that letters last petition I think we're up to 400 now people are blessed that have signed it and then we'll go to the governor and say governor we have great support for what we've asked you to do one of the first things we asked her to do is support and help our rural hospitals because our rural hospitals are absolutely hemorrhaging money right now then trying to keep them open in these small communities is absolutely essential but because if people do become Hill they will need care in those hospitals they will need access to respirators so helping them stay viable is essential we've also addressed education because it's so important we've also addressed the possibility of delay the the so called capital of activities tax and I call it the there's numbers of different names for the gross receipts tax is what I could refer to it as which of course is the tax that you must pay if you have gross receipts in excess of a million dollars even though you haven't made any money it's a ridiculous tax which we opposed in Salem we Republicans we lost sadly that that argument but we need to tell Kate Brown that businesses that are now suffering so dramatically cannot cannot afford to be paying that tax so these are some of the things that are in our letter to the governor where we're asking her please please take these things into account and there's one other element of that letter you should know about the federal government thanks to congressman Walden and the president will be sending each each County I'm starting each state 1.2 billion dollars more or less we want our Eastern Oregon counties our Southern Oregon counties our Central Oregon counties our rural counties to weigh in with the governor and say government please take a portion of that and and spend it in the following ways to help our local businesses and our local farmers or local ranchers this is people need to weigh in explain why they need a portion of that federal funding so what again is somewhere around 1.2 billion you can contact your your state senator or your state representative and discuss this at link please do this is a big deal maybe there will be some more money at some point to be sure maybe there won't but please please take advantage of this opportunity to tell the governor how you want that money spent summary was there something else I was supposed to mention other than that that's all right um so one question along the lines of the kovat virus kovin 19 or the yep so obviously it's having an impact on the economy and the question we got was the economy is weakening quickly what can we do to help farms ranches rural homes avoid foreclosure well some of them is that the income isn't coming in every month generally the income is when you sell your crop which many times is in the fall so hopefully the payments that are going to be made by many of them are going to be immediate on the other hand you've got a you've got to have your money coming in you better have an operating line or something those that because of the virus can't make the payments should be able to go to the SBA and obtain one of their really low-interest loans I've heard driving over today I was listening to the to the vice president and the president talked about the programs that are available and those programs are at 1% interest I think it was going to be less but it turned out that the banks that are handling the loans needed to be able to make something and that 1% is going to help pay for their over trying to put these loans together so I think what we should be doing is making sure everybody knows about these programs and so going online and looking congressman wall this website is a good place to start going to your Small Business Administration I believe those loans will be up and running tomorrow so making sure everybody is aware of the availability of that credit now that's one thing to borrow the money it's another to have to pay it back and so some of those loans may be forgiven many of them won't be forgiven but at least in the short run people will have that money to bridge over this period of time where they may not have income so I was thinking those importantly we should be doing this just what congressman walden is doing right now telling everybody about these programs and trying to make sure they're aware of that help and just does the antidote we where we stop for lunch today that guy is gonna go apply for an SBA loan because the restaurants and businesses and burns are meeting it so yes well the good news is I heard today I knew that there was a limit on these small business amount which is 350 billion it sounds like an enormous it is enormous lot of money but the the assertion that was made today by the secretary of the Treasury was that there would be a request for more money if that was not enough so people need to use that that funding because that's what it's there for the the key though is most people have been talking about how this doesn't can be paid back and at some point that's going to be an issue but in the short run I think just a matter of trying to keep everybody in business all right I've got I got a question via text message the economic injury disaster loan doesn't include AG the AG industry I guess that's more of a comment a sent a letter to secretary Purdue to include AG so along those lines we have a question from some cattlemen the big four beef packers are making huge profits since koban 19 started consumers are paying more yet ranchers cash prices and futures have crashed would you support an investigation by Department of Justice as organ Cattleman's has requested a sector taper due and what are your thoughts on this crisis okay so the question is what can we do about the Cavill crisis crashing first and then secondly what can we do about the possibility that are making money well and the cat and the cattleman are requesting a investigation well of course we would I support the investigation in an instant the the question is let's this have that investigation immediately I'm going to do everything in my power to support ranchers I am a am a rancher I have been one of my brothers are still in the ranching business my my constituency has been in the ranching business the people I've worked for in my law practice are on the ramp so of course I'm going to help them and the let's find out what happened let's find out why it happened and let's go do something about it perfect and the cattleman did endorse you the cattleman I'm very very happy for the support of the Collins Association they have endorsed my candidacy they're many of my friends many of my clients I've known them for years many of my family are still in the cattle business the challenge I've talked to several of them just in the last couple of days and in fact just this morning and said to how our cattle prices they're hoarded and the the question is at what point will we be able to get our economy up and running again so that we can have people back in restaurants and people back actually buying beef and that's that's probably that that's been shoved a little bit to the side as we try to address the medical end of it and the and the challenges that go with staying in business while we wait for things to turn around but the actual of how we're going to turn it around is a huge question and one that I've been asking with different in different meetings in different places in hopes that I could help in some way make this situation better but that's one of our reasons for the dear Kate Brown website is to ask her to do certain things that she has the power to do that would help us in our rural areas um great thank you looking at these questions are you so I guess changing the note a little bit from the covent situation I'm sure we'll get some more questions on that so I guess a question that's kind of been looming around and certain groups and around is let's talk transportation the transportation package and what all you know people people are critical of that and I guess tell us them a little bit more about that well the congressional district too has somewhere between 30 and 40 thousand miles of roads and I don't really know how many how many bridges I'm gonna say hundreds if not thousands and we have to have those roads we have to because we can't get from burns to Bend and we can't get from burns to lake view of you can't get from from Grants Pass down to Medford we've got to have roads and we have a lot of them and one of the things that people don't understand unless you are from this district is just how far everything is from somewhere else like today I drove two hours and 10 minutes to get from Ontario to right where we're sitting right now how fast did I Drive well the speed limit 65 I mean I've gone over that just a little several times and why was I able to do that without ever without ever slowing down on that road and the answer is because it's a really good road it's a state highway it's in great shape and why is that and the answer is because we invest in our roads it's a piece of infrastructure we have to have now those roads don't just magically appear and they have to be paid for and one of the things I was able to do with Greg Gretel represent beretta some years ago was increased the speed limit he used to be 55 on all these roads it would take you forever I helped rate the fact I sat down in my office in in Salem with a with a magic marker and I outlined the roads on a map that we're going to increase from 55 to 65 and I took that down to Legislative Council and said here you go this is the roads we want to increase our speed limit off and that's how it happened because then I added that to Gregory Joe's bill that increase the speed limit on the freeway why were we able to do this because our roads are so good our roads are great and then when the safety people came in Troy kissed Alice is his name he's an ode unemploy a wonderful guy he came in and said you know I represent invest because I was in the house at the time if you allow people to go faster they're gonna be in more dangerous they drive I said truck you may remember that you have constantly asked us to upgrade our roads fix the curves and our cars are so much safer by virtue of airbag something else can't we go faster and although he was not willing to Beaver he wasn't his trickiest job is not to have us go faster but the truth is our roads allow us to do so and this louse allows us to get to places where we need to be much faster saving all kinds of time which we did then can put to other more productive uses of just sitting there driving anyway long story thank goodness we got the money for our roads and our bridges by the way ODOT had given us some figures before we passed the transportation package to replace all of our bridges in our system would have taken exactly give or take a few years seven hundred years seven hundred years most people probably don't know that the life were bridge is not seven hundred years it's a lot closer to 100 years so as we were going through and replacing bridges before the transportation package that's how long would it take it after the transportation package we reduced that time by a significant amount sir B not down to 100 years do you know why because the amount that we have for in the package that people pay who had to be a modest amount now why because you've got to pay your bills and and and and you have to some people say we're not gonna do this we don't want to have to pay more money what they're really saying is let's abandon the assets our parents our grandparents built for us let's let them just crumble and why would we inherit a wonderful asset a run for road system from our parents and then let it crumble why would we do such thing the transportation package was designed to make sure we didn't let that happen and so there are many good things in it there's hundreds of millions of dollars that were driven into will be invested in cd2 as a result of that package I'm very very unhappy for the for the time and effort it took it's a good thing for the infrastructure for our part of the state all right one of the questions we've received via Facebook and from Joseph Angelini what makes you more qualified than your opponents so each of our each of each of there are there's eleven people running for this job and some of them I I don't know very well I don't know them well enough to say what their qualifications might be but I do know this I've grown up in this space I'm from cd2 my family's been here 100 years I've represented as a lawyer farmers and ranchers across cd2 I spent 12 years of my life in the Oregon Legislature working on issues to try to benefit a huge part of cd2 I I know how the people make their livings in cd2 I know I know cd2 I'm a I when I went to law school I went to law school to learn about water walk and so I could be an expert in the water area and I've been helping ranchers and farmers preserve their water rights for years and and I know I'm the most knowledgeable of anybody on that list of 11 candidates when it comes to water I would also say that I'm the most when it comes to how farming and ranching works because I'm still I'm still farming my wife and I live on 110 acre farm we have it's a part of us being farmed and onions this year I know farming and so I believe I'm more qualified because of that and then finally I've spent huge amounts of time traveling this district I know distance I know what it's like to hop in the car as I did today and drive a couple hours to get here and I'll turn around to drive back and I'm perfectly happy with that so there's three reasons and I could I could go on longer but I'll stop there let's talk about water for a second um so you know the governor I think you mean a statement on this a couple weeks ago the governor said she's supported removing the four lower Snake River dams and I guess you want to talk about the you know water dams and kind of that area of your expertise yeah well my I oppose taking out dams I'll just tell you that right now and the reason it has to do with the the fact that dams provide clean power at which many people are in huge need up now one of the things that many people don't know about dams and ones that generate electricity does they offer an opportunity to balance our energy supply with our green power which is wind and solar isn't available so you can a dam is basically a huge battery and you can let the water go and let the water go out by adjusting the water flow through it that's not true for wind or solar so there's a huge value in a dam and the water behind it just because you can balance out green energy there's a huge value in transportation because as you know on this on the Columbia River system and snake systems we have large traffic that's hugely important for getting wheat and other commodities up and down the river in one of the most effective ways we have there's a huge value in dams in recreation which people hardly ever talk about the so my initial default position is always going to be don't take out the dams now down on the Klamath is a hugely complex situation in the Klamath and one that I think the four dams that there's a number of dams there but I think four of them are on the on the list to be removed I could be off on that again it's a complicated space but they some of those dams are on the on the list to be removed the FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is going to be making a decision in the next year or so as to whether or not those dams come out my approach to all of these issues of water is to go to the local area and say what is it that you want and so I would do that and I've been doing that down in the Klamath in my meetings with different people what do you want in fact just the last two days I've spent talking to different members of the climate water news Association and and it's been hugely enlightening to me as to what those people are thinking about dam removal and I if I were the Congress from that from this area I would be doing the same thing going into those spaces and say hey what do you want to do what do you want to do and that's it takes time but how else are you going to know you got to ask so when you walked out not only did you stop cap-and-trade and I think you mentioned a bill already but what else did you accomplish well the the bill we have we walked out twice we walked out in May and then we walked out again in June when we walked out in May we were trying to stop the the gross receipts tax and the gun bill but we we did kill the gun bill and it had in it strict viability if if someone stole one of your guns and and hurt somebody with it then you would be liable those kind that was one element of a whole bunch of bad things in that bill we killed that bill there there was a the cap and trade bill of course I I was the one that was asked by President courtney to to work on that committee I told him I that was the wrong committee I said you should put me on your tax committee I would be far more qualified in that space he said no you're gonna go into carbon committee and so I realized just how bad that bill was the cap-and-trade bill and so that was the that was the reason that we walked out the second time because we were promised the first time when we came back that they would reset that bill and they didn't so we accomplished those things some other bills were killed one of them was the the vaccination bill there should have been a solution to that one worked out but the timing didn't quite fit and so those are those were the things that we got down there were several other bills that were stopped but the main thing we got done was we killed cap and trade and we killed the Second Amendment restrictive bill so that was it was a valuable exercise I'm glad we did it but in retrospect it is a really really challenging way to do things and I'm hopeful that that we'll be able to figure out some way of working together better I hope the Oregon Legislature figures that out because walking out is not a long term not a long term plan so I guess in kind of killed Oregon's green new deal but in Washington DC they have the proposed green new deal and they've been trying to get they try to get pieces of that into the kovin relief bill you know with trying to make airplanes you know measure their carbon or you know keep track of that and now with the Tom's proposed infrastructure bill they want you know green buildings and that could be part of it so I guess the question is how will you fight back against you know the AOC s and the promoters of the green new deal in Washington DC well there's I don't I barely know where it starts but but I was I would start out by pointing out that that the green New Deal can never happen for all kinds of reasons one is is a ten year program and because of the way our government regulates they're set up you could barely get through the first environmental study before the ten years would be up so to suggest that that would ever happen within ten years is is incorrect also the cost is ridiculously high and that then there's many other problems with with the Green Deal what I've learned though in salient is that logic didn't work me pointing out to my Democrat colleagues that what they were going to do was going to destroy big parts of rural Oregon didn't work and so this is why we have to get our president reelected because if you don't get the president re-elected then it's gonna be just on the Senate then we can still stop stuff because the Senate can stop stuff but that's a that's a very awkward way of trying to move this whole government thing forward but this give our president re-elected and then we don't have to worry about the renew deal because he would veto it if it ever ever ever made its way through and let's get our let's make sure Mitch McConnell stays in charge of our Senate and then we won't have to worry about that but what I would be doing is I would be taking all that I learned over the year and a half I studied carbon and I'd be going into the Congress and I'd be saying to the folks in charge of the newest people there what can I do to help because I've I've spent a lot of time studying this and I'm happy to to weigh in wherever they were wherever I would be the most valuable um along those lines um so we got a question via Facebook last night how about Cliff sponsoring the sage-grouse habitat restoration bill which I'm not sure exactly which bill that is but does that represent cd2 values yeah well so whoever asked that question apparently hadn't been involved in the sage-grouse war but the the the the sage-grouse is not necessarily in a danger species but it's a threatened one and so there's been a organized attempt to try to not have a repeat of the spotted owl situation and suddenly having all of the ranchers in huge parts of Oregon precluded from turning their cattle out and so the question has been how do we make sure we don't have those Grouse move over into the endangered space and suddenly people can lose huge parts of where they used to graze our cat we don't want that to happen and so I've been working with ranchers with the Cattlemen's Association and this is one of the reasons the cattle Association has endorsed me because I worked so closely with them to try to address issues as challenging as the sage-grouse I don't remember that exact bill but I did a number of bills in that space the thing I'm happiest about is I was able to convince the or oh well watershed enhancement Board made a lot of garden to allocate 10 million dollars a million dollars a year over ten years to exactly that trying to restore areas where the sage-grouse are and the concept is let's make sure these birds do not become endangered and we suddenly can't turn our cattle out anymore I mean that's what we're trying to do and so if you if you just turn a blind eye to this and say too bad for the grass then you're basically saying too bad for the cattle and so frankly I support the cattlemen and so I've worked very closely I don't know how many sage-grouse meetings I've gone to the cattlemen have worked incredibly closely everybody's been working closely to try to figure out how to to manage this really challenging situation while we're still able to graze cattle and it's been a lot of hard work so I would encourage whoever asked that question to go to the and figure out where where they need to be on this issue do you have a hunting license I don't have 103 years and that and the reason of course when I went into the legislature 12 years ago I they don't thank you very much and so in your in your your spare time when you're not doing all this work in the legislation you have to have a real job and you have to be making money so I would return and I would go back to my law practice and do my very very best to do contracts and leases and other things and then then I returned back to go back to Salem and so my time for vacations has been extremely limited for the past ten years and particularly for hunting and so I have I I don't know how many guns that I have that I used to hunt with before before I didn't have time but I enjoyed hunting the I did have one time another guy and I had a bet about who hunted the most and he bet me I think five dollars that he hunted more than I and I was just two words I I won the argument the two words were ground squirrels because I don't know how many thousands of ground squirrels have met their demise by virtue of my shooting them but the that those days those days are gone because I haven't at the time hmm by the way I support hunting it and every every type of hunting the fact that I don't have time to do it is kind of sad there's the matter of bad ones bills um Shelley representing Sheila boss sir Davis had brought up you know you talk about the unique needs of transportation cd2 and what you've done but she wants to know maybe what would you do in DC about that about transportation well I joined the president president Trump is is mentioning in fact diverting today talk about me because last night talk about a new infrastructure bill of seven eight hundred billion dollars and this is this is something that is absolutely essential I want to point out that the transportation package that we passed in 2017 the the analogy that was used is that our entire system of roads in Oregon whether it's the US highways or state highways or county roads and by the way the transportation package funnel millions of dollars back into our county roads so that entire system has been likened to a sinking ship going down kind of like this because it's gradually falling apart and when we pass that package we we changed the downward direction of that ship a little we didn't stop it so we haven't it's our entire system is still it's still crumbling but only more slowly because now we have more money to put into trying to keep it together if the president is successful and if I get to go back and help him I would do everything I could to make it his efforts to build up infrastructure successful then we could perhaps level out the sinking ship of our of our roads and this is incredibly important over here in CD 2 because we have tens of thousands of miles of roads and if we can't jump on our car or whatever it is and go to wherever we need to get our economy will come to a halt the bridges in particular tonight I've often said if a bridge goes out between here and John Day it's a long way around a long way so the point is we have to maintain this infrastructure that we rely upon every day called roads and by the way affect our president that he's talked about infrastructure from the first day he got into office because it's a really important thing and he gets it and it's not just roads isn't me our dams and reservoirs it should be our pipelines should be a whole bunch of stuff that needs a lot of attention so I'm very happy he's talking about it mmm anyone else on Facebook has any more questions Oh your uh your nephew wanted to know why you have such great hair right I'll just say one thing is real how's that he said you have the best hair out of all your brother so guess what so my brother's don't have any so that's an easy it's an easy as a low bar you better wait but I would yeah I would I would simply say to my nephew thanks for the compliment um how would you defend life in DC or not defend but stand up for life and the unborn well first of all I would that's the most important thing people need to know I'm a pro-life candidate I was I received a Gail Atteberry Award for my work in in the anti-abortion space and also the end of life space and it won't worry you with how much time I've spent trying to oppose some of the accelerated assisted suicide laws that passed over our strenuous objections if I went back to DC and these issues were to come up I would be doing same thing I had done in Salem witches opposed them I would also after the president was elected about five or six months after he was elected congressman Walden asked if I would be willing to join willing to act as the lawyer who vetted some of the judicial appointments to the ninth circuit for the president and I agreed instantly and I was one of two Republicans out of there were there were five Democrats two Republicans and we reviewed 44 applications for appointment to the Ninth Circuit and the district court in Portland and it was absolutely essential that we find conservative judges that would would appropriately address life issues and that is to support life as opposed to not too and I'm happy to say that as a result of those efforts we have two wonderful women judges Karen arrogant in Portland and Danielle non-secular now in San Francisco in the Ninth Circuit so that's the kind of thing I would hope I would continue to be able to do do because I am a lawyer I know that space and I hope I'd be able to help the president in identifying appropriate appointees to the courts because that's a big space and an important one and then as far as being a congressman in that space I'd be doing all I could to try to address some of the other issues and they're complicated and I could not recite them off the top I had but I'd be doing my best to advance that agenda I think there was a question about the affordable care act what would you work to appeal it or what we or repeal it I guess would be the proper right we're going to ensure X Reilly join the efforts to repeal Obamacare but to say that is not that that's not the entire answer because you've got a there's so many issues in the health care space that need to be addressed starting with the repeal there's been many different efforts to try to do it the court may decide to that it's it's not going to work also it's a three trillion dollar issue so just to say that how we're gonna fix it is difficult I will say that competition is hugely important allowing insurance companies across state lines so this is a standard list of things that people want to do and I went join whoever's working in that space and try to help them but it's a hugely important issue particularly now as we look at this Cobin 19 situation okay another question we got from the representative Shelly vos our dateless is ODOT just announced prioritizing climate change by establishing a climate office and she says in these unprecedented times this seems tone-deaf is your thoughts on that right well I'm guessing they're doing it because they've been told to do so by the by the governor that'd be my guess and what's happened is the governor has been very unhappy that we were able to stop the cap-and-trade bill so she's not going to each of her departments and she's telling them to do in at the agency level but she couldn't get done at the legislative level and so with that we'll have to wait to see what they actually do and then see who's going to challenge that in court so you need to write and this is pretty good time yeah it should be everybody focusing on how in the world to keep everybody in business because what's gonna happen is everybody stops driving then the money that comes from selling gas at the pump drops dramatically and the money coming into Oh dots drops dramatically so I would be if I were the direct or vote out and I'm not I would be thinking about not staffing that office until I figured these other much more important issues out yeah that's a good question though another question is from Chad Russell how do you feel about balancing civil liberties during this time with government with the governor shutting down businesses across the state and country I know many that are concerned about this since they can't go to work and are healthy can wash your hands and stay six feet away from people well Chad that's an incredibly challenging question and the the answer is going to depend a lot on each person themselves being educated as to what what that we need to be doing to keep everybody safe many people have have suggested that the president was slow in his response to the virus what I was what I have said is that this is a free country and you don't just come in and yell at everybody and tell them this is how it's going to be because you'll get exactly the type of question that Chad is asking which is basically saying hey you're not the boss of me I'm gonna do what I want and so what you think has to happen is you've got to go to everybody and say hey being free to be whatever you want is absolutely the essential foundation of America but at the same time we can't put other people at risk because it's just like lying you know crying out fire in a crowded theater if you can't do it if what you do is going to put other people at risk then we need to figure out how to make sure that's not happening so what I would be doing is one educating everybody up as to the risk and and then to doing our best to figure out how to let people move around without putting other people at risk so that's the very very challenging but but this doesn't mean we give up on it the real by the way there's a I hate to say this but if you wanted Chad you should go take a look at the most recent The Economist magazine he goes through this exact issue and says if you let government take over now it'll be very difficult to make them let go of that power so Chad's concern is a really good one but challenge is how do we meet this immediate danger without giving up freedoms that we never get back and so I guarantee I would be doing my very very best person for freedom but at the same time trying to keep everybody safe so wait he's right it's a balancing act um I think we're pretty much coming up almost to an hour now so I guess I don't see any more additional questions do you have any so with

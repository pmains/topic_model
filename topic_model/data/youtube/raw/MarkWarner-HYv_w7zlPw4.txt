hi I'm Senator Mark Warner Virginia is home to some of our country's most beautiful and historic national parks our national parks preserve our natural and cultural heritage for future generations and they make a huge contribution to Virginia's economy we've got over a billion dollars in visitor spending at our national parks and our national parks support over 15,000 Virginia jobs unfortunately many of our national parks are in desperate need of repairs unfortunately for years because we've underfunded our national parks maintenance the total deferred maintenance at our national parks is over 12 billion dollars here in Virginia we actually have deferred maintenance backlog of more than a billion dollars making Virginia the third state in the nation only behind California and the District of Columbia in total unmet needs now that's the bad news the good news is we've actually got a plan on how we can fix over 50% of this problem I've introduced a bipartisan bill we call it the restore our Parks Act which would make the largest investment in this problem of deferred maintenance international parks in many many decades it would actually dedicate a single source of funding to address this backlog importantly the Senate recently took a critical step in getting this bill out of committee on a broad bipartisan basis now we have to get the bill in front of the whole Senate where I'm optimistic that will pass overwhelmingly the good news on this legislation is we've got great support from Republicans and Democrats alike and I want to also thank the Secretary of the Interior Ryan sinky who's been helpful on this bill as well my hope is within the next few months we will not only get this legislation passed but we'll get the president to sign it and we can start on this effort to restore this great treasure our national parks

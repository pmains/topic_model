MR. DEUTCH. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR 1  1/2 MINUTES. MR.DEUTCH: I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THAT OUR COLLEAGUES ARE AVOIDING THE FACTS. THESE COMMONSENSE MEASURES HAD WE PASSED THEM COULD HAVE SAVED OVER 400 PEOPLE SINCE COLUMBINE. I'M DISAPPOINTED OF JURISPRUDENCE, JUSTICE SCALIA THE RIGHTS BY THE SECOND AMENDMENT ARE NOT UNLIMITED. THE CHANGES IN THIS LAW WILL NOT UNDERMIEP THE SECOND AMENDMENT. BUT I HAVE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT INFORM EVERYTHING I DO HERE. ONE IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE OTHER IS THIS LIST THAT I WROTE ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018 OF EVERY ONE OF THE 17 MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY SLAUGHTERED BY A KILLER WITH AN AR-15. WE HEARD ABOUT FOUNDATIONAL RIGHTS, FOUNDATIONAL LIBERTIES AS IF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS THE ONLY -- IT'S THE SUM TOTAL OF THE CONSTITUTION. MADAM SPEAKER, THE FIRST AMENDMENT MATTERS AS WELL. AND FOR THESE 17, THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO PRACTICE RELIGION AND PRAY FOR THEMSELVES OR ALL OF THOSE WERE KILLED EVERY TIME WE OFFER THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AND EVERYONE KILLED BY GUN VIAL ESPECIALLY THEY CANNOT PEACEABLY ASSEMBLE AS THE FIRST AMENDMENT GIVES THAT RIGHT TO ALL AMERICANS. AND MOST OF ALL, THEY CANNOT PETITION THE GOVERNMENT FOR REDRESS OF THEIR GRIEVANCEES, NOT THESE 17. NOT THE 19 FROM UVALDE. NO ONE KILLED IN THIS GUN VIOLENCE. TODAY WE CAN HELP REDRESS THE GRIEVANCEES OF ALL THOSE LOST TOP GUN VIOLENCE BYPASSING THI

let's discuss with congresswoman madeline dean she represents the 4th district in pennsylvania she's also an impeachment manager congresswoman thanks so much for joining us as you know democrats so far been pretty tight-lipped about the strategy for this upcoming senate trial when will we know as far as you can tell us when this will actually get underway well that is entirely up to the speaker of the house to present the article of impeachment uh the the senate is not in session as you know they return this coming week so the time frame i believe will be soon but that will be triggered by the decision of the speaker of the house as a house impeachment manager you're going to be working on this obviously do you have you already decided whether you will call witnesses well you know what i won't preview our strategy we have been working i'm really honored wolf to be a part of this team so ably honorably led by jamie raskin we're a team of nine and we're friends and colleagues and we respect one another so we're working hard not one of us will preview our strategy in terms of witnesses what i think is so obvious is that you were a witness i was a witness uh the world witnessed what took place here so there are an uncountable number of witnesses uh i was actually in the gallery in the capitol at the time of the attack and went through that series of chilling warnings and the banging on the doors of the ground floor of the house and then the breaking of those doors we were witness to this as were the senators how scared were you i was terrified i really was in the beginning i don't know if it's a defense mechanism but i thought surely uh they won't be able to come here i had no idea the numbers but i will tell you when they finally the first instruction was to sit down then it was to get down on the ground either kneel or lie down i found myself going to the front row of the gallery to be behind that front wall and then they told us to take out our gas masks and then they told us to put them on i was terrified i had the chance to talk to a couple family members and and uh sadly i scared them uh but uh it was absolutely terrifying and and let's remember what happened here the president incited an attack by americans on americans in a desperate grab to hold on to power he threatened the constitutional stability of our of our democracy and he didn't do it on just any day of the week he invited that mob to the white house on the 6th of january the day he knew we would be in a joint session of congress performing our constitutional duty to certify the election which he was so desperate to undo that he would unleash an insurrection it's so shameful i can't believe this is where we are but it is where we are and i take my solemn duty uh with great responsibility and a heavy heart i know you're back home in pennsylvania right now but i assume you'll be coming back to washington for the inauguration is that right i am coming back to washington i'm not sure when i'm coming back i understand travel within the city is difficult but i'll be coming back to washington very early this week because i've spoken to some of your colleagues you know they they went through what you you went through and they were terrified as well some of them continue to suffer from a little post-traumatic stress are you suffering right now are you okay i think i'm okay i i will tell you i slipped into about four to five days of utter anger i think that's probably a natural part of the process but then uh when the speaker called me and asked if i would serve as an impeachment manager i have to tell you that has galvanized me uh but i i will be aware and pay attention on the other sides of ptsd as every one of us should be i have to tell you on our caucus calls we have a couple of doctors in our among our ranks and they have said that very very kindly be pay attention to yourself and pay attention to your surroundings and how you're feeling but for right now i am pouring myself into the important job at hand which is to try this president for the high crimes and misdemeanors that he is guilty of and make sure he is convicted prohibited from ever running from office again and send a message to the world that this insurrection wasn't just an aberration uh and this week with a new president and uh president biden and kamala harris brighter days will be ahead are you at all concerned uh you know that uh some some of expressing some concern that the senate trial potentially could step on president-elect biden's first days in office what do you think about that should it be delayed in order to give him a chance to get all of his cabinet nominees confirmed to start dealing aggressively with new legislation on corona virus infrastructure the economy there's so much work that needs to be done there's so much work that needs to be done the senate is capable of doing both of walking and chewing gum at the same time and in president biden and kamala harris i see a team so prepared if anybody was to have to deal with the number of crises at hand so it is not as though we have the luxury of just dealing with one thing or another we have a pandemic with nearly 400 000 people dead thousands of people dying a day we have an insurrection incited by the outgoing president and we have the promise of a new administration so i believe we must and we can do all of it and a president biden will be capable of sharing that work product and making sure that he gets his cabinet underway he gets his initiatives underway as he's rolled out but also that we live up to our constitutional duty he's a former senator he knows exactly the role that they must play if there were ever a president capable of handling this calamitous time it's joe biden congresswoman madeline dean of pennsylvania good luck to you i'm glad you're feeling okay thank you so much for joining us thank you will take care

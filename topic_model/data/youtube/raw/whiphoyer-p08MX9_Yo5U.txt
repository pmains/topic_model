can I see the bill today you're not on that committee so you can look at when we mark it up in other words they will mark it up before anybody in the public including now with a member of the house of representa- inox question is that what the gentleman is telling me I know so answer the question is just as similar to every other bill we move I'd say what they will post it before they mark it up so everybody can see it and debate it it's the leader came in my time that's not regular order I've been here a long time you've been here a long time that's not regular regular order is you introduce a bill you go up to this desk you put a bill in now we don't follow that very much but that's the order it is then printed it is referred to a committee the public can see it as soon as it's printed it goes to the committee they establish a hearing the witnesses then come before the committee and testify as to its positive and negative aspects the committee then schedules the markup it may even be the same day after the hearing I get that and then they mark it up but the bill has been given to the public and to members invariably under regular order substantially before that happens you are telling me as I understand it mr. Lee I cannot see the bill today five days before it's scheduled to be marked up is that accurate and I yield to my friend or yield back to the gentleman have you seen a scheduled markup because I didn't have it in my list I don't I don't announce markups but apparently this is another rumor you may have heard I yield back are you is the leader telling me that he does not know personally whether a markup is scheduled on the Affordable Care Act repeal next week I yield to my friend I thank the gentleman for asking that's an askin that's a question to the Chairman I simply provide you the schedule for next week that's what I thank the gentleman but that was not my question whether the chairman of the committee knows maybe the gentleman does not know in which case he can say no my question was does the gentleman know whether a markup is scheduled for next week and the Ways and Means Committee on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act I yield to my friend I thank the gentleman for yielding that that's an action of the committees and they will list as soon as they prepared to do their markups eel back Mr Speaker I don't know whether that's a yes or no why I don't intend to tell you it certainly does not tell me whether the majority leader knows that I would suggest to the chairman of the committee they'll mr. speaker that the majority leader ought to be informed of what the committee is doing on such a very important issue

thank you mr chairman and i want to thank by uh i want to start by thanking you for your leadership on this issue and for holding this hearing uh i am proud to support medicare for all and look forward to working with you to move this forward and i also want to personally thank and recognize our front line heroes i see all these scrubs in the audience and i always put the smile on my face uh because i know that y'all have been on the front lines in the more than two-year fight against covet 19. i also want to say that pandemic uh we have a few uh heroes today and some great witnesses including one that happens to be a california nurse and my personal friend bonnie castillo thank you for being here now ms castillo's executive director of the national nurses united and fierce advocate for equal health care for all and i'm proud that she's here representing california as well as the workforce now as you've all seen the cover 19 pandemic has put a spotlight on what many people of color already knew and that's the fact that the current health care system does not treat everyone equally for far too long communities of color patients of color have faced discrimination in our health care system and we can debate whether it's intentional or unintentional but the facts and the data are clear and that's one of the reasons why i believe medicare for all is so important because it will level the playing field for communities of color it's simply a fact that many communities of color living in the united states have less access to health care have worse health outcomes and are less insured than other communities but a significant equalizer has been medicare research has shown that there are substantial reductions in racial disparities and access to care and self-reported health when people reach 65. now this is striking and should be kept top of mind when we consider this bill healthcare should not be determined by your zip code and no one should go bankrupt because they can't afford growing medical expenses so i share your conviction mr chairman it's frankly unacceptable that as the wealthiest nation in the world we don't guarantee health care for all health care is a human right i'm looking forward to taking action here now turn into my questions in a couple minutes i have left uh the first is to miss castillo you know cost is often cited as a reason to oppose medicare for all who for those who don't believe yet yet but the real question i have is cost for whom now i've heard story after story from families across california about how a single illness can be financially crippling for an individual or a family families often go into massive debt or even bankruptcy to cover a loved one's health care costs but it doesn't have to be this way health care should not be something only the wealthy can afford no one should go to debt because of rising health for health care costs or an illness one example that we're legislating separately no one should have to ration their insulin or put off critical surgeries because of the price tag so with that as the backdrop ms castillo is one of the leaders of the largest healthcare worker unions in the nation how would medicare for all help alleviate the racial and income disparities that you see on the ground well thank you and thank you for your leadership uh senator padilla you know for us as registered nurses i think you know the key words is early access prevention detection and treatment and that means removing those barriers and those barriers are prohibitive whether you have you know for the uninsured as has been mentioned for the 30 million uninsured but for the under insured that can't afford to use their insurance not to mention all those who have lost their jobs and lost their insurance insurance doesn't equal care and people need to be able to access that care and the care and we on this panel i mean we have the expertise and the education to provide that care that's what we that that is our job and we we do our job every day we do our job and during the pet you know the pandemic we didn't run away from the disaster we ran to it but we need the tools and we need to remove the barriers to care for everyone and the the you know the covid uh does not respect any kind of uh barrier to care it is going to if it infects one of us it can affect all of us and so uh as providers we need to it's important uh that we address these i will also just i'd like to comment on you know for instance hospitals are closing all the time we as a union fight hospital closures because and they're deciding to close because it's not simply not profitable to operate a hospital in the lower income communities specifically communities of color rural communities and so if we had the global budgeting where the uh budgeting was based on need human need then we would be able to uh work to decrease those disparities that exist thank you mr china my five minutes are up but if i can just one quick question i promise to be brief uh the kova 19 pandemic has also put enormous stress on the mental health of the american people cases of mental illness and substance abuse disorder have sharply risen during the pandemic and more people are seeking care often costs and stigma pose barriers for people seeking mental health treatment that just shouldn't be the case medicare for all i believe can also help level the playing field for those suffering from mental illness not just physical illness dr el-sayed how can medicare for all help those suffering from mental illness and substance abuse disorder yeah senator peter i really appreciate the question uh we are suffering a second pandemic of mental illness in this country and unfortunately our healthcare system has done this thing where we basically decapitate the head from the body we say if it's in the head whether it's mental health or it's dental health or it's vision or hearing then we're going to pay for it separately and one of the best pieces of uh of of medicare for all um and the chairman's bill is that it reminds us that making medicare whole is really the first step to extending medicare for everybody covering these critical needs is is critically important the second point here is that because we have such a different system of reimbursement for mental health we systematically lag in terms of capacity my own spouse is a mental health provider he's a psychiatrist and every day she talks about caring for students who would not have care except for that they happen to be students at the university and get it through their university and so re putting the head back on the body of healthcare and making healthcare whole through medicare for all ending the differentiation between the head and the body i think is critical and medicare for all would do just that thank you thank you mr

[Music] hi joining me now to continue the discussion on the war in Ukraine as the Democratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia he's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations budget and armed services committee uh he previously served as the state's Governor the chairman of the Democratic National Committee we shouldn't forget he was Hillary Clinton's running mate for vice president in 2016. Senator good to see you again thank you for being with us glad to be with you Howie thanks you heard what Colonel vinman says we could have had the results of this referendum yesterday uh there's not going to be any surprise as to how it turns out but you have introduced a bill and President Biden has said so at the U.N that these are not this is not a viable uh referendum it doesn't make sense we're not going to be recognizing that as part of Russia and a lot of people at the U.N went farther than that so did President Biden saying this is not supposed to happen we at the U.N have decided that countries don't take over other Sovereign countries and the the whole concept of the fact that Russia is on the security Council this kind of thing in the future should be disallowed if somebody invades another country they should be booted um absolutely Ali if this is allowed the UN has no purpose I mean has absolutely no meaning this is why the U.N was created and allowing Russia to get any traction with its bogus arguments about its the need for this uh we can't allow it the good news is you know my my read of the U.N General Assembly has been a isolation and rejection of Russia by leaders across the world um you see Nations like China that have stood with Russia they're starting to get wary and starting to be isolated for their own anti-democratic activities you see these protests in Iran by courageous women who are tired of being kicked around by the morality police and the dictatorial government um there's there's popular sentiment on the move against tyrants these days and the U.N has to be clear and not muddled about you know where where the International Community stands Russia is the lead example but there there are many other situations in the world where being strong against Russian authoritarianism sends a message to other dictators Senator what do you make of the the concerns that people have and they are valid concerns that Russia continues to say that uh if our sovereignty and I'm doing air quotes with sovereignty if if anybody attacks any of these places that soon will decide that they're going to be part of Russia that'll be con uh considered an attack on Russia and hence Russia will use whatever defenses it has once again Vladimir Putin talked about his nuclear weapons again again this this week how do you as somebody in the armed services committee somebody who understands the world well process that well we I think it's a bluff like like Colonel vinman I think it's a big Bluff um the use of nuclear weapons Ali would would uh pose massive Fallout risk to Russian citizens using nuclear weapons anywhere in this theater it's not just gonna invite a coordinated International response that will be overwhelmingly catastrophic for Russia but the use of nuclear weapons also poses Fallout risk in Russia and um so I think it's a big Bluff um Putin is is dangerous because he has his back against the wall as you said he he had a plan to topple the Ukrainian government in three days it's gone poorly the whole world has seen it he's been humiliated before the entire world is forever friendship declaration with Xi Jinping before the Beijing Olympics now looks like kind of a joke and Xi Jinping is backing away from him and everybody knows it and Putin knows that they know it so he is in a tough spot but I still think the use of nuclear weapons has much more Downstream negative consequence for Russia and for Putin's hold on power than it does for other nations you know when we look at these things overseas we look at you mentioned Iran the struggle uh there that you look at the struggle in Ukraine for democracy what was very interesting is um uh earlier this week NBC came out with a news poll that shows threats to democracy was the single most important issue facing the country uh people who were polled had different views about threats to democracy and what they mean uh but what do you make of the stretch democracy actually out uh out ranking cost of living and jobs in the economy and and by some distance immigration Ally I'll tell you this um it is a very strange moment I'm 64 years old you would never have seen a poll where that would be the top issue because we would assume of course we're all Defenders of democracy I I was at an event yesterday at the University of Virginia where they're giving up giving out an annual Defenders of democracy award now normally if you go to a banquet or an award ceremony like that the person getting the award is a you know a Tibetan human rights activist or somebody who's active in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement the award winners yesterday were seven Capital police officers and three of the awards were given posthumously who defended us when the capital was under attack on January 6th the threat to democracy it might be Putin and Ukraine or it might be Donald Trump embracing Q Anon theories and promoting violence we see them at home and we see them abroad and the world has to link arms the the democracies in the world have to link arms and we're showing after maybe a period where we we were taking it for granted or we seemed indifferent to it we're showing a capacity to battle for it at home and Link arms with Nations around the world to battle for it globally and we should be grateful to other people fighting for it for making us aware of how serious matter it is Senator good to see you as always thanks for joining us Senator Tim Kaine is the Democrat of Virginia up next

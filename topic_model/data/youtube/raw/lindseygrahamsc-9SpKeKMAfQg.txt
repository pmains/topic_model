just hours from now the president of the United States we with lawmakers asking them to ease sanctions on Iran and negotiate a nuclear deal but could a bad deal actually lead to war well joining us now to answer is South Carolina congressman Lindsey Graham senator they have whatever sorry senator I will face the same good morning you know certainly a big day today with meetings going forward two ends two ends here arguing in terms of sanctions on Iran what's your position and what is this meeting John Kerry says if Congress takes up another round of sanctions that will lead to war and some people are saying a bad deal will lead to war the goal is not to have a war but what would be a bad deal from Israeli point of view if at the end of the day the deal allowed the Iranians the capability to develop a nuclear weapon if you left the centrifuges intact enough of them to produce a weapon down the road and the only thing between them producing a weapon is a bunch of UN inspectors that has never worked for Israel that would be a bad deal Secretary of State John Kerry says Israel wants every scrap of nuclear infrastructure dismantled we love that too but that's not possible at this time that is possible here's four things that would make up a good deal turn over all enriched uranium to the international community that's the UN resolution get out of the enrichment business dismantle the plutonium producing reactor at Arak the Israelis are never going to let that Rio rak night I all right yeah that will never be allowed to go operation because it could produce plutonium as heavy water reactor if you want a commercial nuclear program which is fine with me let the fuel cycle be controlled by the international community i'm going to introduce a resolution that defines a good deal as those four things and we'll see where the senate comes out on that yeah remember back in the day though for a while one administration was was trusting North Korea how'd that work out for us not good if you back off the sanctions which the president wants us to do if you infuse this event this regime with ten billion dollars and you don't dismantle their capability to produce a weapon the international community is going to say aha sanctions are behind us and they're going to race to do business with a run and that's exactly what happened in North Korea here's Benjamin weighing in on this very prospect this weekend in fact if you do it bad you you may get to the point where your only option is a military option so bad deal actually can lead you to exactly the place you don't want to be says he might bomb essentially with Saudi Arabia perhaps if this goes forward Obama has been able to bring the Israelis and the Arabs together unlike anybody in history it's amazing a bad deal will lead the war and a bad deal is allowing the Iranians the capability to produce a nuclear weapon you've got to dismantle that program to protect us all particularly Israel on lightning round we are talking about the Affordable Care Act be not so affordable care act how screwed up is it in your estimation the individual market is in disarray but the next shoe to drop nobody's talking about is when the employer mandate they got a year reprieve right about september-october of next year when the employer meant data is due to expire you're going to see a disruption of the health care market or employees you think it's bad for individuals wait do you get a notice from the employer when they have to put pen to paper they either going to drop your coverage or your premiums gonna go through the roof that's the untold story it won't be a Democratic senator or a House member left if this happens what's going to change in the interim I think what's going to happen I introduced legislation to allow states topped out every Obama friend has gotten a waiver why shouldn't each state decide if they want to stay in or out of the individual employee Monday if you want to stand in New York fine give us a chance to opt out in South Carolina how does this movie in democratic senators up for reelection are going to find a way to get this monkey off their back before next november interesting and that's how this ends senator thank you

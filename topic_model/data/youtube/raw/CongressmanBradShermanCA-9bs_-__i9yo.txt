  CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT BRAD SHERMAN WHO IS JOINING US RIGHT NOW. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR BEING  HERE. HERE'S ONE LINE THAT STUCK OUT  VERY MUCH FROM THE HOUSE SPEAKER JUST NOW. SHE SAID THAT THE HOUSE  DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IS NOT ON A  PATH TO IMPEACHMENT AND THAT'S  WHERE THE PRESIDENT WANTS YOU  GUYS TO BE. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE SPEAKER? >> I THINK WE'RE ON THE PATH TO  INVESTIGATE, TO INQUIRE AND TO  DEMONSTRATE TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE THAT THIS MAN HAS  COMMITTED HIGH CRIMES AND  MISDEMEANORS. ONCE WE HAVE THE PUBLIC WERE US, ONCE WE HAVE A CREDIBLE REASON  TO THINK THAT WE'LL GET 20  REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO VOTE FOR  REMOVAL AND ALL THE DEMOCRTIC  SENATORS THEN WE CAN MOVE  FORWARD.  >> BUT, CONGRESSMAN, RIGHT NOW  NANCY --  >> WE TAKE --  >> NANCY PELOSI MADE CLEAR THAT  YOU'RE -- NANCY PELOSI MADE  CLEAR THAT AT THIS POINT YOU'RE  NOT OPENING AN IMPEACHMENT  INQUIRY, NOT LAUNCHING  IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS,  INVESTIGATING THROUGH THE  COURTS, OF COURSE. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE COURTS. >> WELL, IT'S NOT JUST THROUGH  THE COURTS. WE HAVE A SERIES OF  INVESTIGATIONS. REMEMBER WATERGATE. THERE WERE A SERIES OF  INVESTIGATIONS ON THE ISSUE OF  HOW NIXON OPERATED DURING HIS  RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN. WE ARE CONDUCTING A SERIES OF  INVESTIGATIONS TO SHOW DID THE  PRESIDENT OBSTRUCT JUSTICE? HAS HE ENGAGED IN A VIOLATION OF THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE OF THE  CONSTITUTION, AND IS HE  OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS? AND WHETHER WE CALL IT AN  IMPEACHMENT HEARING OR AN  OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE INQUIRY  IS SOMETHING THE PRESS CAN CARE  ABOUT A LOT. I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT VERY MUCH. >> BUT YOU DO THOUGH. I'M FINDING THIS VERY  INTERESTING RIGHT NOW,  CONGRESSMAN, BECAUSE YOU DO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE WORD  IMPEACHMENT. YOU HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR  IMPEACHMENT FOR SOMETHING LIKE  TWO YEARS NOW. YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE  POSITION OF WHERE THE SPEAKER IS RIGHT NOW? >> I'M COMFORTABLE THAT  IMPEACHMENT HAS GOT TO BE  FOLLOWED BY REMOVAL. WHAT I DID IN JULY OF 2017 LONG  BEFORE ANYONE ELSE IS GO OUT  THERE AND DEMONSTRATE TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT NOW WE HAVE 800 -- 800 FEDERAL PROSECUTORS  SIGNING A FEDERAL LETNER SUPPORT OF AND THAT IS THAT THIS  PRESIDENT HAS OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE IN A MANNER HE WOULD BE INDICTED IF HE WASN'T PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES. THAT'S A HIGH CRIME AND THAT'S A REASON TO SAY THE LEGAL STANDARD HAS BEEN MET. NOW WE HAVE TO GET THE PUBLIC ON OUR SIDE, AND WE HAD THE  REPUBLICANS HIDING THIS IN  CONGRESS FOR TWO YEARS. NOW WE BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS  THAT WE SAW IN 1973 OF GETTING  THE PUBLIC ON OUR SIDE BY  SHOWING THEM THE FACTS, AND  THERE ARE SO MANY MORE FACTS FOR US TO DEMONSTRATE, SO I THINK  WE'RE -- AGAIN, IF YOU COULD  CALL IT AN IMPEACHMENT HEARING,  YOU COULD CALL IT A HIGH CRIMES  AND MISDEMEANORS INQUIRY. THE PRESS WOULD CARE. I DON'T. I JUST WANT TO GET THE FACTS OUT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND AT  THE SAME TIME IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TOWNS THAT'S NOT ALL  WE'RE DOING HERE.  >> I GET IT, BUT THE -- BUT THE  WORDS HERE DO MATTER. AN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING -- THE WORDS DO MATTER. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME  RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE IS UNITY AMONGST THE AK AMONGST THE CAUCUS THAT YOU'RE  NOT MARCHING ON A PATH TO  IMPEACHMENT.  >> WE'RE MARCHING ON A PATH WHEN WE GET A FAIR HEARING IN THE  SENATE. THAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE CHANGE  PUBLIC OPINION AND GET MORE  FACTS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A MULTI-STEP PROCESS  THAT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN ALMOST  TWO YEARS AGO.  >> STEVE COHEN, YOUR DEMOCRATIC  COLLEAGUE, HE SEEMED TO QUESTION NANCY PELOSI'S PATRIOTISM. HE WAS SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES JIM SCIUTTO AND POPPY HARLOW AND SAID THE ONLY REASON NOT TO MOVE TO IMPEACHMENT WOULD BE  POLITICS. DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM? >> WE NEED REPUBLICAN SENATORS  TO CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE. IF THAT -- IF GETTING TO THAT  POINT IS POLITICS, YOU CAN SAY  IT'S POLITICS, BUT EVERY  PROSECUTOR IN THIS COUNTRY WILL  SAY THEY DON'T INDICT UNLESS  THEY THINK THEY CAN GET A JURY  TO CONVICT, AND OUR JOB IS NOT  ONLY TO DEMONSTRATE AS WE  ALREADY HAVE THAT HE'S VIOLATED  THE HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS STATUTE, STANDARD, BUT THAT WE  WILL GET THE CONVICTION AND  REMOVAL IN THE SENATE, AND THAT  REQUIRES US TO EDUCATE THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. AT THE SAME TIME AS I SAID THIS  IS NOT THE ONLY THING GOING ON  IN CONGRESS.  >> RIGHT. THAT'S TRUE.  >> WE JUST PASSED SOME MAJOR  LEGISLATION.  >> NANCY PELOSI LISTED A LOT OF  THAT OUT RIGHT BEFORE SHE TOOK  QUESTIONS. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR  COMING IN. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.  >> THANK Y

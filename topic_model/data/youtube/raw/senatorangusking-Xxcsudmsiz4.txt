first i want to send my uh warmest thoughts to the people of houston i know what you're going through and i've seen it and and am following it and it's a it's a very tough time and it's i know it means a lot to them that you're there uh with them on this uh on this awful and this in this terrible time um what the russians are appear to be doing i think there are a couple of lessons to be learned from this number one there are no boundaries for what our adversaries will do number two the russians are doing something that the chinese in fact have been doing for many years which is essentially theft of intellectual property the estimates are that chinese theft of intellectual property has cost our economy billions of dollars so clearly this is one of the most important areas that we need to shore up our defenses and we we attended to this in a number of different ways in the report but uh the the the fundamental i think one of the fundamental issues is as i mentioned in my opening statement they have to understand that there's a price to be paid for this if the russians or the chinese or the iranians or whoever it is comes after us and does something like this and we we can attribute it to to a particular country there needs to be there need to be consequences there need to be results otherwise they'll keep doing it why wouldn't they so that's the kind of strategic area that we're talking about but then also we need to be more uh defense oriented it's very interesting that uh i can't remember 85 of the cyber risk rests upon individuals doing things like clicking on phishing emails in other words the most basic kind of cyber hygiene would be tremendously important in protecting our our companies and our country from these kinds of attacks i don't know how they got into those vaccine companies but it wouldn't be surprising at all if it was some kind of phishing expedition that got the credentials that got the password so the government has a lot of things that we can do and they're all in our report or many of them are in our report but we also need to support and encourage the citizens to understand the magnitude of this risk because it may not be that they hit the pentagon but they're going to try to hit smaller companies and and get into the system in that way so you raise a very important question that i think we we really have focused upon and must continue to do so

i come to the floor today with sadness and reluctance because we are actually debating an extraordinarily worthwhile even historic bill that would not only improve our infrastructure our roads and bridges and highways in the state of connecticut throughout the country but also provide jobs enable more economic growth promote the effort to put connecticut and our country back to work and my reluctance is that we are debating an amendment that distracts from that essential task the work that the nation elected us to do and to make our priority creating jobs and promoting economic growth we are debating an amendment that seems fundamentally flawed i am respectful as is everyone in this body of the moral convictions and religious beliefs that others may hold i believe that this amendment is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague it is unacceptably flawed in the way that it is written because it essentially gives every employer any time anywhere with respect to any medical condition any form of treatment the right to deny that essential health care and those services based on his or hers undefined religious beliefs or moral convictions quoting from the bill itself religious beliefs or moral convictions without any defining limits insurance companies can even deny a person coverage for mental health treatment or cancer screening or hiv and aid screening simply because that employer or insurance company may believe that the causes of those conditions somehow violate his or her religious beliefs or moral convictions this amendment would threaten access to a number of clinical preventive services such as diabetes screenings vaccinations or cancer screenings essential preventive services that have been proved to reduce health care costs and save lives and those services should be guaranteed to every american without cost in my home state of connecticut one of the smallest states in the country approximately 270 000 women would lose access to preventive care if this amendment is passed and around the country some 20 million women would lose that kind of access to preventive care that is a result that simply is unacceptable the amendment goes too far and it would endanger the lives of millions of americans would completely undermine the progress and we have made progress in providing crucial health care services to millions of individuals i oppose this amendment because of its practical implications because of its apparent unconstitutionality and because it flies in the face of sound public policy at a time when we are considering a bill that deservedly the transportation measure has broad widespread bipartisan support in this chamber and across the country we are again polarized republican versus democrat regrettably divided and potentially gridlocked because of an amendment that has nothing to do with transportation or putting america back to work that should be our task it is my priority it should be the priority of this chamber at this historic moment in our history when we are reviving a still struggling economy when people are hurting striving to find work and when we should be doing everything in our power to put america and connecticut back to work and enable economic growth

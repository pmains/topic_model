want to have my colleagues be aware of the first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to nagorno-karabakh Artsakh especially for demining efforts and expanding support to a health care and rehabilitation services especially those injured in mines the second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in the third is um chair of the Sindh caucus southern Pakistan Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings forced conversions of Hindu girls and after they've been kidnapped and then forced a force of forcible marriages and dr. Anwar lagari the brother of a dear friend of mine was subject to extradition extrajudicial killing four years ago so I hope that you can pledge to raise gross human rights violation and sinned with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with and I hope that you'll also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi Council it and to support a million and a half dollars a year so that the voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language now I want to pick up on mr. Connelly's comments cuz shogi was brutally murdered so far our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they can't visit Disneyland they can't these seventeen button men who kid won't get US Embassy's that's an inadequate response I'm gonna suggest a better response there are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy may not be in our interest but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons if you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw you should not trust them with nuclear weapons second even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future he's not a democratically elected leader he be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at any time and of course the Middle East doesn't need a new nuclear weapon what I've seen in this administration recently and it's just come out is a effort to evade Congress in to some extent evade your department and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing enrichment etc and we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called ip3 and others who seem very close to the Saudi regime in particular we've seen your assistant secretary of state Kris Ford say that say that the department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of other understanding which don't require congressional oversight or approval rather than through a 1-2-3 agreement and we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which are switch in normal course are made available to the public but are instead being kept secret all of which all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia so can I count on you and the administration to release these six they're called part 810 authorizations by the middle of this month I'll have to look into it can your staff prepare for us or you prepare for us a list of all the types of nuclear Commerce the administration believes it's entitled to engage in without a one two three agreement that's gone through congressional review take a look at that I can assure you that we will do our level best to comply with a law every day and if you believe that we're not doing that our obligations please let me know it appears to be in one case and in rent appears that this is an end run around the law in an effort to achieve a policy do we want to provide nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia before they enter into agreements for mountain or reprocessing and no enrichment we've been working we collected the United States covered the Department of Energy the State Department and others been working to get the Saudis have indicated they want civil nuclear power we've been working to make sure that they do but why wouldn't they want controls except for the reason that they want nuclear weapons what how do you generate an extra kilowatt by keeping the IAEA inspectors out yeah you know I can only tell you that the Islamic of a-prime very much very much wanted to do the same right they didn't want any of these things in either and we got we got it we treated Iran like an enemy if Saudi Arabia is hell-bent on developing a nuclear program that is uncontrolled and designed to make them a nuclear state or a possible nuclear state will we treat them as an enemy we are working to ensure that the nuclear power that they get is something we understand and doesn't present that risk that's the mission statement these six secret part 810 authorizations are inconsistent with that and I look forward to you making them available to the public or at least to this committee and with that I recognize my fellow head of the Asia subcommittee the ranking member thereof Ted Yoho Thank You mr. chairman miss

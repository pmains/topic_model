Mr chairman Mr wood congratulations on the good work of trout unlimited to advocate for our clean Waters and our Fisheries I note that in August trout unlimited with six other conservation organizations submitted joint comments with recommendations for the interagency working group regarding meaningful Good Samaritan proposals to remediate Historic AML sites and reprocessing of mine tailings and waste uh the comments did highlight the Clean Water acting circla as two primary barriers to making progress on AML Reclamation can you describe how targeted conditional liability protections and Reclamation efforts can help speed up the progress on cleanup of Legacy abandoned mine lands yes ma'am thank you for the kind words about trout unlimited we appreciate that um as I mentioned in my testimony one of the challenges we and this is this puts me in a very difficult situation because there's not a stronger advocate for the Clean Water Act than trout unlimited fish need Cold clean water every day um trout do anyway um The Challenge though is that as vital as that law is it is it is meant to stop people from polluting it's not it doesn't enable people to clean up the effects of pollution and so as I mentioned we have the ability to go in with a lot of these tailings for example the the solutions are fairly straightforward they're they're minor engineering problems with some of these places we're not talking about Superfund sites you dig a hole you line the hole you bulldoze the tailings into the hole put an impermeable liner over it put parent material over it dig a French drain and then you can walk away from a lot of these sites but um we can spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars to do that kind of work on a site and to bury these tailings but and we might be able to get to 95 98 of Clean Water Act standards but it might be another 2 million you might need to do a constructed Wetland to get to a hundred percent and and once you implicate once you start dealing with moving water running water it implicates the Clean Water Act and you're required by law to get to 100 or we would become um you know a potentially responsible party uh in in the government size and and liable to Citizen suit from anyone so it's just it's it's a wonderful law we don't want to change the Clean Water Act in any way shape or form we just want to demonstrate um the prowess of of communities of of Good Samaritans to clean up these abandoned Minds um and and do so in a in a manner that you know makes the environment materially better and then hopefully we can take work with Congress to take this idea to scale well thanks for your willingness to participate and put your financial wherewithal Behind these projects um Mr oxberry how applicable are pilot projects for low-risk AML sites like those in my home state of Wyoming and is there room to implement Good Samaritan remediation more broadly uh uh thank you Senator lamis uh again there are tens of thousands of hazardous abandoned mine sites Across the Nation uh we're looking under this legislation at just 15 pilot projects uh and and we think that would be a a great start but we want to learn from these projects and maintain momentum and the best way to build upon these pioneering projects is to ensure that we apply lessons from the projects to Future Good Samaritan comprehensive legislation western states are an excellent laboratory for testing the system uh rather than contemplating an extension of the pilot projects we would hope and prefer that the lessons learned from the pilot program be used to inform comprehensive legislation uh in the meantime these pilot projects will help us further understand how to best design projects to make them both attractive to Good Samaritans while ensuring that environment final cleanup quality is maintained and we'll also be able hopefully to make sure that western states have a leadership role in the design and implementation of the program thank you and my last question is for director Cabrera um can these permits be designed in a way so they are limited in scope to make sure that no one can mine explore or conduct other activities outside the scope of the permit under this legislation of Senator Loomis absolutely the EPA will have the ability to set forth specific permit conditions to the particular pilot project and as far as I read the legislation um uh EPA is going to have a broad authority to write permit conditions and as long as the applicant agrees to those permit conditions the permit May limit uh many of activities that occur site in terms of scope and ability the law itself is very narrow and a narrow reprocessing materials without additional lighting so the answer to your questions thank you all Mr chairman I yield back

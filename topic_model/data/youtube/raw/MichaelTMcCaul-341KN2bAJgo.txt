the high-tech community and be a part of the high-tech community and get your input into legislation so we have buy-in from the stakeholders uh i think that's what we should be doing as members of congress and and i pledge in the next congress that's the way i intend to move forward working with your sector it's fundamentally important we're here today to talk about big data i say big data is really smart data imagine like the library congress being able to search it in a matter of seconds this could be one of the most revolutionary things since the internet you look at super computers that come out in the internet but this is the ability to take all the all the data that's out there more than the library of congress and make some sense out of it i look at patterns and trends and there's so much data within the federal government itself that this commission and i want to applaud this commission for their report this report will be very helpful i think to the federal government in terms of how to properly analyze this data so we can see trends and patterns um and the applications are uh everywhere whether it's law enforcement related whether it's business related whether it's identifying waste fraud abuse and god knows we have plenty of that in the federal government uh this could be enormously helpful in saving the taxpayer a tremendous amount of dollars at a time when we need to be saving money so i think the work of this commission has really been outstanding i look forward to working with tech america in this to steed square right here as we move forward in terms of applications within the federal government and and elsewhere because as i mentioned as i look at all the problems that we face and there are many i really can't think of one that technology can't provide the solution to and that's why your sector is so important to me uh and i think that's why it's so important should be important to the congress and through the high-tech caucus really the goal has always been in a bipartisan way to really call attention and educate members of congress on the issues of high tech and cyber security and other tech related issues stem education you know federal workforce that can deal with technology they're all just vitally important so let me commend all of you for being here today um uh i'm supportive of this commission and this document and finally i just want to again thank tech america for your great leadership in providing this valuable report not only for the congress but for the american people thank you very much

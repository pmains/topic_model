so let's have some real talk on afghanistan by now you've heard that uh joe biden has no intention of extending the august 31st deadline that deadline was self-imposed by joe biden himself this entire time and because he self-imposed it well the taliban made it their redline last couple days they've been beating their chests saying that's our red line you have to be out by then now our answer to that should and should always be uh or what what are you gonna do about it um and if you try to get in the way of us getting our people out we'll kill you that should be our answer just to be clear unfortunately that's not joe biden's answer and there's this claim by the administration that look anybody who wants to leave afghanistan can leave that there will be no americans stranded that's what jensaki said anthony blinken the secretary of state has said that he's confident that we'll get all americans out by august 31st this is a lie this is a flat out lie we have sources on the ground and i'm going to tell you right now what they're saying what you could expect as an american citizen or an afghan ally trying to make it to the gates of kabul airport it is an unbelievably bad situation the truth is that the outer security perimeter the first id check that somebody goes through is the taliban the state department's actually listed the taliban to check people's ids now i don't know what world we live in where we think we can trust that the taliban is going to in a neutral way go through people's passports and ids and not try to uh take them away or stop them from coming in because the truth is we've heard many many reports taliban are actively hunting american citizens in the streets of kabul and of course throughout the country and they're certainly actively hunting and killing people who worked with us people like our interpreters this is a fact this is an undeniable fact it is also undeniable that many americans have actually been turned away at the gates okay because the processing has it ebbs and flows um right now it's at a trickle and it'll only decrease if we actually say that we're going to leave by august 31st because if you say you're going to leave by august 31st well you have to stop the processing days before that because it takes a few days to extract all of our military personnel and all their equipment safely which a lot of people on the ground by the way think there's a very low chance of happening effectively so we might leave things behind if you do make it through the gates again you might not even get through it all americans that are stranded um we do have the ability to extract them we do have the ability of special military units to go out and get them but at least one occasion that i know of state departments shut an operation down they actually were about to leave our military was about to leave and go get americans and the state department without explanation shut it down state department's in charge in all of this department of defense is the implementers right they might give it some advice but the state department's in charge that's actually what's happening on the ground it's important to note that even if you do make it to the gates you make it past the taliban uh death squads you make it past the taliban security perimeter and you make it through the thousands of people that are potentially crushing you i mean our soldiers are picking up dead bodies because so many people have been crushed and trampled over by by the crowds if you do make it there it's not as if there's a a process there's not as if there's a line that people walk through and documents get checked it's a marine who has to stand up and yell at a bullhorn for some names on a list and just hope that those people are there but it's pure luck that people are getting in at this point it's pure luck and so to say that we're going to get everybody out by august 31st that's fantasy it's not true it's a complete lie so what are our options well look we have to acknowledge that the old plan didn't work and that the old plan has gone to hell and we need to acknowledge that we now need to reset the chess board that we need a new plan if as a country we actually care about getting our american citizens and our allies out and i think we should i think a lot of people agree with that so what do we do well we simply first of all say that we're going to stay longer how much longer as long as it takes we will leave when we are ready when we think that we've gotten everybody we want to get out out carefully note the administration keeps using this line that they're getting americans out who want to be extracted well here's the thing they're actually counting people as not wanting to get extracted if they tried to get through with their family and we wouldn't let them through so here's the scenario uh a father a father of a family of four let's say is a u.s citizen but nobody else is a u.s citizen his wife or his kids and so they've been told well you can come through but not your wife and kids so you have to choose now secretary of state says that's not happening but we have multiple reports on the ground from this happening and so now they're being counted as somebody well because obviously they're not going to leave their wife and kids and so they're being counted as an american that didn't want to leave so they're checked off the list but of course they wanted to leave and of course we should be allowing immediate family and even some extended family to leave with american citizens in an emergency situation like this protecting our people has to be a priority but for this administration it doesn't seem to be look it is it is almost impossible at this point to get everybody out through the airport in kabul it's also a very soft and easy target there's now reports that terrorist groups like isis might plan on actually bombing taking a v-bed which is a vehicle-born ied uh taking it through the gates and launching attacks on kabul airport you need other options in a situation like this you know we left bagram foolishly that had more airstrips and more capability to get more flights through you just need more places for people to go that has to happen at this point again the the situation on the ground has changed radically we need biden to recognize that we need biden to actually take action that protects american citizens and protects our allies protects our dignity in all of this he's refusing to do it we need more public pressure on him to change course and do what's right here

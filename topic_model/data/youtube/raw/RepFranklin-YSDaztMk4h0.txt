thank you congresswoman miller appreciate your efforts and leadership on this very critical and vital topic i rise today in defense of the god-given right of parents to guide and shape the education of their children preparing our children for the world and teaching them the skills they need to be successful adults is not only a parent's right it's also their responsibility unfortunately it is one of many of our sacred rights that my democrat colleagues want to rip away and give to the federal government having already corrupted our higher education system with anti-american ideology the democrats are now pushing their indoctrination program down to k through 12. this may sound like partisan rhetoric but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle aren't hiding their intentions their build back broke program includes a 10 billion dollar billion dollar environmental justice slush fund that will be used to push the green new deal in universities they are incorporating divisive racist ideologies like critical race theory into classrooms across the country they will try to say that's not true but don't buy their lie regardless of what you name it any curriculum that teaches kids that they are inherently racist or hopelessly victims simply because of the color of their skin is itself racist it runs counter to the american ideal that's not freedom of ideas that's indoctrination they are working actively to push parents out of every aspect of our children's edu education don't believe it in loudoun county virginia just across the river here any parent wanting to review the crt components of the curriculum is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement a legally binding document that forbids them from sharing what they find out what is it in that curriculum that they don't want people to find out about and once they find out about it why don't they want it to be shared i come from florida a state where we value transparency and the sunshine we have very strict sunshine laws this would never fly in the state of florida we're not afraid of what our government is doing there in fact we want people to know more about it the covet pandemic and our country's response to it will have long lasting effects on our nation perhaps one of the most destructive of these aspects is the developmental damage inflicted on our children because their needs were placed last if there's any silver lining at all to the pandemic it's that parents whose children who were subjected to school shutdowns were finally able to experience firsthand what they're being taught they've responded with anger and frustration at the politicians who have allowed this travesty to occur unfortunately the democrat response to this nationwide movement has been to treat concerned parents as domestic terrorists and they've weaponized the justice department in an effort to get these parents to sit down and shut up terry mcauliffe's statement that he doesn't believe parents should tell schools what to teach was a horrifying peer into the soul of what radical progressives truly believe that big brother the federal government knows best and should be given full autonomy to control our lives but virginians put the democrats on notice last night america rejects their efforts to ram through a toxic platform of to grave government dependence this doesn't just include federal overreach in our education system but also in the outrageous spending programs that will destroy our economic prosperity democrats are trying to sell americans a bill of goods they don't want that they can't afford and with money the country doesn't have during election years we often hear the american people ask how they're doing compared to four years ago i would ask them now how are you doing compared to 10 months ago our education system is falling apart our southern border is a disaster violent crime is skyrocketing across the country our botched withdrawal from afghanistan has diminished our standing on the world stage and inflation is running rampant every action the biden administration takes is hurting our country americans know they're worse off but democrats appear to be unaware or apathetic as i look across the aisle where are the traditional liberals if you're still there it's time to come out of hiding and stand up to the radical progressives who are destroying the very fabric of the country i know you love stop listening to the dc and city inner city echo chambers those are not the voice of america show the american people that you are listening to them by standing against divisive rhetoric in our schools stopping outrageous government spending and supporting law and order yesterday's election should serve as a wake-up call to all who wish to save america from destruction it's not too late and with that i yield back

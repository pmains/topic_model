Chris Kyle had a front-row seat for all of that savagery and now there is a push to award Chris Kyle the Medal of Honor posthumously Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield were killed at a Texas gun range two years ago the shooter was convicted of their murders just this week texas congressman Roger Williams introduced a new bill to honor Chris Kyle congressman welcome it's good to have you here today good to be here so why do you think that Chris Kyle deserves the medal of honor and is it unusual for the push for this to come from a congressman instead of the White House well I think Chris Kyle certainly deserves the medal I mean you look at four tours volunteered for tours in Iraq countless number of Americans that he saved I think that his actions certainly warranted and I think it's another good way to tell his family and our veterans that are currently in service and those there that are that are retired that we appreciate them we appreciate their efforts and we love them there's not a lot of people in this administration right now they're trying to defend our military and I think this is just an opportunity for us to say how much we appreciate and understand what he did and thank you for the lives that were safe well when I think back on Chris Kyle's life and the fact that every moment that he was protecting our soldiers and Marines his life was in danger and you think about other people who have received the Medal of Honor and the people that they were able to save in combat and clearly he saved so many of our people in the middle of these combat situations but I guess I have to ask you straight out do you ever foresee a moment where President Obama will be handling handing the medal of honor to take I'll in honor of her husband do you think that will ever happen well I pray that it will happen I mean I can't answer for President Obama we've got to begin the process as we started your state to get our bill and get it on the on the floor get the House and Senate to pass it and get it on President Obama's desk I can't imagine him not doing this but i can't speak for him and I can't worry about that we need to get the process going so we can honor a Chris Kyle his family and all our veterans out yeah we spoke yesterday and over the last couple of days in fact with marcus luttrell who wrote lone survivor he was a very close friend of Chris Kyle's and he received the Navy Cross it was given to him by president george w bush as we can see in this picture here for his heroic acts and bravery in the war in afghanistan so I mean that that's the moment that you wish for correct sir that's the moment I wish for I believe it will happen and it started yesterday to to do the things to honor him and our military a lot of our viewers would agree with you I think what should they do if they want to support what you're doing well I think they can they can certainly go on on their websites and let us know that they support what we're doing and talk to their fellow congressmen to get on board and support this when it gets to the house floor in the Senate floor and we need to hear from everybody and I think it's the right thing to do and I believe that it will happen all right thank you very much sir I know governor Greg Abbott has commemorated a day februari second Chris Kyle day in Texas and no doubt he supports it too thanks for talking with us today congressman thank you for

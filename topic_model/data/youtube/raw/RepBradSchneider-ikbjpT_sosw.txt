Mr. Speaker, this year we’re again experiencing
terrible gun violence that destroys lives, tears apart families, devastates communities
and puts a stain on our nation. Sadly, after thousands of senseless deaths,
after Sandy Hook, after the Pulse Night Club, after Las Vegas, and so many more, this body
has taken no positive action. Just the now tragically routine moments of
silence. And then back to business as usual. But this week, this Congress will, in fact,
take action. Action making it easier for dangerous people
to carry concealed guns throughout the country. It’s inconceivable to me that this bill
is what comes to the floor from the debate about gun safety. Concealed Carry Reciprocity allows people
from states with the loosest safety standards, or no standards at all, to carry a firearm
across the country, irrespective of our local laws. I’ll give one example: in my state of Illinois,
people who have two DUIs within five years cannot get a concealed carry permit. But this bill would override our state law,
rendering ours, and every other state legislature virtually helpless to protect their citizens. I rise today in strong opposition to the reckless
and dangerous concealed carry reciprocity bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

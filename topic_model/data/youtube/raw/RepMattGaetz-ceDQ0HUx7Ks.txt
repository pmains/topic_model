a member of the House Judiciary and iron services committee and Congressman it's a great of you to be here I I wanted to just ask you you know it was interesting and Lawrence saying he was looking at the tone of the room do you expect a respectful audience or will we see histrionics on the part of the Dems will Luo Democrats were for a wall before they were against it and now they're against a speech before they even hear it and so when it comes to the tone of the room it's sort of one that is precast and baked in I expect you'll hear from the president a call to abandon the politics of resistance that put us in a shutdown instead of putting the priorities of border security first I expect the president's also tout the substantial achievements of this administration from the deregulation agenda to tax cuts to historic criminal justice reform the president obama never would have been able to deliver but Lou my personal feeling is one of being truly crestfallen because my first choice for guest for the State of the Union turned me down and so I'm wondering Lou are you going to tell your viewers or am I gonna have to tell them well since you have mentioned it I didn't want to presume but I do want to thank you congressman Gates was kind enough to invite me to to join him at the State of the Union tonight but this day job of mine or is it an evening job of mine I got in the way and I do appreciate it sincerely by the way you're that committed to your viewers Lou that you wouldn't you have never been to a State of the Union I understand him and you're so committed to delivering the truth that that I think that's very admirable but look I I expect that tonight regardless of the president's tone and tenor and calls for unity you'll see every person who's trying to measure the drapes in the Oval Office offer their hot takes and I that just will pale in comparison to I think the robust message you'll hear from the president the and I do want to say on your invitation not only have I never actually attended a State of the Union address yours is the first invitation I've ever received to do so and I am deeply grateful congressman thanks so much we'll have to have you next year Lou you got it thanks so much appreciate

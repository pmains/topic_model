Thank You mr. chairman and thanks to all of you gentlemen for being here appreciate your testimony as well as your preparation for being here to testify Thank You mr. Johansson if I could you talked about well I come from the Central Coast of California I think my committee members are going to get sick of me saying I come from the salad bowl of the world where there's over 100 specialty crops grown there those types of crops we can't just run a machine through the fields unfortunately we need a labor force to go in there and pick them obviously with the immigration issues that we've been having I mean you talk to farmers for the past year and and then some they basically say you know what even with the drought water is not the number one issue labor is the number one issue you said that there are some pixie's you mentioned they rise and number of front you know from seventy seventy two thousand one hundred and sixty-five thousand what else can be done when it comes to the h-2a program what can we be focused on cuz I believe that that's that's going to be you know that's where we can go to help alleviate the situation yeah and certainly I would defer any policy responses to when we get confirmation of a new secretary and I'll just I was just noting that I think over the past several years Congress both in the house and the Senate side had contemplated adjustments to the h-2a program to make it more workable for farmers to use that program to get a more stable supply of labor and I think in those various bills there's a good number of ideas that could work with both labor or with USDA depending on how those different facilitating adjustments were made so be glad to put a more formal response together for you for the record and certainly would like to defer to the new secretary when he has a chance to get on board understood I look forward to that response thank you very much I yield back my time

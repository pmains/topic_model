I rise today on behalf of our 911 first responders and their families urging all members of Congress to support passage of the never forget the heroes Act HR 70 62 which would permanently fund the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund and extend its authorization to 20 90 regardless of party affiliation and regardless of which district or state you come from it is imperative that right out of the gate of the next Congress starting next month that this legislation is immediately passed and sent to the president to become law first responders who worked on the pile day and night aiding in the search rescue and cleanup efforts we're breathing in toxic debris - they're now known to have caused over 50 different types of cancer James Zadroga was one of those fearless leaders he was also the first NYPD officer whose death in 2006 was connected to toxic exposure at the World Trade Center site the James de drogas 9/11 health and Compensation Act was later signed into law in 2011 to help our 911 first responders five years later the droga Act was permanently reauthorized and included 4.6 billion for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund over five years which was established to provide compensation for the victims of 9/11 and their families however we're hearing from the special master of the fund that this funding quote may be insufficient to compensate all claims representing a district just over 50 miles from Ground Zero fighting for the Americans affected on September 11th isn't just my job it's personal whether it's losing a loved one or known someone who volunteered on the pile each and every one of my constituents including myself has been affected before Congress passed the permanent reauthorization of this joga Act I vividly recall so many first responders who had fallen ill we're forced to come to our nation's capitol and beg for the benefits they rightfully earned these 911 first responders live not only New York but 433 of the 435 congressional districts across this country this isn't just a New York issue this isn't a democratic or republican party platform or political football this is a responsibility we all shoulder as Americans first and foremost it's the spirit of our nation and it is who we are as a people these were the very men and women who in the face of evil we're willing to put it all on the line to help save their fellow Americans who ran into the towers while everyone else was running out it is unconscionable the time again they've been forced to come crawling to Washington DC to plead their case as to why they're worthy of our support it was heartbreaking and sickening and I hope we have learned our lesson we must pass this legislation at the beginning of the 116th Congress so these first responders don't have to go through all of this all again so they can focus on their health and not be forced to travel to Washington DC on their own time dozens of times for the benefits they have more than earned this past September 11th 17 years since the attacks we came together as we always do to remember those who were taken from us on that day but this year marked an especially harrowing occasion by the end of this year it's anticipated that more people will have died from 9/11 related illnesses than were killed on 9/11 and over 175 of those deaths occurred just this year Jimmy Martinez was one of those hundred 75 diagnosed with bone marrow cancer he went into remission in 2016 a year after the Zadroga Act permanent reauthorization he responded to the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center again on 9/11 and came to the aid of so many in the aftermath of superstorm sandy this August he died a 26-year veteran of the FDNY just as there were so many who fought for this Ajoke Act that were not here to fight for its reauthorization in 2015 Jimmy's just one of the so many who are unable to continue this fight today that's why it's up to us to fight for others like Jimmy for those who risk so much for us but they need our help Congress must take action to ensure every family receives the compensation they're entitled to as soon as possible they have earned nothing less on that horrific day in the face of the worst of humanity these men and women were the best of it in honor of them and the families who carry on their memory Congress wants to do its job and permanently fund the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund in the aftermath of 9/11 we vowed we never forget and I'm going to make sure of it

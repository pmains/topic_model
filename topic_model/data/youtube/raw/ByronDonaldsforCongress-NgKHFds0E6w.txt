joe biden is on damage control after the comments that critics say is derogatory to minority voters here's what he said what you all know but most people don't know unlike the african-american community with notable exceptions the latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things our next guest says biden's remarks highlight the racist views many white liberals hold florida state representative and congressional candidate for u.s congress byron donalds joins us now byron good morning to you how significant of a guest was this for joe biden griff first of all thanks for having me on the show uh this is not a gaff this is actually what white liberals across the country think when it comes to black voters they believe they have a hold on black voters in the democrat party that black people don't have some different thoughts but what they don't realize is that black voters across our country we're liberals and conservatives we're democrats we're republicans we're libertarians and we're also no party affiliation uh individuals we decide who we want based upon the best person but the the real thing that's really a problem in america is that you have white liberals like joe biden who believe that they own the black vote but we're going to show them in november that they don't so do you think byron that we will see at the ballot box black voters that didn't want their vote to be taken for granted i definitely believe so listen i had a conversation with a friend of mine from college we're the same age she's a black female that lives in fort lauderdale florida she's watching what's happening in our streets across america she doesn't like what she sees she doesn't like the fact that she feels that the party that's that's her current registration registrative party the democrat party is leaving her behind she feels that party's going too far to the left and i think you have many black voters in this election cycle are not just looking for the party that they've always known they're looking for a party that provides real opportunities and real solutions not just for the black community but for all of america well now byron biden tried to walk it back in a tweet clarifying it do you think that will uh at least cover up for this recent gaffe no i don't and like i said it's not a gaffe this is what joe biden truly thinks people are not have not forgotten what he said when he was on a breakfast club with charlotte main to god about how if you vote for donald trump then you ain't black i haven't forgotten that i'm not going to forget this one and i think what joe biden is going to realize in november when he loses this election is that you can't take black votes for granted frankly you can't take any votes for granted your job is to earn the support of the american people not assume that you have it byron donald's running for the 19th congressional district in florida thanks byron we should point out we invited your competitor to come on they were not available so we'll see if they want to join us at some point

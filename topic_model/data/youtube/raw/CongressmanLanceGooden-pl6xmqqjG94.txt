[Music] all right the coronavirus shutting down campuses across the country you probably feel this or know this or feel it directly at least 3 million students now impacted as close to a hundred universities and colleges move their classes online so was it say about your money that you spent on room and board our next guest says students forced out should be fully refunded joining us right now is Texas congressman Lance Gooden congressman that seems to be logical and the only lawful thing to do do you project a problem well I do project a problem some schools are doing the right thing some haven't made up their minds my hope is that they will do the right thing and congressional action is not necessary but if you pay for room and board and you're being kicked out of your dorm it only makes sense that you would get that money back if I cancel a hotel reservation even if it's non-refundable hotels which would still love for me to come our refunding my deposit my room and my room across the nation but hotels are still open for business these schools are kicking students out and saying you're on your own so if that's the case they need to be refunding these room and board costs right and of course for a semester if you cancel the whole semester that's a different story how could you possibly charge people they only used a few weeks of the semester right that's that's right and you know students are easy to take advantage of there they're not historically voters they're not loud they don't have lobby teams working for them so they need their members of Congress to step up for them hopefully it's not necessary hopefully our universities and colleges will do the right thing all right you got Harvard middle Middlebury and Amherst or some of the schools that will prorate room and board starting on March 15th so a lot of them maybe want to apply it to the next semester if you're an underclassmen might that be acceptable to you it might be if I'm coming back the next semester if I'm graduating in two months or if I decide to go somewhere else then I want to be sure I get that money back but really students don't probably probably don't have the means if you're a low income student if you're on a scholarship maybe you don't have anywhere to go back to so you need that money right now I am hard pressed to accept the idea that universities need that money more than the students they're kicking out absolutely you see the parents are usually writing those checks so I think the parents got to be proactive and go out there and fight for it like everything else usually to get into that school the other thing to think about which is maybe for another time is what about the athletes if you're a lacrosse player baseball player anybody playing a spring sport you're not playing so do you come back next year and if you come back next year what about the incoming class of freshmen is gonna be any scholarship money available for them right do you lose your eligibility for the the minimum the maximum number of years you can participate does this year count there's a lot of decisions that are gonna have to be made in the coming months NC double-a and everything like that but I think it's great that you're getting ahead of it a lot of parents who resonates with especially my house my daughter's a freshman she was told don't come back you're gonna do this from a remote location come get your stuff what was she giving her money back we have not addressed that that bridge has not been crossed she just found out that yesterday that's why this segment is so perfect for us appreciate it Thank You congressman thanks a lot getting ahead of it we'll stay with it

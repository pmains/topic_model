we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks uh greatest podcast ever and uh of course by now just by you've probably given it five stars already i don't know why you wouldn't um but we have a really special guest with us today andy stumpf and um you might have heard from him he also he has the second greatest podcast ever uh and also i don't think you probably know this um he put me through buds he was my second phase instructor but also proctor which we'll get into what that actually means all-around great guy does a lot of great things still outside of the seal teams and we've maintained um in close contact ever since um i i believe andy will often say about me even though he was my instructor i was a bit of a hero of his is that right andy i don't know if i've ever used those words ever associated with you i think you may have said them about me it's written them they have written them did you did you force me to write them did you threaten me and then make me right sure it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what it kind of matters they've been under at the time oh man yeah we've known each other for uh quite some time for sure and so you know today i want to go into you know i think we should shoot a little bit about our about our history but but um we've been trying to plan this for a while we've been planning to schedule this for a little while now and i reached out to you yesterday because i'm like look let's just get this done especially with everything going on in afghanistan you've done multiple deployments there you've got opinions on it and i kind of want to work through those opinions i want to see where we agree and disagree i think most veterans kind of come out around the same place uh yeah from what i've seen um but there's just there's just a lot more to unpack here than the general public realizes that's been the case for a long time i'm very frustrated with how we've oversimplified the situations in places like afghanistan and iraq and these so-called endless wars i i'm frustrated by that from a public policy standpoint and um so we're going to unpack that but but first what is a proctor uh help help us understand that what is it what does a second phase instructor proctor and why did you call our class a bunch of turds and then quit on us why don't you guys actually that was if i did then you resigned you resigned temporarily you were so mad at us i can't even remember what we did i can't either and let's be honest it's a tactic that i sometimes have to use with my kids right there's it's all about connecting with your audience you know you have to figure out is it going to be the hammer of justice that gets them to do stuff or do you have to be the dis disappointed parent that says i actually can't be around you guys anymore because you disgust me and that's what worked well with your class i mean maybe it had something to do with the leadership it's hard to say but okay so a proctor um for people i don't know how much we talked about this because you and i we did a podcast actually on uh my show as well so people are curious about our relationship they can go back and listen to that we chatted for a few hours on anything we may miss today but buds is three phases long um there's a pre-phase i don't know if they necessarily count that as an official one but there's an instructor cadre and of course it's the military so it is a rank driven organization so for you the class going through the class has an oic because they're a mix of enlisted an officer and on the instructor side of the house instead of the class leader coming and talking to a variety of instructors what they do is they designate one point of contact that is what would you what would be in boy scout terms the den leader you know whatever term you would want to reduce it down to you're a den leader yeah it would be more appropriate for the girl scouts though i don't know what they call him the you know the cookie leader or whatever it is that's you know so in each phase there's a lot of hand-holding there's a lot of hugging that occurs so much yes so in every phase uh they assign an instructor so in first phase i'm not sure who your proctor was but i did a turnover actually might have been dan fowls i think um but we did a turnover and they kind of read me in on the class the rank structure kind of the top five performers the bottom five for performers and it's i mean more than anything it's an administrative role you guys would come to me for uh you know the schedule and information specifically on what's going on and then i could come to you because you were the class oic and interface and just you know it's it's a single point of communication because i think there was 15 second phase instructors and how many guys were in your class it was 60 70 80 something like that sounds about right that sounds right it would be impossible to try to have good communication absent those two point of contact so that's really all it is and it shifts you do a one class you see them from the first day to the end and then you kind of just rotate through on the proctor side it has nothing to do with rank it kind of just has to do with where you are in the line and uh yeah i mean that's really the role there the class is your responsibility if the other instructors have questions about the class or what's going on they come they came to me as opposed to a random member of your class and it's an important uh part of the architecture there because it just it it truly helps the communication in the classes to seamlessly go through the phases so you're a particularly interesting instructor to us um because you just come back from a deployment or you had just been healing up from an injury on a deployment where you got shot in iraq i believe and um it's not like you got lost an eye or anything so you were kind to be honest you were kind of complaining a lot about your injury you know again it's like i don't know what the big problem was but uh i got hit with shrapnel once so i know your pain um just i hit the laser i got hit with a laser in my eye so i know your opinion ugh yeah actually that's kind of terrifying to be honest the first part you have to watch it happen that's true because i've gotten prk too um so so but anyway you were you you were coming off um some pretty interesting experiences you had been at i believe blue squadron um gold before that and um you know the which is development group whatever it's all it's nobody everybody calls it still team six everybody calls the sales team six now and have fun don't spend too much time and um so you were back you were and often times in the seal teams coming back to be a buds instructor is a bit of a break uh especially if you know if you've just been shot for instance and uh that's often the kind of guys that come through i mean you're coming through after uh after a couple deployments um or many more than that and um you know so you had a lot of you had a lot to tell us you had a lot of um experience to give us and before that you'd been to afghanistan already i believe uh yeah three times three times before 2007 or just total three times i was in afghanistan in 2002 2003 2004 and then back in 2010. so yeah it was uh three of the four times i had been there been there it already occurred right i guess let's just get into it um how cause i've only been once um you've been three times i mean how did it change over time and you know in each time we went what was the kind of frustration going through your head with with the strategic mission given to us and how that actually played out on the ground how could it have been communicated different or did you even think about that stuff because because to be honest i'm not sure a lot of guys did we were just kind of happy to be out and fighting for our country yeah i mean oh god i don't know if there's enough storage device on any medium to truly capture how much time it would take for me to explain how i feel because you described it in the beginning i think very correctly and i think it's something that has is lost the complexity of it not only from like for you and i like i can i'm not an expert in afghanistan and that's one thing that i wish people would realize is just because you had your boots on the ground in afghanistan it doesn't make you an expert in the country like i'm not an expert in the geopolitics or the policy or anything that happened above a tactical level i can tell you about the different provinces that i've been to you know the differences between the rc north south east and west you know there's everything from the hindu kush to like star wars type um you know deserts there and everything in between i can tell you about the partner force that i worked with a lot the a and the amp and a little bit of the partner force i worked with when i was at development group i can tell you about some of the people and some of the culture but i see so many people getting up on their soapbox trying to talk about the country and what has happened there and what's happening there now is if there's some expert and the reality is they're just they're not and i think that's one thing that's important for people to take pause is just because you you know you wore the american flag on your uniform you got issued for a bit it doesn't make you an expert in everything especially at things beyond the tactical level unless you you know had multiple stars on your shoulders and at that point anyway i would say you're largely you're detached from it and you're in much more of a policy perspective but it's like trying to describe what's going on now is like trying to watch a complicated situation unfold through a pinhole and and it's moving by really fast um you know in the vets that i have talked to and i haven't asked you this question directly but everybody that i have talked to if you spent about six seconds with our partner force over there you realize that what is happening now in afghanistan was going to happen whenever united states left so let's say we had left 10 years ago this still would have happened but say we left 10 years from now it's still it still would have happened and you and as soon as you entered with a slightly less chance with a slightly less chance for sure but but but in the end they don't have that kind of which sounds crazy to people because they think of afghanistan as this warrior culture but the people we train with do not have the warrior culture it is it is not like the american military um yeah i mean you've trained if you trained like south korean seals or it's it's a very different culture they just don't have whatever it is we create in america and i'm not sure what that is i'm not either and i think it's important for people you know maybe to ponder if afghanistan ever has been in its history what the west would want it to be and if it's even capable for them to ever become what we would want them to be my answer to that is no they never have been and they never will be and to say we had left 10 years before now it probably would have been easier from a logistical perspective and maybe we wouldn't have left as much stuff behind and maybe 10 years from now it would have been even more complex but bottom line the country at least in my opinion was going to funnel on itself because they didn't have the ability to stand up for themself in the way that you and i are conditioned to our military service to think that a soldier should behave and i know that that won't be understood by a lot of people and i apologize that i don't have a better explanation for it but literally i have not talked to a single veteran that served there that is surprised by what happened they are surprised by the velocity with which it happened but not the end state in and of itself and today and i think that's that's i think that is a point that most of us agree on um which is but then the question becomes okay so then what do you do and this is what's been driving everybody crazy um and what's been driving me crazy again is the oversimplification of it it's it seems to me that the american public has believed that there's only two options either we pull out we bring the troops home you know and we make ourselves feel good because that slogan makes us feel good bring the troops home we're going to protect guys like you protect guys like me i always say i don't need your damn protection that's we're all volunteer force it's not why i went over there and i'm very i get very frustrated by that sort of moral superiority argument um but it does seem to me that people think it was either that or nation building and the truth is there's a lot in between there's a lot of options in between those two rather extreme options and as far as what i've been advocating for for years now is that in between option in my mind we found a good stalemate we found a good in between at a very low cost we were keeping some sort of stabilization in a place like afghanistan and at the very least offering a strategic objective of denying a full-on terrorist safe haven um to me that seems like a good deal you know because a lot of veterans are asking what the hell was my service for what what did i even do this for uh was it all a waste and i'm like no it was not a waste because you know what we got for the last 20 years no more 911s that's what we got and that seems like a pretty good deal now did we oftentimes maybe expend too much blood and treasure just to meet that objective it would seem in hindsight that that's probably true in hindsight well it's a hypothesis right because we don't know what would have happened if we had left 10 years ago and we don't know what the cost would be if we had stayed for another 10 years and i have heard a lot of vets talking about you know you know the service being in vain and and again i this is where i would say to those veterans you need to take a minute and realize that our involvement in afghanistan was never actually supposed to be saving afghanistan from itself it was a reaction to an attack on us it was a reaction to an attack and when i went over there in 2002 and three and four we were trying to find fix and finish the individuals that had planned for the attacks on 9 11 11. as you described deny them the terrain to be able to recruit or train or plan or whatever it may be that might express in an attack outside of that country and it wasn't until much later on i would say the deployment in 2010 where things shifted drastically the roes were different the guidance was different and the overall goal seemed to be different i mean it was very clear to me in the early years of afghanistan that you know we weren't there for nation building i didn't hear that term until back in 2010 and in my opinion the united states government specifically the dod we're not good at nation building um but for the vets who are thinking like hey i served for nothing you absolutely didn't what is happening now in afghanistan was going to happen and it was never our job to go there and to build afghanistan into something that we thought it was going to be we went there for the reasons that both yunna have already described and like you said in 20 years you know we haven't had an attack like the one that we did it absolutely was not in vain and if afghanistan cannot stand on its own two feet that doesn't mean that they served in vain those two things have to be very disconnected but i think they can be very convoluted especially if all it's just complete bombardment on every social media platform on every news network look at what's happening it's falling apart and i think it's really easy to connect what's happening to that country in a bit bigger again with i hate the term but it's applicable boots on the ground they're very different things yeah i i think that's all true um and the question i have for people like the people who just want to who kind of operate in this sort of shattered world view and there's a lot of americans on the left and the right what's what's frustrating me about the the dichotomy of thinking on this particular issue is that it's been wrongful thinking on on that that is that is bipartisan it has been shared by the left and the right everybody seemed to want to repeat the slogans of you know no more endless wars let's reduce this complex foreign policy situation into a slogan this has frustrated me to no ends and i've taken a lot of aim at that at that crowd um over the last week because i i don't i don't see how they can criticize biden i don't see how i mean we can we can criticize him for how he did it he definitely did it in a in a an extremely hasty and an inappropriate manner yeah we left a lot of equipment behind but people don't realize that wasn't by accident that was on purpose we were that was there for the afghan national army we just didn't expect them to fall so quickly again to your point we should have expected it it was it it and and they're not it's not totally their fault they've they've been around for as an organization for less than 20 years that's not that's not a lot of time in the grand timeline of history to really build a culture they don't have our logistical support anymore they don't have our air support we made these decisions rather quickly and you're dealing with an enemy that does not fight conventionally they're dealing with an enemy that that hides among civilian populations that is willing to use ieds to get you it's a very different kind of warfare and so i i want to give a little bit of grace to our to our allies there they they they've fought a lot they've tens of thousands of them have died fighting and they continue to fight but they needed just a minimal amount of backup from us you know when we talk about costs we did find that balance i think in the last few years we had very minimal costs few thousand troops um we had kia in the field about an average of six to seven soldiers since 2014. we've had zero casualties in the last 18 months and so you know i asked people like what look if this this has to be about costs and benefits because if we all agree that we should have gone in and done something about 911 and i think everybody agrees even biden voted for that for that aumf and um it was a righteous war so we all agree that on that and then you have to show a little bit of grace for our decision makers who were there day after day okay what do we do now because if we just pull out it seemed obvious at every moment that taliban would just take over and we'd return to a pre-911 situation where you'd have a terrorist safe haven and you're now at risk and so is that is that a superior outcome to just leaving that was always the question that's been the question every single day since 9 11. since we occupied afghanistan and for people to just assume that that's an easy question to answer is is is just it's just so frustrating and people have gotten so emotional about it which has frustrated me and made me emotional i suppose um this is about as emotional as i can get but in any case it's it's just never been that simple and so people are like well how long would you stay dan i'm like you know what when the cost benefit ratio makes more sense when the cost of leaving is less than the cost of saying that that's when that's when i'll leave because right now if we're looking at what's happening right now it seems to me that the cost of leaving is huge i mean everybody seems to agree on that now uh and the cost of saying that compared to our situation just a few weeks ago of stability and an afghan government that was still our ally and we had a few thousand people there we hadn't lost a single soldier in 18 months i don't know that seems like a good deal you know you know south korea didn't have a an election until the 80s we occupied south korea until they didn't even have a they didn't have a democratic election until the 80s people don't realize that when america commits in the long run it it works it takes time though it takes time even in these industrialized civilizations um it it may not i don't think afghanistan ever has a hope of turning into south korea don't get me wrong but but it was stable and we were preventing terrorism um and and now it seems like everybody agrees across the spectrum that this will this will certainly be a safe haven for for people like isis and al qaeda i don't know what do you think about all that yeah you know you hear the comparisons between europe and uh korea or the places that the united states has had establishments at least from you know remote-based perspectives since the 40s um and it's you know at a high level it's a good comparison but at a specific level i mean i think it's tough because you know we weren't involved in any combat operations in europe and korea post the end of those wars um and our involvement you know in kinetic operations whether it's by with and through or directly or air support whatever it may be i mean it's i mean the 20 years we've been in afghanistan far exceeds any amount of time for combat operations in the korean peninsula or europe so there's some good similarities and there's some poor ones and you know just you mentioned it afghanistan is afghanistan it is hard to describe the culture the the origins and inception of that country the warfare that has been on ongoing there generationally you know they tell time differently than westerners do not not in the 24 hour perspective but i'm talking generational memory where it seems like in the united states we have a memory of the next you know instagram feed that you scroll through um you know like i said i agree with the decision that we needed to leave that country but at the same time like you and i are talking about we knew that again after working with the partner force there that it was probably very likely if not you know a certainty that this was likely gonna happen if you're gonna leave execute the strategy you know like i would plan for the worst case scenario that's the way that you and i were taught to plan right let's look at the most deadly course of action the most likely course of action and our plan needs to encompass all of that and i look at what's going on now and it's like really like this is the best that this is the best that we can do like this is the best plan that we have that's stranding tens of thousands of people i mean i have some friends at some tier one units now that are getting spun up to potentially be sent over there in the case there needs to be hostage rescue type situations or to recover people and this is where you know to me it's very easy to look at the last few weeks and judge the person that's in the in the seat right now in the oval office and you absolutely should i think you know if you're in charge and you are executing a plan and you've had i mean let's be honest you've been in office for six months right so he's i don't know how much hand he has had in the plan but if it goes to sh and you don't audible and you don't change the plan and you don't take the time to find a better plan or you know do the things that are necessary you own that 100 percent and you should actually but especially especially because the taliban were blowing past the the uh the agreement i mean they were blowing past it in every sense i mean the the act of taking over capitals let's be honest that'd be a shock to anybody no so but and so there's but you should at least reassess the negotiations at that point that's what i'm saying as soon as you get into the seat if you realize that the plan that your predecessor put into place was and it's not going to work you are now in charge and it is your obligation to fix that you don't get you don't get to blame trump for this one is correct and also trump ended the negotiations yeah they had agreed to a conditions based withdrawal and here's the thing right so there's what's going on now and then there's everything that's happened in the 20 years of our occupation in this country and then let's go back even farther when we first started having involvement in the country whether it's a proxy war against the soviet union right like it's not like this is not the first time the us has had its hands in afghanistan so what's happening now should be viewed very critically but i also don't want people to lose perspective of what happened in the other 19 and a half years in the involvement in this country i think that the policy makers writ large you know they they need to be held accountable as well you know it's we there's so many lessons that i think we can learn from as a country that hopefully not repeat into the future because that seems to be our only option at this point it's not like we're going to go back and hit a redo on afghanistan so if we're just going to gloss over everything that led us to this point and only focus on what's happening right now which we absolutely should focus on that i just hope that those lessons learned and all the things that happened previously aren't lost then we're going to end up doing this again not the same you know if you don't study your history you're doomed to repeat it i think so many people just disagree on what the lessons are um we don't seem to be doing a lot of really uh objective introspection i mean because it would have been easy to look at the situation in iraq in 2011 and say look we knew that would happen because all the bad guys are hiding out in syria and it seems stable now it looked like nation building it actually kind of worked kind of worked at least to the best that it can in a place in the middle east it kind of worked in in iraq and obama and biden wanted to leave and so they left and those of us on the ground um because i was on the ground in 2011 in iraq i knew this would be a bad idea again it seemed relatively stable at the time but we we also knew that all the bad guys were tracking were just over the border in syria and um of course they came through and the rest is history right isis uh came through and took over iraq and uh we had to go back in and deal with that uh so i think everybody in the military was saying the same thing about afghanistan biden was advised to keep at least that 2500 to 2500 troops there um i think i think military professionals would probably prefer closer to 10 000 and people are like well that's an endless war and i'm like can we stop labeling it what it is is the stabilizing force call it a peacekeeping mission but we're not really in heavy combat like it's just people just don't understand what we're doing over there anymore it is not like it was in 2012 it is just not and and people need to understand that when i was there in two three and four it had shifted in 2010 to something that was completely different and that from my understanding and talking to people still going over there that evolution continued i agree with you you could call it whatever you wanted to and also let's take a less myopic view of the world in general and the united states in general like we're in an endless war yes yes we don't have a choice correct and it doesn't have a geographical border it could be an intellectual endless war a conceptual i mean the people out there who are who are at their core level the antithesis of what we believe they're still out there i mean the last stat that i saw i think it was the u.s special operations forces has a footprint like a hundred and four countries something like that yeah but it's strap strap in people were in an endless war afghanistan is one piece of a puzzle that is an order of magnitude greater than what's going on in just that country so you know label it whatever you want to or bury your head in the sand it doesn't change the reality you can't say that word on my podcast andy it's all right seals they're the worst um anyway but you're absolutely right that's about as emotional as i can get too and sometimes you have to use the big boy words that you only learned in college so you're absolutely i've just screwed with you yeah yeah you're absolutely right uh we'll just leave it out well i don't like that we don't we don't edit these things out but the but you're absolutely right and i've said this before i wrote it in my op-ed for the wall street journal it was we we didn't lose a war we didn't even end a war because the war never ends because as it turns out there's still people that want us dead and and and westerners have a really hard time understanding why this enemy wants us dead because it's like well oh we we must have done something right that's always their reaction it must have been our foreign policy it must have been something we did you have to understand that they hate western civilization they they hate us for for reasons that go beyond your comprehension and you just have to accept that that's the first thing you just have to accept and a great example of that is osama bin laden um because by by way of our actions our foreign policy actions osama bin laden should have loved us right we assisted him in the mujahideen in afghanistan in the 80s we uh actually invaded iraq to defend his home country of saudi arabia in 1991 it's unclear why this man hates us so much he hates us because he hates us right that's and he and he ordered the attacks on uh the embassies in tanzania and kenya he ordered the attacks in the uss cole in 2000 and of course ordered the attacks on september 11th the rest is history but he hates us because he hates us and the people who have followed him hate us because they hate us and it's an endless sure it's an endless war um because they wake up every day thinking about it and the best we can do is at least be the hunters instead of the hunted and i think people with this sort of myopic view of national security where it's like okay i guess there's a bunch of seals on coronado beach with binoculars like looking out looking out over the horizon making sure the riskies don't invade that's not national defense national defense is a it is a web of alliances and forward deployed forces that can react to threats around the world because it turns out the world is a very small place uh that's been national security for a very long time frankly and uh it people but it's just for some reason this makes people uncomfortable and i wonder if this is just a failure of communication from our policy makers over time over the last 20 years especially because the way the public reacts to these so again the the sort of the slogans of endless wars um is is extremely emotional people get very frustrated by it and and i i think they've just been miscommunicated to for a very long time yeah i don't know i don't know where it comes from um and for people who who say that they want to end an endless war my question to them generally is well did you think that we were at war on september 10 2001 and they'll say well no because we haven't been attacked yet and i and i will say to that you are viewing it only from your side of the coin if you looked at the other side of that coin the people who were planning the september 11th attacks who took the time to do so over years guess what they thought that they were at war with us because they were at war with us all that time we just weren't or you weren't paying attention so it whether you feel like we're in an endless war or your enemy does again you have to strap in right you can you can choose to bury your head in the sand and ignore the reality and i don't i mean i see people being taught in condition that you know you can't say or do anything that might be offensive to anybody else for any reason and when that starts creeping into foreign policy i don't know how that works you want to get into you want to get us some woke military stuff is that what you're alluding to or no i mean just in general you know like oh we shouldn't be uh you know we shouldn't be out around the world promoting american foreign policy and i and i see some links to that being like well you shouldn't go out and say that you're proud of anything or you know you have to be careful what you say or what you do because you don't want to you know offend anybody but like listen the execution of american force foreign policy yeah it's going to offend some people the people who wake up every day and try to figure out a way to do damage to the united states of america or kill american citizens guess what they're not going to like it sorry so what do you want to do do you want to sit back and wait for them to attack and then be reactive or do you want to be out there and try to defend what it is this is that this country stands for and then you get in the argument well what does this country stand for and i don't even have the tolerance to begin that one because i think you and i you and i align on on the reasons why this this country is great um the amazing opportunities that it provides people and it's like i just don't have the ability to have those conversations with people but i see those ties between you know people being taught don't offend anybody don't say anything and i just don't know how that mental connection they view american foreign policy and they think well we must be doing something that's wrong it's an interesting point and which is this that there's especially in recent years seems to have been the sort of lack of lack of confidence in the american ideal you know but by recent years i mean like the last 70 years frankly like since since the vietnam era which is where i win this when this feeling that america can't do any good it doesn't deserve to be upheld as this shining city on the hill it really started in the 60s and people's backlash towards vietnam got a little bit better in the 80s when we won the cold war and reagan was you know the eternal optimist and made americans feel good about america again um but it and i think you know maybe we did have it too in the early 2000s at the start of these wars um but then we then we got right back into this sort of self-hatred and um this is kind of what we stand for and on the and this manifests a little differently on the left and the right but in the end they come to the same conclusion see on the right i pay attention more to what the right says for obvious reasons um and you know because i'm in stark disagreement with this crowd on these on these particular issues and they and what they tend to do is to sort of come up with these simplistic labels like oh if you believe that we should have troops over there still then then you're a then you're a neo-liberal or neocon internationalist you're a globalist right they start to label things that they know sound bad because it's just that's just how we do things in politics right you just tar and feather somebody man you say words and they can't do anything back right right magic words see on the lefty they call you a racist um on the right they call you a neocon or or a rhino or whatever it is and it's just like how about just use some brains let's just use some thought processes and maybe some conversation because this stuff especially with this stuff it's so much more complicated than they than they want it to be in their lead so to take the the people on the right for example who and it's very interesting i was talking to my dad about this recently um you know he's 30 plus some years older than nine he was talking about how it's really interesting to see it's not uncommon to see the left and the right um arguing or disagreeing on things but to him he said one of the most interesting things he's seen in his lifetime is the left attacking the left and the right attacking the right for not being far enough to either side of the extreme so for that person who says hey if you think we need to have a foreign presence overseas you're a globalist what do they actually think that we should be doing and where what's the alternative yeah where does the road lead if we were so it's like okay you're king for a day so you get to make foreign policy we'll pull everybody back where did where do they think that that leads so they'll they'll say just focus on home and then my next question okay that's that's about as in-depth as the answer gets by the way and then the next th focus on home but also can we multitask yeah exactly that's my next question to them is can you do both right because you hear this like we spent 88 billion dollars training the afghan army and look what happened we could have spent that at home and a conservatives say that my next question to them is wait a second i thought we already over budgeted at home right i thought that was our argument so like how is that our argument it doesn't make sense guys it's an emotional argument let's just be more careful with how we speak please because it's it's not as if that money just especially with the way we spend money at the federal level it's not as if that money was taken away from a program at home and again my problem with the programs at home isn't that we don't have enough money for them it's that we spend too much money on programs that don't work and don't provide an outcome that we think is actually superior in any case let's not conflate the two issues just because we're trying to make an emotional argument let's make more reasonable and honest arguments and then i swear that's just that's just the entire problem with this this whole conversation is it's um it's really packed full of emotion more so than most issues more so than most issues and a lot of issues have a lot of emotion well i mean when you see people falling off airplanes trying to take off you know like that's it's gonna elicit emotional response i get it but emotions are not gonna be how we navigate our way to a better place and that's where it gets completely lost on me because i see people escalate to that emotional level and then the dribble that comes out of their mouth i have a hard time trying to understand and eventually i just stopped trying to understand it yeah yeah i was told that they didn't want us there um which all the pictures of people trying to get on airplanes and and you know risk their lives and basically die of heat exhaustion uh outside the gates of kabul airport to try to get to america it's another it's complex some of us don't exactly well we're going to be celebrating in the streets some of them have very deep family ties to the taliban and again instead of telling watch with us or telling time with the watch or a sundial they're watching decades flip by without a care in the world because they've seen this generationally so it's i mean good luck in a place and like people don't even understand the differences in the provinces and the cultural differences and the language differences in the afghanistan country as a whole good luck trying to find a consensus on you know well they want us there or they don't that is the most simplistic description to a ridiculously complex situation that i've ever heard some do some don't and everything in between what do you think actions should be realistic action should be for the next few weeks i mean we've got a self-imposed deadline of august 31st to get everybody out i i don't see how we meet that deadline there's going to be people who need to get out and deserve to get out deserve our help you know i think the the estimate is about 80 000 afghans that have helped us that deserve siv visas um you know a mix of interpreters sources contractors these types of folks there's still thousands of u.s citizens um and uh who who maybe weren't really clamoring to get out before again i think i think everything everybody was taken by surprise a little bit on this but they certainly are clamoring to get out now they can't really make it to the gates we know this for a fact i'm very upset with this administration for claiming that people can make it to the gates if they want to it's just not true um it's it's too chaotic of a situation people are literally dying um at the gates because they're getting crushed by the crowds um taliban are beating people back they're dying of heat exhaustion there's a lot of problems it's not safe to bring your family to the gates of kabul necessarily so you know one of the things i've been pushing for just tweeted it like a few minutes ago actually was just authorize our forces to move a few hundred yards outside the gates and pick up people because i mean my office is working with specific individuals who contact us because they can't get in touch with the state department and we're just we're just leading them to the right place and then we've got soldiers on the grounds that we're in contact with guys i know um who were making those connections happen and and it's it's the least we it's the only thing we can do and it's at least it's working but you know just there but they have but their their hands are tied in a sense because they have no authorization to even go into the just move out a little bit further outside the perimeter um i don't know what you should think about that i don't know what you think about retaking bagram it's another thing that's another option that's on the table um well what sucks the most is that we're well by where i'm not talking about you well maybe you because you made the poor decision to enter into politics much more tied into this than i am but what i mean what's going on it's crisis management right so crisis planning is about the best that they're going to be able to do which is not going to be the best plan what i would have loved to have seen is to have those people that have you know the 80 000 people that you mentioned like you're telling me as a country we couldn't have figured out a way to have all that stuff handled before we left we couldn't have read the tea leaves but what had happened historically or look at what happened in iraq and what it appeared to be in the velocity which became different and handled that up front right to avoid that crisis management so that would be i mean i wish that we had done that but we hadn't okay so let's look at the situation that we had now i mean you were a military officer i was a fake military officer as we both know oh that's right you went to the dark side because i'm your hero because you're here and you're like i just what can i do to be like dan crenshaw yeah you don't lie you you wear an eye patch by yourself uh in front of them i usually wear two to help me sleep at night but it just looks like a sleeping mask so it's it's a dual ipad you know we actually produce sleeping masks with my face on the eyepatch actually do we actually produced this i didn't know that and i could have lived the rest of my life i'm gonna send you one and sign it please do so so what do we do now okay first off i'd say get rid of any self-imposed deaths why there's already going to be enough stress and enough pressure involved in this why would you add a completely arbitrary timeline right so get rid of that i would listen to the i mean i've never sat down with the joint chiefs of staff or the people who send ideas up the chain of command beyond a very you know slide deck that goes to the battle space commander they get sent back and says hey your helicopters are facing the wrong direction so fix those and i'll give you mission approval but i would hope as the plans go higher up that the smartest heads we have around the table are putting together a plan to execute what you talked about to get those people out of there and there's no way that the best plan is just to stay geographically fixed to the kabul airport because people also need to realize this just because it hasn't become incredibly violent around kabul which is where the video cameras are for the news networks does not mean that that is how the taliban is behaving in the rest of afghanistan look at what has happened in all of the cities that have fallen along the way the execution of soldiers both a a and a p so there's what i mean and i'm sure the u.s does this too there's the face we'll put on when the video camera is up and then there's the you know the the behavior when the video camera is off so realize that as well but if we're fixing ourselves only to the airport which is where all of the cameras are i just it's not a great policy i think we well also there's u.s citizens outside kabul there's there's u.s citizens all over the country if that's going to be our priority and we still have not authorized any kind of rescue missions and again and again so i don't i mean i don't know why that would be the case neither you and i are sitting at the table for those conversations even though i would love to be a fly on the wall because what i've still never been able to figure out looking back at my military career is you know what where what are the conversations around the cost you know um let's say i mean like just curiosity let's use a drone strike as an example let's say we have a high value target but he's surrounded by five innocent family members that's not worth it or let's say that is worth it what about 10 what about 15 like i'd love to be around these conversations where they have the conversations about what's the acceptable risk and what's the acceptable cost because i feel like that's probably what they're talking about now hey if we authorize people to go off of the kabul airport what's the risk how many lives are going to be lost and i'm just really curious as to what decision makers actually talk about in those moments and what the math they actually use is because i've never heard it openly and transparently explained to myself as somebody who used to be on the action end of that but it's a good question i and what what i want to see is the politicians the this is the president simply authorize these things and say look military now you figure out whether it makes sense from a cost-benefit ratio yeah because the only the only the mil only the guys on the ground only military can really answer that question and assess their own risks the president can't possibly do that right he's just not he's not close to the situation he certainly in particular doesn't have the background to do that but you at least have to give permission for the analysis to occur and you know that that's the first step give permission for the military to even think about it and i mean empowering your subordinates you know like he should not it's another thing i think is interesting people the president has to be the smartest person in the room like really what if he was not the smartest person in the room but he had the um you know he's like avengers assemble and like put together the most amazing team of the smartest people like i would hope he's already made that decision right because that's the that's going to have to happen whether any action is taken in the first place or the decision to whether or not you're going to take action or not is going to occur like i would have to hope that that's already happened yeah i kind of want to ask you um what what you've been doing ever since the seal teams we kind of we brushed past your impressive bio a little bit at the beginning because we wanted to get right into the meat of the conversation um obviously we talked a little bit about how you and i met um but tell us about unless unless you want to unless there's a few things you want to keep adding to the afghanistan conversation but the only thing i can add to it is i don't have the solutions i mean i'm detached it's tough to see what's going on maybe taking bagram is this a short-term solution i have no idea um but what i do know is that we could have done way better on the execution of this plan or paused the plan and created a better one and for that the people holding the bag on that need to be held responsible but let's not forget what happened in the years leading up to it as well i mean other than that i don't know what to say about afghanistan it's it's depressing for a lot of us um yeah because like i well i don't feel like my service was was in vain by any stretch um it's depressing to me because it was just such an unnecessary folly it really was like we didn't have to leave this way at all um at the very least we could have a lot of us there's been bipartisan outrage against the administration for months actually because they haven't been processing sivs you know that's just one thing there was clearly no plan for for american citizens but i but i still tell people if you bring if you bring the troop levels down to zero you will create a power vacuum and the taliban will run through the country you know it's just a matter of time and people are like well we didn't know it'd be this fast okay well in six months from now and in the end you're going to end up with this with the situation where the taliban are back in control and and we're right back to a pre-911 situation and i can't say this enough and the question has always been at what cost do we think we can take to prevent that terrorist safe haven because there's a cost to it and i think for 20 years we tried to figure it out figure out what that cost would be and sometimes it got really expensive and then we called it nation building but then in the last few years it really wasn't that expensive um it was actually it was actually a very small commitment um that maintained a stalemate and a stalemate might be the best thing that we can hope for in a place like afghanistan and and i think that's why i'm so frustrated because uh i've been saying this for a long time and um and but but i think we let emotions uh have the best of us and and make policy for us so that's my i guess last last feelings about it but let's talk about you let's talk about you and the limited time we have left how much time do you have left i don't know it's your show well yeah but you got to go okay um andy what have you been doing uh tell me about your podcast and uh i know the audience probably enjoy listening to it and uh you know you've um just you're involved in quite a few things so and i don't i won't do justice to it trying to give some kind of bio for you so give me a sense of what you why you got out of the seal teams and um what you've been doing since yeah well getting out of the steel teams wasn't necessarily my choice uh my medical record and my body were like hey we think we're done here and it also didn't help when i got back from that last tour in 2010 and although i had been filling a leadership role you knew this as and know this as well as i on a fit rep or an eval if the right box is not checked it doesn't really matter what you did because for your next advancement selection uh you either have the box checked or not so i got back in 2010 and i was told by the officer detailer that although i was acting in the role of both the oic and an operations officer that it didn't count so i would need to do back-to-back uh aoic and then oic deployments and then find a joint tour to which i responded is there any other option available to that because my body is trashed i've already done eight deployments i don't feel like doing another three with my kids at the age that they are at and in the back of my mind i didn't think i was going to be physically able to do it because there is some pretty severe residual uh nerve damage at least from the gunshot wound in iraq and it makes i mean being the physical weak link on the ground especially in a leadership position is a recipe for absolute failure i couldn't i would not be able to live with myself if i was ever to be in a place and because of a physical limitation somebody that i was with either got hurt or killed i just i would not be able to tolerate that so i was medically retired i was actually five days from getting out of the military with no retirement of any kind and a doctor was like hey yeah i'm not signing this discharge physical you need to go out to nico the national intrepid center of excellence and i went to the one at walter reed and did a full diagnostic and work up and ended up getting medically retired so it wasn't really my choice uh to leave but it was my it was definitely my time to leave and worked for a strength and conditioning company after that i did some aviation stuff i did some charter flying i started public speaking towards the end of my military career about four and a half years ago i was really lucky i got introduced to uh our mutual friend joe rogan uh as a guest on his podcast because i was trying to do some fundraising uh to raise money for the navy seal foundation uh through some skydiving and we just i mean you know this is as well as i do he's people ask all the time what's joe like i'm like he's like what he's like on his show there's just no microphone he's just an awesome grounded down dude and he's like hey man you are he's like you're good at talking um you should start a podcast which i come to find out he tells everybody so i feel far less special it's like the man who has spawned a million podcasts i swear to god he's like the pod father and uh so i started the podcast with no real uh idea of where it was gonna go uh and it's become one of the most cathartic things that i've ever done i'm fascinated by other people and things that they do so i get to sit down and talk with people from our you know like guys like uh jason tushin or jason gardner or jocko and sit down and just have conversations and explore similarities and differences in beliefs and backgrounds and who i am as a person why i wanted to do the things that i do or have done in the past or want to do in the future and just hear about incredible stories from other service members from other services from female veterans so it started off as like i mean i mean i should probably listen to joe i guess because i guess his podcast is reasonably successful um and then you know currently now i mean i've actually backed away from a lot of the stuff that i used to do because the pandemic highlighted for me how much i hate traveling so i'm trying to actually stay home and maximize what i do at home where i live in northwestern montana and i've been talking with guys like evan hafer i'm gonna open up a black rifle coffee franchise in town and throw my hat into the ring and on saturdays people can come in and order whatever they want i'm gonna give them drip coffee regardless of what their order is you know the thing that i like to do that's awesome those those guys are great i've had them on um have them on the show a couple times as well um it's funny how um veterans like like you and them this is i was just thinking about this as you mentioned black rifle coffee guys that get like they're a coffee company and yet they get they get blasted in the political spectrum oftentimes um and again you know be because i don't know that maybe they're because you can you know for the second amendment types you can never be second amendment enough and like these guys have probably done more for the for normalizing gun culture than anybody else ever has and yet they get uh blasted for the dumbest stuff i mean the dumbest stuff how much how much do you get in the poll i mean it's a political podcast and you know we've talked about policy a little bit um how much do you get into politics on at least in your daily life in your show what questions would you have of me what criticisms might you have of me i mean since you're my old instructor you might as well might as well just lay into me andy i mean you know that was never my style if i wanted people to listen i would talk quietly so they would have to listen more intently you were definitely the disappointed dad for sure you guys like i said the hammer justice is not always the best tool it's actually been interesting watching your entry into politics which i'm pretty sure i tried to talk you out of the instant that you first told me you were considering i'm like no dan no um it's uh you have definitely become more partisan as well and i don't say that negatively i think politics in general have become much more partisan and i think it's actually getting people to tune out more than to actually tune in because you know what people are going to say it'll be it'll be people pointing at the left and the right and oftentimes i think the subject matter is lost along the way and i don't know how to correct for that uh but politics for me right now i mean i'm already seeing signs for like trump 2024 and here's the thing people can think what they want to about trump it's not a statement about that for me it's this sense of doom that the next election cycle is around the corner because i'm still not ready to deal with that again i don't want to be bombarded for two years leading up to it and my biggest concern and maybe you would have an answer for this you know i have a lot of worries about our about our country and you and i don't think we're at the brink you know people are talking about civil war and being at the brink i mean easy to say the actuality of that actually happening i'm not so sure uh because people the their thought of what a war in the streets looks like and the actual execution of a war in the streets are two very different things but i don't know if our country would survive another election cycle where there's no faith in the process in itself if there's no way to restore faith in the actual electoral process that i think might be something that would trend us toward that and i mean you're living in that system i mean how do we how do we recover that faith for people because both sides are basically saying it's flawed you know there's there's different arguments about what had happened but at the end of the day it's it's causing people i think to question the validity of a very sacred process in our country and i don't know how we recover that before 2024. yeah there's a lot to impact there so i mean on the election stuff you know like the left says there's voter suppression the left says that the russians colluded with trump and that you know his election was illegitimate and then obviously everything that happened with trump's uh with this 2020 election uh you know the accusations of of widespread fraud and systemic systemic fraud um you know algorithms that change the the ballots and such so just uh you're right but the important thing to remember is it undermines faith and faith is pretty important so i always take a step back on this particular issue and say look an election is a competition and in any competition you need really strict rules really strict rules that everybody agrees upon and then you need to be able to audit the the results afterwards in a coherent manner like it can't be this mess that it's been in a lot of states and an audit should just be par for the course so i don't it's unclear to me why we wouldn't always audit elections in texas i think that's normal practice um and so there's that that's the conservative argument for elections because i'm like look because the left will say why don't you just want to make it easier to vote and my answer is well it's already really easy to vote and also like i want it to be easier to score a touchdown we can't just expand the end zone you know like it's just like again there are rules and let's just follow the rules and make sure that we at least agree on the outcome you know it it's easy to vote to say it's not easy to vote i think it's ridiculous so like from a policy perspective obviously i think i'm right on this and and i think democrats are wrong um but you know i also don't necessarily agree with all the rhetoric that's been used uh on our side either uh i i just think i just think it pulls away from the the core of our argument which is you have to have an election that has integrity that you can trust which is which is truly the core and i think there's a good moral argument for that just that that's that simple statement of of make sure the rules of the game are are structured well strict and well followed and that can be audited afterwards that should be a very simple thing on on the polarization issue i think it's worth addressing because it's certainly a question i get asked a lot like dan how do we how do we pull people together how do we how do we stop being so partisan and well look i what i try to do is at least help you understand why i am so much against the left um because what i what i what i think people find unfortunate is when you just rely on kind of shallow talking points you know or just name calling or the tit for tat like well they're bad because hillary clinton's corrupt well that's not why they're bad that's why hillary's bad but it's not why everybody's bad it's just like we're not bad because you don't like the way trump tweets like that's a ridiculous statement you know what what what i think is wrong with the other side is simply their ideas and we have to be talking about ideas a little bit more and and then also i would say the second thing is it is the nature of politics to debate ideas and to debate those ideas fiercely it is the entire point and so partisan partisanship is inherent in the system of politics it always will be you know it's like the question of afghanistan really it's it's if you don't like that then well what's the alternative because the question is always well compared to what you know compared to what and and i think we're always going to be in a situation we always have been in a situation in any kind of democracy where there are groups that disagree with each other disagree with each other fiercely and i think what we need to agree on is the the structures of our republic that allow us to disagree in a in at least the most peaceful manner possible when i get really amped up is when is when people start to threaten those structures things like packing the supreme court um removing the filibuster you know basically turning us into a a mob democracy which is what our founders never intended to happen a mob democracy is so so dangerous i mean the idea that we might make extraordinary policy decisions off of a simple majority is a very scary place to be you don't want to be there if you're asking me i i think that's how we got to this afghanistan issue really i think that's how this decision got made so hastily um was because it was it was based on that sort of feeling it was based on a very crude look at what the public might think you know because most people will say if you ask them a simple question should we leave afghanistan yeah we should leave that's what they say now if you ask him a few more questions like well what if it will create a terrorist safe haven what about a residual security force they might be like yeah yeah leave a residual security force you know can you point to it on a map yeah that's always a good one as well you know and it's like it's like yeah should we be basing serious discussions off of off of that i'm kind of going out of tangent there but that would i guess be my response to a lot about a lot of what you said i think the best thing are you enjoying being and doing what you're doing it's not enjoyable the way uh like seal teams were enjoyable like you i kind of left kicking and screaming um i wasn't allowed to really deploy anymore i mean i deployed a couple more times after i was injured but um you know in the uh more of an in kind of an intelligence capacity not because i'm so intelligent i mean obviously i am andy but we're using that term loosely i mean you meant the military the criminal not of course the individual reflective policy well clearly i meant both but you know it's neither here nor there uh but but i did a couple more deployments but then they were like you know we're just you have half an eye like you need to get out of the military um and so you know there there i went um so it's not enjoyable in that sense because i i truly i i never saw the military as service uh the way we're thanked for our service every penny i've ever made in my life i would give right back just to go back and do what we used to do yeah and i think a lot of us feel that way so it's um but but politics is it's important it's important to be part of a conversation um that affects americans lives and so it's fulfilling in that sense which i which i might say is a more pure form of joy just not it's not joy in the fun sense but i but i do make it fun i mean obviously i do a lot of kind of things that uh normal politicians don't do and we do that because look americans have to see you uh having some fun uh you'll go crazy in this job if you don't try to have some fun uh i do this podcast because it's the only place that you can have those more in-depth conversations because like i can tweet about things i can i can put out short videos on instagram you can't put out long videos and instagram but to watch them so you have to do a podcast and that's why you know normally we will deep dive with somebody into a wide variety of subjects whether it's health care environmental issues housing issues i mean i think we've done literally everything on the podcast at a certain point bring on experts to talk about that then you can really start to unpack things and help people understand you know why why i take the positions i do and that's that's that's my main goal in politics help people understand why i take the positions i do and people appreciate that even if they disagree with it like at least you're directly confronting the ideas you disagree with because oftentimes people just talk past each other you know you say oh they're just bad they're just bad and they want bad things okay well why are they bad you know it's just it's not hard to explain why let's just explain why and why it doesn't work um and i think it's important to remember too that you can disagree with people's ideas and still wrap your arms around them as a fellow american you know it's uh my dad and i passionately disagree on many things and we use many color for words and uh phrases when we're passionately discussing things and at the end of the day like i love them more after those discussions that's one thing that i hope we can navigate our way around to is the the realization that yes there are bad people out there and of course there are a variety of bad ideas but they're not always joined at the hip you can have people who are you know maybe they're less educated on a topic or maybe their upbringing was different and they believe something different than you but that doesn't inherently make them a bad person and they may well end up being your neighbor and that's the person you're probably going to rely upon when things go south and guess what the government is not there to help you but your neighbors will be yeah i think that's an important lesson that a lot of people need to learn right now we've really gotten to this point in politics where the other side is evil now conservatives feel this way more than more than most we've always felt like we've we think that liberals are wrong but they think we're evil and um i'm not even sure how you identify i mean i i've i don't pay attention to your politics that much 2021 sorry are you even allowed to ask me that in 2021 i feel like that was racist that's a good play i i mean i again i don't follow politics incredibly closely i would say i would probably identify more along the lines of a libertarian i'm i was fiscally conservative and socially liberal on a lot of issues and then some i completely flip-flop and my biggest thing is like hey like i want to be able to go out and live my life to its fullest and i don't want people pushing on me and i think people should largely be able to do what they want to do you know yeah that's yeah that's that's a good view to have and i think things get dangerous when we're like when we can't have that live and let live philosophy that that's that's when people start talking about these sort of extraordinary civil war measures when we start when we're starting to really infringe on the ability of others to be free even if we don't like how they're acting we don't like what they're saying we don't like what they're doing and then we can do somebody have to be to think they're going to go through life and never be offended by something that happens to them or something that's said or not ever be exposed to an idea that grades against them it's like get over it like that's the beauty of our society is that we can have those things and people that irritate you could live to your left and right and you can still figure out a way to come together as a community i mean stop being so sensitive we have a lot of sensitivity in america these days i can't believe you offended me it's like really i mean what are you talking about i mean why would you ever think that that's not going to happen at some point in your life like grow up it's it's a it's a moniker of living in a free society and you have to you have to live with some kind of offense in a free society and you have to be able to deal with it you have to be proud here's the thing you got to be proud of being able to deal with it and i think that's what's changed um where where we we've sort of elevated this sense of victimhood as like a heroic attribute uh in our society where um the the person who gets the welfare benefit the person who fought to get their services given to them is now a hero which is just not how americans used to be and i think that's strange or the person who who fights to expose how they were offended is now seen as a hero and i'm like what what is heroic about this because a heroic to me would be letting it roll off your back and then demonstrating that that you're stronger for it that would be a traditional heroic attribute or heroic way of thinking a heroic character then we've kind of flipped these things on their head to where people actually have an incentive to be victimized or at least claim victimhood and i it's a very dangerous path and it you know again from a political perspective i see that that pathology in american culture leading to the policies that i disagree with be it socialism or something akin to that because and the reasoning is quite simple if you're not strong enough to live in a free society and right everything offends you and you're clamoring for somebody to take care of you you're clamoring for a politician to give you things to take from somebody else and to give you things to take the responsibility that you don't want to take you do end up with a very socialized society you end up with a which which i believe is unsustainable i mean it's inherently unsustainable uh it's never worked as it turns out never worked and i think that's a dangerous path to go down um even if it's tempting for for so many people because it does feel good in the short term everything yeah lots of things feel good in the short term yeah um eddie i know you got to go soon and um appreciate you and your insights on um on everything our country's going through right now and sites let's be clear for the listeners i have my own with lots of it's lots of insights i have like there's a reason i used to have a blog called confessions of an idiot and there's a reason why i titled it that so well glad we were able to do this because we've been trying to do it for for a while um and this this was a this was a much better topic to uh to land on um you do have good insights i think

you're jumping you we need to link up and go into the wind tunnel because it was hard to watch all right you're well you didn't see my second one okay i never okay all right let's just address this let's just address this so there's a little bit of potato chipping going on all right it lasted for like a second i was just like oh come on guys like he could have gotten the footage where i was much

winners and then our three vermont artist judges susan tier colin bright and vanessa conten will announce the third second and first place winners in that order and so i would now like to invite congressman welch to provide opening remarks um thank you very much uh thank you everybody for uh doing our covet safe zoom uh the council of fine arts uh visit where we're all virtual i i don't even know what to say because i normally uh get so excited about being uh at the at the vermont college of fine arts where they have that magnificent uh display uh in that wonderful uh room that they have upstairs but it's great to be with everyone on our virtual uh event and you know a couple of things that i'm really excited about despite uh this coveted world that we're in and we're starting to come out of uh we did manage to put this all online so that's good number two incredible participation 160 students from across the state and number three we're going to be able to have everyone's artwork on our website that will go live once we finish with the awards ceremony i want to thank some people but first of all i really really want to thank the vermont council in fine arts for for hosting us and you might think that it wasn't as much work for them to host this uh this year when we're doing it by zoom as opposed to physically but in fact uh karen middlemen and troy hickman did an immense amount of work setting up this portal that allowed us to have this event today so thank you vermont council on fine arts um i also want to uh thank uh that's jericho palms who really did the heavy heavy heavy lifting uh to make this happen an immense amount of work and you did that uh really for all the vermont artists uh these young students who are participating today and uh submitted those 160 pieces of art so thank you jessica and also thank you leslie ward uh for making everything available from the vermont council on the arts i want to thank our uh our artists uh who were the judges and that's a hard hard job and i always enjoyed listening to the artists talk about how they see and assess uh the work that they uh have viewed and uh are giving award awards to and that's uh uh our artists are susan tier uh colin bright of vanessa compton in all the very accomplished vermont artists we have a few uh guests on the call including the speaker of the house of representatives jill kerwinski i'm going to ask her to just say a word or two but also a couple of other state legislators who are big supporters of the arts uh kathy james and seth bongartz before i ask jill to just make a quick remark i want to say why it's so this program is so important to me and i feel uh such pride that i've been able to pick up the legacy that was started by my predecessor or one of my predecessors in congress and it was senator jim jeffords who at the time he began this was congressman jim jeffords and when i first came to vermont it was after i graduated from law school jim jeffords was our congressman and i was a big fan of admiral his uh and he was a extraordinarily uh wonderful member of congress uh both when he served as a member of the house and also later as a us senator but he began the congressional arts competition and it was an idea that was born out of the monarchs council and just the enormous support that vermonters have for the importance of the arts and this which began as a contest in vermont really i used the word contest but it really was an opportunity for not to encourage or my high school students to to express themselves through the artistic skills and vision that they had that this just spread all around the country and what is now the case is that all of my colleagues and 435 house congressional districts have an arts competition where the students in their districts are invited to submit their work have it be judged and then winners is selected and then each district gets a winner and the work is then displayed on a hallway that goes from the house office buildings over to the capitol itself and one of the wonderful joys i have in my work is that when i'm walking from my office over to the capitol usually to cast a vote i go through this hallway and see on display uh the 435 works from all across the country and i have a habit of stopping along the way uh each time to pay a special attention to a particular work of art and uh it's it's just a it's really a wonderful experience for me the other thing i wanted to say is that this is really to the artist to the students uh i was not good at expressing myself artistically and i'm still not and i think one of the one of the things that i had trouble with when even i was trying to start to do something like that when i was in grammar school or high school is i was afraid to um let people see my work and to be judged and it's an aspect of you submitting your work and letting other people see it and to talk about it and to have the confidence that you can have a display of your work your effort your heart something that's meaningful to you and let others uh have a critical response to it and it's critical not in the sense of it's you know good or bad it's critical in a sense of assessing it and then discussing with you how what's your vision discussing with you how did you execute on that and then being open to getting uh feedback from people who've had experience about your execution your skill and how to improve it so it's a very brave emotional step to take to be an artist and then display your work so that the public uh can react to it uh in the final thing i want to say is that during this pandemic you know it's all been a shock to us and we've acted and reacted and tried to cope in different ways and i think if you're in school uh you're going to school grammar school high school college and you have to do things remotely i just can't imagine um how hard that would be because you know you get to uh in adulthood you've got different systems and it's a different situation i think the stress of trying to get through this uh when you're totally cut off from your support systems and your your friends and your your your fellow classmates uh is an incredible challenge and you know how do you do it other than trying to express that to some extent through your artistic vision so i just think that art is i've always thought even though i'm not an artist i have so much appreciation for people who are and help through the expression of the world as they see it those of us who are not artists better understand the world we're in better understand the world we're in the relationships the communities and ourselves so i want to really express my gratitude to the artist to your parents and to our judges and to the vermont college of fine arts so i'll stop there and just i just want to acknowledge that we've got the speaker of the house of representatives uh who's doing i think an extraordinary job and has been a public servant for years and as he's a very very good friend jill crowinski jill thank you so much congresswoman welch it's so great to be here with all of you i just want to thank all of the work that people have done to put this event together it's really important especially this year i just feel like it's more important than ever thank you to the teachers and the parents and the judges for your work and dedication towards this and to every student on this call we are just bursting with pride for all of you and we are just so excited and um i cannot wait to see this art and i know that congressman welch has said that there is a piece that will go to the to congress but i would love to find a way to get some of this art into the state house that would be fantastic so congratulations to all of you and i'm so excited to see the art thank you and congratulations uh thank you speaker kruwinski and now i'd like to turn it over to president leslie ward vermont council on fine arts who will mention who will uh tell us our honorable mention winners thank you peter and um i just want to say it's really an honor to be here today at the event and to have the opportunity to address the talented artists who have participated in this year's events and all of your parents teachers and friends who have encouraged you along your artistic journeys it's really an honor because at vermont college of fine arts we believe that artists are essential to a humane and compassionate world which is why we believe so passionately in our mission to foster the excellence of emerging and established artists through our six graduate programs we nourish artists who deepen their practice as students and are enriched and supported as members of the vcfa community throughout their artistic life we really believe that arts are central to the human experience and have the ability not only to reflect reality but to create new and better realities the art each of you created helps individuals not only know but viscerally feel the wide range of human experiences through your work the universal becomes personal each of your outstanding pieces and i was so impressed with them is a portal to new understanding propelling your viewers into a more intimate way of being in relationship with the world and with each other opening doors to empathy and understanding across divides and distances some of you may have already decided that art will be your chosen profession and you will pursue it from here on out for others art may just be something you keep alive as a side hobby as you pursue other interests at the vermont college of fine arts we believe the artist lives in all of us throughout our lives and that entering into a deep study in practice can happen at any age we have students that range between their 20s and their 70s so whether you see yourself as a professional artist or not keep envisioning keep creating keep expressing your truth the world needs your creativity and if and when the time is right vcfa will be available to you as a place to develop your voice and be in a supportive community with other artists who want to learn and grow and now

milne judges choice night star trails by morgan frank and the final judge's choice pride by jayden crowder congratulations to all the honorable mention choices thank you thank you thank you very much those are those are magnificent really really wonderful uh president ward and now vermont artist susan tier will announce the third place winner susan hi everybody so nice to be here um i have the honor of announcing the third place winter a winner and the piece is titled saunder by isabella engineering so i am so excited to talk about isabella's artwork titled saunder she has described her work as a surrealist self-portrait accented with organic shapes and lines of a primary color palette it's a unique image that has stayed with me since i first saw it and will continue to because of its complexity the original and combination use of mixed media the dreamlike elements and various dualities the gaze is mesmerizing and calming the hollow body appears thin and somewhat frail the weighted head is slightly tilted and firmly in place even though it rests on ribbons of flowing primary colors red blue and yellow she appears unfazed the colors come from the internal and they find their way to the external the color shapes are geometrical and flat they're smooth curved soft edged and thoughtfully placed on her face and head the patterns of the primary colors never mix as primary colors are often associated with their overlays subtly mimicking her body and facial features there's a suggestion of gentle movement combined with a pause and of course there's this beautiful combination um two-dimensional color design that's carefully placed on top of this beautifully detailed grayscale portrait so i go back to the gaze it's where i start and where i end with this piece i'm reminded of portraits of frida kahlo the hollow figure detached from the neck and head are reminiscent of portraits by renee magritte the colors and organic shapes remind me of one of my favorite spanish artists moreau so i believe isabella's title is a significant part of her intention in the making of her work sonder i had to look it up and what i read gave me more insight to her visual expression so the definition is it's the realization that each passer by is a living thing as vivid and complex as your own so i go back to the gaze and i know that i can and want to look back so i am going to pass this along to colin and vanessa we all agreed that we felt we wanted to say something about each um each winner and um so we get to talk three times so i'm going to pass it over i'll give it to colin if you're ready and um and then to vanessa thank you and congratulations isabella thanks susan i think one of the things that was most striking to this piece to me as a designer is the use of these organic shapes and primary colors they bring my focus away from the delicate grace and the excellent grayscale execution momentarily and then allow it to snap back so it keeps my eye moving from from one set of features to the next and i love the way that this yellow color block mimics the line of the cheek bone that the three circles move into the the area where the mouth would be it's just it's it's fascinating trying to figure out exactly what these ribbons of color are but it provokes a lot of thought i think it's notable that in all three of our top three selections that there were commonalities between the three judges selections that made these decisions both very hard and very easy so vanessa i'll pass it over to you thanks colin and i also wanted to just lift up something that congressman welch said so beautifully that it's a brave emotional step to be an artist and to put yourself out there in your work and just want to say how much i respect each of the artists of the next generation for doing so um and with isabella's work i like susan found so much mystery in this piece i found a slight androgyny to the figure and this kind of mysterious fluidity which i feel is such a beautiful powerful strength of this next generation um the technicality of the illustration is flawless it's scarily flawless in the best of ways and i love how the piece references surrealism yet also feels very fresh and contemporary so great great job isabella thank thank you very much thank you uh susan that was beautiful um and as the second place winner is going to be announced by colin bright uh colin sorry our second place winner i am very pleased to say is rachel lynn peace title labels this is a really striking portrait and i think it's so striking because it demonstrates a combination of both exceptional technical skills and being able to to create this beautiful image but also carrying forward a strong social social message and i think that the combination of these two strengths aren't just the mark of an exceptional student of the arts but are the mark of an exceptional artist there are a number of very intentional decisions that i think contribute to the success of this piece the decision to concentrate detail on the portrait's eyes and on the message my race is not a virus in the center keeping that really crisp and very clean and then allowing the focus to start to fuzz out and dissipate as we move back kind of keeps us locked on the humanity that's portrayed in those eyes and on the the plea for humanity that's conveyed in that message the the intensity of the subject's gaze is another thing that keeps drawing me back in the technical skill that's demonstrated through the painting of those eyes keeps me engaged in a way that makes me feel like there's two-way communication happening when my eye starts to wander away from that very strong detail to work in the center uh the the soft focus that's been brought to the rest of the image allows me to take those those bits of information in the derogatory and hateful nicknames as it were for kovid they grabbed my eye for a second but then i brought once again back to that gaze and back to that strong central message and then the uh the last piece is the the tiny crisp small type that's recounting episodes of racially motivated hateful action uh that because of their size and because of the defined granular level of detail there pulls me totally to that one piece of information but because it's so small it doesn't distract from the overall composition and the central message that i keep coming back to i'd say overall that this piece is just exceptional and the honesty and the vulnerability and the earnestness that are shown here and demonstrates really significant forethought both in the concept and in the execution so rachel you should be immensely proud of the level of sophistication that you've achieved here and the clarity with which your message is conveyed and i think that this this art is going to serve as a great testament and document to a very ugly truth about some wrong that still exists in our culture today but it does so with a grace and a beauty that is lacking in a lot of public discourse so congratulations and thank you for sharing this with us susan i'll send it over to you okay so oh rachel your your artwork is bold brave and powerful um you know in your artist statement that labeling is often reduced to one word but in contrast your artwork speaks volumes so the your use of uh mixed media wallet watercolor and the news headlines come together to create a strong visual voice that i hope that you keep and and remain doing what you're doing you're sending a direct and important and meaningful message so thank you and congratulations vanessa um i find this piece a strong and heartbreakingly tender work of art for all the reasons beautifully illuminated by colin and susan um one thing i love about it is that it's directly challenging folks disbelief in equality or equanimity at this moment in time it's confronting it i found the use of text very very strong and i don't always land at that text can be a detractor for works at some point but not in the case of this piece in this case it's a weapon of truth and this piece lifts up that the only way to move forward into the future the future that your generation rachel is inheriting is to reckon and deal with the past and present to not turn our collective gaze away from the systemic oppressions that are happening at this moment and in the past but to face them head-on just like this young woman is doing in this piece and may we all rise to this challenge it's beautifully beautifully done rachel great job thank you thank you uh and now uh we go to vanessa you're going to tell us the first place winner yes thank you so much i'm very very honored and excited to say that first place goes to selfie mirror which is a photograph by passion muy belacha when i first saw this photograph by pasion i first my jaw dropped to the floor so i'd lift it back up and i thought that this is a piece that responds to what it feels like and looks like to be alive in this very moment this is a photograph that i could be turning the pages of aperture magazine which is a photography magazine and see it and it would be um i would not be surprised to see this there when i look at this i think about the power of representation in visual art and the power of either negative or positive imagery to influence perceptions of oneself and others this is a piece that moves the dial and challenges narratives that uphold racist and gendered ideologies it's a breathtaking courageous and i believe transformative image it is both strong and vulnerable it holds those dualities um when i look at this portrait i think of the portrait photography of the life magazine photographer gordon parks and also contemporary photographers deanna lawson and latoya ruby frazier this is an image that is so very rooted in the photographic portraiture tradition and at the same time feels fresh and timely which i think all three pieces had had that in them for example the iphone and the light that's a time stamp a timestamp on this moment that we're living in some other elements that i was drawn to was the placement of the ring on the index finger which is the power finger the tiara or the crown which the young woman is wearing referencing regalia the inclusion of the plant the body position of the young woman which feels strong yet also somewhat distanced which is also compounded by the gaze of her i'm transfixed by her i want to know what is she feeling in that very moment does she feel strong and in her power i hope that she does but what is her story where was she before this photograph was taken and where is she going after um this image reads as so very right now speaking to this moment that we're living in in our state in our nation and around the world as global citizens this complex moment then the next generation um is inheriting that this young woman is inheriting that passion and the other winners and all of the 160 artists are inheriting um having to enter the halls of adulthood during a time when even the adults are experiencing something for the first time and figuring it out as we go um this is a piece that i hope to see printed large format it values the dignity of the human being and is also just so so very beautiful so i want to say congratulations pascal i look forward to following your career and your artwork and i'll pass it on to susan to say some more words oh thanks vanessa it was great so well said and um i just i love this image and i'm glad that khan and vanessa brought this image to my attention and i immediately knew why why and um and it's really interesting to live with the work and look at it over and over again because you start to relate to what the images is saying and to me it made me feel like it is exhausting what you know what was written in the artist statement about our phones and they will continue to be exhausting um but they have been and are our connection to the outdoor world um especially during the pandemic um in this woman's place in this pristine studio setting um telling many stories that we could all imagine and that we could respond to describe and then we look at ourselves and what kind of stories do we have within us and the irony here is and then such an original idea is that because even though the phone connects us it's an isolated moment it's quiet and the phone is actually just her mirror so again something else for us to contemplate as people in response to the work and um also her i find her facial expression and body language um showing weariness and that encompasses for me the past present and future and so much of what vanessa touched upon so congratulations and um and i also want to say congratulations at this point to all the artists um and to be very proud of all the artwork that came in and i was very honored to be a part of it thank you colin all right um you know vanessa and i both have this rise to the the top of the list i think for very similar reasons um i'd like to share just a couple of their points that that were really powerful to me one is just the incredible casual power that is demonstrated in this this young woman uh and another strong part to this piece i think is that we're invited into the scene it would not have the same strength and power were it just the selfie that was taken by that iphone but the fact that we're brought into the process uh and then the the technical merits that are that are on display here in lighting a scene with a light inside it it's a very technically difficult image to produce and then the the last real philosophical thing that i feel about it is that the way that the scene has been set with this plant and this backdrop uh i think really demonstrates uh an awareness of the reality that we're all creating inside these tiny one inch by two inch boxes on the computer screens in front of us you know i know that i didn't have all this stuff up on my wall before covet and i had to start inviting people into my studio every day and i think that this this speaks to that same construction of the reality that we're displaying to the world all the time in some really beautiful and powerful ways and i am immensely grateful to have had the opportunity to study this beautiful image for the last few days and to look through the other 160 pieces through the last few weeks has been an immense honor and i am just floored by the talent that apparently is surrounding me everywhere so keep doing it this is awesome thank you collin um you know the works are beautiful but listening to each of you the judges describe what you saw in them what you saw with what was represented how you described it but also putting it in an artistic context and putting it in the context of the lives we're living each of us now uh was just a wonderful experience uh so i want to thank uh susan collin and vanessa again uh for all the effort you put into taking so seriously these artworks uh in making the very very difficult uh decisions about who was going to receive the awards so from the bottom of my heart i want to thank you for the artistic lives that you're leading and helping us find our way as vermonters of course i want to thank all of the students i'm going to turn it back to rebecca i think who has a an announcement rebecca hi yes thank you and it's my pleasure to announce um that all of the winners artwork and all 160 pieces of artwork that were submitted will now go live on congressman welch's website so if you want to see all of the pieces you can go to congressman welch's website under services and then art competition so services and art competition the display is really spectacular so thank you so much and congressman welch i'll turn it back to you to make closing remarks well it's bittersweet you know normally when we're together and we get so excited about seeing the works and when i get so excited about meeting the artist judges and the three that we have are so articulate and obviously committing so much of their lives to artistic expression we get a chance to have a cup of juice or coffee [Music] and mingle and uh and get to know one another and it's always been a really really a thrill for me uh to be able to do that and now i i feel enormous frustration because i so enjoyed seeing the works that were chosen i so enjoyed the descriptions of those works from our judges uh that to say goodbye right now is very frustrating for me so i hope along the way uh i do i get an opportunity to meet the artist uh and our judges but i'll finish where i began and that's with just a heartfelt thank you to the students throughout vermont who are navigating on their own i mean you have none of us have faced uh a pandemic like this in a century here in this country and there's no road map for how to get through it and being uh high school students there's no road map for you you know your older brothers your older sisters uh can't tell you how they did it when it happened to them this is all something you've had to figure out on your own oftentimes in isolation without the supports of your friends and i i just want to salute you for that effort and applaud you for uh having the uh the the the will the vision and the generosity of spirit to create these artistic works and then the emotional uh bravery to display them and have them be commented on it really matters because each of us is trying to find a way to get through this world we're in it's fairly confusing these days and the best way to get through it is to express what you see and to try to help others along the way and that's the final thing i do want to express to the judges the way you commented it was so intelligent it reflected your consideration of the context of the world we're in the artistic world brand and uh your comments about the art was so specific uh and uh constructive uh that i learned a lot and i can only imagine how helpful it's been to the artist on whose work you were commenting so thank you all very much uh for participating in this wonderful tradition of the vermont arts competition that was started in this country by our very own then congressman jim jeffords from rutland vermont thank you and goodbye

i've been a member of a bipartisan group here in the house for a number of years that meets periodically with the members of the supreme court and today we had the honor of meeting with justice sotomayor she is as impressive in person as she was when we saw her on tv during her confirmation hearings our meetings lasted about an hour we talked about issues related to the court of course the court caseload how the court approaches certain matters and the like we need to interface with the judicial branch and i think it's really a good thing that members on both sides of the aisle can put aside their partisan differences sit down together and have a very good discussion with members of the supreme court of the united states as we did today with justice sotomayor

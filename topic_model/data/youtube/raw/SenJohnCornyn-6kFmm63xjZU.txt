CONSENT THAT THE QUORUM CALL BE DISPENSED WITH. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. CORNYN: MR. PRESIDENT, 28 DAYS AGO AN 18-YEAR-OLD YOUNG MAN OPENED FIRE ON STUDENTS AT THE ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN UVALDE, TEXAS. HE MURDERED 21 PEOPLE -- 19 CHILDREN AND 2 TEACHERS. IN THE PROCESS, HE EFFECTIVELY COMMITTED SUICIDE AS WELL. THIS WAS AN ATTACK THAT WAS SO CRUEL, SO BRUTAL AND INHUMANE THAT IT HAS BROUGHT MUCH OF OUR NATION TO ITS KNEES IN MOURNING. SINCE THE SHOOTING, MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED, AS I'M SURE MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE, I RECEIVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALLS AND LETTERS AND E-MAILS WITH A SINGULAR MESSAGE -- DO SOMETHING. DO SOMETHING. NOT DO NOTHING, BUT DO SOMETHING. TEXANS ARE DISGUSTED AND OUTRAGED BY WHAT HAPPENED AT ROBB ELEMENTARY AND THEY WANT CONGRESS TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF MORE INNOCENT LIVES. I DON'T WANT US TO PASS A BILL FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHECKING A BOX. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING USEFUL, SOMETHING THAT IS CAPABLE OF BECOMING A LAW, SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT AS A RESULT OF THE HARD WORK OF A NUMBER OF SENATORS IN THIS CHAMBER THAT WE'VE MADE SOME SERIOUS PROGRESS. IN PARTICULAR OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, SENATOR MURPHY, THE SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT, SENATOR SINEMA, THE SENATOR FROM ARIZONA, SENATOR TILLIS, THE SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA, AND I HAVE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR COMMON GROUND. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY, WHAT'S THE USE? WHY TRY? WE KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT DIVIDES MUCH OF THE COUNTRY, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE, AND MAYBE EVEN DIVIDES PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD, BUT I THINK WE HAVE FOUND SOME AREAS WHERE THERE'S SPACE FOR COMPROMISE, AND WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME RED LINES AND NO MIDDLE GROUND. WE'VE TALKED, WE'VE DEBATED, WE DISAGREED, AND FINALLY WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT AMONG THE FOUR OF US, BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WILL BECOME LAW OR FAIL TO BECOME LAW BECAUSE OF A SMALL GROUP OF SENATORS. THE TRUTH IS WE HAD A LARGER GROUP OF 20 SENATORS, 10 REPUBLICANS AND 10 DEMOCRATS COME FORWARD AND SIGN ON TO AN AGREED SET OF PRINCIPLES. AND I BELIEVE AS SENATORS SEE THE TEXT THAT SUPPORTS THOSE PRINCIPLES, THEY WILL SEE WE TRIED OUR BEST TO BE TRUE TO WHAT WE SAID THOSE AGREED PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE. SO SOON, VERY SOON, NOT SOON ENOUGH FOR ME, BUT VERY SOON WE WILL SEE THE TEXT OF BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP KEEP OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. WE KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WE ARE IMPERFECT HUMAN BEINGS, BUT WE HAVE TO TRY AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION. ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THIS LEGISLATION IS SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. FOLLOWING THE VIOLENT ATTACKS, WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT MISSED SIGNS. AND THE FACT IS AS "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RECENTLY PROFILED, THE TYPE OF YOUNG MAN TYPICALLY ALIENATED, ISOLATED, NOT RECEIVING ANY SORT OF SUPPORT OR PSYCHIATRIC CARE, CERTAINTY NOT COMPLIANT WITH THEIR DOCTOR'S ORDERS WITH TAKING THEIR MEDICATION THAT ALLOWS THEM TO MANAGE THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS CHALLENGES, WE KNOW THAT THIS PROFILE IS ONE THAT SALVADOR RAMOS FIT, THE SHOOTER IN UVALDE. HE WAS A DEEPLY TROUBLED YOUNG MAN. HE WAS ISOLATED, HE WAS BULLIED AT SCHOOL. HE CUT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE LIKED THE WAY IT MADE HIM LOOK. IT MADE HIM LOOK TOUGH. HE HAD A HISTORY OF FIGHTING, OF ASSAULTING FELLOW STUDENTS, OF THREATENING SEXUAL ASSAULT OF YOUNG WOMEN, AND TORTURING AND KILLING ANIMALS. IT'S A FAMILIAR PROFILE. THIS MAN -- THIS YOUNG MAN, I THINK, WAS CRYING OUT FOR HELP, BUT HE GOT NO HELP. NOTWITHSTANDING THE BEST EFFORTS OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM. THIS YOUNG MAN, HE SHOT HIS OWN GRANDMOTHER BEFORE HE WENT TO ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WANTED HIM TO GO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM AFTER BEING OUT OF THE CLASSROOM FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF COVID MITIGATION PRACTICES. SO OUR GOAL WITH THIS LEGISLATION IS TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE IN CRISIS GET TREATMENT BEFORE THEY REACH A POINT LIKE SALVADOR RAMOS. NOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR. NOT EVERYBODY WHO'S SUFFERING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS A THREAT TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. MANY PEOPLE SUFFER IN SILENCE WITH THEIR PARENTS, THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR SIBLINGS TRYING TO HELP THEM TO NO AVAIL, BUT THERE IS A SMALL SUBSET OF PEOPLE LIKE SALVADOR RAMOS WHO ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS IF THEY DON'T GET THE KIND OF HELP THEY NEED. SO THE PROVISION OF THE BILL WHICH REPRESENTS THE SINGLE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS DRAWN FROM BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION INTRODUCED BY SENATOR STABENOW AND SENATOR BLUNT. I THINK THERE ARE EIGHT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO MAKE THIS KIND OF ACCESS TO COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND OUR BILL WILL HELP DO THAT. IT EXPANDS HIGH-QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES NATIONWIDE THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF CERTIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICS. MANY OF THESE PROVIDERS ALREADY OPERATE IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BUT OUR LEGISLATION EXPANDS THE NETWORKS OF CLINICS TO DELIVER EVEN STRONGER AND MORE FULSOME SUPPORT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO INCLUDE PROVISIONS TO EXPAND SUPPORT OF CARE IN OUR SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT IS AT SCHOOL THAT MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SUPPORT. TEACHERS ACTUALLY SPEND MORE TIME THAN PARENTS TYPICALLY WITH OUR SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN AND SUPPORT OF -- SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT WILL BE PART OF THIS BILL WILL HELP IDENTIFY STUDENTS NEED THAT HELP SO INTERVENTION CAN BECOME AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. MR. PRESIDENT, AS THE PRESIDING OFFICER PROBABLY KNOWS, 60% OF GUN DEATHS IN AMERICA ARE SUICIDES -- SUICIDES, WE NOT ONLY WANT TO DO OUR BEST TO STOP THE SALVADOR RAMOSS IN THE FUTURE OF HURTING OTHER PEOPLE, BUT WE WANT TO HELP THEM AND KEEP THEM FROM HURTING THEMSELVES AS WELL. SO I BELIEVE THIS HUGE INVESTMENT IN AMERICA'S MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM IS AN INVESTMENT IN SAFER AND HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER PILLAR OF THE LEGISLATION IS SCHOOL SAFETY. THE UVALDE SHOOTER WAS ABLE TO ENTER ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THROUGH A DOOR THAT WAS NOT LOCKED WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THAT'S AN OBVIOUS VULNERABILITY. SCHOOLS NEEDS TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO, WHICH MEANS EVALUATING EMERGENCY SECURITY MEASURES, REVIEWING CURRENT PROTOCOL, ADOPTING BEST PRACTICES WHICH ARE BROADLY AVAILABLE THROUGH PUBLICATIONS AND STUDIES BY THE SECRET SERVICE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND THEY ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADD OR EXPAND THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AS APPROPRIATE. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO GO FEARFUL FOR THEIR CHILD'S SAFETY. AND NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND BE AFRAID FOR THEIR SAFETY. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND THE ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHERS IN OUR SCHOOLS DESERVE TO FEEL SAFE AND PARENTS DESERVE PEACE OF MIND, AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL PROVIDE. NOW, THE FINAL RANGE -- PORTION OF THIS BILL, BEYOND MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOL SAFETY INVOLVES A RANGE OF PROVISIONS TO PREVENT THESE SORT OF VIOLENT ATTACKS FROM OCCURRING IN TT FUTURE.  -- IN THE FUTURE. AGAIN, I BELIEVE THAT LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. I DON'T BELIEVE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS ARE A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH, AND THIS BILL HONORS THAT COMMITMENT. SO UNLESS A PERSON IS CONVICTED OF A CRIME OR IS A JUDE -- ADJUDICATED MENTALLY ILL, THEIR ABILITY TO PURCHASE A FIREARM WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS LEGISLATION. SOME HAVE SUGGESTED PROVISIONS THAT I BELIEVE WOULD INFRINGE ON SECOND-AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND REALLY NOT GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S NO PARTICULAR BAN ON A TYPE OF GUN OR NO MANDATORY WAITING PERIODS, NO BACKGROUND CHECKS OF INTRAFAMILY OR FRIEND-TO-FRIEND TRANSFER. NONE OF THESE ARE INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATION, AND SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES CLEARLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT. BUT, AGAIN, THAT'S BECAUSE LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. WHAT WE'RE TRYING DO IS PREVENT DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS FROM UNLEASHING VIOLENCE ON THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND ONE WAY OF ACHIEVING THAT GOAL IS THROUGH MORE ROBUST CRISIS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. NOW, THAT'S A BROAD TERM THAT DESCRIBES A RANGE OF INITIATIVES THAT AIM TO REDUCE VIOLENCE, PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND CONNECT INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS WITH THE HELP THEY NEED. IT COULD INCLUDE SOMETHING CALLED ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT, WHICH ALLOWS COURTS TO ORDER PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES TO RECEIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT TO ENSURE THEY RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED AND THE COURT WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THEY MAKE THEIR DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS AND TAKE THE MEDICATIONS THEY NEED IN ORDER TO REMAIN PRODUCTIVE. BUT BEYOND A.O.T.'S, OR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT, THERE ARE HEALTH COURTS, LIKE I SAW IN DALLAS, TEXAS, NOT THAT LONG AGO. ONE THING THAT WILL HAVE COMPLIANCE IS A JUDGE IN A BLACK ROBE SAYING, YOU WILL DO THIS, AND IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES, THAT'S WHAT IT WILL MEAN BUT THERE ARE ALSO COURTS WHICH TREAT THE ROOT CAUSE AND NOT THE SYMPTOM. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MENTAL TREATMENT AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE DELIVERED INCREDIBLE RESULTS. I'VE BEEN CLEAR AT THE OUTSET THAT I'M FOR PROVIDING LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANTS TO PUT FORWARD A RANGE OF CRISIS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT THAT STATE DEEMS BEST TO HELP REDUCE SUICIDE AND VIOLENCE OF NOW SOME OF OUR -- VIOLENCE. NOW, SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WANTED TO FOCUS THIS MONEY ON THE 19 STATES THAT PASSED SOME FORM OF RED FLAG LAW. THAT IS A CHOICE UP TO THE STATE. BUT WE ARE NOT INTRODUCING A NATIONAL RED FLAG LAW, BUT WE ARE PROVIDING THE AVAILABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED GRANTS TO CRISIS INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WHETHER YOU ADOPTED A RED FLAG PROGRAM OR NOT. PERHAPS YOU HAVE CHOSEN SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WELL, THIS GRANT PROGRAM WILL GIVE EVERY STATE FUNDING THAT IMPLEMENTS PROGRAMS THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE ADOPTED TO STOP INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS FROM REACHING THE POINT OF VIOLENCE OR SELF-HARM. IF ANY STATE WANTS TO PASS A LAW, OBVIOUSLY UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION, THEY ARE -- THEY HAVE AUTHORITY TO AUTHORITY TO PASS WHATEVER CRISIS INTERVENTION LAWS THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE AGREED UPON IS THEY HAVE TO HAVE ROBUST DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. SO IF THE NEW LAW DOES NOT INCLUDE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS, IT WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE GRANTS NO MATTER WHAT FORM THAT CRISIS INTERVENTION PROGRAM TAKES. OUR BILL ALSO PROVIDES INCREASED PROTECTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER A PERSON IS MARRIED TO THEIR ABUSER IF THE ABUSER IS CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE WHAT I WILL CALL NONTRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, WHETHER THEY'RE LIVING TOGETHER, WHETHER THEY HAVE A CHILD TOGETHER, OR WHETHER THEY HAVE A LONG-TERM ROMANTIC OR INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP. 86% OF GUN-OWNING HOUSEHOLDS SUPPORT THAT KIND OF PROTECTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS WHERE TOO OFTEN A GUN IS INVOLVED. AGAIN, THIS DOESN'T LIMIT LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS RIGHTS UNTIL SOMEONE IS CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC ABUSE UNDER STATE LAWS, THEIR GUN LAWS WILL NOT BE IMPACTED. AGAIN, THIS PORTION OF THE BILL INCLUDES CRITICAL DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS, WHICH, AS WE ALL KNOW, IS PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION. YOU SHALL NOT BE DEPRIVED OF YOUR RIGHTS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW. ONE NEW FEATURE THAT WE'VE PROPOSED IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF NONSPOUSAL MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ABUSE, NOT A FELONY, BUT MISDEMEANOR ABUSE WILL HAVE FIVE YEARS TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS RESTORED. THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAN RECORD AND THIS IS AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND COMMITTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND COMMITTED A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION TO STRAIGHTEN UP THEIR ACT AND TO NOT REPEAT IT. OUR BILL STRENGTHENS THE NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM, KNOWN AS NICS. IN UVALDE, THIS YOUNG MAN, SALVADOR RAMOS, PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECK, IT WAS LIKE HE WAS BORN YESTERDAY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY FOR THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS TO LOOK BACK ON ANY MENTAL HEALTH ADJUDICATIONS OR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE BARRED -- CONVICTIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE BARRED HIM FROM PURCHASING A FIREARM. IF A 17-YEAR-OLD IS CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT CRIME, THAT INFORMATION SHOULD SHOW UP IN THE BACKGROUND BACKGROUND CHECKN HE TURNS 18. 87 % OF HOUSEHOLDS SUPPORT MAKING JIEWF NIL -- THE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM WILL MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. THE STATES WILL CONTROL WHAT INFORMATION THEY'RE WILLING TO SHARE, BUT OUR LEGISLATION PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR STATES TO UPLOAD THE RECORDS THAT REFLECT ON THE SUITABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO PURCHASE A FIREARM, ALLOW THEM TO UPLOAD JUVENILE RECORDS INTO THE NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE-FIRE ARMS ARE NOT FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE UNDER 21 WHICH WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING THAT GUN IF THEY WERE AN ADULT WHEN IT HAPPENED. SO, MR. PRESIDENT, I KNOW THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO PLEASE EVERYONE. SOME THINK IT GOES TOO FAR. OTHERS THINK IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. AND I GET IT. BUT THE NATURE OF COMPROMISE AND THE NATURE OF ACTUALLY WANTING TO GET A RESULT REQUIRES THAT EVERYBODY TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND WHERE WE CAN. AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY HARD IN A 50-50 UNITED STATES SENATE. BUT I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE -- SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE TELLING US TO DO SOMETHING ARE SENDING US A CLEAR MESSAGE, TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN AND COMMUNITIES SAFE. I'M CONFIDENT THIS LEGISLATION MOVES US IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE WORKED IS HE -- WORKED SO HARD IN THIS PROCESS THAT HAS GOTTEN US THIS FAR. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE TEXT WILL BE RELEASED ESSENTIALLY AT ANY MOMENT, ALTHOUGH THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THAT TEXT IS WRITTEN HAVE BEEN PUBLIC FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. THIS LEGISLATION IS THE PRODUCT OF GOOD FAITH, BIPARTISAN NEGOTIATION. IT INCLUDES BILLS AND IDEAS OFFERED BY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. AND IT MAKES CHANGES THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY VAST MAJORITIES OF AMERICANS. AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT HAS THE REAL POTENTIAL TO BECOME LAW AND CREATE REAL CHANGES IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. SAFER, HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES, STRONGER, MORE SECURE SCHOOLS, SAVING LIVES, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT. SO I'M EAGER TO DISCUSS MORE DETAILS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AS THEY REVIEW THE TEXT IN THE COMING DAYS, AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SAME SORT OF GOOD FAITH AND THE OPENNESS TO OTHER IDEAS THAT HAVE BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT. AS WE DEBATE AND WE VOTE ON THIS BIPARTISAN

[Music] just over 40 years ago my dad start a small business in our backyard mowing grass while my dad's small business didn't change the world it changed our world helping my four siblings and I go to college to this day I still remember the name of the community banker who helped my dad get his business going his ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee I got to work everyday with this in mind how can we help those small business folks just like my dad we're working to make life better for their families and for their communities Thanks republicans pro-growth policies we continue to see our economy grow and job creators confidence continues to rise but we know that America's small businesses are still struggling to access the capital or the funding they need to grow that's why I'm looking for innovative ways to help our small businesses raise capital one examples through my work on investment crowdfunding investment crowdfunding simply makes it easier for everyday Americans to invest in small businesses they believe in it so whether it's through an investment to help fund new equipment we're simply going around the corner buying coffee your local own coffee shop today is an important reminder that we can all do our part to support America's small businesses the true job creators in our economy so go out shop small businesses and say thank you to these great job creators

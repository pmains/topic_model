thank you madam chair today the house is taking long overdue action and fulfilling our promise to the American people to lower the cost of prescription drugs medical research is fueled life-saving advancements in medicine but these innovations remain out of reach for too many to do exorbitantly high costs tragically three in 10 adults reported not taking their medicines as prescribed at some point because of the cost even those who can't afford their prescriptions are charged prices many times higher than in other developed countries this is simply unacceptable HR 3 puts us on a path towards a more equitable healthcare system where cost is no barrier to getting the care patients need in particular I want to highlight my legislation the protecting Medicare beneficiaries with pre-existing conditions act now included in HR 3 as section 801 more than 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have a supplemental insurance policy known as Medigap Medigap helps lower out-of-pocket cost but some 30 million more Americans are unable to buy a Medigap plan without being charged more being charged more for a pre-existing condition specifically disabled Americans under 65 and Medicare advantages role enrollees are not afforded the same coverage guarantees as nearly every other American the affordable care act rightly eradicated discrimination for pre-existing conditions in the individual market we need to finally right this wrong for Medicare beneficiaries as well and that's exactly what this bill does I look forward to this chamber passing HR 3 to give more Americans peace of mind when buying their insurance and standing at the pharmacy counter I hope all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this bill and with that I yield back the gentleman yields back the gentleman from Texas is recognized thank you madam Speaker I yield myself one minute so thank you the Republican altar

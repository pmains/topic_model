  HAPPENED LAST CENTURY. EARLIER THIS MONTH, TURKISH  SHELLED TO THE LEFT AND TO THE   RIGHT AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS. GREAT ALLY TURKEY IS.  WE HAVE HAD COUNTLESS  THEN WE'RE TOLD THE COMMITTEE  HASN'T HAD HEARINGS, WE'VE HAD   COUNTLESS HEARINGS ON THIS FOR   DECADES, INCLUDING A FOUR-HOUR   MARKUP WHERE WE PASSED IT  THROUGH COMMITTEE AND THE ONLY   ARGUMENT MADE THERE WAS THAT   TURKEY IS A GREAT ALLY.  LAST WEEK WE HAD HEARINGS THAT   SHOWED THAT TURKEY IS NOT SUCH A GREAT ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES. FINALLY, WE'RE TOLD, AND THIS  WAS INSULTING, DURING THE RULES  DEBATE, SOMEONE SAID IT'S NOT  WORTH OUR TIME.  ONE AND A HALF MILLION DEAD. THE FACT IS GENOCIDE DENIAL IS   THE LAST ACT OF A GENOCIDE.  FIRST YOU OBLITERATE A PEOPLE. THEN YOU OBLITERATE THEIR  MEMORY.  FINALLY, YOU SEEK TO OBLITERATE  THE MEMORY OF THE OBLITERATION.  ALSO, GENOCIDE DENIAL IS THE   FIRST STEP IN THE NEXT GENOCIDE. WHEN HITLER'S CADRES WONDERED IF THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH THE   HOLOCAUST HE WAS ABLE TO   REASSURE THEM BY SAYING WHO  TODAY SPEAKS OF THE ANILINGS OF  THE ARMENIANS? DENYING GENOCIDE IN THE PAST   WILL LEAD TO MORE GENOCIDE IN  THE FUTURE.  TODAY, GERMANY IS A AND  PROSPEROUS DEMOCRACY BECAUSE IT  HAS COME TO GRIPS WITH ITS OWN   PAST.  WHERE WOULD GERMANY BE TODAY IF  IT DENID HOLOCAUST?  TURKEY WILL BECOME A PROSPEROUS  AND MODERN NATION ONLY WHEN IT   RECOGNIZES THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE 20TH CENTURY.  THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR   TURKEY IS ACKNOWLEDGE THE  GENOCIDE AND URGE THEM TO DO   LIKEWISE.  I YIELD BAC

so the final decisions were made last week - were to locate the two big AG research agencies the location for the next ten years or so will be in Kansas City Missouri those were the only USDA agencies that didn't have representation outside of Washington that also puts them within about three hours of land-grant institution partners and other partners and what they do I think it's a great move I think the decision by the Secretary of Agriculture and the president to move those agencies harder closer to where they're logical partners are a great idea it's also somebody pointed out to me today the only time since bob byrd was elected to the senate that this many people moved out of washington and didn't go to west virginia so it's a big a big step in that direction and they're already moving into temporary space there right now and that permanent space has been decided for the next decade at a time when world food needs are going to be higher than they've ever been before in fact doubling between now and two thousand sixty having those critical AG research jobs in the heart of the best animal and plant research institutions in the country is a great move

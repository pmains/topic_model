♪♪ I'm Abigail Spanberger. Virginia's economy is strong, and we need to keep it growing by creating more
vocational training and apprenticeships so you can get a good job
and earn a good living, whether you have a four-year
college degree or not. And better job training
means more skilled workers. That helps businesses
keep growing, creating more opportunities. I approve this message because more training means better-paying jobs. That's the key to our future.

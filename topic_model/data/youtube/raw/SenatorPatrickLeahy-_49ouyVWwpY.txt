mr president as many of others have said today is a memorable day in our nation's history osama bin laden a man responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent victims including so many americans lost in september 11 2001 has been killed i commend president obama and his national security team for the careful planning of this operation as well as the members of our intelligence agencies who spent years collecting information that made it possible many of us know that when the president nominated leon panetta to be the director of the cia he told me his first directive must be to find osama bin laden i've known director panetta for nearly 30 years i know this is a man who takes on a task takes it on very seriously and in commanding him i also commend all those men and women who worked with him on this but i know that he gave singular attention to this issue but i also want to join americans across the country and praising the brave team the storm the compound where bin laden appears been hiding for years they completed their mission without loss of american lives to care to avoid civilian casualties as president i've had the privilege of going and watching some of these people part of the this uh these special forces train i watch the tremendous training they under undergo whether the seals or parts of jsoc or whatever it may be remarkable remarkable people and every one of them had to go there yesterday knowing that they may not return we also remember today the victims of all the attacks perpetrated by a man who more than any other represents the face of international terrorism september 11th attacks are at the forefront of our mind nearly 3 000 lives were lost including those victims of the world trade center in the pentagon on the four airplanes i remember that day as vividly as though it was yesterday we also remember with gratitude the first responders who rushed in to save lives even knowing they're risking their own and so many who did die in trying to save others what amazing acts of heroism and then of course the passengers on flight 93 who put the lives of americans on the ground ahead of their own but we should not forget and must remember the six victims of the 1993 world trade center bombing and the victims of the embassy bombings in kenya in tanzania in 1998 which left 224 dead including 12 americans we certainly must remember the lives of the 17 sailors killed in the bombing of the uss cole in october 2000. now the death of osama bin laden will not bring them back to us but we should all hope that it may help bring closure to those family members and friends who still grieve their loss today remember the lives of the brave american service members who served in the war in afghanistan and the sacrifices made by their families who mourn their loss or help them recover from the injuries as we do those who have served in iraq vermonters have answered the call to serve some from multiple deployments with the vermont national guard many most recently with the 86th infantry brigade which returned last december and of course we thank the brave men and women who've worked tirelessly to protect american soil from additional attacks now osama bin laden cloaked his attacks in anti-american rhetoric but his murderous and criminal path took the lives of innocents around the world including many of his own faith he proved himself to be what he was a cold-blooded murderer whose indiscriminate attacks have led to the death of maiming of muslims and people of other faiths all around the world but regrettably he leaves behind followers who are committed to the same message of hate and destruction they have no regard for the values that unite the rest humanity and common cause this is we should not cloak this person in the guise of somebody who deals with religious fervor he is a murderer a murderer a murderer president obama pledged that we'd bring osama bin laden to justice and last night we learned that bin laden has suffered the consequences of his atrocities justice has been served now i hope that americans will claim this moment to stand side by side as we did in the weeks and months following the september 11 attacks let us do as we did then transcend our differences and stand in unity unifying our support for the victims of bin laden's crime and our resolve to keep our great nations safe but also stand united in our commitment to the rights and principles to define us as a democratic nation that respects the rule of law actually that respect is what distinguishes us from those who seek to harm us is what will ultimately enable us to succeed against it and is what people around the world expect of america regrettably the september 11 attacks and other acts of international terrorism have often been used to justify policies which stray dangerously for those rights and principles and when that's happiness damage our global reputation has hurt our credibility but also ironically it's made it more difficult to build the broadest alliances against terrorism we also have to remember as so many of our military leaders have told us the military force while at times necessary as it was in the operation against osama bin laden is not a counter-terrorism strategy we've seen how nearly 10 years after 9 11. having spent hundreds of billions of dollars maybe trillions to combat terrorism the recruitment of terrorism among disaffected youth continues the pace around the world including in our own country we've also seen how much more we have to do to counter the misperceptions and misinformation fomented by extremists about the united states and our intentions addressing these challenges should be a priority as we go forward so i urge all americans to support our president this continuing effort urge all of us in congress to join together for the good of the country and all americans it is remarkable what this country accomplishes and our strong and brave and wonderful we are and we stand together now is the time to stand together we've done it before we can do it now and we're a better country when we do it

it is indeed fitting that we are here in statuary hall for don young was a man of stature and know that our hearts are with you our arms are wrapped around you joanie and dawn and all the grandkids all those who who don loved so much know that our hearts are with you at this very very challenging time for for all of us because in so many ways we were all part of the young family i don't know how many in this room but i know most alaskans have somewhere tucked away in some drawer a button that says i'm a young woman or i'm a young man we all have been there for our congressman don young so as we are here to pay our respects to the congressman for all of alaska the dean of the house and just the 43rd individual to lie in state probably the only one who has ever stuck his hand into an animal trap in a hearing just to prove a point that was our one and only don young but truly i cannot imagine a more fitting place to start to say goodbye because this is just the beginning of the goodbyes but here in the united states capital where don dedicated 49 years of his life to the 49th state i think he would really find that fitting just 49 and 49 we always know that he wanted to do just one more we're just going to do one more but i think it is appropriate because everything that he did was for the state that he loved and loved so well and the state that loved him back equally for so many alaskans don young is the only congressman they have ever known they have ever known and so for them what is next there is such a hole such a hole in our heart so again speaker pelosi leader mccarthy thank you for affording our congressman this extraordinary honor to be here to lay in state in statuary hall so much has been said about about dawn in these past 11 days since his passing and and and dan has articulated well some of the some of the stories some of the words that have been used to to describe him there will be many stories about his career his character truly his tireless devotion to alaska and alaskans about his his many many adventures many that perhaps shouldn't be shared in polite company um and certainly many of his accomplishments but i think you will hear repeated over and over the dawn was larger than life he was as colorful as they came he was tough but he was loyal and loyalty nowadays seems to be a commodity that can be in short supply but don young was loyal he was gruff but he had a soft spot he could be so caring so compassionate and he was not just a colleague to me but he was a mentor he was my friend he truly has been my congressman for for all of my tenure and and again the congressman for all of alaska for so many alaskans lives it is it is also important to know that as much as he loved alaska and alaskans he loved the institution he loved the house of representatives and it showed it showed in the respect that he had for his colleagues and he would be barking at you but then he would say let's make this happen let's make this happen for the right reasons and partisan politics was one thing and he could fight with the rest of them but he was a man who wanted to get things done we celebrate don for his incredible contributions to alaska and to our nation and to his family we owe you all such a debt of gratitude you have shared him with us for so long for some of you for all your lives and as we go forward we're saddened but we go forward with resolve knowing that there is a new star shining in the night sky to guide us true north but dawn your heart was always alaska and your legacy will shine forever we will miss you we will mourn you we thank you rest in honor and rest in peace

mr. Oliver let me pick up on a line of questioning that chairman Sullivan was pursuing during his time and that salt water recreational fishing you mentioned on page two of your testimony that NOAA Fisheries is going to partner with Atlantic States Marine Fisheries to host a national summit in March of next year on the saltwater recreational fisheries I've introduced a bill called the modernizing recreational fisheries management Act which would amend magnuson-stevens to improve management for saltwater recreational fish fishing it's co-sponsored by ranking member Nelson also by Senators Blunt Inhofe shots and club HR of this committee will you work with Congress as we explore magnuson-stevens reauthorization in a way that allows its successes to continue while also adapting to fix the problems at hand especially those with recreational fishing and I would mention specifically the marine recreational information program which a recreational fishermen believe lacks timeliness and accuracy they believe the program is not designed to monitor short seasons like red snapper and have you have you looked at my bill and also have you looked at the idea of innovations such as Mississippi's tails and scales electronic reporting system for red snapper landings by using smartphone snaps so it's sort of a two-part question that I'll wrap into one there Thank You senator mr. Sullivan senator Sullivan yes I thank you for the question we absolutely want to work within whatever construct you have to improve those types of information I have become acutely aware in the short month that I've been here of some of the issues surrounding not not just red snapper but certainly a lot of focus on red snapper particularly with regard to some of our some less than perfect satisfaction with some of our own stock assessment information less than perfect satisfaction with our M rep program it's a gentle way to say that yes sir and we of course haven't pending a baseline benchmark stock assessment for red snapper thanks to funding that's been provided it's going to be a couple of years before we get the results of that but that's going to be an important piece of information on the data collection side what's coming out of the water I have heard from a number of constituents from a number of people I've had discussions amongst my own staff leadership over the past two weeks about some of its satisfaction I've heard with the emmerich program and the speed with which it's progressing that that program is a work in progress and I understand some of the frustrations I think we have some improvement spending on it going from the telephone survey to to a mail survey will be an improvement I've also heard that it's not enough it's not fast enough and we're not taking great enough advantage of some of the state data collection programs as the one you referenced and a couple of thoughts on that is I have made it a priority based on discussions over the past two weeks to prioritize and expedite the certification of those state data programs we are using data for many of those programs and a lot of those are supported through the MRAP program but I have heard loud and clear that we need to expedite the certification of those programs and the use of the data in those programs and I personally believe when you look around at the technology we have today and cell phone smart phone technology that there have to be we we have to find a way to utilize those technologies to get that information quickly more quickly and more accurately and I know that there have been concerns about you that information is it the apples and oranges problem with you tying it to data from the MRAP and other programs in terms of stock assessments but I think we we are going to make it a priority to do that we also also believe that if regardless of the implications for stock assessment if we have a way to get better information today on what fish is coming out of the water we don't need to be using that and so I absolutely agree with the provisions or the points that you're making I've had a chance to briefly look at the legislation you've introduced tonight I think it's consistent with it seems to be consistent with the things we already intend to do but certainly any help and direction that you want to provide us and that would be most welcome and we'll work with you sir very good and my time is expired so I'll just ask you on the record about something I was going to explore in this hearing that's that's aquaculture in federal waters there in 2016 there was a final rule so far we haven't had any bites on actually applications because of the expensive permitting process and other regulatory challenges so mr. chairman I think I'll just ask mr. Oliver he could comment on the record since we're were pressed for time here about why he thinks we haven't had any anybody apply now that now that we have a program for aquaculture so thank you

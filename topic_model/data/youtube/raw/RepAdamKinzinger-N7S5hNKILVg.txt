republican congressman adam kinziger sits on the foreign affairs committee he's also an air force veteran who served in iraq and afghanistan he's currently a lieutenant colonel in the air national guard congressman thanks for being with us the biden administration as we just mentioned is expected to lay out more military aid a new military aid package for ukraine focused on the anti-tank anti-aircraft missile systems that we've been seeing that they have been sending to great effect it is i assume you support that i i you've talked about a no-fly zone in the past where are you at on this in terms of what the scope of usaid has been well so look it's been i mean it's been good obviously we're seeing the devastating effects to the russian military from it ukraine is significantly outnumbered russia has made it clear vladimir putin has made it clear that he will not lose which is why we're worried about an escalation into weapons of mass destruction so i you know i do commend the administration for all they've done so far what i worry about anderson is as russia begins to escalate god forbid and i hope i'm wrong there may be a moment where we realize we do have to close the skies and let's keep in mind vladimir putin has no right to contest the skies over ukraine in the first place and ukraine has a right to defend their skies even if that involves partner but i'd also like to see you know better uh missile defense or better uh anti-air missiles that go higher range anti-shipping missiles as we're seeing the potential for an amphibious landing for instance off the coast of odessa so there's a lot more to do but i do commend what we've done so far one of the the you know things that president zolensky has repeatedly said is that that you know the shelling of buildings some of which uh may come from aircraft firing firing rockets firing missiles um but a lot of that also comes from tanks or artillery on the ground or even great at great distances even potentially from belarus or from russian soil if there was an attempt to shut down the skies and president zlunski's words wouldn't that actually entail trying having to try to take out all of those uh you know missiles being fired from from artillery from long-range artillery well it could certainly include for instance it depends what kind of a no-fly zone is it a humanitarian corridor is it western ukraine or all of ukraine obviously you have to watch when artillery is fired because the altitude you don't want to fly over it i don't think that would be a huge problem with shutting down the skies but i think the reality is is we're kind of allowing uh right now vladimir putin to set the battle tempo we're allowing him to threaten escalation and we're more eager to say what we won't do and that's what my fear is is that we're actually doing a better job of deterring ourselves and nato than we are russia again i don't want to say this as a point to say we're not doing anything significantly we are and ukrainians with their fighting spirit have shown that but uh man i do worry what happens when this goes into chemical weapons and i think the president should make it very clear that weapons of mass destruction are a very very bright red line that nato will enforce do you think it likely i mean obviously you know we've seen in syria the use of of chemical weapons we've obviously in russia use them one-on-one against individuals uh that have uh spoken out against vladimir putin or in some way angered him both in russia and and in europe um do you think it a very real possibility chemical weapons could be used here yeah i do i think it's a very real possibility i think vladimir putin's made it clear he doesn't want to lose he can't lose and uh his military's trying their best to lose it for him and uh given the logistics and everything and i think anderson that brings up another point and another area of the administration should certainly be looking is there are russian proxy wars everywhere around the world uh look into syria uh there are russians in syria libya uh you name it maybe it's time for us to start you know we're not gonna engage russia directly in ukraine and i understand that decision uh maybe we ought to look at supporting some of our allies fighting russians in other areas as well um congressman i'm kinsaker i appreciate your time thank you

Thank You mr. chairman mr. Attorney General thank you for being here today last month I had the pleasure of meeting with you to discuss important topics that are affecting our nation and I thank you for that of those many issues you mentioned how the Department of Justice is working to reduce gun and gang crime within America with project safe neighborhoods after seeing how a week the previous administration was on crime I'm happy to see this administration make steps to toughen up on criminal and gang activity when I speak with local police chiefs and sheriffs in South Mississippi they all agree we need to organize and deploy programs that fund street-level outreach education and employment opportunities as a combat gun in gang violence to that point could you please tell me what is your request for the project safe neighborhoods program and how will it help to address the ongoing violence and neighborhoods throughout our country well thank you it's 140 million dollars it will be money not going to the federal government but be going to your local law officers in the form of a grant and that goal of it would be to help our local grant recipients create task forces and partnerships to be more effective in their neighborhood we've got our professors who've reviewed the program in its previous existence and established to my clear conviction that it worked and we're going to make it even better now and the key to success in making our communities safer is this seamless partnership between the federal resources we are not bound by county and city jurisdictions or state lines even sometimes we can go internationally what's the local police aren't able to do so we have an opportunity to have partnerships in a good way DEA after we you've given us 20 18 additional money we met with Rob Patterson their acting director and he's already added 400 task force positions where we subsidize local law officers to participate in a TAS force to deal with that local communities problem so we want to help South Mississippi deal with its problem and it might be quite different than a problem somewhere else in America and we'll help them deal with their problem well thank you for that and I think the project safe neighborhoods is a great program and real quickly I know you mentioned that the majority of the drugs enter in our country is coming through our southern border and but but it's the drugs aren't just being manufactured in Mexico but it's coming from South and Central America and we have national security cutters out there every day I think at last count the Coast Guard is responsible through the NSCs for taking off more than half of the cocaine seizures and you know throughout our US government do you do you have any thoughts or ideas I mean I know we need to surge to the border using every resource we have guard National Guard CBP other other agencies federal agencies collaborating but how do we stop those drugs from making their way into Mexico perhaps from a naval perspective thank you I know you've raised that with us before and you're aware of some of the situations that are important we believe that Coast Guard and perhaps the Navy too can not perhaps the Navy also can play big role in this we know that a large amount of drugs is leaving from colombia and south of colombia and it's brought by boat often mostly some comes directly to the United States but mostly it's its unloaded in Mexico and taken across our border unlawfully and so we have an opportunity to really make a breakthrough in my opinion in focusing on that opportunity and the main limitation of our ability to be successful in making even more big seizures is simply the number of boats and helicopters are in the region so they're coming up through the Caribbean some from Colombia and Venezuela and some is probably more coming up the Pacific outside and so it's very much an opportunity as you and I discussed to make a breakthrough well thank you for that as well and sadly we we know we have visibility on a lot of the smuggling of drugs but we don't have the resources to capture and take all of it off the water and with more resources we can do that and once again making our neighborhoods safer here in America thank you thank you thank you mr. pallazzo we recognize it

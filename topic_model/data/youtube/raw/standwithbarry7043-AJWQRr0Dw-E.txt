hello friends this Saturday July the 4th we're gonna celebrate 244 years as an independent nation but as we get together and we celebrate our Independence Day let's keep in mind that while a vote of the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1776 gave us our independence our freedom was earned on the battlefield so as we celebrate our independence let's remember to honor those who sacrifice so much for our freedom god bless you and God bless america

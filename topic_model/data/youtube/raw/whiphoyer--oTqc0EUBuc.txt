we watched as Senator John McCain returned to the Capitol after having been diagnosed with cancer and undergoing a serious operation all of us are praying for his swift and full recovery in earlier days as we all know he faced danger with courage he's doing the same again right now when he spoke yesterday from the Senate floor he talked about a time when legislators Republicans and Democrat despite their differences work together to make progress albeit incremental on major issues through discussion and compromise he lamented as do I the recent tendency total partisan victory or nothing at all something we see is much in the house as in the Senate Senator McCain said this quote we've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle he concluded in that paragraph we are getting nothing done instead Senator McCain proposed legislators ought to return to regular order regular order for those who aren't familiar with the day-to-day workings of Congress simply means doing things in the proper way drafting a bill in committee holding open hearings marking up with amendments reporting it out and then bring it to the floor for amendment and debate before voting on it this process this regular order of business affords every member an opportunity regardless of party or district to have input and help shape the policy that is the way it should be the product of such a process as Senator McCain described it would be and again I quote something that will be imperfect full of compromises and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either side but he concluded it was one that quote might provide workable solutions to problems Americans are struggling with today mr. speaker that is how our system is supposed to work I started my career in this body in 1981 shortly thereafter I joined the Appropriations Committee I like to tell people that I served on the labor health committee and there were 13 of us the Democrats were in the majority and there were eight Democrats and five Republicans and I used to tell people you could take the 13 of us throw us up in the air have us come down in random seats and have a markup and you would have been hard-pressed to identify which party each member represented today lamentably mr. speaker it would take you about a minute to determine those differences our speaker said on October 29th 2015 we will advance majors of legislation one issue at a time mr. speaker we're about to consider they so-called minibus the former chairman my Republican friend mr. Rogers is seated here in this chamber with us he and I both would call a time when be considered one bill at a time we brought it to the floor we amended it we debated it and we voted on it one bill at a time that's what speaker Ryan was referring to when he said we will advance Majors legislation one issue at a time apparently because that has become inconvenient or impossible but it is not the regular order that we are pursuing speaker Ryan went on to say we will not duck the tough issues we will take them head-on Mr Speaker we will adopt a rule that will duck the issue that will preclude full debate and it deals with president Trump's proposal to build a wall that many of his administration believe will be ineffective in accomplishing the objective that we all support and that is keeping our country secure and making sure that those who come into this country are known to us and don't sneak in to the country but the wall will not work and we will not be able to debate that fully because it will be included in the rule and I suggest mr. speaker that is ducking the issue it will be deemed passed we won't vote on it we will vote for the rule or against the rule and the wall and 1.6 billion dollars will be deemed passed mr. speaker that's now how our system is supposed to work neither side ought to let the perfect become the enemy of the good neither side can claim credit for all the best ideas that's why working together is imperative that was my experience when I served for 23 years on the Appropriations Committee that's why regular order is so important it protects me can people it protects each member who is here representing some 700,000 people give or take that's why regular order is so important it facilitates dialogue and debate it brings out every view and idea and provides the framework for compromise compromise is the essence of democracy and I suggest it is the essence of successful families whether they be countries or mom and dad and kids they come together and they agree not because they get everything they want or the other side gets nothing they want but because both sides compromise it's a speaker I agree with Senator McCain we need to return to regular order Speaker Ryan as I've said told us shortly after his elevation that he wants and I quote the house to work its will many buses don't allow that on the buses don't allow that frankly see ours don't allow that the speaker adopted in principle and open and transparent process sadly Mr Speaker we haven't always seen that but there's still an opportunity for 115th Congress to reflect that vision that's what Senator McCain was talking about yesterday he was appealing to the best of us the American in us not the partisan in us not the confrontational is in US but the seeker of productive compromise in a democracy the Congress and our country will be better if we return to regular order and I yield back the balance of my time the

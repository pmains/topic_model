i wanted to continue highlighting the example in uh at the city of palouse which is a it's a very small town just over a thousand people they had in without the brownfields grant would whitman county and counties like it be able to afford assessments and clean up of contaminated sites or attract private properties like those in pullman and palouse from a county's perspective and for our small towns it's unqualified no we would not be able to afford it we struggle with paying our employees a livable wage we don't do new programs we can't pick up new initiatives without this money from the epa it would not have happened and categorically so we have the example of the plus side i know that it's it's farther along than the the pullman site but would you speak to what would be the impact on the community without this grant and then since the police clean up what has it done for the local economy and how has it changed the community well when we look at a brett brownfields remediation we look at two things the first being the environmental impact of this particular site the second being the economic viability of this this particular site i happen to serve on the snake river sand recovery board which deals with creating habitat for salmon which relates to our transportation needs and needs to keep our dams and our our uh barges and my wheat going down to export but for the city of palouse uh and mayor echinova of that former mayor deserves a lot of credit of this they're a bedroom town of of washington state university pullman without the grant funding for from the epa for this brownfields remediation 160 as you say that downtown would be unavailable for economic development and so currently they have that ready for economic development we have another site uh in pullman that we're looking at and hopefully we'll be able to redevelop that in the future uh without epa money the city of pullman marshall state university and the port of whitman would not be able to develop a particular project there so i would suggest to you the whitman county may not have the most amount of brownfields on behalf of counties nationwide i would say its impact is huge thank you and thank you again commissioner largent for joining us here today mr ford i wanted to ask just for you to speak if the brownfields program did not exist would private capital want to get involved and clean clean up these sites and would you just speak to that aspect no you'd you'd really be up so what i called to get you'd get upside down on a project extremely quick again and what you find out if you if you just look at recent history um the people that really had the appetite for risk were the people that really had nothing to lose you know the the non-profits the economic development authorities people like that who who had the confidence uh to to have the the the state and the federal governments back them but even at that there's too many other opportunities for for developers to to jump into and capitalize on with less risk and so uh the importance of of the us epa is that they they have this collaborative approach to share that risk so it's not that we're risk uh so much risk averse is that you know we don't want to be the only one up there with everything to lose and so what's what's great about the us epa is that it allows us to share risk it allows us to collaborate on the end use and it elaborate it it elaborates on on an opportunity or gives us a mechanism where by which the developer the landowner the community elected officials at the local state and federal level can work together on an assessment the cleanup thank you great i wanted to ask one more question because you talk about these brownfield the brownfields program being the gateway would you speak to the economic second chance that it gives communities that have lost that legacy manufacturing facility absolutely i'll go so far as to say that the epa is is the funding source of last resort if it wasn't for the epa we wouldn't have those opportunities to to help these communities that are on the last leg that lost an industry that lost a business and and again it it gives those people hope to bring life or what i say breathe life back into the bones of these communities thank you my time has expired thank you mr chairman i yield back

so the last two weeks we've been on a farm tour throughout the third congressional district i've been to farms from methuen to lancaster lowell uh to concord there are 804 farms in this district which contribute to 40 million dollars in in products sold we've seen farms that produce fruits and vegetables dairy farms even farms that produce the flowers the tulips and the mums that we see in our grocery stores so it's been such an informative experience uh some cool things that i learned that 97 of the farms are family owned in fact some of the farms that we visited in dracut and methuen they've been in families for more than a century so these farms are not only huge contributors to our local economy but also to our community with farm to table and farmers markets and farm stands being on the rise there are social collisions that are happening all over this district as a result of our farming community so i look forward to bringing back the issues that i learned in terms of how to make how to support our farmers down in washington i look forward to bringing that with me and look forward to keeping you posted [Music]

you know I agree with you mr. Leiter that you know the FBI JTTF have an enormous challenge so much information is coming through and you miss one one thread and then you're held accountable i think this case though i would make the argument is a little different you've got a major on base fort hood he was talking to a cleric who there was some evidence that may have even had ties to the nine eleven hijackers for God's sakes and he's really rising in stature to becoming the number two in the world next to bin Laden and I think you know and unfortunately w FL owing only gets two emails they don't get the May 31st email that clearly outlines what his intentions are and what he's planning to do you're right professor San Diego has it though why you know and they have DoD employees on these task forces you know why didn't one of those at least contact Fort Hood why didn't anybody contact Fort Hood and say you know what there's an issue here there's a pre got a problem you get a guy that could actually kill somebody you know and I don't think any of you really have the answer that I don't have the answer to that it's just unfortunate that didn't happen in this case and so with that again we thank you for your brilliant insight in your excellent testimony and I'll dismiss this panel move on to panel to thank you

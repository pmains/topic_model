so Michael sale I don't understand you know here basically Republicans are handing the president an easy political victory I don't have to get anything past anyway I don't get it I you know even with the idea that immigration is going to somehow you know eclipse the gun debate is just a boneheaded position to take I don't understand the idea of positioning the party position in the leadership against an issue that is a ninety percent issue with voters out there you know at least pretend that you're interested in it please pretend that you give a damn about what happened and that you're willing to make a step forward to resolve the concern that people have in the country about guns regardless of where you are on the NRA and all of that it's not that's not the point I mean this is some of the craziest posturing I've ever seen when the country sitting near hemorrhaging their concern on this issue for the party to step back and basically say we're not even listening to what you have to say it's crazy

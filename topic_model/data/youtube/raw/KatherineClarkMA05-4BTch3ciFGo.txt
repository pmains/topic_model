hello everyone and thank you all so much for tuning in to our panel discussion today that will focus on the problem of plastics pollution and the urgent actions we need to take on climate as we begin a new session in congress and welcome a new administration we must shift from talking about this the defining challenge of our time to acting and confronting the climate crisis and mitigating its impact on our communities now and for future generations a year ago i introduced the break free from plastic pollution act of 2020 with senator tom udall and representative alan lowenthal this legislation would take critical steps to address plastic pollution including phasing out single-use plastic products holding corporations accountable for wasteful products reducing wasteful packaging and reforming our broken waste and recycling collection system in december we asked again uh to urge president biden to adopt a comprehensive plan to address the ramifications of plastic pollution on americans health and our environment both of which disproportionately impact communities of color while also creating good jobs by boosting the domestic manufacturing of sustainable alternatives we know this is not a hypothetical problem it is an existential crisis that is devastating to communities across the globe but this also presents us with an opportunity to build a new visionary framework that prioritizes a resilient clean economy environmental justice and public health the break free from plastic pollution act presents a comprehensive solution for one of the leading contributors of carbon dioxide production plastics this bill will reign in waste improve recycling decrease harmful emissions and ensure that plastics don't wind up in our oceans and waterways this legislation would phase out unnecessary single-use plastic products hold corporations accountable reduce packaging and reform our waste and recycling systems recent reports estimate that each person consumes a credit card's worth of plastic per week that's because plastic is everywhere and it doesn't bio-degrade plastic breaks down into microplastics that are found in the rain water on the peaks of the mountains in new hampshire to farmland soil that produces our food and in our lakes rivers and seas plastic production is also a major contributor to climate change with its production expected to account for 20 percent of global oil consumption by 2050 meanwhile 92 of us plastic waste is never recycled so by shifting the responsibility for recycling and cleanup to the companies that produce wasteful products the waste the practical waste reduction and waste management policies can reverse this trend and put the united states on a path to break free from plastic produce pollution as we have asked the president to make addressing this issue a priority not just by supporting our bill but by implementing strong executive actions right out of the gate and president biden has already shown that addressing climate change is a top priority by rejoining the paris climate agreement and implementing a slate of executive orders aimed at tackling the climate crisis but we know there's more work to be done and i am excited to be joined by an incredible panel of local experts and advocates on climate and environmental justice we have state representative maria robinson kirsty pesci from the conservation law foundation nancy downes from oceana and dwayne tyndall from alternatives for community and environment and emily norton of the charles river watershed association all of them have joined us today to discuss their work and the issue of plastic pollution i'd like to now introduce my friend state representative maria robinson prior to her election to represent framingham in the state house she worked in the clean energy sector to address climate change her experience ranges from working with the massachusetts department of energy resources to deploy solar panels at municipal waste and wastewater facilities to working in state legislatures and agencies in over half of the country advocating for clean air regulations to provide expert testimony in front of federal energy regulatory commission she is the only elected member appointed to the u.s epa clean air act advisory committee which oversees the technical implement implementation of the federal clean air act representative thank you for joining us and can you tell us a bit about the policies that you have been working on at the state level absolutely and thank you so much for having us today uh representative clark it's such an honor to be here with some incredible experts that i know are working um with many of my colleagues in the state house and also in state houses across the country we're so thrilled that you are tackling this and asking the biden administration to tackle plastics at the federal level but of course states continue to lead in many ways especially over the past four years on a lot of important issues around environmentalism around clean energy clean water clean air and this is uh this is no exception to the rule when it comes to plastics in 2020 alone more than 200 bills were introduced across 35 states aimed at reducing plastic pollution in some way shape or form and that included bands such as single-use plastic bands or polystyrene bands anti-preemption bills and then of course the extended producer responsibility work that you've mentioned and we have all of those bills pending here in massachusetts as well what i'm particularly excited about is that the national caucus of environmental legislators of which i'm on the board and also the massachusetts representative earlier this month they pulled together a new network it's called the epr for packaging network and it start started out with a group of legislators from about nine different states announcing a really coordinated effort to start to hold producers responsible for that end of life management of plastic packaging and we're so thrilled that legislators from both sides of the aisle frankly are are getting invested in ensuring that plastics are not a long-term part of our future but we are finding um unique and creative ways to use them um some of the things that i'm excited about as well is that you know hawaii actually passed a law last year that has their state department transportation looking at using recycled plastic for road work and so it's solving multiple problems in this creative way that would also reduce reduce pollution at the end of the day so um of course you know we we see that even new york is looking more comprehensively at things like their right to refill at um which it turns out that plastics is not just an environmental issue but sometimes can be a health code issue in in that situation so it would allow you to in non-coveted times bring reusable food and drink containers in into different food establishments so here in massachusetts i know that my colleague michael day is introducing a really amazing um extended producer responsibility bill um the incredible representative michelle socolo is working with many of these people on this call uh on some comprehensive work along with senator jason lewis uh as they lead uh the brand new zero waste caucus and and so we're thrilled to see some of the work expanding our existing bottle bill um and and looking to just reduce the amount of plastic that we have and shifting that responsibility which i think is so important from the consumers to the producers in order to ensure that there there's real equity there um for many folks and i'm sure others will will touch on this this is an environmental justice issue as much as anything else recognizing that incinerators and landfills are are in some of our poorest and most vulnerable communities so i'm thrilled to be here with everyone today and thank you so much for having us oh thank you representative and thank you for your leadership and i'm glad that everyone you mentioned is part of our incredible ma5 delegation so thank you all for being such leaders on this issue and now i'd like to introduce kirsty pesci kirsty is the director of the zero waste project and a senior fellow at the conservation law foundation kirsty is a former massperg staff attorney actively engaged in waste reduction and opposing the expansion of landfill and incinerator capacity kirsty is part of the zero waste boston coalition which advocates for zero waste solutions such as reuse recycling redesign and composting anaerobic digestion in the city of boston she also founded the central massachusetts group residents for alternative trash solutions to oppose a regional landfill expansion in her community and oppose and promote zero waste principles kirsty would you talk about your work to address pollution and waste where we have seen successes and what we need to do differently and if you could expand on the problem of plastic pollution specifically and why action is needed thank you so much for joining us well thank you for having me and as you just heard a lot is happening in state government around these issues so we're making some progress and about five years ago when i started four years ago when i started the zero waste project we did not hear about plastic and that has changed people understand now that it's a problem and it is a very very serious problem but a problem that we have solutions for um one of the problems that the presidential action plan actually addresses is the subsidies for oil and gas plastic is made primarily from oil and gas think of it as fla fracked plastic that's what bill mckibben is calling it and so what that means is if we are paying these companies to pump gas out of the earth we're never going to be able to create fair market conditions where we use reusables or glass and aluminum materials that are actually recyclable so we need to stop that we think it's about 650 billion dollars a year of subsidies that the u.s government is giving to these companies so again we need to stop doing that um and remember that the production of plastic is polluting at every stage fracking gas as i said very polluting tremendous impact on the climate the emissions into the environment from methane and other things very very polluting leaving legumes of polluted water behind refining and manufacturing the gas and making it into plastic is incredibly polluting and we're finding that those facilities as is already stated are in environmental justice communities meaning communities where people have less money less english access and less um more people who are people of color people with less power frankly and they get they're on the front lines and being impacted by these huge facilities across the country um and then plastics waste management there's been a whole a whole gas lighting that's happened because the oil and gas companies got together and said we're going to pretend that plastic is recyclable we're going to slap a triangle on everything and we're going to tell people it's fine to use this because it's recyclable but for almost all plastics there is no market partly because virgin plastic production is so cheap because of the subsidies i mentioned but also because there are so many different kinds of plastic with so many different additives that sorting them cleanly to make it actually a reusable product is not financially sustainable and then when you add to that how dangerous plastics are at every stage as i said and also how dangerous plastics are to use as you stated earlier we have plastics on the mountain top and we have plastics in the mariette trench we also have plastic particles coming out of our dryers because our clothes are 60 plastic so we're breathing that in we have plastics we're finding plastic in women's placentas that means that we're directly impacting you know human health and then you know a step further there's plastic and plankton and there's plastic and ant hills there's plastic and soil all of our natural systems rely on their ability to absorb oxygen and you know all of those pieces are being hindered by plastic being in the system so not only is it not recyclable the way that glass or aluminum is recyclable really can be recycled infinitely but also it's dangerous to be using these plastics and then drinking out of these plastic containers and eating out of them so we need to and we're breathing them honestly so we need to do a better job with all those pieces and i think as you you'll hear from the other panelists we need to make good choices ourselves and do the best we can and we need to encourage local solutions you know because those also are you know what we have in the united states is this wonderful political laboratory where we try things locally when they work we try them at the state level when they work at the state level we try them at the federal level but the problem is a an international problem um there's an incinerator in maine that's been receiving plastic from northern ireland so we need to and some of it got jumped in a bay in maine so we need to do a better job with all of this but we really need that action you were talking about up front at the federal level because we have solutions as the representative just said producer responsibility for packaging good strong deposit return systems or bottle bills all of those pieces work really well but we need to put them in place in a much broader and in national and really international level so i'm so glad we're talking about this today because we can solve the problems but we need to really hunker down and do so oh thank you so much and i i think people are surprised when they find out there is no national bottle bill and uh we so appreciate the work being done locally across the commonwealth and hope to put that uh into use uh in federal policy but now i'd like to introduce nancy downes nancy came on board in august of 2017 and is the lead campaign organizer for ocean anna i always want to add some syllables to oceana in the commonwealth of massachusetts prior to joining oceana nancy was on the front lines of protecting the southern california coastline as both a volunteer and a grassroots activist and for 12 years as the southern california's regional manager for surf rider foundation she led numerous campaigns and educ educational programs on marine protected areas wetland restoration beach renourishment projects urban runoff and marine litter reduction nancy one of the priorities for your organization has been the problem of plastic pollution and you have extensive experience working to protect our shores and coastal waters can you elaborate on the problems of plastics pollution and why action is needed urgently and thank you again for being with us thank you congresswoman clark and representative robinson and all the panelists here it's an honor to be here thank you so much especially for your leadership in introducing the break free from plastic pollution act and just your leadership here locally in the state of massachusetts uh it's awesome uh our oceans are facing a massive threat with plastic pollution and that's it's either oceana or oceania either one's okay um 17.6 billionths of plastic pollution enter our oceans every year that's approximately a garbage truck every minute uh and as uh kirsty said a meter nine percent eight or nine percent of all plastic that's ever been made was actually recycled so as you said we cannot recycle our way out of this mess you know when you go back 25 years ago my very first speech cleanup was around 1995 and we innocently brought down tons of trash bags and water bottles for our volunteers and disposable rubber gloves and we thought we were making a difference and at the end of the cleanup we had generated more trash than what was actually on the beach so we knew very quickly that we needed to shift our thinking and initially we thought these small actions at the local level were going to have this huge impact only realizing this plastic is still coming up every week more and more trash so we worked on local policies to ban one item and it still wasn't enough when we started realizing this is a crisis and over 20 years we've realized this is not just a local issue it is a global issue and the cost is too high for the marine environment the studies that oceana has done has shown the impact for marine mammals not only ingesting this plastic but also getting entangled in this plastic it's causing impacts to how they feed how they mate and ultimately leads to death and thousands of different species in the marine environment um and it's too high to our coastal economy is new englanders we love our seafood and we love going to the beach we wait all winter to get down to the coast and cape cod in the summertime and that impacts getting to the beach you know a lot of times people don't think about the impact also to our city's infrastructure you know when there's plastic waste in the communities it's getting into our rivers and waterways it causes flooding it impacts the trash trucks the bags get stuck in those trucks the taxpayers have to pay the money in dealing with this waste cleanup we really need to start shifting the responsibility back onto the plastic manufacturers and we have an opportunity to demand companies provide us with plastic free alternatives like we shouldn't be the ones stuck at the grocery store trying to make that choice these companies should be providing better choices for us as consumers so urging consumers to shift our purchasing power back to the companies and make them provide us with better choices you know when you're shopping online you don't have a choice you have to do the plastic peanuts or the plastic packaging we should demand choices when we have things shift to us and ultimately government too plays a huge role both at the local state and federal level so oceana works with local communities in massachusetts the the one that i that currently comes to mind is the town of attleboro i think has nine different items that they're trying to eliminate from their community it's very impressive so it's not just bags they're looking at straws expanded polystyrene foam takeout containers the intentional release of balloons and even the plastic alcohol knit bottles so they're looking to comprehensively reduce those items from their community and by that leadership that can influence the state which then influences these these comprehensive bills like the breakthrough from plastic pollution act so definitely urging people that are listening to understand even if you don't live on the coast this plastic pollution has a huge impact on you your health in your water quality your air quality and the marine environment and so doing your part to reduce your purchasing of these plastic items but then urging your city state and federal elected officials to pass these bills is going to make a huge difference and happy to answer any other questions you have it's just great to be here oh thank you so much nancy and thank you for really connecting how this all comes together wherever you live in the country this is an issue that impacts the quality of your health and life next i'd like to introduce dwayne tindall duane serves as the executive director of alternatives for community and environment a neighborhood-based environmental justice and transit-oriented development non-profit ace works to organize residents and work with community organizers locally statewide and nationally to build platforms and offer resources that address systemic injustice ace is the first environmental justice non-profit organization in massachusetts and has defended the rights of roxbury residents for over 25 years dwayne we are so happy and grateful that you joined us today we'd love to hear more about your work and why it is so important that we center environmental justice front-line communities in the fight against plastics pollution and climate change thank you dwayne first because environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mines we feel it first we feel it the hardest we feel it doing this pandemic the air quality that impacts um that caused asthma and then you related to cold bed and the the vast impact that they have on our communities um and then we realized that we only live on one planet one community and how we are so interrelated um the plastic pollution is not affecting our population equally poor working class black brown ethnic communities are carrying that weight the production of plastic booster air water and soil along every step of its production you know this and then again when it's discarded in landfills or burnt incinerators while we all suffer the impact to some extent it's poor communities as front line communities that really are seeing the greatest impacts as fossil fuel companies see the writing on the wall for the oil and gas they are looking to the growth in the plastic industry to keep their profits flowing all companies are very very intelligent and profit driven you cut one avenue off they create two additionals and that will mean more poisoning of the air water and lane of marginalized people in our country and around the world meaning the neighborhood near you your urban centers traditional red line communities on communities that have been historically discriminated against for soma plastic is constructing a new facility in louisiana since james parish where 87 of the residents of the fifth district are black the construction not only threatened the help of residents but it would also desecrate the burial site of enslaved african americans we stand in solidarity with with our people in james paris a 2016 study found compelling evidence that the houston area communities with high population color and high property levels face high risk from chemical accidents and everyday toxic exposure stand in solidarity with those communities and right here in massachusetts the real elevator incinerator saugus has taken other communities trash over 400 000 tons of trash burning it burying hundred thousand tons of ash in an unlined landfill thereby poisoning the water in the air of the ej communities of saugus riviera lynn chemicals and plastic corporations can only get away with selling their noxious product if they have low income and powerless people to build their plant or incinerators next to that's why when we take all our people we truly protect all our people without anyone to dump on you're better off and this is an opportunity to have a reset to have a real discussion how we protect all our communities this pandemic shows that our state lines our town lines our city lines are illusionary at best and now is the time that we can actually make a difference so thank you for hearing us out and thank you for having me here thank you so much dwayne and your canary in the coal mine line really resonates with me as we look at just the effects from this pandemic and how how similar um it is to environmental justice it has no respect for uh partisan lines or or town lines and municipality lines state lines and we are only as healthy as um our our most vulnerable communities so thank you for being with us and and for your work on this important component of environmental justice and last but certainly not least i'd like to introduce emily norton emily joined the charles river watershed association as executive director in august of 2018. she previously served as massachusetts chapter director for the sierra club where she advocated for stronger renewable energy policies at the state and local level and prior to that she spent 10 years as a research and communications consultant to groups such as the conservation law foundation northeast energy efficiency partnerships environmental defense fund and the u.s epa energy star program emily serves as an elected city councilor in her hometown of newton where she is a member of the finance committee in the public safety and transportation committee some of her local victories include a city-wide ban on plastic bags restriction on the use of polluting leaf blowers and changing the name of the outdated term alderman to city councilor in her city council role emily serves on the massachusetts municipal association environmental policy committee emily it's great to have you here and i am hoping that you be able to discuss what it's like to deal with this issue on a local level and we know you bring state expertise as well and why it's so important for our watersheds that we deal with it now thanks for joining us thank you so much representative clark for this important discussion and for your leadership with your legislation to take an ambitious approach to uh to dealing with this crisis and plastic pollution it is uh extremely tough to be the last speaker after all of these amazing individuals and leaders so i'll just be brief and piling on to the points uh that my fellow panelists have made at crwa we organize the biggest river cleanup in the country each year uh the earth day charles river cleanup in partnership with our partners at the esplanade association charles river conservancy the emerald necklace conservancy and others and in fact the major way that plastic pollution gets to the oceans is through rivers flowing through heavily populated areas and at our cleanup we have thousands literally thousands of volunteers not in a pandemic but before this and we will be doing it again um picking up over 40 tons of trash and that's great but what about the rest of the year and why should residents have to be doing that anyway it makes us wonder like why is our government not stepping up to prevent companies from making and discarding products that are killing us from as as kirsty laid out and as duane laid out from the petroleum that is a key ingredient to plastic to when it breaks down into micro plastics which ends up in our food chain and our placentas um we get cancer we get autoimmune diseases and more and then the air and water pollution at the end the end of the life cycle for plastic when it's landfilled or incinerated from soup to nuts basically to paraphrase bell biv devoe this stuff is poison in addition to my day job as you heard i also serve as a city councilor and there as i as um the representative mentioned i um let on the plastic bag ban also polystyrene band and i can tell you we see way fewer plastic bags now it is beautiful i just had a resident tell me the bullets pond association that was always yanking bags out of our local pond they don't have to do that anymore so it definitely works over a hundred communities in massachusetts have banned plastic bags dozens of ban polystyrene many have banned even straws plastic bottles attleboro has really gone above and beyond but it means there's different rules in different communities which is hard on our retailers confusing for our residents local communities can only do so much so in the words of benjamin franklin an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure we need our state government and our federal government to be a partner in protecting our residents protecting public health and eliminating products that are killing us it has been a long four years um but we are so happy to have a partner again in our federal government obviously you representative clark have always been our partner but now we are at least in a position to make real progress on this urgent issue so thank you oh well thank you emily and thank all of you uh we are so lucky to have each and every one of you helping us address this problem so let's start with where emily left off we have a new administration uh one that understands the complexity i think i just went off we can hear you still yeah i still see you okay all right great um uh the complexity of the situation in front of us and how what is the most urgent action we can take to reverse this damage i definitely think passing the break free from plastic pollution act would be a huge step in the right direction absolutely so each person individually speaking to their member of congress no matter where you are in the united states and urging your elected official to co-sponsor this piece of legislation would be amazing i think that's right and also helping to marshal the data in terms of the costs so there's the environmental discussion but i can tell you in newton we're paying almost as much now to get rid of recyclables as we are to get rid of trash we we have to pay to pick up you know our bottle bill is very limited um we need it's far beyond needing to be expanded and so we pay to pick up the trash in our parks and and roadways so that is a cost sort of an invisible cost that every taxpayer is paying so corporations are making the profits and joe q public is paying so i think that would help build support for that bill as well as long you know people really understood you're already paying for this this is not an extra cost i would totally agree with the break free from plastic pollution act call your federal legislators call your congress people right now also emily is 100 correct we've been doing a survey of municipalities across massachusetts cities and towns are paying sometimes 10 times as much for their recycling because the recycling system is not working you can't mix everything together and then expect you're going to be able to separate it out and have a marketable commodities that actually have value we need to keep things separate through a bottle bill through producer responsibility for packaging systems and move forward that way the other thing i would say is don't be um don't be fooled by false solutions building on what dwayne said earlier that wheelabrader sagas incinerator was pitched as in 1974 as new technology that was going to solve the trash problem and we're seeing gasification paralysis uh and other types of incineration other types of high heat tech to do this for sewage sludge and taunton to revamp the the wheel of greater saugus facility um these ex all high heat needs to go bill mckibben just wrote an article about that in the times recently if it's high heat it's bad for the climate it's expensive it doesn't create many jobs it destroys resources and it creates a lot of pollution period there is no high heat technology whether it's as i said gasification paralysis or chemical recycling that doesn't create a ton of pollution so and they and they end up in front line ej communities over and over again there is no away remember that and we have to deal with these materials up front and upstream not think that we're going to send them off to be burned or buried somewhere safely because that's a fallacy it's never going to happen yeah that is is such an incredible point that there really is no out of sight out of mind that this continues to exist and be a problem for all of us and uh dwayne that brings me to a question and specifically for you we see so much of this pollution um you know bad environmental effects in our most vulnerable communities and frequently communities of color how do we involve how do we engage with those communities how can we do a better job of finding those real solutions working with our frontline communities i think it's a combination of education outreach with enforcing regulations and laws i don't think i don't think um without like like harder and harder regulations and in a strong illegal framework will really push it anyway we know the legacy of poor air quality we call it asthma and all throughout the country and many of our communities we have very very high asthma rates so we know intimately the fight is on a policy and legislative level that can't be in the argument that regulations and enforcing laws that more than many times are on the books already to kind of really make it create a change but i think it's a combination of organizing education with the legal we see it as a civil right our environmental justice is racial justice that's right so like we have a long tradition of organizing and bringing in our legal legal and regulatory framework to create change it's not as hot but it works in in those two or two those two things of organizing in the legal framework help advance the agenda bits and pieces of the time so thank you that's great and we know that this transformation is going to take time and there are so many competing priorities but maria maybe you can start us off what would you like to see as a top priority in tackling this crisis sure i think for us starting with a plastic bag ban is so important because it impacts the rest of the entire process you can't have clean recycling when people are still putting plastic bags in with their recycling and it gums up the machines and it creates larger issues down the road and so that's that's something that feels very straightforward um and again i think it's at the same time i'm turning between that and really pushing on the extended producer responsibility because i think it's so important for us to hold those companies to account and at the same time thinking right now in a post-pandemic world that we want our small businesses to succeed and we we don't want to add any additional costs we recognize how hard it is living on the margins for a lot of our amazing restaurants who do use polystyrene because it is inexpensive how can we ensure that from a government perspective that we're um equalizing the table and ensuring that compostable and and reusable materials cost the same as polystyrene um and and so that's our responsibility to ensure that we're helping all along um the entire life cycle of these products gallon thank you kirsty what's some priorities you'd like to see well i think that we need to stop nibbling around the edges and go to the heart of the problem um as the representative just said producer responsibility that's making the the companies that are benefiting from this plastic crisis that's making them accountable that would the bill in massachusetts which we spent a lot of time on um would actually reimburse cities and towns for their recycling costs for packaging and paper so we're talking about probably 40 of the waste for that you know the recycling piece for that city and town would then be paid for and it would encourage those corporations to redesign that's the real key redesign their products so that they reduce and that they're more recyclable or reusable and that that's the crux of it right there making them um accountable the same with the bottle build though the producer responsibility for packaging piece which also exists in the break free from plastic act would be huge um and then again we need to take those big bites and be honest about what works and what doesn't plastic bags are not recyclable but no filmy plastic is recyclable meaning that there's no market for filmy plastic at all there's only a market for number one number two and sometimes number five plastics those containers so we really need to ban any of the plastics that there's not a market for and phase out single-use plastics as much as possible as soon as possible um so the break free from plastic pollution act would do a lot of that but also as we referenced before the um presidential plan would be really impactful because it would stop the investment in those uh in those false technologies those fault solutions like chemical recycling gasification process incineration and also stop subsidizing really stop subsidizing um oil and gas industry and that's really all that is really key so again as i think nancy said a couple times too call your legislator you know and remember that you want to go by the zero waste hierarchy reduce and recycle and compost but remember first reduce and reuse and no high heat and avoid plastic whenever you can that's plastics number the answer yeah emily what would you cite as a priority uh well as usual my fellow panelists have already you know already hit everything but absolutely the bags are so key because they're one of the easier things you can bring your own bag you can pay 10 cents in newton for a paper bag so you know let's let's hit the lowest hanging fruit first and a lot of people see the bags as trash they see them around um i honestly think a key reason that the bag ban passed in in boston was when at that time counselor ayanna pressley said this this is an incredibly important issue for communities of color and low income companies we don't like trash in our neighborhoods either so that seems like one that should be easier to tackle but absolutely getting the cost right we should not be subsidizing fossil fuels in any form for many reasons and we should not be subsidizing chemical factories we should not be subsidizing plastic in any way we should be incentivizing um the compostable the reusable because even if you're a consumer that wants to go into the store and avoid plastic it's virtually impossible like i literally buy shampoo and conditioner which obviously is looking great in a box and it's just like a bar of shampoo and conditioner like that's cool but i have to order it online like i can't even get in my local store so then like some amazon guy bring so it's just it's just all wrong so we need to make it easier for people by getting the cost right and this legislation and the the presidential approach um that you're proposing would help us get there yeah i i think that's absolutely right i've really been struck by all of your comments of let's let's flip this paradigm so it is not consumers going in trying to make do um but it is more corporations uh changing their business models to help us get there and can i pile on with one more thing there there's this argument sometimes among the environmental community on whether it's corporations have all the responsibility individuals have all their responsibility obviously corporations need to be doing much more but i do think uh individuals can do a lot when corporations see individuals taking steps to reduce plastic tweeting at them to reduce plastic when when people see us and we've seen this in in other arenas including um the racial justice conversations that we're having that corporations have been leading more than our president over the last four years so i do think i i don't want to leave individuals like up i just got to wait until the the politicians and the corporations do it all no we even as individuals do have a lot of power those local bans have made the statewide bans possible that's the there are a dozen communities that have banned plastic water bottles in massachusetts and now nestle is coming to the table on the bottle bill because they're afraid that their product is going to get banned across the board yeah what you do locally is fantastic don't stop just because we need a federal solution doesn't mean the local part isn't really crucial emily is 100 correct that's probably the nice thing okay i think that's right uh because my fellow panelists have done this federal government down you know this top down really we can't wait it's urgent and this bill should be passed but i'll flip that and you're right emily that the more we do this 139 towns in the state of massachusetts have already banned the plastic bag so we're already like leaning towards the you know you got to be kidding so many of us have already done it it makes it easier to convince the state to go ahead like so many have already taken that initiative and i'm agreeing with dwayne education education education um even in the town of attleboro there's excitement that one of the um companies are now producing uh like a bioplastic for the nip bottles and they think that's great isn't that great and the answer is no because those knit bottles that are bioplastic it requires industrial composting so if someone throws out a plastic nip bottle on the street or a bioplastic knit bottle on the street they're both going to sit there because that bioplastic bottle needs industrial composting so people don't realize the likelihood of that product actually getting to the industrial composting facility is not going to happen and even a bio bag if it ends up in the ocean it doesn't have the heat pressure and bacteria that would be needed for that bio bag to actually break down so it's about educating people that these transitioning from one single use disposable item to another disposable item is not the solution it's about not wasting our resources and reusing these these valuable resources that we have so education education and local level is is critical and that gives everyone who's on this call who's a constituent of representative clark something else to do because we know that calling your congresswoman might not uh change her mind because she's already there but you can reach out to your city councilor or town meeting member and your state representatives and state senators we certainly have lots of work to be done yeah exactly and uh um you know as i look at this and so much of it i hear so frequently from constituents but i recycle you know i'm doing my part and and we you know we encourage that we don't want to discourage that like you said these individual actions do matter but maybe um you can talk about sort of the state of recycling and and where we need to go i was pretty alarmed at the statistic about the very low percentage that of plastics we actually recycle and nancy you hit on some of the problem is it takes an industrial um recycling uh to get us there so how do we begin to to look at that so i see you're okay no go ahead emily yeah i started my career in burlington vermont as the recycling coordinator when recycling became mandatory and it was i think exciting for people to have something that they could do it was sort of like whoa wait a minute what you want me to go through my trash like it was a big behavior change and now as you said everyone's like oh but i recycle i recycle unfortunately it turned out to be not all that and now um now we need to get beyond that because recycle means so many of these are not even recyclable they're certainly not recyclable the way glass is over and over or paper so and i know kirsten and nancy and the others can speak in more detail about the state of the industry but i did want to since we have this opportunity some folks may have seen the boston globe article about jack coughlin from agawam who is a local hero who would just walk the streets picking up knit bottles and he was hit by a car he's in his 70s he was hit by a car and he's now been paralyzed and you know is this the fault of the nip bottle industry maybe not you know he he he was hit by a car it was it was nighttime but if he didn't if we didn't have these nip bottles out there in the street people like him wouldn't have to be a lot walking along the streets picking them up so i just didn't want to give him a shout out because it's just such a horrible thing that happened to him and here it is he's a he's a community hero in agawam and um and i i would hope that our state legislature and the federal government would take action on this issue if even out of to to honor to honor his work yeah i was at the hearing where mr coughlin testified in massachusetts and you know we did not manage to ban nips or add them to the bottle bill or expand the bottle bill um we know how to solve this problem we literally do and the way to solve this problem is to kind of set up a system of collection like we have for the bottle bill right now but include all beverage containers and to set up systems like producer responsibility for packaging where the city governments are paid for the work they do so we have enough staff that's another ej part of this but you know communities like newton have wonderful staff for recycling not as many as they probably need but they have great you know great staff communities like lowell and lawrence are always struggling to even have the money to pay the staff and to have the staff so they're working their tails off and they can't create the systems we need so producers need to pay for that we need to expect them to pay for that and we have to be realistic as nancy was saying about these false solutions plastic is not going to be recycled well efficiently or cleanly ever we need to move towards reusables refillables like we had when we were kids in the 70s all the coke and pepsi bottles were refilled that has much less of a climate impact much much less of a climate impact reusing a bottle 50 times you just have to wash it and move it around that's it making a new bottle whether it's a plastic or glass takes a tremendous much much much more energy many many many more resources and we have to be honest about what works and what doesn't and not buy into the corporation saying that they're going to solve this problem for us coke and pepsi and american beverage association been saying they're going to solve this problem for 30 years they're going to use recycled plastic they're going to they've never done any of it and even the proposals they're making now would only take care of one percent of the problem so we need to take the solutions we know work and put them in place um and again we've got great bills coming up through the zero waste caucus as the representative said earlier that rep day and repsicola and senator lewis are proposing for producer responsibility for packaging for a single use omnibus bill and for an expanded bottle bill we can do all those things in massachusetts you certainly we certainly can do this in the federal government too through the existing bills that you're proposing so we can make this happen we just need to do it honestly yeah nancy actually real quick um you may be able to answer my question this but i know that over the years we sent all of our waste away right it went to other countries and those countries have now um realized the impact to their own communities to their own health and just they have reached capacity and said no thank you and have started shipping our waste back so again to the taxpayers this realization that we are now going to be faced with that bill of dealing which it's actually funny the irony we now have to deal with our own trash so that's a good thing because now we can be realistic about how much we're actually generating and how much it costs but i think a lot of people locally may not realize that once was an away thing and now it is something that we have to deal with head on here in the state of massachusetts in the united states yeah that's that's correct what what happened is that the waste industry bought the recycling companies they verbally vertically integrated and so then they said we're going to go to single strain no sore recycling and about 10 years ago waste management casella wheelabrade or cavanta all did that and what they told communities and their articles all over places put whatever you want in that recycling put a laundry basket in there put some christmas tree lights and we're gonna recycle all of it and it as nancy said it got shipped to china where china was building their recycling markets and their recycling infrastructure and now that china has done that they don't need our badly sorted plastics and paper so they have will not take our mixed paper and plastic because they have little to no value um and then the waste companies instead of saying oh this no sort thing was a bad idea we're going to start deep sorting or we're going to support a bottle bill or we're going to go back to dual stream or any of the things that do work they said oh we're going to charge all the cities and towns because you're doing a terrible job with your sorting so that's why newton's getting this bill that's why all the western mass communities are getting these bills we're seeing this across the country um as nancy said the taxpayers the consumers are being left holding the bill on this and it's really not fair um and it just underscores that there was never in a way i don't think a lot of stuff was getting recycled in china either but we didn't have to deal with it right up front and now we do so this is the time to pass state and federal legislation that will change this whole this whole system and it again without the local folks pushing for it it's not going to happen so thank gosh we have you know all these people who are stepping up on this and paying close attention well that's it is both harrowing and inspiring so how do you think as a you know federal representative with these solutions that are coming out of our local communities um how do you think we can be better responsive i mean we've talked about education but how can we better connect with these locally based solutions that are arising and dwayne i'll i'll start with you for your thoughts i think we need to need it connected to on public health outcomes yeah we got to make it we got to put it on the front door of everyone it's not a particular community even though particular communities may be impacted more it's something we all in the same boat whether you drill a hole at one end or the other end um if you're not careful we'll all be impacted so public health is something that kind of only get noticed during like times like this so i think would be good if you take advantage of these times and connect air quality in public health and plastics and and and basically create that alchemy and say this is what we need to do we need to improve our air quality to improve our public health and i think that may be one of the ways that we can start moving forward thank you yeah it seems like public health prevention are always things that are first to cut last to be restored and maybe the the lasting lesson of this pandemic is going to be reversing that order anyone else want to address that maria emily sure so i would love to see our burgeoning climate change movement especially the youth climate change movement really tie plastics and zero waste into what they're looking at i view plastics as this really intersectional issue where it ties in municipal federal state government it ties in climate change it ties in environmental justice it it has elements associated with all that but not all of those individual pieces necessarily see themselves as part of the zero waste and ending the single-use plastic movement um and and helping to join those communities is something that i'm pretty passionate about to make sure that people unders better understand that all of these individual decisions will impact this larger goal that they have of stopping climate change yeah yeah i um i was going to say that in newton we do have some people who are conservative politically conservative and it's been sort of surprising to me i've taken some steps that they haven't really liked because i'm pretty lefty but there is a relatively um less consternation on when i when i tackle plastics i don't know what it is i don't know if it's just a newton republican thing but i do it does give me some hope that this is an issue that protecting our environment um saving money um not having corporate giveaways that that is something that could get support across the political aisle i know that that is something that you obviously have to deal with in congress as officials do at every level is is working um with their compatriots in um in the other party and so that is something that um that does sort of give me hope for this issue is if we are brave enough and that's what's been frustrating at the state level as kirsty knows we've been battling to try to get this plastic bag ban done statewide and it's like all right then we'll just do 10 more local bands and 10 more local bands like legislature are you going to ban this once we have i don't know all 351 cities and towns have done it on their own um especially when you have the shoesberry and the more the more conservative towns doing it um so that's that's something that does give me hope for this issue that you know no one likes to see plastic trash and you know if the case is made um if people did have a better understanding of it's not just you know what you see in the trash it's not just the pla microplastics that we are ingesting it's how this stuff is produced and and who ends up across the world as dwayne said um suffering the most from this when we're protecting when it can't be dumped anywhere where then we got to come up with a new solution right so that's that does give me a bit of hope i think this can be a bipartisan issue and maybe that's me being naive and only being at the local and state level not at the federal level but um you know hope springs eternal there well you anticipated my uh final question um which is with so much a challenge to our public health uh sort of it can be overwhelming you think you've been doing the right things sorting things in your blue boxes and you find out that that really isn't being recycled and in fact that local municipalities are being charged back for a lack of recycling so we have a new administration that's focused on climate change focused on this issue of plastics what gives you hope and how can we continue to have people focus on this and working towards it uh without getting sort of overwhelmed with everything else going on in this pandemic and we'll start with nancy how do you how do you find inspiration i am eager to answer this because entire countries have banned these single-use items states have banned these single-use items our local communities have banned these single-use items there are restaurants throughout massachusetts that have leadership i'm thinking about a place in harwich that i love to go to that has smoothie bowls they've switched completely of no plastic whatsoever so it it can be done it is being done and there's enough businesses states and governments around the country and the globe that have already successfully done this that we need to just highlight the success and show that it the cost is more expensive to not do it and that it can already be done so that gives me hope that's great kirsty two things give me hope actually and i am a very hopeful person or i couldn't do this work sure uh two things give me hope one is the point that emily made because the communities that have banned plastic water bottles are on the cape and the cape is not a lefty uh bastion you know cape is a relatively conservative place but they care about the ocean and they care about their homes and that's something we all have in common so i agree with emily that this is not a left or a right issue this is something that if you want to live in a clean community you you want to ban these unrecyclable single-use plastics and single-use goods in general the other part that gives me a tremendous amount of hope is not only seeing all the examples that nancy is referring to and i would i would point you all to zero waste europe for all kinds of case studies for places that this has worked in the philippines too they've done some fantastic work um not only do we have these good examples but also uh as a report just came out from gaia the global anti-incineration association gaia found that these solutions zero waste solutions create jobs if we are refilling and reusing our containers if we are composting cleanly and putting the soil back onto the earth if we are reducing and reusing and then recycling and composting as much as we can and redesign to make it all better there are many many more jobs green jobs clean safe jobs in that then there are in back up a truck and dump it and burn it or bury it so we really the only the only uh folks who stand to lose money are the big plastic companies in the big oil and gas companies cities and towns will save money there'll be more local businesses and there'll be more green jobs so if we're all going to save money if we're you know consumers and cities and towns are going to save money and the governments are going to save money it's just on oil and gas and and uh the chemical and plastic industry it's gonna lose money i'm fine with that i think that sounds fantastic so this is a great idea for all of us we'll all come out ahead if we implement those zero-waste solutions that the representative was talking about so that gives me great hope i love being right and being the fiscally responsible choice it's a fantastic place to be that's a good spot to land in dwayne where where are you pulling optimism from frontline communities that have been so disproportionately hit by this pandemic and just have a history of environmental injustice where do you see those glimmers of hope i'm seeing it on the municipal level um i'm a town meeting member in the town of brookline and i remember when we banned plastic bags a few years ago two nights of debate but we banned the more people know the more people are beginning to shift and i really believe that the blue the blue um you know the recycling cult that we had basically removed it from my conscious mind and as we put it more into our conscious mind into public discourse we will make a logical self-interest decision to move away from these products but this is just a process of bringing it back into public discourse on a policy level on the neighborhood level to have a different type of conversation and try to avoid the false solutions that have been propagated by multiple different entities so it's it's small steps but we are moving in the right direction thank you great thank you and maria will will end with you sure uh on a note of optimism i'd say you know the united states has done this we were the first country to ban plastic microbeads um and i think when we're still one of less than a dozen countries that it has done that we're capable of doing this kind of work and i'm so excited to see the kind of effort that's happening at all of these different levels of government and bringing together these unusual bedfellows to have this conversation about our future public health i think it's incredibly heartening and i'm so thrilled that you brought this group together today to have this conversation and i hope it kicks off a larger effort where we're all making the same push at the state local and uh federal level so thank you so much well thank all of you and emily did you want to add something no i was just gonna unmute to say thank you before we close out well i just want to thank all of you not only for joining us here but giving all of us optimism and hope through your work and your concentration on this and helping us really see how interconnected we are and that we also have the tools to change and uh to address plastics pollution environmental justice um these issues that can seem like they are just beyond our grasp but they really aren't and uh we're so grateful and i am inspired by the work that all of you do and hope that this pandemic for all the suffering and loss that it has caused will underline how interconnected and interdependent we all are and the key priority that funding public health and addressing these issues should play in our policy and in our lives so thank you all for joining us thank you for your work and we look forward to working together uh to make our planet uh more just and healthier and cleaner

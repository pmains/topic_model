thanks so much and I thank you mr. chairman so miserable and I so do you have meetings with mr. Schulman and his then Deputy Commissioner Miller did you do that on a fairly regular basis I had congressman quarterly management review meetings where we looked at broad issues with respect to the budget and to how their IT refresh was going and so forth again taking full cottage cognizance of this relationship with the IRS where we didn't engage in discussions didn't work in the details of tax administration or tax enforcement right right but but so so okay roughly four times a year you sit down go over the budget talk things through that's good they were you know in terms of reports stream you're the appropriate person for that to happen it in Treasury understand so you regularly have this meeting and you discuss budget issues but this issue about IRS employees targeting conservative groups did that ever come up in E these meetings it did not I have no recollection that at all okay so knowing what you now know do you think there might have been a concerted effort to kind of prevent the report stream I mean prevent this from coming to you I don't know congressman exactly what was going on within the IRS on this what I know is that in general and this is Treasury IRS relationships for many administration's now of both political partner I understand we're not saying the IRS is a venerable organization but certainly not as bad as what we've come to find out in this in this problem so in May of 2012 the IRS had completed an internal review and investigation were you informed of that internal review and investigation no congressman's I testified earlier this morning I learned it that just in the last few days okay so no all right but were you informed the you were informed in June 2012 that the IG was undertaking their audit or review right sure precisely congressman when it was but at some point mr. George came to me and said that he was undertaking an odd hey June July summer 2012 some point in 2012 some point in 2012 I was it perhaps before the first tuesday after the first monday in november just established as a fact here it may have been Cano cries again I don't precisely recall when it was mr. George you have some further vague recollection was it perhaps hot outside or were you wearing a jacket on over coach I mean some time some time frame for me not to be glib about it but you know no sir you know it was in the summer of okay thank you so in the summer 2012 your inform the IG is undertaking this review does this raise any sort of concern with you well what it raised for me is the is what i said earlier which is once the IG is looking at an issue we asked we mended I understand I understand I'm separate from that I'm not saying you go to mr. George and try to manhandle them and say don't do this I'm not making that accusation okay just to be clear what I'm saying is he brings us very serious matter to you you've received letters from the left and the right in Congress to the Department of Treasury among various other administration officials right they send letters to the Treasury and to the IG it's their press reports in the spring of that year there's some concern your IG comes forward and says look we're going to take this review don't you go this is kind of you know a good thing bad thing come on give me some sort of science of your emotions you're a human person to congressman I i did not have awareness of this issue before I don't believe no no I'm not talking about your learning I'm talking about your feelings let's talk about your feelings then and when you heard the aiji's going to do this you're serving a president you're the President appointed you your Senate confirmed a very important position you're there from the beginning of administration the IG comes to you and says we're looking into this very damning thing it's a presidential election year you don't say for a minute this is kind of frightening he didn't come to me with conclusions Congress when he came to it back to the so I said to him well that's very important and you should follow the facts with ok so then take me from there do you tell anybody no I I not so much much later when like when I know I can't remember at some point later I I came to learn that the IG had also told the fact of his audit to some other folks no no no so we're talking about summer of 2012 the election is coming up it's unclear who's going to win your guy that nominated you I assume you still support but in 2012 you're looking at this election year and you don't pick up the phone and say to that your contacts to the White House which you know and say just as a heads up this could actually hit the fan in a presidential year I did not congressman ok and you don't tell anybody in the office of counsel at the White House I did not ok so the first time you'd learn about conservative groups being tarded by the IRS was when this report came out the first time I learned that there were was before the report came out a draft of the report was shared with IRS and IRS staff as we as i think is not public had conversations with some people at the Treasury Department I didn't have any understanding of the details but I understood from mr. George I think at some point in the last set of weeks that this was going to be a report that was going to reach a very damning conclusion but I don't have any understand the heads up to the White House chief of staff I did not okay thank you mr. nice for your indulgence that the absurdity of this is that when it when a huge accusations being undertaken by inspector general in a presidential year I I just it it is beyond me to think that an administration official wouldn't of maybe let me ask another question you contact the donut time is expired make it very quick did you contact the campaign about I never had any okay thank you make sure Thank You mr. George

Thank You mr. chairman for bringing these two bills before us today for the comments and tomorrow's votes last year our office hosted a roundtable discussion on climate change in the district we had climate scientists economists and academic issue from all sides of the issue but we may have differed our pinions on what Congress should do the one thing that stood out that we had common ground on that was on energy efficiency finding ways to use energy more efficiently efficiently is common sense we ought to be promoting efficiency as a way to save energy money and create jobs HR 21-26 will provide this country with a market-driven voluntary best practice approach to align business owners and their enter tenants to reduce their demands on the energy grid Peter Welch has been an excellent co-sponsor with us with me I've enjoyed very much working with Peter we've had a great relationship on dealing with this and other matters on energy efficiency this is where it demonstrates where Republicans and Democrats can work together it's just one of two license engineers in Congress with over 50 years in a construction experience I understand just what it takes to make our buildings more energy-efficient this legislation is supported by everyone from manufacturers restaurateurs the gaming industry contractors labor and environmental advocates it's estimated to lower the energy costs to consumers and businesses by two billion dollars two billion dollars and resulting in reduced carbon emissions by nearly 12 million tons this moves our country also towards energy independence our priority in Congress should be to create an environment where business wants to create jobs and pass you to this bill ensures that we truly are working towards that goal like to thank again chairman Upton and ranking member Waxman for allowing this bipartisan bill to straight to Marco thank you and I yield back my time German yields back chair would recognize gentleman from Florida mr. bill

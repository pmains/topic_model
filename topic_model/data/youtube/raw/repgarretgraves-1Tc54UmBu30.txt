hey it's Congressman Garrett Graves I got an important update for those of you that have been following the windfall elimination government pension offset issue that has been adversely affecting many of our public employees across Louisiana and really across the country especially having an impact on police officers teachers firefighters powers and state employees and others just late last week the house Ways and Means Committee announced that they're going to have a markup session which is a voting session where they can amend pass or reject the windfall elimination bill that's our bill H.R 82 that addresses this issue that fixes it once and for all it was a surprise announcement in that right now we're on track to have this bill before the entire house for a vote and then send it over to the Senate so if you look at this two different ways on the one hand is this good news because they're going to move the bill forward and through the committee process and then we go through the floor where I'm more inclined to believe is that this is actually going to be a sandbagging or stall tactic and that under the rules of the house if they have this markup session it potentially alleviates relieves or maybe even prevents this bill from being forced before the full house for a vote so we are reaching out to speaker Pelosi and saying look no matter what happens with this bill before the Ways and Means Committee this surprise markup that they've announced you need to schedule this bill for a vote before the full house as soon as possible this week we are at the 25 days as of now go ahead and schedule this bill stop these delays that have been going on now for four decades and let people have access to the dollars that they paid in to the Social Security trust fund so they or their spouses can have a safe and secure retirement it's their money it's been stolen from them and it's just wrong so we're pushing speaker Pelosi to do the right thing we'll keep you posted as this evolves thanks

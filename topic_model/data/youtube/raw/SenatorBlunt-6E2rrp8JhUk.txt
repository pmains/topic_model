but the last year the question I've been asked the most in Missouri is when will Congress vote on the US Mexico and Canada trade agreement well I'm very glad to tell you I just voted to pass us MCA and to send it to the President's desk this is a big win for farmers and ranchers and workers across our state right now our economy is stronger than it's been in 50 years thanks in large part to having the right tax policy and the right regulatory policies in place with today's vote and other trade agreements the president secured we've also got better trade policy u.s. MCA will keep the momentum going to support new jobs to expand markets and to boost economic growth as a global AG leader were one of the states that stands to gain the most by this new agreement with our two largest trading partners it's a great day for Missouri farm families and I'll continue working with the president to make sure we're positioned to take advantage of all the opportunities ahead of us in the new AG world

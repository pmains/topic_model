my first question for mr mr bonnie the commodity credit corporation is certainly a very important entity to my folks back home how would you describe its primary mission its primary purpose in your in your views to support uh support commodity production and agriculture and to help uh stabilize agriculture in the in the wake of uh uh you know extreme weather all that type of stuff and you know speaking of commodities i'm going to read this definition a commodity is a raw material or primary agriculture product that can be bought and sold such as copper or coffee or wheat or milo do you feel that carbon is a commodity carbon certainly has value and we see that in things like the growing climate solution act and other pieces of legislation but i think your question is about is it a commodity in the context of the commodity credit corporation and i don't think it is i don't think it needs to be if you want to think about how you use the ccc to advance climate smart agriculture and forestry whatever you do in the ccc has to be about commodity production agricultural commodities and thinking about how you take advantage of that and create opportunities for producers that may grow those commodities using climate smart agriculture and forestry is the potential link with the ccc and it's those opportunities and new markets that i think are consistent with the ccc so do you envision in any way based upon that answer using the ccc funds to create a carbon bank then i think we would look at the ccc as a potential way to to create partnerships with agriculture to look at ways that we can advance climate smart agriculture in ways that will will increase and improve commodity production and will create more value for for agriculture on working lands you know those answers sound a little bit uh contrary in the core to me that in the sense that you're describing paying for a carbon service really this the service of storing carbon so i just don't see how you could in any way equate the two by using monies from the ccc and i just want to make sure that we're on the same page here that you agree the purpose of the ccc the priorities should be the arc programs the plcs and and just really concerned about running that bank dry of course and i would just say this is true across all climate policy if we create challenges for agriculture where things don't work for agriculture that's not just a problem for farmers it's a problem for the climate as well we have to do things that are going to have agriculture support anything we would do with the ccc we would put in front of people let them look at it and make sure that what we do is consistent with with with agriculture and agriculture's needs that's going to be true of everything we do on climate as i said before if it doesn't work for producers it's not going to work for the climate you know i i've always said that you're saying that farmers and ranchers were the greatest are the greatest conservationists in the world i remember my grandfathers building terraces for soil conservation would you agree in general that farmers and ranchers are just incredible conservationists yes we have an enormous stewardship ethic in this country and that the test for us on whether it's thinking about wildlife conservation or climate how do we take advantage of that how do we create incentives for producers to be able to voluntarily participate that's true of everything we do thank you last

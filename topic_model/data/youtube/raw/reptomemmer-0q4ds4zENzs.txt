let's bring in Minnesota Republican congressman and brand new house majority whip Tom emmer uh congratulations you finally you guys finally got it done after what how many days and how many hours 15 rounds so now today's the hard part correct you got to vote on the rules that you agreed to yeah I don't I don't think so good morning Brian and thank you for that uh last week was uh quite an experience today really is uh to me it's not a big deal the rules uh which has not been widely reported literally are the rules that our conference voted on after the election with one exception and that is the motion to vacate is being restored to where it was for a hundred years before Nancy Pelosi changed it that literally is the only change in the rules that our members will vote on tonight okay uh so Mr whip is Mr whip the correct title we should use with you Congressman web just getting used to it okay so is that the right term I I think so I like Tom but uh I like Mr whip uh so Mr whip we understand that at least two congressmen on the Republican side um you've got uh Tony Gonzalez and Nancy mace have both said publicly they will not vote for the rules package the rules package is a 55-page document and according to punch bowl there is also a secret three-page addendum that Mr McCarthy and his allies hashed out during several days of the negotiations is that true are there three pages of stuff we'll not know about and if so generally you won't tell us what's in it but generally what's it about yeah no the first off the rules for Tony and uh Nancy uh Tony has said he's not uh willing to vote for them yet uh Nancy on the other hand has said she's on the fence part of the thing that needs to be understood is these separate items that you're talking about which I would argue has been mischaracterized not unusual for a local media Outlet here on the hill the rules themselves I I do believe both Tony and Nancy will uh come around tonight when they realize the things that they want to talk about are in this uh separate agreement and specifically my understanding is Tony wants to talk about a provision that says we're going to start with the FY 22 budget as the Baseline I and this is a concern because you got uh in the uh in the spending approach you've got the discretionary spending that involves both this out of control domestic spending since before the pandemic under Nancy Pelosi and you've got defense spending and the argument is this would affect defense spending which I'm here to tell you guys Republicans will not impact defense spending aside from efficiencies and waste it's the domestic spending that we're going to go after yeah some of the moderates I know Republicans are worried about how some of the moderates are going to vote for some of these rules I know members would get 72 hours to read the bills before they vote you talked about the the term well you talked about only takes one person to vote the speaker out or to start that vote at least and then the term limits Nancy mace was on one of the Sunday shows and she said she's worried about these back room deals she's not sure what kind of deals were made in exchange for a vote for McCarthy Byron Donalds was was on television and he revealed it sounds like he's revealing that he got the house steering committee in exchange for his vote for McCarthy listen to this so you're going to be a part of the Republican steering committee as Kevin McCarthy's designates and part of that is going to be to make sure that the entire conference you know the the ideological Spectrum if you will is represented through all committees and I think this is important because what I've seen in my first two years in Washington is and this is actually not Kevin's fault this is the the nature and the the culture of Washington D.C is that the members are actually really uh uh uh separated from each other they don't really get a chance to talk a lot and engage a lot unless they take specific interest to do I think having more voices on more committees is actually going to help the Republican conference and Congress overall so we can clear up a lot of the misconceptions about policy ideas and and political points so we could actually do the right thing by the American people through a truly deliberative process that is open and there's a lot of conversations going on I think it's a great thing Congressman your reaction well first off we've got to be careful not to conflate the rules and this discussion that took place with these points that I'm going to argue to you Ainsley all of our members are going to support there's no backroom deals first on the rules you're opening up the capital for the first time since the pandemic to the public you're eliminating proxy voting and making people come to work they haven't been doing it for years uh you're reinstating the Holmen rule which is going to allow members to literally do targeted spending cuts Within These huge bills and you're eliminating the opportunity for these 1.7 trillion dollar Christmas tree Laden ornament uh bills on the other side your the agreement that you will know more about our members have been learning about it real time as we go through not all of them chose to be part of this but they will now you're going to have single subject matter you're going to have germanus what does that mean Ainsley well in the past the house might pass to ceremonial coin bill for a famous American who did something important sent it over to the Senate it sits there without action and then guess what they strip out that language they put in a 1.7 trillion dollar spending Bill and they send it back as the coin bill that will not happen anymore we're going to hold the Senate accountable we're going to hold the house accountable we're going to do what the American people expect let's see if you guys do get along because yesterday Nancy mace called Matt Gates a fraud every time he voted against Ken McCarthy sent out a fundraising letter you guys got some open wounds that need some Bactine it's all good Brian human beings gotta learn to get along together they do and just don't grab them by the neck before you go Mr will uh what do you have any idea what Kevin McCarthy said to Matt gates in that very seemingly tense moment that got Matt gates to vote for this I do president what did he say what did he say he and he and uh Matt were having a discussion that I'm going to leave between them if they want to disclose those uh what they talked about I'll let them do that all right but he only voted present right yeah he never voted for him right he said we had a deal we made a deal give us a hint just give us a little they're learning how to get along okay good enough what was the reason he didn't vote for him because he said on Sean Hannity show the night before he kind of implied that he's got a vote for him that night yeah and then he also said what more what was the phrase he said what more can I ask for you guys everything yeah he goes I'm out of things to ask for look guys like every member of the Republican conference the 222 everybody wants to have their voice heard and Kevin McCarthy's job that the leadership's job is to make sure that that happens and that's what that was about we heard a lot of voices for 15 rounds all right fantastic Tom thank you Mr whip I'll call you Tom good luck good take care guys

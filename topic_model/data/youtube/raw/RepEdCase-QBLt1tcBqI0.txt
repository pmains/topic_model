good evening and aloha i'm u.s congressman ed case i'm coming to you live from my district office in downtown honolulu and i'm really honored and happy to be joined tonight by my colleague and full partner in the u.s house uh representing uh all of our hawaii congressman kaialii kaheli who is coming to you live from his district office uh in hilo so from one end of the state to almost the other uh here we are both of your u.s congressmen in a joint uh talk story and that's what we're trying to do tonight uh we're trying to run a joint uh uh community meeting with you uh to number one update you on on our work on behalf of hawaii in our country in congress uh number two to listen to your thoughts and then number three to answer your questions and i'm going to turn this over to congressman kylie who has only been in office for um seven plus months but already has made such a huge uh a huge contribution to hawaii uh he he came in just uh just prepped from the get-go he was he was like i said earlier my full partner from the get-go uh he got two great committees in the u.s house which he'll talk to you about the committee on armed services and the committee on transportation and infrastructure and has developed really really positive relationships across all of the house so so it's a really uh really a pleasure for me to to have him with me in the house and with that uh congressman kelly i turn it over to you mahalo nui law congressman case for that warm introduction and uh it's been a honor of mine to work with you uh now for the past 212 days in congress i took office on january 3rd 2021 and it's uh been not nothing like i would have ever imagined but um you know the opportunity to prepare for the 117 congress uh with your early guidance uh has really really helped and it's been my honor to work with you you know we worked on many issues together concerning our constituents the people of hawaii and our families we're going to talk about those tonight uh right now this is august and the congressional calendar historically this is the august recess it's a time when we go back to our districts we go back to our communities and we uh get an opportunity to hear from the people that we have the privilege to serve before we go back to washington dc after labor day to continue the work of the congress before the holidays just like you had mentioned earlier i represent the second congressional district that includes the rural part of the island of oahu and the rest of the state of hawaii as you know since i assumed office uh congress uh mencase and i have met every week and i think that's really important for our constituents and the people of hawaii to know that we have a very good solid close working relationship not only at the member level but also at the staff level both of our dc and hawaii offices meet often congressman case and i meet weekly and we try and stick to that it's easy to move schedules around and uh and cancel that but we really make a commitment to meet weekly wherever we are to keep each other informed to hold each other accountable and to have that shared commitment to the people of hawaii that wealth of knowledge uh the patience and the experience that we have been able to receive from congressman case's office has allowed my staff to grow and it's uh greatly it um with that being said i'm looking forward to jumping into this uh virtual town hall tonight and i really want to mahalo uh everyone here who have joined us online this evening look forward to your questions uh and mahalo nui law for taking the time out of your busy evening i know this is a thursday evening uh it's dinner time you know everyone's home with their families but we really appreciate the opportunity to spend a little bit of time with you this evening to share with you you know what we've done for the people of hawaii over the last seven months and how we can continue to make your lives better um in the uh the united states congress uh for the remainder of the 117th congress so that being said i'm going to turn it back and yield back to uh congressman case who will transition into general thoughts on the 117 congress mahalo thank you so much thank you so much congressman um and um i really appreciate your comments about uh teamwork that's what it takes um you know we only have four members of the uh of uh congress two senators two representatives uh and if those four members aren't uh connected um trying to accomplish things together it can get bad pretty fast but that hasn't happened at all congressional delegation has always realized that they needed to work together um and um this particular delegation not only do congressman kahelia and i meet weekly but uh the entire delegation meets on a regular basis as well and we all uh try to keep in touch with each other across the house and the senate so uh to senators shots in hirono this is certainly uh part of your talk story as well although you're back in the senate right now working let me talk about the 117th congress to date and again just to kind of get everybody on the same page um our country uh operates in two-year congresses we've been doing that ever since um our first congress uh way back in the 1700s and this is the 117th time that congress has come together for a two-year congress we have the first session which is the first year the second session which is the second year um every congress uh um you have to kind of start anew with your legislation uh but obviously on the things that you're focused on uh can continue from congress to congress and of course stuff like covet 19 that doesn't care what congress you're in and so the challenges are always there uh members uh come in a new congress brings new members uh some people leave some people come in so you you need to to help develop the the new relationships all all over again and that's uh that's really critical in the first six months of a congress and congressman kahella has certainly been doing that with many many people throughout congress but even me who who know a lot of members of congress already who who knew them from my prior service 03 to 07 many of whom are now leaders in congress so that that's been a good connection to have but also just members that i came in with the second time i still have to get to know a brand new class of members of congress uh and so certainly that's been part of the first uh the first of a few months of this 117th congress but to the huge issue that we all face covid19 is uh and will remain our number one uh challenge uh in the 117th congress uh covent 19 started in the last congress we're into the 18th month of a pandemic we're into the 18th month of incredible uh tragedy we have had um somewhere around 36 million cases of covet uh 19 throughout our country and we're not even talking about the world we have now seen 615 000 of our fellow citizens die of covid19 we are into the third wave of this pandemic the first wave of course in the first months of 2020 the second wave in the summer of 2020 and as we worked out of that during the rest of 2020 we thought things were getting good getting stabilized and then two things happened the first thing that happened was that we had the delta variant far more contagious far more dangerous than the than the um the initial covet uh strain that that hit that hit us so hard last year and second we let our guard down uh we didn't take the public health advice uh we we felt like we could somehow kind of skate through this without um you know everybody uh trying to get vaccinated and and protecting each other uh certainly um i think that we let the guard down in much of the country in terms of of the conditions that we had put in place um and we are getting hit of course we all know very hard today uh in our own hawaii over 600 cases the largest single day uh since coved started and by the way let's just be really clear from the get-go here uh that is us the residents of hawaii mostly uh getting infected so it is not um you know uh it is not the tourists that are that are that are that are coming in infected and giving it to everybody else it is it is it is something that is circulating uh relatively internally here in hawaii which is of great concern and so although we have one of the highest levels of vaccinations in in the entire country uh still we're not immune from this and and we are seeing that we have dealt with covert 19 at the federal level throughout the last 116th congress and continuing into the current 117th congress we have passed uh three major uh measures of emergency assistance uh totaling some five plus five plus trillion dollars of federal assistance i think everybody's familiar the business assistance through the paycheck protection program and other small business oriented assistance the direct economic impact payments uh to to many citizens a number of times unemployment insurance supplementation and then finally aid to our state and local governments to help out uh which they are still in the process of distributing in in one way shape or form and this 5 trillion has been aimed both at the public health side of covet 19 as well as the economic dislocation side of kova 19 where of course we've been hit so hard right here in hawaii because of because of its impact on travel and tourism in particular but also the community and social side of covet 19 the the uh eviction moratoriums that we had in place and and will now continue um under the uh centers for disease prevention and control's most uh most recent extension um and so um certainly this is uh the number one area that we all have to continue to focus on is covet 19 the public health side the economic side the social disruption side that's predominant and will remain that way in 117th congress aside from covid19 for myself one of my principal activities is my appropriations committee the appropriations committee is the oldest committee in the u.s house and it's the committee that is responsible for all federal funding some 1.5 trillion dollars per year every year before the start of the next uh fiscal year for for for our federal government which starts on october 1st we come together for a number of months in the appropriations committee and essentially uh consider all of the requests for funding for that year from the president in the president's budget from our own colleagues and the needs of the country and we come up with 12 separate measures for all of the federal government ranging from you know education to labor to social services to foreign affairs transportation to anything else the federal government does this has occupied a great deal of my time in the first months of this 117th congress because that's really when the appropriations committee does our work we reported all 12 bills after a number of weeks of just day to night meetings uh during a prior district work period when other people were back in the district we were back in washington getting those bills done we have just completed all of those bills and have passed um uh most of them out of the united states house uh they are now in the u.s senate um these are major bills for hawaii in particular um anything that in in what the federal government touches um is impacted by appropriations uh to include not only assistance to travel and tourism but uh to enough to our number two economic uh uh generator uh the national defense effort in hawaii which um had we not had that as well uh during the uh the the very difficult time of of covet 19 we would have been in even deeper kimchi as we saw travel and tourism go down so our defense effort here really pulled us through in many ways i spend a lot of time on that to try to make sure that that defense is adequately funded here but a number of other areas that perhaps i'll get into a little bit later on two more things and i'm going to turn it back to congressman elliott to note number one of course uh we are in the middle of uh major deliberations over uh the largest infrastructure package that our country has ever undertaken the president has made certain proposals to congress in the trillions of dollars uh the president and a number of folks in both the house and the senate have tried to work towards a bipartisan uh bill that could actually pass congress uh which is the goal here the goal here is to get something that passes congress and can get to the president's desk and be signed by the president uh the bill that is being negotiated or deliberated on in the us senate right now is over one trillion dollars of infrastructure and this is not a traditional infrastructure although that's critically needed uh roads um harbors airports water lines sewers etc but infrastructure in a broader sense the one area that i would note in particular that i think is most critical for hawaii is broadband because too much of our state still just lacks basic broadband we saw that happen during covet 19. today we depend on broadband for distance learning but also telemedicine which we used so extensively during during covet 19. and so the opportunities for us to get uh some real federal help to to uh really take broadband throughout this entire state um is an exciting one that that i think we we need to pursue um and then finally i would note um that um here in hawaii of course we're in the indo-pacific uh we're in the broader uh community of of the pacific um we are closely linked with the countries of you know asia and the pacific and even beyond countries like india um that in one way shape or form have major efforts uh in the pacific and here in hawaii we are really in many ways uh the center of our country's efforts in the pacific whether it be defense or other areas um foreign policy gathering people from other countries at places like the east west center at the asia pacific center for security studies where we facilitate really an international effort to cooperate in the pacific um this is an area that uh has certainly uh uh consumed a lot of my time as well um that is not only what we should be doing for our country as we look to to china and i'll get perhaps into china a little bit more but as china seeks really in many ways to dominate the pacific um to include up to our doorstep and perhaps even us of course i'm sure china would like to kind of determine the history of our state uh i don't think we're gonna let that happen but um that's their ambition uh and we have to address uh that as a practical matter but not just that uh but um the many um relationships that we have throughout the pacific islands our cultural and ethnic heritage so much of it right here in hawaii we have a role to play for our country but as we play that role for our country and for our world it also helps us back at home with our own economy so in the area of continuing to try to diversify our travel and tourism industry there's much we can do at the federal level that will help us to do so as we look to our role in the indo-pacific um with that i will turn it back over to you congressman cahelli for your own thoughts on the big picture of the 117th congress great well mahalo congressman case for that and you know i think like you articulated uh the 117 congress for me has been dominated by you know covet 19 and how the federal government is approaching um dealing with the coronavirus something that we've been now dealing with for for over a year and a half um like you said uh earlier today you know recorded a record 655 new colbit cases 166 hospitalizations and a positivity rate of 6.9 percent here on hawaii island uh we had 131 of those cases and we have an 8.35 positive positivity rate and so covet is still something that is very much here in our community uh the delta variant is the predominant variant for the kova 19 strain across the united states as of mid july 82 of all coven 19 cases in the nation were as a result of the delta variant uh and so it's something that we need to take very very seriously it's a viral variant it's much more contagious it accounts for mo the most disease transmission and it represents a dire health risk to unvaccinated individuals and it's now endangering many regions throughout the united states you know for for myself personally i chose to get vaccinated um not just for my my wife my kids my family my mom but also community members and my kupuna and our kupuna who are elderly and immunocompromised and so if there's one thing uh that i want to make sure i foot stomp tonight is to please get vaccinated um you know vaccines are widely available throughout hawaii and um of course it's a choice you have to make um and you make with your doctor if you're concerned about the vaccine you know reach out to your doctor or a trusted nurse and try to do the best research you can and make the best decision you can for your family but um at the end of the day you know i really want to emphasize um to everyone to get the vaccine um and it's really really important with the um you know very deadly delta variant that is spreading throughout our community and it's i think why through complacency we've seen a spike in uh covet cases across not just the state uh but throughout the the country as well and so um that is uh what what has really taken up a lot of our time um over the course of the last uh you know 212 days uh while in the congress you know i had a opportunity to be a part of the american rescue plan which was a significant uh um you know federal piece of legislation that allocated you know uh billions and you know over trillion dollars to different states across the country to deal with covet 19. one of the things that i'm very proud of in the american rescue plan and i'll talk about one of those things is the child tax credit that we included in the american rescue plan many of you with with children have been receiving the child tax credit as of a few weeks ago um and although the child tax credit is a temporary provision it has the pos uh the potential to cut child poverty in half in hawaii a stunning 83.4 percent of children in our district will benefit from the expanded and improved child tax credit that equates to about 135 000 children across the state uh the average benefit for over 36 thousand households is about 2 900 um and uh you know it's it's it's gonna help families especially those families where children in poverty uh get out of poverty and it's going to help at least 2 900 children in our district get out of that deep poverty so that's something that i'm really uh proud of that we're able to do and i hope that we can make that child tax credit uh permanent uh moving forward one of the things i focused on um in the appropriations process and we're still working on in the congress is on the agriculture side of the house i've had an opportunity to lead efforts to increase funding for specialty crops for infrastructure for organic agriculture and nutrition programs and rural housing and development programs and a broad range of integrated area-wide pest management issues that we've been dealing with here on hawaii island where coffee is a big part of our agriculture industry as it is on kauai and on other islands across hawaii but really important here for hawaii's agriculture industry we've been dealing with the coffee berry bore and the coffee leaf rust and so i've really focused on even though i don't serve on the agriculture committee i've really focused on how we can help our agriculture industry through the coffee plant health initiative to the macadamia tree health initiative and through doing whatever we can to to strengthen local processing um and to help smaller livestock processors throughout the state compete for competitive grants and also how we can work together um through the flexible financing for rural america program which can help rural energy cooperatives um on their consumer debt and utility service providers that are unable to refine loans from the usda so i've really focused on on agriculture and diversifying hawaii's economy from our historically tourism and military economic drivers and um you know we've put a lot of work into that so um i'm going to save a few of my uh things that we've worked on for a couple slides that i have uh after congressman case's uh um additional things that he wants to talk about and then i'll bring up a couple slides that we can discuss but at this point let me turn it back to congressman case so we can do that and we can get to your questions thanks congressman and uh what's uh quite interesting and i think people should know is that um um uh kai and i coordinate um on our appropriations requests uh not only do we talk back and forth about bills that we can co-sponsor but when the time comes to actually uh try to seek federal funding in in various areas uh we talk back and forth about um you know what exactly we we think we need and how to get it and which of us is best positioned to really uh lead something in particular so you know if it's if it's a funding issue that's important uh especially to congressman cahilly's district um and it's an appropriations committee issue i'm gonna try to push that one through for for hawaii and if it's uh of transportation infrastructure related uh that relates uh perhaps even more more so uh to the first congressional district my district uh than the second uh well uh kelly is going to try to try to help get that one done so we're just far better off if we are in constant communication coordinating on the specific efforts that we want and i think that is borne out by some of the results in appropriations excuse me that we that we have been successful at so far i'll just give you a little bit of a sampling of of some of the areas that we are focusing on again on the appropriation side in the agriculture area akai mentioned the coffee these leaf rust which has been so devastating to our to our coffee industry we have comparable uh concerns with some of our other major specialty crops such as macadamia nuts which which have their own challenge of going but in the agriculture area we also have some very very specific education grants that facilitate education throughout our state that we have been able to to fund um in a way that is specific to hawaii in the uh commerce and justice and science area which is critical here uh in hawaii uh we get a we get a huge amount of money for um really ocean and atmospheric related research that funds many many good jobs through the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which pairs up really with the university of hawaii in many ways to offer really world-leading research we try to fund that through the appropriations process i talked about defense one area that we believe i think i can speak for both of us is necessary for hawaii is is a state-of-the-art homeland defense radar uh which we have also tried to fund together with our colleagues in the senate and and have been successful thus far we have tried to fund federal programs that that that accelerate renewable energy research and development uh through the energy part of appropriations uh that is something of course that we desperately need here in hawaii where we have some of the highest energy prices based on fossil fuels in the entire world and we need to continue that transfer and transition over to renewable energy the federal government offers a lot of funding in that area that also assists us from uh from an economic development perspective because jobs are created and maintained good solid paying jobs in the research and development area it helps our university um as well uh in in homeland security uh one of the continuing uh issues we always have is is is trying to make sure that people can get in and through our airports um as easily as possible that helps uh not only only us locally but also our travel and tourism industry so we try to fund the tsa and keep the csa you know fully resourced in the area of of interior uh the interior department uh we try to fund our precious natural resources to make sure that that our national parks for example both of which are in in congressman kelly's districts but help the entire state not only do we like to enjoy that but of course that's part of our our visitor industry we have tried to maintain that funding um we have um major uh investments in military uh construction um i'm on that subcommittee where i'm now pretty pretty senior on that subcommittee and i spent a lot of time trying to make sure that our military facilities are are up to par uh we have major investments going on at places like schofield barracks the pearl harbor naval shipyard um the uh kaneohe bay marine marine corps uh facility uh where they really need to upgrade many of their most basic facilities things like like um enlisted in officer uh quarters uh hangers um you you name it these these run into the really really into the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars and of course that not only helps our our our defense effort but it provides very good solid uh paying jobs for for those that work in construction here in hawaii and at the pearl harbor naval shipyard which is our largest industrial employer which is right in the middle of my district at pearl harbor um i also have in that committee our veterans affairs matters and and of course our veterans communities throughout hawaii we have one of the highest pro rata populations of veterans and their families of any statement in the entire country because not only do we do we serve in the military as does congressman alcaheli but also many many of our military families choose to stay here after their service and so these veterans facilities are critical to that community not just tripler but we have both tried very hard for example uh to make sure that uh the newest veterans of facility in hawaii the aloha project the advanced leeward outpatient facility that will be constructed out near uh west oahu and in kapolei is actually fully funded and constructed in the state and foreign office area of appropriations i spoke earlier about the great facilities that we have here that are central to our country's effort uh in the indo-pacific and are really gathering places if i can put it that way for many many leaders uh from and others from throughout our world that come to hawaii to try to solve many of the problems of of the indo-pacific and even of the world and again uh so we're talking about the east-west center which may which receives a major federal funding as well as other facilities uh that may not be as well known as the east west center but are still uh equally critical to that effort again these also provide good solid paying jobs here in hawaii and then finally transportation housing and urban development where we have major block grants large amounts that that come to hawaii to help us with our infrastructure needs um and i guess i shouldn't have said finally because the last areas is really in health and human services and education and in that area uh the the the the funding that we try to maintain and increase from year to year is funding not just generally in those areas but for our native hawaiian programs where we have long-standing federal laws and programs that assist our native wine community with health with education uh with business development uh with housing and these programs need to be maintained and funded from year to year and the needs are great so that's a little bit of an overview of of appropriations i think i'll uh just stop there and turn it back to you for a little while congressman okay great sounds good i'm gonna um display a few slides and um let's go to the next slide okay so first first and foremost want to make sure that everyone has the right information to uh contact my office and and uh who you can reach out to in both dc and hawaii in washington dc my chief of staff is christy wagner here in hawaii my deputy chief of staff is ikaika mahoy in washington d.c our legislative director in charge of our policy shop is kana smith i'm michael ahn and raz makaula they are our dc and hawaii communications directors and here at our district office in hilo hawaii is jasmine bronco as our office manager and then hanalei lilo is our director of constituent services a couple different things i've done um as you're a member of congress i relocated the flagship second congressional district office from the island of oahu here to hawaii island and to my hometown of hilo and so i'm sitting right now in hilo hawaii in my district office which is uh just in front of the gila lagoon center and right across from the state courthouse for those of you familiar with downtown hilo the other thing i did was i utilized four of the part-time positions that are allocated to my congressional office to field representatives on the islands of lanai molokai maui and kauai so we have four field reps that represent the second congressional district on those individual islands so if you have any issues mike contradi is on kauai jean ross davis on the island of moloka'i stephanie ohigashi on maui and joel on the island of lanai can coordinate any issues you might have and then there are our dc and hawaii district office addresses and please follow us at rep kahele or kahele.house.gov sign up for our newsletter which we put out right about the first of every single month and you'll be able to receive that and um and see what we're doing back in dc and here at the district office in hawaii for you next slide committees and caucuses already talked about those house armed services committee and the two subcommittees i'm on are the tactical airline and readiness subcommittees and in the house tni committee really important for the bipartisan infrastructure bill that is currently being uh in final negotiations in the u.s senate congressman case and i will be expecting that bill over in the house probably in a few weeks but on those uh tni committee i serve on the subcommittees of aviation and highways and transit two really important subcommittees for hawaii as far as caucuses go i'm a member of the progressive caucus uh k-pac asia pacific american caucus where i am a member of the leadership team on kpac i'm also a member of a couple different caucuses that are bipartisan the four country caucus being one of those uh served together on the pacific islands caucus which congressman case is a founding member of that caucus and proud to serve with the other insular and u.s territory members across the pacific on on that caucus i see some medicaid questions and uh cnmi questions and we'll be able to answer those uh tonight as well next slide um as far as constituent outreach and services update uh in the last 212 days my office has responded to over 30 000 constituent letters with an average response time of about nine days i personally look over every single response that goes out to your constituent letters and emails that we receive and um we're really proud that we've we've gotten caught up on those and we're uh we're um we're getting those uh with a timely response and a meaningful response to your issues as far as casework uh we try our best to uh address all casework issues within the first 48 hours and our office has closed uh 650 official casework inquiries um that has come into our office since we took office and what's really important about that is just because you send me an email or reach out on instagram or facebook or some social media platform in order to really have a case uh looked at um you need to go through our district office our casework team which hanalei liloy manages and you need to fill out the personal disclosure form that allows us to look into your personal case and issue so that we can uh appropriately work on that and so i would just want to stress that as well as far as constituent interactions uh myself or my staff have attended over 120 community meetings and i'm really proud that our oahu staff and our team of hard-working interns have attended every neighborhood board in the second congressional district on the island of oahu since we took office and we have representation there we're on the agenda we provide a timely response for every question that we get asked and um you know that's something that that we've really worked hard to do is to be on every neighborhood board meeting on the wall as far as island um district visits you know congressman case left out the fact that he is and he won't say it but i'll say it he's uh the only member of congress ever in the history of the state of hawaii to represent both the first and the second congressional district in the united states house of representatives so he knows how challenging it is to represent the second congressional district which encompasses the entire state of hawaii in my last uh six seven months in office i've had a chance to go to maui and lanai and molokai and oahu and kauai i've gone to every island bought molokai but we are going to go to molokai in a few weeks before the end of august and so by the end of august we will have gone to every island uh for for extensive site visits um throughout the second congressional district and uh and you know that that's a really important opportunity for us to really understand the different challenges on the different islands next slide community funded projects this is something that was new in the 117 congress i'm sure congressman case will talk about some of the ones that he worked on but for for my office specifically in the appropriations bills um that the majority of them have been uh already moved out of uh uh it's it's i guess committees of jurisdiction and have been brought to the house floor it's about 5.8 million dollars um a million dollars for the boys and ghost club of the big island for a keal puna youth development community center 1.2 million dollars for the council for native wine advancement for their trades and entrepreneurship program a million dollars to hana health on maui for a rehabilitation support center 650 000 for the kauai creative technology center over on west kauai a hundred thousand dollars for the kawahi program on molokai a million dollars for the milolii community richmond historical center in south kona and finally 896 000 for mao organic farms on the leeward coast on the island of oahu so these are community funded projects uh that will be flowing into our communities these projects and i'm sure like congressman case will talk about his are really important for this um point and space and time because of the lack of general fund revenues to the state of hawaii the state legislature was unable to provide really critical grant and aid programs that the state historically appropriates every legislative session to worthy nonprofits all over the state and they didn't give out any granting aids this past legislative session to non-profits and so these community-funded projects that congressman case and i were able to champion and work on will help those nonprofits and critical services that they provide to our communities next slide i think this is my final slide these are some appropriations for hawaii um that i work really hard on uh congressman k sits on the appropriations committee so his his representation on a very very important committee for hawaii um uh you know is has been critical to getting many of these programs approved because he is that that voice and he's uh you know at that table when many of these appropriations requests uh come to the appropriations committee in the various subcommittees of jurisdiction but these are some that i wanted to highlight i talked about agriculture earlier money for native american programs uh that eventually get to our native hawaiian programs and our sba 88 development programs um there's programs and funding for native wine healthcare papa lokahi and the different native hawaiian healthcare island systems that that make up the native wine healthcare act and papalo kahi there's money for native hawaiian education programs that get administered through the state of hawaii that help programs like punanaleo and our university of hawaii hilo and manoa native foreign education programs there's money for housing urban development for the native wine housing block grant program uh the hud vash program uh hudvash which helps um houseless veterans and provides them housing vouchers so that they can have housing that they can live in money for the east west center that's really important for for that program and we've consistently always funded the east west center and so that was a an important appropriation and then finally one of the things that i was able to work on was a veterinary treatment facility program at hickam air force base just under 29 million dollars for that program so these are just some of the many appropriations uh projects and programs that our office was able to get into the appropriations bill and um you know i think it goes back to the teamwork that congressman case and i talked about you know where both hawaii in the u.s house and the u.s senate is very well positioned but with my representation on the house armed services and the tni committee and congressman case's representation on the natural resources committee which has a very important role for the native hawaiian community but more importantly his position on the appropriations committee puts us in a very strong position to fight for every federal resource and every federal dollar for the state of hawaii and the districts that we represent is that the last slide yes mahalo okay um so those are my slides and i'll turn it back to uh congressman case well hello um i think i often i often think about my congressional duties as being in really three buckets the first bucket is is our responsibility to help lead our country so the larger issues of our country our contribution uh to the direction of our country whether it be covet 19 responses or how to deal with china or any number of other issues that we face in congress every day the second uh bucket is about um helping our hawaii wherever we can both congressman kaheli and i have really focused a lot of our report back to you um on on that aspect whether it be appropriations or our community project funding or some of our our other efforts that are really more about making sure that our federal government works uh for us here in hawaii and then the third area is is really about helping our individual constituents and and uh kai kai uh uh spoke to that in some of the areas that he discussed that when he when he talked about casework uh which is our individual efforts on your behalf my office is completely open and and accessible to the folks in the first congressional district to help you with your individual concerns a lot of times it's just a simple question but a lot of times it's more complicated than that the areas that we get a lot of questions on from that perspective are are for example um unemployment insurance which remains a state program so that's been very frustrating in all honesty uh uh because it's not a federal program and yet it's been so critical to so many out there but we still try to answer your question and get an answer from the state if you're not getting an answer other areas are immigration which is definitely a federal program of passports which is definitely a federal program veterans and social security benefits a huge part of our our case work again for information there in context case.house.gov one thing that we are really honored to be able to do is to recognize the the folks from hawaii that have uh have have succeeded so well on the national and the international stage and so um if you if you have a couple of those pictures that we that we took today can you can you put them up right now to my staff i hope they're there um maybe not so i will i will just um try i have to describe to you that today uh today today congressman kahella and i uh we were not able to do this personally because of covet 19 restrictions but of course uh olympic gold medal uh surfing a championship champion uh carissa moore returned to hawaii and was honored in the governor's office today and we were able to give her present to her through the governor a special certificate of congressional uh congratulations i'm just so proud of her uh to have her back there's there's the picture right there and that's our certificate um and that just gives us incredible pleasure to have really the us congress uh through us i'll be able to contribute to uh so much of what she's been able to do and make make us all proud so it kind of chokes me up but um she's an amazing person and she's she's the olympic gold medal medalist and to have that come from hawaii for the first time with all of our history right here is is something that i think moves us all unifies us all i can say the other thing i um did today i think it illustrates a little bit of of the job that i that i try to do in terms of helping hawaii in congress and that is always interacting with with our fellow elected officials here in hawaii uh both congressman kahele and i uh re uh represent about 750 000 people each uh and as he pointed out he that's on a number of islands i i i have honolulu so 15 miles one way 15 miles the other way is a little easier logistically but we have to rely on our partners in state and county government to try to try to feed us information and to point out to us areas that they think are important for us to focus on and then our job is to try to figure out how to help them and and help our constituencies and so uh for example just this morning i spent um three three hours with uh honolulu uh city council uh chair tommy waters who represents uh a hundred thousand people with me in east honolulu all the way from makapuu point all the way uh through east honolulu as far as wilhelmina rise and and and waikiki tommy has all of waikiki and so we drove around today and and simply uh um tried to talk story about what what he thought were important issues here's some pictures and just kind of run run through them here we we are at first of all sandy beach trying to figure out how to preserve that incredible coastline at hanauma bay right here talking about marine conservation um and then on from there to the manolo of fishpond uh which is uh right there hawaiiloa ridge incredible restoration effort um on from there we went to aina haina where we went up to the top of i-9 and met with residents uh to talk about um flooding in a wailupi stream uh get get it on on site so in other words we're i'm not in washington dc i'm here trying to figure it out with them and then try to think to myself well how can i translate this into action from there we went on down to waikiki where we spoke about critical beach restoration efforts that are needed in waikiki as well as to try to understand how we could help our our tourism industry and then finally we made uh a a wreath uh uh down there to to really honor the folks that were um in waikiki long before uh the tourists were here uh in hawaii and so that was just that was just my morning this morning but it was invaluable for me to stay in touch with my fellow elected officials and i got a long laundry list of stuff i got to take back to dc now and and uh work it through okay uh congressman cahilly um a little bit more from you or do you want to just go to your questions because i think we're kind of at the time when we should turn it over to the to our listeners yeah you bet yeah we can jump to questions um i'll uh want to take do you want to take one we'll just uh tag team back and forth i got i got my list and you got yours yeah sure and we're uh we're trying to pull as as much as as we can from here um one question talked about uh the cesspool situation throughout the state and if there were any updates to possible solutions uh you know this was something that um you know i didn't expect to be a big part of my work in this you know first six seven months of the congress but on the tni committee um i had an opportunity to address this particular issue after doing and being invited to it making a site visit to the to the east hawaii wastewater treatment facility here in hilo and so taking that information and working together um with the subcommittee on jurisdiction for cesspools and clean water issues throughout the country we were able to work on the house clean water state revolving fund and i was able to get 50 million dollars into the house infrastructure bill to address the cesspool issues and so this bill passed the u.s house it was included it was included it's 50 million dollars to address cesspools to the clean water state revolving fund um was passed by the u.s house in the invest in america act uh which is basically the house infrastructure bill this was direct action of advocacy on behalf of myself and my staff and ensuring that cesspools are included in any type of clean water legislation in addition my staff has been working together with county officials and the epa to increase the availability of funds to address this particular issue you know as you most of you probably know the state legislature a few years ago passed a law to eliminate all cesspools across the state of hawaii uh it doesn't take effect until about 2040 2050 that's that's a ways away from now uh but the goal is to eliminate the about 90 000 cesspools that exist throughout the state the majority of which exist here on hawaii island that comes at a cost because if any of you out there have had to get a new house construction or you did a remodeling permit and were required to put in a septic tank you know that that can cost anywhere between eight to fifteen maybe even up to twenty thousand dollars to convert to a septic tank and a leech field so trying to get federal funding to help local county municipalities modernize their wastewater treatment facilities connect more people to the wastewater system get people off of cesspools and help those that in our our rural and geographically challenged communities to uh convert to a septic tank and find the federal resources to do that was something that my office worked on through the infrastructure bill so we're working on it and uh thanks so much uh for that for that question and i guess congressman case we'll just go back and forth no okay um i got one here what are your thoughts about the bipartisan infrastructure bill that is now before the senate i spoke to that a little bit uh earlier on i support the bipartisan infrastructure bill first of all i i support a major investment in infrastructure i support the largest investment in infrastructure and in our in our nation's history and this bill does represent that uh there are other proposals that are larger and there are other proposals that are smaller uh for me what this comes down to is our nation's infrastructure is crumbling whether it be our roads our our sewers our our schools our broadband our our airports are right across the other road and we need that kind of investment reinvestment in our country really to not only keep our country strong and functioning but to compete out there in the world um but you've got to get stuff through congress um and in all honesty there are many uh of our colleagues in congress that either don't believe in in an infrastructure bill or if they believe in it they believe in a in a much smaller version of the of the infrastructure bill and and so you've got to find a way to pass stuff through congress the senate is split exactly 50 50. uh the house uh is is virtually uh split there are um um you know not many more democrats than republicans so although democrats are are in in the majority it's a very very slim majority and and and um the the options to to pass things through congress on a completely unified democratic perspective in both the house and the senate are very very narrow and so um this is a this is an opportunity for us to try to come together uh and kind of get beyond the partisanship and and do the right thing for the country uh the president has advocated for a bipartisan infrastructure bill since uh even before he was sworn in he has worked hard to hold that together he's brought the two sides to the white house to negotiate where those negotiations seem to be breaking down he's held this one together they came to an agreement in principle they're they're they're working through it in the senate right now which is which is you know a tough place to get anything passed now on a 50-50 split and i think the country wants its government to work so this is not just about infrastructure this is also about can we actually figure out a way to get stuff done uh that is for the for the common good of the american people and kind of set some of that partisanship aside and so there's a lot invested in in the in this in this bill that is being deliberately deliberated on in the senate um and we're both very hopeful that they'll get it done by the end of this week and it'll be back in the house now we did pass out our own uh infrastructure bill as congressman kelly pointed out um and that's over in the senate and and hopefully a lot of that is in what the senate is uh debating and we'll will conclude uh hopefully uh very very soon and then we'll get it back um but so my thoughts uh to answer your question in a very long way but to simplify it um i i again i support that effort and i and i hope uh very much to be able to take it up in in the house and as congressman kelly said in the next one or two weeks and get it passing get it to the president's desk and prove to the american people that this congress can actually work okay back to you congressman yeah i'll say the same thing on the infrastructure bill um you know hawaii uh is is and the nation is desperately in need of an [Music] infrastructure investment and injection into the nation uh to address our crumbling bridges our roads our aging infrastructure you know hawaii has a d-plus when raiding our infrastructure and many of our bridges are already crumbling go out to haleiwa and uh there's a bridge out there that you barely can use because the foundations and the footings are in desperate need of repair so um you know this what looks to be um you know really really close to an infrastructure bill something that uh you know this is only my first year in congress but congressman case has been in uh the house uh for for um you know several years many years and and he knows how difficult it is to get an infrastructure bill through the house and senate to the president's desk and this is the closest we've got it in many many years to uh achieving that um i hope that there are critical components in the invest in america act that we sent over to the house that are in the senate version of the infrastructure bill that looks like they'll pass this weekend um in the invested america act we both congressman case and i had an opportunity to um specify certain uh surface transportation projects that are really important for the entire state of hawaii um many of those projects were identified on the state's onpo and the state's transportation infrastructure or investment plan on the exact acronym but it's it's a step and the tip the transportation improvement plan by the state of hawaii department of transportation and so everything from the repaving of wainui nui avenue here in hilo to addressing bridges and critical infrastructure highway transportation projects across the state were in that bill that we sent over to the senate and i really hope some of those stay in there and make it in there because they're really important um for some of those uh state identified um you know uh federal state cost share transportation projects that we can get in there but basically uh i i fully support the infrastructure bill and i lo is looking forward to it coming over to the house and and like congressman k said passing it as quick as possible and getting it to the president's desk okay question for me is um uh let's see uh when can hawaii family see the premium pay for central workers as part of the american rescue plan what can we do to make this happen so the american rescue plan act and thank you for that question but the um american rescue plan local fiscal recovery funds may be used to provide premium pay to eligible workers performing essential work during the covet 19 public health emergency or to provide grants to third party employers with eligible workers performing this essential work these funds were distributed through the american rescue plan that the congress and the president signed into law in march those funds were distributed to the governor and to the county mayors so it would have been up to those state officials to decide how to distribute these funds uh including if they wanted to have premium pay for essential workers so i hope that uh answers your question if if you um are eligible for premium pay um and it's something that you have not received yet you know like congressman k said we often deal with issues that are not directly within our jurisdiction but we know how to connect you to the appropriate county or state senator or representative that can work together with the administration to get those um allocated and finally here's a here's another easy question it's basically you talked about your field representatives for the rest of the state but who are your representatives for the second district on the island of oahu uh and so that's a great question thank you for that on the island of oahu is my deputy chief of staff ikaika mahoy he is essentially the uh my top representative throughout the entire state of hawaii so that would be kaika mahou he's on the island of oahu and roz who is my communications director and she is on the island of oahu as well you'll frequently see them at neighborhood boards or at community meetings when we go back to in-person meetings but ikaika and raz are my field representatives and my point people on the island of oahu okay um let's see here's a question for me will you be willing to raise taxes on the wealthy um that's a very good question and i think it's one that we all have to face the music on so let me set the stage for that um we have borrowed um over five trillion dollars uh in the last 18 months for covet 19. uh 18 months ago um our our our physical situation in our country was already going downhill uh we had very very large uh annual deficits of the difference between revenues and expenses uh any in in any uh fiscal year was all already some of the largest uh that we had ever ever had and then we coveted 19 came along and uh our national debt uh at the beginning meaning the entire amount of money that is owed by our federal government so translate by you uh through through our through our federal government uh was somewhere in the range of 23 trillion dollars and that was a very very large amount but take 23 trillion dollars and and increase it to over 28 trillion dollars inside of 18 months uh puts our physical situation in an even more precarious state and so personally i'm not willing to to go into any more uh debt in our country than than we have to covet 19 was an emergency and we needed to do that we needed to stabilize our our economy stabilize our our communities and help those that needed uh helping and that was the wrong time to either cut federal programs or increase taxes while we try to get on our feet again but hopefully now that we're coming out of covet 19 and stabilizing to pretend that we can just go on with massive increases in federal spending without um um trying trying at least uh to to return to some physical sustainability in our country i think is perilous and is the wrong decision for us to make not just for ourselves but for our children because i don't want to hand off uh to my kids a country that is that is a physical wreck and i don't think we have to uh and so we've got to face the music because the only the only alternatives then to try to do this in a way that doesn't worsen our debt uh at the level that we went down the road with covet 19 is is by is by uh controlling the spending side and or providing on the revenue side i think we do have many areas where we can control spending and even reduce in some areas but the fact of the matter is we're talking about major infrastructure investments for example um in the in the trillion plus dollar uh category um you're not able to handle that kind of investment in our in our country by by cutting federal programs by a trillion dollars somewhere else to increase uh infrastructure spending and so you're led back to the revenue side now um i didn't support uh the actions of president trump uh some years ago not not that many years ago um to reduce uh taxes on on the most uh uh uh wealthy among us and also to reduce taxes on corporations where i thought that that the tax rates uh were were adequately set prior to that by by both democratic and republican um uh presidents and congresses and so um these were still some of the lowest corporate tax rates uh since the second world war um also on the on the um on the individual tax side uh they were some of the lowest tax rates as well so it wasn't like they were crushing and and and um destroying economic activity or or or or making it very very difficult for for people to live i didn't think those tax cuts were necessary and they weren't warranted and i think they created inequities in our society that i that i simply couldn't support as a policy matter nonetheless uh those those tax cuts were instituted and they contributed to a horsing worsening fiscal situation and to debt so to me to simply allow the tax rates to return to where they were before they were reduced by president trump to rates that again had been sustainable over time is the is an appropriate thing for us to do and so from that perspective the answer to your question is yes i'm i am willing uh to return uh to tax rates uh free trump uh cuts uh that would result um in an increase uh in in taxes at the very upper income levels and at the corporate uh tax levels uh i would not be willing to do that to a point where it actually does in fact um um start to hinder economic activity but i do not believe that going back to pre-trump tax cut levels is going to do that and and i think it's a fair allocation of the responsibilities of of our federal government across our society and i think it is necessary for us to be able to make these uh um reinvestments in our infrastructure and other parts of our our economy and society where are you congressman yeah i mean you know one of the questions i got asked uh and it's it's basically [Music] along the lines of what you were talking about was the question was how this income was taxed higher of the trump tax cut due to the assault limitation i'm okay with that if they're very rich are made to pay their fair shares uh not zero and what would be my comments on that and you know i couldn't agree with you more that the rich should pay more and that's why i'm a co-sponsor of the ultra millionaires tax and this bill will ask the 0.01 percent the richest people in this country to pay their fair share in taxes um you know this bill would include a two percent annual tax on the net worth of households between 50 million and one billion dollars and a three percent sur tax on net worth above a billion dollars at the end of the day we have a revenue problem in this country and trickle-down economics has never worked for our country and the trump tax cut uh of uh that cost us 2.3 trillion dollars in revenue uh was supposed to go to the working class and in fact it went to the um uh people in the top 20 of the income ladder you know i know so many people who are working class uh americans that when they did their tax returns this past year um you know found that they were paying a lot more in taxes than they were in previous years and that's because president trump's tax cut you know was a total dot was a total doubt it was a total sham and um you know i totally would agree and go back to the pre-trump tax cuts and uh or the pre-trump tax rates and to um go back to um where the taxes were for the uh um the corporate tax rate and uh the other uh tax structures that existed before the trump tax cut and so you know i agree with you and um you know i definitely think the rich should pay more and um you know that's why i'm a proud sponsor of the ultramarines tax so that's uh my piggy backing on that uh that answer from uh congressman case let me go to uh another question uh my business is being threatened this is from uh um let's see my business is being threatened by eviction by my landlord from a good friend of mine aside from jeff gomes here in hilo and he's falling falling behind on my lease to the covet shutdown can you help me um you know jeff a lot of people are in your situation as well across uh across the state and across our country as of right now the federal government has not issued an eviction moratorium for uh commercial businesses they've only applied that uh to um uh you know residential tenants and so i i i don't know what congressman case uh will have to say but i don't think um president uh biden nor did president trump when he was in office issue an eviction moratorium uh for for commercial businesses um and those that have commercial leases um i will say that the state legislature even attempted to pass a law this past legislative session uh to protect commercial tenants and that never even made it out of the hawaii state senate passed one committee and died in the house or the senate committee on the judiciary um all of that doesn't help you and so how can we help well you know one of the things that our office has been trying to look into his eil loans and if those are still available for those impacted by covet 19 you know those loans are um managed by the small business administration um but you know this is a a difficult um a difficult issue and it's affecting many many businesses who are just starting to come back uh as the economy starts to come back and so you know i'll do whatever i can and uh to help not not just you jeff but um you know tenants across the state who are being impacted because of a loss of revenues due to covet to help you stay in your your business and stay where you're uh where you're located and try and work together with your landlord to do that there are community organizations throughout the state depending on your particular circumstances that i might be able to connect you with um but you know this is something that is really important to me and you know my staff knows how important it is to me um but it doesn't look like there is a state or a federal eviction moratorium for commercial businesses that is in place or will be in place and so the available you know opportunities to help you would reside within the small business administration or what we can try and do with our community partners uh out there but congressman case any thoughts on uh on on that i mean i think that's the reality congressman um the the the um assistance that we tried to provide and did it did provide across across the government was uh to to give small businesses like jeff's and by the way jeff i still have your keychain i really appreciate that the time that i spent with you um i've always i've always treasured that and i know the hardship you're going through right now as as so many are throughout the country i mean throughout the state we've tried to make sure that those ppp those idle loans as congressman uh heli referred to are available to help you to help with with your rent um and um and certainly uh landlords that receive their own assistance uh uh should should should not uh be be um you know taking that assistance and yet uh trying to evict uh tenants in the same breath uh that that would that's completely unfair if that's happening and personally i've said to many many tenants in that situation that if that is happening let me know and i'll get personally involved because that that is not what was supposed to happen um depending on what the business uh is that you are in there are also other possibilities uh shuttered venue uh grant operators uh the restaurant revitalization fund i know that's not you jeff i don't think but many others that may be listening there are very specialized areas of business assistance um and there are a lot of programs out there to help commercial landlord-tenant-related disputes get worked out after all um it is it is far more preferable from the landlord's perspective to keep tenants in uh and get them uh paying again as opposed to not having anybody in at all so um all i can really offer right here is exactly what uh kai just did which is anybody in the first congressional in that situation reach out to us uh please and we'll try to help with your own individual uh situation because we've been able to help folks out not once we've understood the exact circumstances that they have been under and each one of them is a little different um okay um i'm going to go ahead what are your thoughts on addressing the concern of china as it attempts to spread its influence in the pacific what is this so-called eagle act well first of all i spoke to that a little bit in my in my introductory uh remarks that china is a major threat to the indo-pacific to our country um and to our world china's intention um is really to to to supplant the um the international rules based order which is uh for the most part uh led to great uh peace and stability um and uh improvement in the lives of many uh throughout our world uh since the second world war um and it is simply um a kind of an international code of conduct on which under which we will we will try to address the world's issues and and try to resolve the world's disputes and essentially china is fine with doing that if if it helps their own ambitions uh but it's not fine when it doesn't uh has happened for example in the south china sea which china is trying to turn into its own territorial waters and when that claim went to um arbitration international arbitration which the philippines brought in china lost um china said it wasn't going to abide by that um so that'll tell you a little bit about what's going on i know there's i know there's people out there that wish china wasn't this way that wish that that somehow think when people like me talk this way it's it's it's overly aggressive i want i would like china to be part of the the um the world like anybody else but you have to be realistic at some point and look at the evidence of what's happening from a human rights perspective from from a democracy perspective from a buildup of the military perspective and all kinds of ways and it all adds up to one thing and that is that china's something to worry about um now we need to respond to that in a number of different ways number one um if we don't have a strong national defense capability then china doesn't really care about us uh but if we have a strong national defense capability um then china does have to be concerned um just running you know rough shot over over much of our part of the world uh and so that it has to start there in hawaii has a major role to play but the other area that is really critical is for us to to really um compete with china in the non-defense sphere so in other words to to offer to the world what we have offered for three generations now which is which is um aid where it's needed humanitarian assistance education assistance technological assistance trade uh with with with the world all of these things help countries like it those throughout the pacific islands the pacific rim whether it be our allies like australia or other countries um that are not technically our allies but we want to work with i like the countries of the pacific islands uh to include fiji and the blue pacific act which uh congressman kelly referred to earlier is an attempt to do that in the pacific islands to boost up our engagement with the countries of the pacific islands in areas like the peace corps like the u.s agency for international development like trade like helping those countries to to to secure their their maritime uh regions their their oceans um and these are sometimes referred to as soft power uh and uh but it's really really critical stuff the eagle act was a major it is a major bill that has been now brought out of the foreign affairs committee in the house and is coming before the full united states house of representatives it stands for um engaging america's uh i'm sorry ensuring america's global leadership and engagement act so it's really um it's really the blue pacific act but bigger than just the blue pacific act uh to include other countries as well throughout the world um much of our blue pacific act is in the eagle act now so um this is a major effort that we need to continue to try to push through um um to to to to re-engage in many cases with countries of the world that perhaps uh feel like we've been taking them for granted uh for too long and um if they if they have desperate situations at home and and nowhere else to go uh china offers them um what they often need uh but with a lot of conditions and we don't want to let that happen where do you uh don asks a question about the second amendment specifically if i support the second amendment yes i do don but i also believe that communities have the right to be safe from gun violence and that's why i support common sense gun violence prevention laws like red flag laws banning ghost guns supporting gun safety and enhanced background checks thanks for the question okay congressman congressman we're actually kind of running short on time so i'm gonna i'm gonna do one more for me and then uh you do what you want and then we'll they will rap if that's okay okay sounds good all right well i'm gonna take uh take one that we started with uh that we both talked about in the middle and that i think is the right place to end this says what are your thoughts on mandatory vaccinations now that the governor and the mayors have agreed to have public employees either be vaccinated or submitted to weekly tests let's go back to the facts here we're in the middle of a pandemic we are in a worsening part of that that pandemic uh we have in the in the prior two waves of covid19 we didn't have the option of of getting ourselves vaccinated now anybody uh at least over the age of 12 or 12 or over um and under 12 in just a few months can be vaccinated can be protected largely from covet 19 and can protect each of us uh from covet 19 as well we also know uh that folks that choose not to be vaccinated 98 of the covet cases that we're seeing today um are are the folks that are not vaccinated and i actually got the stats as we were talking um of the covet 19 cases in hawaii today 84 of them um are our rs local residents uh only 14 are related in one way shape or form the travel and tourism and many of those are returning residents um 99.5 of deaths from covet 19 are in the unvaccinated so that it's it's completely clear um that that vaccinations do protect uh from from uh coveted 19 and the more people that are vaccinated the less we need to worry about covid19 returning um or or or going back to where we were just a few months ago now sometimes people say well what about the risk and i i'm not gonna i'm not gonna trigger quote it um the disclosures on the vaccinations do not give anybody 100 assurance of no side effects uh but the clear evidence now at this point uh given the the millions of vaccinations given uh is that is that whatever effects there are very very minimal and in many cases very mild um but i would ask you the basic question what is the risk to you of the vaccination of getting vaccinated and thereby getting protected comparing that risk to the risk of getting covet 19. we know that cova-19 is a very terrible situation to be in with long-term effects so i would say that risk is worth it under the circumstances now take it from a mandatory perspective first of all when you use the word mandatory i think what you are saying is that that your government is going to show up at your door with a needle and force you to put it in your arm nobody has said that nobody has said that um and no um there is no initiative to do that but is it fair uh to to expect somebody that works in a public place uh who is in a public place um to either be vaccinated to protect him or herself and everybody else in that space and or if they don't want to get vaccinated to be untested to make sure that they're negative for covet 19 on a very frequent basis uh let's let's talk about uh guards in in prisons let's talk about service members on an aircraft carrier let's talk about teachers in a school i think that that is a reasonable thing for us all to expect at this point and we have to we have to go in that direction because otherwise we're not going to be able to get to the point where covet 19 is not um infecting over 600 of us every day and right here in hawaii um so so my answer to you is that i i support the initiatives from the president the governor and the mayors to require either vaccinations or or frequent tests in in many parts of uh at least the workplace um as a condition of of going into that that workplace but no i don't i don't um i don't support anybody uh forcing you uh to against your will to get vaccinated although i think you should get vaccinated and i have been vaccinated as has my family how are you okay i'm gonna i want to tie it up with three things um and i'll take two i'll do two questions that i think are really important one of them has to do with healthcare a question was having access to quality health insurance is critical particularly for cancer patients and survivors i'm so happy that congress increased subsidies earlier this year so more people can better afford marketplace plans four out of five people cannot buy a plan for less than ten dollars a month however i know those expanded subsidies are scheduled to end in 2022 which is would you support making these expanded subsidies permanent so more people have access to affordable comprehensive health insurance thank you for that question my answer is yes and in fact i am willing to go further i believe that health care is a human right not a not a privilege and it's why i am a strong supporter and co-sponsor of medicare for all one of the things that is coming before the the u.s house and is a um a priority issue for health care for the progressive caucus is three things one lowering the age of medicare so that more people can get medicare at an earlier age the second thing is and we must absolutely do this and that is to allow medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry just like our tricare and medic military healthcare um programming systems are able to um negotiate and set those drug prices um for prescription drugs and the third thing is to include dental and vision into those health care plans and so these are things that are really important i hope we can accomplish them in this congress but uh expanding health care to every american in this country so that it is accessible to everyone is something that i'm a i'm a big proponent of will we get there in 117 congress in terms of medicare for all i just don't think the numbers are there right now for that but it doesn't mean we can't uh keep talking about it keep educating people about really what that means and hopefully um you know through advocacy and hard work we can get there one day um second thing i want to talk about uh is the here on hawaii island someone asked about the hawaii island brush fires and what has my office done for the working together with the county to address the brush fires in waikiki and puapo in waikoloa village first of all my office had a in-person representative in the hawaii county emergency management agency from this weekend working together with local firefighters uh the military at pohakaloa community volunteers and other agencies to address the fires that were very destructive and could have been very very much more destructive had those fires reached the village of waikala but beyond that we've been working together in the last 48 hours with the usda and working on the disaster assistance programs we're looking to host a community town hall with the usda as early as monday so that we can make sure that people can get that we're affected by the fire can get the disaster assistance programs we're also working together with some of the um i guess ranches and individuals that lost livestock or have or lost grazing areas so that we can move those affected cattle to other areas uh so that they can graze and so we're we're really working hard right now and uh and i just want to mahalo uh everyone in the colony of hawaii and the firemen and the families and uh individuals that worked really hard to put those fires out and and there are still fires in in the um in this area um it's about 95 put out but it's not 100 put out and there are people still up there right now um working to to put those fires out so i just want to hello everyone for your hard work through the course of the weekend and the final thing i want to talk about congressman case talked about the um uh you know the mandatory vaccinations um and covet 19 i'm going to circle back to covet 19 and i want to just quickly address uh the eviction moratorium um for renters you know there are two things happening right now there is a federal eviction moratorium that has been extended by the cdc for uh those tenants that qualify um and that has been extended to october 3rd there's some confusion in regards to what localities and areas qualify or don't qualify there's a pretty complex complicated metrics to figure that out part of it is looking at the seven-day case rate and the nucleic acid positivity rates but what i can tell you is that we have been my office has been in touch with the cdc and that they have advised us the centers for disease control has advised my office that every county in the state of hawaii qualifies we have not received that in writing yet as of tonight thursday night but verbally they have conveyed the cdc has conveyed that every county in the state of hawaii will qualify under the federal eviction moratorium that has been extended to october 3rd if you qualify and so part of it is looking at that 19 page document to determine if you qualify but we we haven't received any writing yet but the cdc has verbally conveyed that to myself the second piece is governor ige's state eviction moratorium which ends this weekend that is separate from the federal eviction moratorium so there may be individuals that would have qualified for the eviction moratorium under the state eviction order that may not qualify this weekend when that eviction order comes to an end and my office is working uh has reached out to the governor's office um to figure out one you know is extending that eviction moratorium at the state side of the house something the governor would consider to align with the federal eviction moratorium that is now extended to october 3rd again for those that qualify but more importantly is how can we get the american rescue plan federal funding that we appropriated to the states and county governments to the tune of of about 120 million dollars that as of just a few weeks ago less than four million dollars has been allocated or distributed per the u.s department of treasury and so you know what is more important to me is that our state and our county governments are able to distribute um those federal funds for rental relief uh for tenants and more importantly to make sure that landlords are made whole from from uh rent that uh has not uh previously been paid because of the covet 19 pandemic so i know it's a question that that we're asking uh at the federal level is how can we help get uh the counties and states to expedite the releasing of those funds um and and so that we can make landlords whole and make sure that tenants can continue to stay in their homes right now with the delta variant you know ravaging the country and covet 19 cases at the highest levels they've ever been this is not the time uh to be putting people out on the street and to be evicted people what we need to do is push as much money out before the moratorium ends and to keep people in their homes we don't want people going out into areas that have high rates of covet we don't want them living in uh communities or in areas where they're crowded or there's high congregation areas shared living areas or in a worst case scenario an unsheltered uh homeless or houseless situation so you know that's my update as far as the eviction moratorium and i i wanted to make sure that that was clear um congressman case back to you okay well thank you so much first of all i just want to endorse everything that congressman kelly just said about the eviction moratorium i think he described it exactly right and unfortunately his descriptions includes a fair bit of uncertainty as we have all had to deal with confusion over the last couple of days stretching into the last week i think the main thing i i would say to everybody in addition um is is simply call us contact us if you have any questions we'll try to get you the answers if we don't have them we'll tell you uh but um we can at least try to answer your individual questions and so on that note um i will um have my closing remarks and then turn it back to youkai to close it um it's been a great um a great um honor to to continue to represent you in the 117th congress it is a very very difficult congress as as as you know uh because of covet 19 and the many other issues that we face um but the bottom line is uh we're still uh here as your two u.s representatives uh we're still here to try to help our country with the national issues that uh that we that we need to contribute to sound national uh decisions uh whether it be there be in our country or overseas uh we're still here uh to try to make sure our federal government works for us uh here in hawaii whether it be appropriations or anything else uh and we are still here to help you with your individual concerns and all of that takes us uh staying in touch with you uh this is one way uh that we try to stay in touch with you we hope you we hope you learned something and and and and perhaps had some appreciation of what we um are are all about um in our jobs on your behalf uh many of the questions i don't think were answered i have a couple left on my list but still please uh contact me through case.house.gov that's the easiest way case.house.gov uh to send in your questions we'll get them answered or to ask for whatever follow-up you think is needed or or to ask for assistance and so with that i thank you for listening tonight and i'll i'll turn it over to my colleague uh same here you know all our time uh tonight has come to an end i i really appreciate congressman case and the opportunity to you know partner with you and be your partner in the house uh i also want to thank both of our staffs for putting this uh town hall together working behind the scenes to make it happen and as you mentioned we weren't able to answer every single question there but what i can promise every individual uh that made a comment is we're going to go through every single one of your comments we're going to pull your question out at least at least i'm sure congressman case is off as well as what i want to speak for him but we will go through all of your comments we'll turn those into questions and we will do our best to uh respond to you i guess we would just need the email to respond to so if you can send an email to our office tonight and you can just put your email on there and we'll be happy to uh respond to you but you can also contact our district office in hilo at 808 746 6220 uh if you can leave your first name your last name said you may say you made a comment and leave your email address and that's probably the best way that we can get back to you um again i want to say mahalo nui law to um you know everyone that uh joined this uh town hall tonight and um i look forward to doing more of these and um just you know thanks so much congressman case and for all of you that shared this evening with us and uh to everybody that tuned in online um again you know thank you so much for giving us your time this evening and i look forward to hopefully seeing you in person one day at a community town hall meeting um or on another uh talk story that that we'll do uh maybe sometime uh this fall so thank you so much and i guess what is it 8 12 in the evening and i'm going to uh jump onto the kailua neighborhood board and they hope hopefully they haven't got to the agenda item yet and i can give my legislative update for the kylo neighborhood board but again thank you so much everyone and

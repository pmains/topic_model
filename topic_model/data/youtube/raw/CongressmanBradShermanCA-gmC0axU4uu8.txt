now Donald Trump supporter former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Democratic congressman brad Sherman who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee thanks to both of you congressman Sherman you heard John McCain Barack Obama is directly responsible for it he may now parse words of the word personally versus directly but he said what he said he stands by that part directly responsible fair outrageous the fact is it is the Maliki government installed by george w bush with the advice of john mccain that caused isis to be created they're the they're incredible level of corruption sent a well-equipped army to the north of iraq and gave all those weapons to Isis because he didn't bother to pay the soldiers they stole the money for themselves Maliki was installed by george w bush and he created an anti sunni incredibly corrupt and oppressive regime which gave us isis today and then not only did they run away from their weapons they ran away from the mosel bank and in just a few days isis became the most richest anti best armed terrorist organization all because of the government we installed in baghdad under the bush administration is that they got okay so you're saying it's outrageous but Governor Brewer you know President Obama is saying something very different about where the blame lies at let me tell you a little bit here's what he said today about that those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault one the motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newton but the instruments of death were so similar the other Brewer does he have a point there that guns are to blame if there had not been a rifle involved with this shooting that many many fewer people would have died I'm a little bit amused by this discussion given the fact that John McCain clarified his statement you know as a politician sometimes on the spur of the moment we say things but he did walk back his comment that it wasn't president personally the personally I directed I mean you can call that a walk hold of X I can call that a walk but but he didn't take away what he said that he's directly responsible I mean directly or personally I mean it is it's equally awful to say but i think you know it's based on his security advisors the people that are making the the directions of the country of how we're going to fight this battle this war on Isis and in regards to the shooting in orlando I you know I heard part of his speech today when he was down there and you played a piece of it for me and it's a tough thing to do to go down there and talk about it but I wish that we could at least have one day to the country over America we could weep for this horrible tragedy together without politicizing it and blaming it all on gun control it just seems outrageous to me that that's where it always wants to go where these things always want to go instead of laying the blame at the feet of the people who have done this obviously he pledged his support to Isis and we ought to be as Americans and as our government and their decision policymakers we ought to be over there fighting them on their territory isn't though let me just actually okay you're fully ensure that they'll come into our country congressman isn't though what John McCain did also politicizing this in terms of Barack Obama's directly responsible whether he's talking about his foreign policy so what isn't that politicizing it the president's initial comments I think were the right comments of grieving and he did state that this was an act of hate and an act of terrorism I think we all agree on that but then Trump went absolutely wild in in just a few hours after this event took place and that has unfortunately crowded out which should be the sorrow of this nation for 49 people killed and over 50 injured but now that we're discussing all this the fact is there's only one thing we can be certain about Barack Obama's policies and in Iraq and that is prior those policies we were losing hundreds and thousands of our greatest every year and now we're not all right i want to give Governor Brewer a chance to respond to what you said though Governor Brewer as a supporter of Donald Trump do you think he took it too far when he said things like look we're led by a man that either isn't tough or smart not smart or is something else in mind when he's talking about this act of terror where the implication multiple times was that he sympathized with the terrorists in some way do you think that he took it too far governor I believe that he is not speaking forthright to us as trying to always soften the subject matter of where we're at in America today in regards to this terrorist radical Islamic terrorist situation that we're facing here the people of America are fearful they want to see us to be America again and and the bottom line is is that they don't believe that our federal government is protecting us all right thank you both very much I appreciate your time tonight

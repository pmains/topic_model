mr. president I rise today with two of our colleagues senator Markey and Senator Jeff Merkley to reflect on the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that concluded just this last weekend in the country of Poland it's important the conference which is better known as cop 24 COP cop 24 which I believe refers to conference of parties 24 met there for the past and I think they've been doing that for 24 years but met there for two weeks as leaders from nearly 200 nations work to reach agreement on how the world our world will actually implement the Paris climate agreement the the stakes could not be higher mr. president I'm not one as my colleagues know I'm not one giving to hyperbole but the future of our planet and the future of our children and our grandchildren may well hang in the balance was it a positive step forward that the international community could come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change on a global scale by finally beginning to implement the Paris agreements yes it was but having said that this agreement is not perfect they know we know it no one's pretending that it is it falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the IPCC determined just one month ago are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade the entire world needs to do even more to address this problem that includes setting much more aggressive emissions targets going forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead while we certainly can and should be doing more though this agreement is cause for a hope that bolder future agreements are achievable but reaching bolder future agreements mr. president is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world after all leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or any endeavor and that includes saving this planet unfortunately our president along with many and his administration continued to reject climate science and deny the reality and the magnitude of the challenges that we're facing well mr. president here's the reality according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration the u.s. experienced 16 extreme weather related disasters in 2017 that exceeded 1 billion dollars apiece in the past year alone Americans paid three hundred and six billion dollars in damages due to storm surges flooding wildfires crop freezes and droughts a new record 13 of our nation's leading scientific federal agencies recently reported to us in the National Climate Assessment that if we do nothing to address our carbon emissions today's extreme weather related events will pale in comparison pale in comparison to what lies ahead here's a sampling and while we can look forward to if we do nothing if we don't do enough in the future we can continue to expect rainfall where participation is measured by the foot not by the inch we can continue to expect more wildfires and places out west burning areas larger than my home state of Delaware and we can continue expect extreme flooding to devastate communities like Ellicott City Maryland not too far from here which has been hit by not one but two 1000 year floods in the past two years alone think about that too in the past two years alone somebody asked me the other day what is a thousand-year flood well that's something that's supposed to happen no more than once every 1,000 years we've seen - now they've seen two of them in Ellicott City in the past two years mr. president one of the most amenable Alaric's for my yoke then maybe from some of the others in this chamber come from a guy named Stephen Stills I described him as a california-based climatologist he's not he's a singer-songwriter from Buffalo stream field above Buffalo Springfield Fame and Crosby Stills Nash and young he watched the load that rohtul Erica goes here goes against some Isis is something's happening here just what it is ain't exactly clear think about that that's why you're over something's happening here just what is ain't exactly clear well make no mistake something is happening here and what is happening here is exactly clear what's also clear is that there's still time to do something about it while actually fostering economic growth in the US and beyond our borders let me say that again here's the good news what's also clear is that there's still time to do something about it while actually fostering economic growth in the US and beyond our borders climate science isn't part of some grand hopes if this isn't some little Arminius alarmist prediction it doesn't come from some left-leaning organization it doesn't come from talk radio the truth of the matter is that it comes directly from our nation's leading scientists and from leading scientists around the world let me also remind our colleagues at the National Climate Assessment is not developed a direction our whim of any one person or any one administration it was Congress it was Congress that passed a law mandating that the National Climate Assessment be presented every four years we did it Congress did it that law was called the global change research Act of 1990 it passed this United States Senate in 1990 unanimously was signed into law by the late President George Herbert Walker Bush a Republican our nation's leading scientists warned us yet again less than a month ago that if we fail to start seriously reducing carbon emissions now by the end of the century we may well be witnessing the following tale of Horrible's here's a chart first one deals with sea-level rise six feet since the 1990s a lot since 1993 three inches compared to what we've experienced in the last one would ever be 25 years there's a heck of a lot we would expect if it does go to six feet and sea level rise some three point six trillion dollars in cumulative damages to the US coastal properties and infrastructure most of our East Coast a lot of it would be underwater a lot of will be underwater including about maybe parts of the laws lying state in America which is Delaware our next chart talks about annual economic losses of up to 500 billion dollars annual economic damages by 2090 not cumulative but every year a half trillion dollars a year in economic damages we have another chart here that speaks to gross domestic product you may recall when we followed a Great Recession a little around 10 years ago the worst recession since the Great Depression we saw GDP growth losses rather GDP growth of oh just over 4% it was horrible it was terrible banks stopped lending money unemployment rate was about 10 percent or more people couldn't get loans for anything and that's where we were if these estimates from some of the best smartest scientists in the world are correct it's not going to be license of 4.2% we'll be looking at 10% by 2100 no no member of this Senate is going to be around then but these pages sitting down here they will be a lot of them will be and our sons and grandsons and granddaughters they may well be around to yet as the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these effects of climate changes the Trump administration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies the administration this administration is also attempting to discredit the recent science reports by pushing talking points from well-known climate deniers here's the good news but Americans are not following or not rather Americans are not falling for these tricks anymore Americans are witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change and their communities every day they want action anyway they want us to be part of that action so it is a business community and while this administration sits on his hands American businesses are actually stepping up in a big way to combat the effects of climate change many businesses stand ready to do even more and they're looking to us here in our nation's capital for vice and leadership to our international friends who around the world are wondering where our nation is on this climate change and on climate change I just want to say to those folks that speaking on behalf of the majority not just of Delawareans but Americans we're with you we are with you we support the club Paris climate agreement we want to reduce carbon emissions because we're convinced that doing so will enable us to save our planet and create jobs a lot of them this is not a democrat or republican issue this is not a blue state or red state issue it affects us all and if you think that climate change hasn't reached your state yet the science is clear that eventually it will well luckily for us young people are leading the call for action climate change or environmental issues or environmental issues are often mistakenly forgotten when we discuss domestic issues and today's new cycle especially under this administration it doesn't always make headlines it's oftentimes been said their climate changes and it is not an issue that drives Americans to the pole well mr. president I think that's changing young people have led the way in changing our country before I remember when I was your age I say to our pages in the 1950s that we led the decades-long civil rights movement for equal rights for every American under the law it was young activists who made clear their opposition to the Vietnam War back in the 1970s when I was actually serving during the Vietnam War as a naval flight officer young people pushed hard for strong environmental standards when the Cuyahoga River just north of its in Cleveland once through Cleveland but just north of Ohio State where I went to school was on fire yeah at the same time we had shores of our country littered with garbage well our country is back at another one of those make-or-break moments in our history we need the energy of Americans of all ages young or old to make sure we don't blow it and we need to listen to them all especially to our younger Americans this generation of young Americans and after all we think about they should be energized by this it's their planet and it's their future when it comes to global challenges such as terrorism and cyber attacks the u.s. doesn't sit back and wait for someone else to leave the way we step up and we lead we have many dogs in this fight many dogs in this fight some big ones and some not so big ones we got a lot of dogs in this flame we got a lot at stake unfortunately acting sooner rather than on climate change rather than later on climate change brings with it a number of positives we can put our country on course to reduce emissions while growing our economy I keep coming back to this theme and it's important thing we could put our country on a course to reduce emissions and grow our economy the two are not mutually exclusive I don't care what some people would say and that was believed in fact quite the opposite they are not mutually exclusive what we can and should be doing is using our energy and resources to foster new economic opportunities for communities that may depend it today on the old world order in 2017 nearly 3.2 million Americans were working in wind and solar energy efficiency and other climate energy jobs so year or two ago one of them was one of our sons our oldest son's you worked for six six years or so helping develop waste for large buildings all over the Northeast to conserve energy as is one of the jobs there were a lot more 3 million 3.2 million more more will fund more jobs will follow and it's incumbent on us to ensure that some of those new jobs go to people whose jobs are going away as we seek to reduce carbon emissions in this country and on our planet how would we feel if we're losing our job and it's the same time somebody three million people had died gained a job and that well how about me and I born in West Virginia dad was a coal miner for a while early in his life how about those people well we need to make sure that is so we make progress in reducing carbon emissions that the folks who lose their job but cause their livelihood because of the reduction of those carbon emissions that we don't forget then we reach back and help them - well let me just observe we don't have the luxury of waiting around we need to crank it up and when you did going and that's why as a senior Democrat on the right and ranking member the Committee on Environment and Public Works where I serve along with senators Markey and and Merkley and others I'm anxious to join them and helping lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate future and if we're honest with our children and our grandchildren we don't have any other choice mr. president it was my hope that on the world stage this week America's representative at cop 24 would make clear that our country is ready to lead by example unfortunately they apparently did not but that's no reason to despair we have the facts and I think we have the energy and the commitment on our side I want to leave our colleagues today with with this message climate action should not be an issue that divides us climate change climate action should not be an issue that divides us it should be an issue that unites us it should night not just this country but the entire global community in our world could definitely use a little uniting these days so could our country years from now when my sons are I should say our sons my wife and our sons our sons our children are dealing with you Nevel consequences of failure to address climate change if we do fail but they'll be a day when they it might come to me or frankly to any of us and say well you were a United States Senator you were a United States Senator weren't you grandpa what did you do when you had the chance to do something about this impending disaster when there was still time what did you do what did you do about it and we should all want to be able to say the same thing I work tirelessly I work tirelessly we want reminding warning my colleagues pushing our colleagues that we moved heaven and earth to make sure that future generations would and would inherit could insurance could inherit a safe a healthy planet one where their dreams and aspirations could be realized and not destroyed or my colleagues and I especially senator Markey senator Merkley today are on the floor to make clear that the overwhelming majority of Americans stand with almost every other nation in the world on this issue we need to act we need to act now time is not on our side let's seize the day carpe diem let's seize the day and I'm happy to yield the floor

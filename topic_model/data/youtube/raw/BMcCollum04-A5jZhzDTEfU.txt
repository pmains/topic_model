Speaker I rise in opposition to this continuing resolution the federal government's fiscal year started three months ago Republican Congress still hasn't passed a full year of federal spending rather than protecting our nation and meeting the needs of the American people we are now debating a third continuing resolution to kick the can into January Republicans control this house the Senate and the White House but clearly they do not take their responsibility to fund the federal government seriously frankly they should be embarrassed for the past three months Democrats have sought to work with Republicans to secure a budget agreement and responsibly pass appropriation bills but Republicans have been too busy to meet this basic responsibility instead they've spent months working in secret on their deficit busting tax scam let's be clear the Republican tax scam is part of this CR as well the CR contains language to exempt the Republicans lavish tax cuts for big corporations and billionaires from the statutory pay-as-you-go Act Republicans pass their tax scam knowing it was fiscally irresponsible and that it would trigger cuts to Medicare the Crime Victims Fund and other vital programs and trigger an increase in to the federal student loans now they're asking Democrats to help bail them out well I didn't vote for the Republican tax scam and I'm not going to paper over their mistakes so the President Trump can sign it into law but here's what I will do mr. speaker as a ranking member of the interior environment Appropriations Subcommittee I know Republican appropriators are as frustrated as I am and I want to work with them to find common ground and to responsibly fund our government it's time for appropriators to do our job Republicans and Democrats to work together it is time for us to get back to work and fund the federal government responsibly mr. Speaker I yield back gentleman

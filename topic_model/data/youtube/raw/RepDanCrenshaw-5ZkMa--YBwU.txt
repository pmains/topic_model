we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks to the greatest policy podcast in america uh we have had some don't slap all right one of my favorite doctors in america is with me dr reynolds delgado he's been on the show before doctor thank you so much for for being back on local houston hero look saving patients every day not just covered patients but all kinds of patients um we'll get into some really interesting things you've done on lung transplants uh with uh with fatal covid patients and saved all six you said that's amazing so i wanna we'll talk about that i wanna give everybody a quick overview of what we're dealing with on kovid reason we're doing this podcast you know a big announcement from the cdc last week um basically telling us what every common sense person knew already if you're vaccinated you don't have to wear a mask around others we'll get into that in the politics surrounding it i want to give everybody a quick update on what's going on in texas [Music] governor abbott announced zero covet related deaths reported yesterday that's pretty great uh fewest coveted cases in over 13 months lowest seven day covet positivity rate ever lowest covet hospitalizations in 11 months the downtrend continues hospital capacity is getting better and better we only have just under 12 percent of icu beds filled with coveted patients under 4 of the general beds are filled with covet patients new cases under 300 a day and what else should we say here yeah just generally decreasing and yet what's interesting in harris county we continue to be in a designated stay-home work safe designation which is the highest threat level our esteemed county judge lena hidalgo has kept the county on this level for the last year 12 months despite similar counties in texas uh changing their threat levels by the way this this means by definition according to her own designation that outbreaks are present and worsening of course this isn't true according to the metrics what's interesting about two about this this downtrend in texas is you know there was abbott made a big announcement i don't know what date was that i mean it wasn't long ago that texas was fully open but those of us who've been living in texas for the last six months know that um it was pretty open so it's it's i don't think a lot changed to be honest with uh was the mass mandates it look a lot of businesses still require masks i don't think there was a big change there that that is changing now only in the last week really but and as people get vaccinated more but um that downtrend was happening with or without the vaccine and i do want to kind of hit on that just theorize as to why that might be um yeah yeah well first of all thanks for having me again dan and we're all really gratified and happy that you're back in the saddle now and recovered from your recent issues yeah so i just wanted to mention that thanks again so yes uh so the curves in the hospital are flattening out and they're they're way down so there was a spike and then a second spike in their third spike and now we're way on a down slope here and so the icus are not filled with code patients and things are so this is the natural history of how viral flare-ups and burnouts occur this is just naturally how it occurs and uh and so this is fully expected and our ability to become normal is uh imminent you know i think and and already it has been in texas for a while as you say so the the vaccines so around a third of the u.s population is vaccinated 41 percent here in houston uh there's another third or so of the population that has immunity by whatever means they were in contact and and so there's a growing smaller percentage of people that have no immunity and are just now uh you know our general adverseness to being all together in big crowds put all that together and basically you know this is a problem that's going away yeah maybe just mathematically speaking and um it's it has to go away at a certain point just just by the science and the math there's clearly those in the in the political arena and certainly in the media that never want it to go away and that's what's been so mind-blowing to me um about the reaction to the to the cdc director's announcement um she was like i so i was on meet the press this weekend and um always a combative show especially for republicans but i didn't but i was on and i listened to the entire interview between chuck todd and um and uh dr wolenski the head of the cdc and it was extremely combative you know and she's and they're on the same team in theory and what struck me as odd about that interview was look when the cdc director says hey guys guess what you don't have to wear a mask anymore if you're vaccinated a lot of us with common sense we're looking at her like wait you were wearing a mask after you got vaccinated like like you know because i remember look i remember when when like when the um when the guidance was like wear a mask if you can't socially distance like all right that makes sense if you're gonna be close talking somebody you know and you don't know if you're if you're virulent or not then then um maybe wear a mask right that makes sense you know three to six feet was this that's what the science said if we're for quote-unquote listening to the science three to six feet and then that quickly became wear a mask if if if you're living in civilization at all times you know if you're alone walking your dog in the park you better wear that mask i don't think houstonians ever agreed to that nonsense i rarely ever saw that but uh but i also travel between here in dc all the time and i'll tell you what in dc right at this moment there are people alone in a park wearing a mask right a hundred percent so and they're listening to the science at least they believe they are so this is very odd anyway that was my reaction to the cdc director but chuck taught out a totally different reaction his his reaction was wait a second you you said you said don't do this three days ago how do you know people are vaccinated what are we gonna do i mean they were they took the opposite approach they think the cdc is being extreme and there's so many statements like this from the press look at uh leanna wen cnn contributor former head of planned parenthood she says the cdc's new guidance has devolved into a giant mess it was a major blunder to seed responsibility effectively ending mass mandates it's not just about science it's a major policy decision that the president himself should have made i we love that statement because it's like wait a second i thought you're supposed to listen to the science not politicians because under trump you weren't allowed to listen to trump you know you had to listen to the science um you know uh on the press kept asking uh rachelle willenska head of the cdc who's supposed to be the vaccination police how do you know and the cdc director said rightfully we're asking people to take their health into their own hands get vaccinated if they don't they'll continue to be at risk i've been saying that for over a year i think that's absolutely right i just i'm not sure where this finally came from the other one i want to point out this isn't this one's really infuriating it's one of the reasons we've lost trust in dr fauci um he he came out with dr wolinski and said yes you don't have to wear masks if you've been vaccinated and then a day later he says quote he referring to senator rand paul because those two man that's like america's greatest couple right now um he senator rand paul was saying if you've been infected or or you've been vaccinated don't wear a mask which is completely against all public health tenants fauci continued so he's dead wrong i mean i don't even think personally against him yeah you do but he's just quite frankly incorrect okay so dr fauci you've contradicted yourself yet again over and over i mean where does this where does this come from well it's all about social engineering and you know whether or not the government and elected officials and then government officials really should be in the business of trying to socially engineer or fool people and doing things yeah and uh and i know where you stand on this and i understand in the same way i mean as soon as you start down that road you're on a slippery slope towards losing all kinds of civil liberties so it's so important not to for the government and and people like fauci who's who is a government official to uh to not try to fool people but rather educate people give us all the facts this is this is why i lost trust with fauci over time um he definitely tried to manipulate people and he admitted it later you know telling people not to get masks at first having people like me repeat that you know and then i get yelled at later right i'm like look i was just saying what dr fauci said then it turns out later he's like well i just didn't want you guys to go buy him because i wanted to save him for health care professionals just tell us that we're adults because that's a very reasonable thing to say we're not even because look the science back then said and you know maybe it still does we're not even sure if these work we think they might within three to six feet it's a good precaution but honestly care professionals need them more so save them for them that's a very honest thing to say and perfectly reasonable thing to say well just say it the other thing he lost my trust when he refused to contextualize any of his comments you know when he would come out and say look if you're 15 you could die but that's true but like the probability of dying is less than if you get the flu if you're if you're under 20 years old so you know contextualize it be a good be a good scientist instead of a propagandist well and a doctor i mean he is a physician and you know as physicians that's one thing we do is we don't um we don't uh do what's called paternalism basically or we're trying to fool and take care of our patients as if they were children you know we we give them the facts and let them make informed decisions and that's that's how a doctor and i think that's how someone in fouchy's position should do it yeah and that makes a lot of a lot more sense um can we theorize a little bit what's your take on we touched on a little bit but just the the natural progression of a wave of a trend um and in texas in particular look i mean my my layman's theory on this is that we've reached a point of infection rate or and therefore immunity in the population where just mathematically speaking it would be very hard to increase cases you know it's not quite hurt immunity i don't think that's the right term for it but it's a bit of a burnout if you will i think that's a better way to think of it and as a burnout and the flattening of the curve that really is is is going to be a terminal flat in other words it's going to continue to flatten until something new happens now what is that new well maybe a variant um but but i i don't see another spike yeah that way and and talk to us about the nature of viruses a little bit we've talked about this in the past but i want you to repeat it um how how they evolve why the death rates might have been more severe at first and how later strains change yeah this is really interesting because you know viruses follow the principles of natural selection okay so there's this this really great old einstein quote it's god is subtle but not capricious and the relevance is that these viruses aren't trying to fool us it's not trying to trick us it doesn't have some mind of its own it's just trying to survive yeah right so the virus is just trying to survive right and so the survival of the fittest so the fittest viruses will continue to go on and infect people and go throughout the population and the less fit ones will not and so it evolves very frequently in fact it evolves from city to city you can actually tell by doing gene sequencing on the viruses and people in one city in another city and tell which city infected what city so it evolves a lot uh frequently and during this evolution the the spike protein which is the protein that our immune system reacts against changes subtly and as those changes occur um your immunity that you had in the past becomes a little less effective now if you still have immunity from the past then it's somewhat effective so it's less chance you're going to get really sick if you get this new variant but that's how it works and that's how the variants work and that's why we need to not get crazy out of control afraid of these variants the variance that's a natural phenomena is supposed to happen it's going to evolve towards being more communicable yes but less virulent and it's it gets to this example in singapore um they're on lockdown again i mean indoor dining suspended immediately trouble the travel bubbles whatever all these things even though they have a 22 fully vaccinated you know you've got um certain fear porn epidemiologists claiming there's a surge uh they were fact checked by nate silver on twitter as he shows an actual graph of uh new cases uh that you know there's no surge and they're they're freaking out because of this barium but as you say there's no indication that these variants are are as dangerous as these again let's call them the fear-porn doctors or fear porn health officials would like us to believe and we need to get to a point where we start looking at this disease a little bit more rationally right and the way i like to think of it is looking at it more like the flu and so the the principles by which it evolves are similar to the principles by which the flu has evolved over time and uh we need to look at it more like the flu and get to where we are societally dealing with it like we deal with the flu so ultimately i'd like to see very soon hopefully where it's just a once a year booster for those at risk just like we do for the flu and that booster is taken from very heavily populated areas of the world usually asia-pacific area you take the strains there you make your vaccine out of them you get people vaccinated in the fall and then you go about your life and and you vaccinate those that need it of course healthcare workers and elderly etc and so i think that's where we're going to be going with this and uh history is on my side and that thought and natural selection and science of uh how the flu and other uh uh viral infections have gone it it makes this the most likely scenario for the future now is it possible that one of these variants will flare up and become super ver virulent and because it is possible yes but it is very unlikely yeah tell us about um you know in these worst cases where you actually uh did a lung transplant is that uh unique to houston or in your practice yeah right yeah so there's been very few well so you know we're blessed in this city in houston to have the world's greatest medical center and um and of course i biasly believe that i work at the world's greatest cardiovascular hospital baylor st luke's texas heart institute and so we did six successful lung transplants uh for patients for coed so these are covered patients on ecmo which means the full support you know full definitely dead unless we do something uh dramatic and so we we pulled off six successful lung transplants for that and i want to put my hats out to dr gabriel luer one of my colleagues who's a lung transplant surgeon a very talented young surgeon who pulled this off and and the rest of our team at baylor st luke's for that and it just goes to show you that you know we have the capability to beat this on many fronts and then later we can talk about uh some new meds coming online and things like that and and again the evolution of the vaccine the vaccine will be evolving to take into account the variables over time just like the flu vaccine does well that's important to note about new meds and all that is is our ability to treat this is it's it's like we're in a totally different universe than a year ago right yeah just dexamethasone alone made a huge difference yeah just that alone so yeah we're we're far better now um is there anything is there anything you take issue with in the cdc guidance i mean you've got you've got it in front of you here um were you just as surprised as i was that it took this long to to come out with this yes yes and just the comments made prior yeah it makes you wonder if if they weren't getting some kind of heat to come out of this before summer vacation yeah like from people like me you know because because we're just like what the hell are you guys talking about i mean yeah it's and i think it that's why it reeks of political decision to make well yeah the other part of that is is vaccine versus non-vaccine so that completely polarizes people so if you're vaccine you get all the green smiley faces if you're not vaccinated you get all the red and yellow frowny faces with masks on yeah and they're nice tigers can't do anything yeah and so it's really creating a a a polarization and you know so yeah one step away from people having to wear some kind of armband that says there they they keep pushing for that and like i get asked about it a lot from constituents and i'm like don't worry don't worry and and i do mean that i look i know they talk about it a lot i don't see how that would ever happen right i mean it constitutionally practically i don't i honestly don't see it and and i encourage people not to not to freak out too much about it but it doesn't mean that the left doesn't want it right you got rachel maddow who's quoted saying uh something like i have to train myself not to see unmasked people as some kind of enemy or danger right i'm like you have a you are a pathological thinker if that's if that's how you've been this entire time there's something wrong with you rachel right like something deeply deeply wrong with you and this is and again like just in dc i'm telling you people look at you like you're a bad bad person if you're walking alone on the sidewalk with no mask now what's interesting about a place like washington dc is um this is a highly educated a lot of people have a lot of master's degrees so they're supposed to be the smart ones who understand how to interpret data and science and it's completely the opposite because the science does not say that there's any transmission outside in you know unless you're like breathing into somebody's face i mean it's like less than one percent um so the the the the misinformation campaigns run by the media so absurd they got a joe scarborough mika brzezinski um on on morning joe saying they'll keep wearing masks on airplanes despite being vaccinated just makes good common sense it doesn't make good common sense you know say because you're scared i mean give us a different explanation besides that's common sense because it's the opposite of common sense this isn't true and if it it's just just based on infection rates based on case levels based on the fact that an airplane has turned out to be one of the safest places to be just because of of how often the air recirculates so i'm so sick of the misinformation and they're just never called out on it well i'm not going to try to apply logic to those that would do that that would create non-mask shaming now the great shakespeare quote seek not logic where none dwells but you know the fact is that we cannot go down that road where people are having to wear a scarlet letter of whether or not they've been vaccinated or not that's simple uh simply just too far to go as far as limitations civil liberties and and slippery slope there and there's just we just can't do that so somehow we got to get out of that mindset and the only way to do that is going to be from uh the leadership from on on high it's got to come from you know from the administration from our elected leaders and they need to get us out of that this kind of discriminatory thinking um otherwise otherwise think about this i mean it's all these private institution restaurants in two weeks i'm going to the indy 500 i was invited to go to the indy 500 and sit in this wonderful box seats you know and so i you know they sent me an email telling me your tickets are on the way oh by the way will you please send me a picture of your vaccine card before we send your tickets you know so it's it's starting i mean it's yeah you know vaccine discrimination it is and it's what blows my mind about it it's like if you're if you're not vaccinated it's your risk which has always been my opinion on on the virus the entire time i understand that there's you know at the broader level there there is a concern about hospitals being overrun but in the grand scheme of things and the data shows this and very clearly over the past year the virus runs its course basically no matter what you do study after study after study has shown that lockdowns do not have a correlation with or any effect on the trends of the virus the area under under the curve is always the same again i i do understand that you have to apply that to your hospital capacity but it seems to me it seems very very obvious to me that if we were to learn any lessons from this and unfortunately there's an entire side of the country that doesn't want to learn lessons from this but if we were if we were to objectively learn lessons from this it seems to me that the best application of our resources and our efforts in a future pandemic would be increasing capacity at the health care level as opposed to trying to control a natural spread of a virus we have proven completely ineffective in controlling it around the world we've we've proven completely ineffective and never before in human history have we even tried because we know it's stupid right but for some reason in the year 2020 at the pinnacle of modern civilization we thought we could and we failed and we do acknowledge that failure and acknowledge that it's impossible and that a better use of our resources would be to continue to create and generate wealth by not destroying our businesses and our economy and then use that wealth to like we did some things right like operation warp speed increase hospital capacity here in houston we were a little freaked out we needed we opened up an entire stadium for hospital capacity we never used it never needed it but that was the right move you know that's a good investment of money in my opinion in the face of a pandemic um you know we sent hospital ships to new york never needed them right but but that's the right kind of thinking yeah i think two two things i would say one is we we need to be prepared for the next go round uh when and if something like this happens in the future and and have the ability to ramp up capabilities to take care of it uh but you know number one and most important is we got to get back to normal getting back to normal means treating this like we treat the flu within a year i'd like to see that happening that's number one because if not the the damage to society is serious and deep and number two be prepared for the next go-round if it occurs and it's unlikely to occur again as natural selection tells us it's gonna it's it's gonna be more prevalent but less virulent so unlikely but be prepared but number three i think there's a third important one and it is learn some lessons learn some lessons so what is the lesson that we have learned from this well besides not eating bats perhaps we need to look into this whole issue of viral containment and how we study viruses yeah and this came up in the in our favorite couple dispute between dr fauci and rand paul right yeah right yeah so just you know just basically to say how this works is there's these labs known as bsl4 labs so biosafety level four labs and and they're all over the world there's nine in the united states there's uh 30-ish of them in the world and these labs study viruses of all types and there's this particular research going on within these labs including in wuhan called gain of function research so basically they manipulate the virus so that it is more powerful therefore using that more powerful version to study in animals and cell cultures and study drugs and whatnot and so you know this is we don't know for sure that this pandemic arose from such research we don't but we do now know that it's possible and given that possibility should we really be doing this type of research yeah and i think my my answer to that is well let's really rethink this maybe this is a lesson learned from all this and maybe the way to rethinking is is this the overall societal benefit of doing this gain of function research and keeping all these horrible pathogens in these labs worth the potential risk of it getting out and i think that argument was maybe reasonably possible to defend years and years ago i don't think so now why much of this research can now be done using computer modeling it's called in vitro versus in silico so in vitro's doing in a lab with actual virus in silico means doing computer modeling on in computers that can model they can take a dna sequence and model what the protein will look like and what the antigens and the antibody reaction interactions will look like and so much of this research can now be done with computer modeling second there are actual viruses in containment labs in parts of the world that have not infected a human being for decades smallpox is a great example and yet they still are in existence and i think that's a mistake yeah it's a mistake because obviously it's possible that it could get out and uh you think covet's bad boy smallpox is devastating it's horrible and and so smallpax exists in labs in the united states and in russia and i think that's a mistake and you know the scientists would say well what if we need to study at some future point well we now have the technology to gene sequence anything we want if we there is some random reason in the future why we somehow how need to study smallpox we can make it from scratch now so there is no need or reason to keep it in storage so dr faucio was wrong on that and senator rand paul was right senator rand paul i think you took your yeah oh yeah the gain of function research i think is is is is a really serious issue that it's a lesson that we need to learn from this whole thing uh that you know going forward will help us prevent future pandemics fundamentally what you're talking about is a it's a cost benefit analysis and i think what we need you know if i were to broaden what we need to learn it's the ability to analyze policy and situations with a cost-benefit analysis that's that's the learning lesson so whether it's whether there's too much risk in keeping diseases in labs perhaps there is and what's the benefit of that and if the benefit doesn't outweigh the risk of the cause the cost then don't do it um cost benefit analysis on lockdowns already went over that i've gone over that a billion times with this podcast uh but that's how you make policy decisions and there was this belief amongst the left it was just for some reason it became partisan it was exclusively amongst the left that the only pro that the only goal in policy was to reduce cases and that's not the only goal in policy there's balance there's a lot of factors there's costs there's benefits if the only goal was to reduce covet cases then by all means lock everybody in a room right like i mean you know you deal with all sorts of issues heart disease being still the number one killer of americans what would you tell americans if you didn't want there to be any more heart attacks i mean you you'd force us to eat and exercise a certain way you would force us right right but what are the costs of that and what else what's the practicality of it um you know it's i i just i i'm so blown away by the lack of critical thinking that occurred over the last year it blows me away and it makes me very sad and well the the that the damage to society of how we dealt with this pandemic has not fully been appreciated yet no uh there is deep seated damage to our economy to our society there's loss of entire industries there's um everything that goes along with that in in the psyche of society with depression and and homelessness and people destitute and such and and it's just that has not been appreciated it hasn't fully played out yet either no i still think you know we're probably heading for some sort of recession or something and so um that's something that was totally lost in the fervor of trying to stop all the cases and um and and you and i talked about this last summer when we did this podcast that very thing we predicted that even then yeah and um the one thing i couldn't predict was that this would continue after the election i mean a large part of me like i've analyzed the psychology of why people believe what they believe about covet and a part of me did believe they would it would at least change after the election because a large part of it was politically driven um but i guess the thing is is once you've once you've attached yourself to an ideology you can't let go and um there's a lot of people that love the idea of collectivism they love the idea of of everybody doing what they're told to do in it together it makes them feel like a tribe it's a very human thing to to want um it's as a conservative it's very anti-conservative we're much more individualistic and the more you try to tell us what to do the more it pisses us off yeah if you had just told asked us everybody to wear masks i don't think the mass controversy would be a thing everybody would be like that's not really a big deal worth a stupid mask you know but but you try to mandate it and it really irks people um you try to mandate vaccines it makes them think that you're hiding something and um well the whole collectivism versus individualism thing you cannot force that on people you just can't i mean it will backfire and history has taught us that so many times over and over again it's amazing we still have these discussions frankly and it's like look utopia's not possible it's a greek word for for no place like that's that's literally that what it what it means but there's a lot of people who still believe in it you wanted to talk about vaccines actually oh yeah yeah like you're pro vaccine you don't think they should be mandated but well no no no no it's not that i'm necessarily pro-vaccine i just think they're safe yeah and and just a quick explanation of that so that this is one area where we made a lot of predictions last summer when we did this podcast and and most of them were right including the variants coming around around the new year and all that stuff but one one thing i was i was wrong about is is how the efficacy of the vaccines i predicted around 50 in fact they're very very good 90 plus percent for that's unusual for vegetables yeah it's very unusual so most vaccines like the flu vaccines of the past were around 50 and so why is that so the reason is because of new tech basically the pfizer moderna are new tech brand new technology excuse me so old technology was you take the vat you take the virus you chop it up you distill it take the proteins out that you want and hope that a lot of other junk doesn't get in there with it and then you inject that people and they make antibodies the new tech is very cool actually you'd take a bit of the dna from the virus just a bit just the part that makes the spike protein and then you create rna from that so rna is just basically a photo a photo negative of it you take the rna from that and you give that rna to the to the person and then that rna gets into their cells and your own cells then take up that rna and then create the protein from scratch so it's very pure so really it's far purer than the old old tech and and it just gives you that spike protein and and so you produce it yourself so so you know so reactions are less uh like like um serum sickness reactions we call our your your immune system going overboard because there's a lot of impurities and this is very pure and so it is safer from that perspective now some will say oh can it give you some you're injecting this rna and could it mess with your dna and can it give you some kind of weird cancer some crazy thing in the future and we don't know years from now so what i would say to that is this new tech though it's new for viruses it has been used for other treatments of other diseases so for cancer chemotherapy immunotherapy and cancer it's been used for many many years so so there is some experience with the the messenger rna technology going back for other disease states so it's not entirely new so that hopefully but second is you're giving rna out dna so dna theoretically could you know mess with your dna but rna can't rna is the effect not the not the is the product not the uh yeah the source of the product so so it's not going to mess with your dna so you know basically it's it uh don't fear the the vaccines you know that our our biotech companies have done a great job here honestly that's uh maybe another uh the johnson johnson vaccine is the kind of old type of technology right yeah it's oldish so it's kind of in the middle okay yeah um one thing i don't have my facts completely straight on this but i thought i read an article about canada having a lot of trouble getting people vaccinated is that have you heard anything about all of those lines yeah a lot of countries are having a lot of trouble so people that not only canada but a lot of third world countries definitely the third world countries that's for sure um but uh we well we should pay some attention to that because why because where the variants are going to come is from highly populated areas with little immunity so in other words the virus is circulating a lot that's where the new variants are going to come and so this newest variant is coming from india yeah now like i said the variance oh just another word the variants are our current vaccines do work on the variants they do so the current studies show for pfizer for example that it's 94 of old covid and 74 for new cove for new variants so it still works pretty good but even if you aren't uh you st still in that 26 percent that get it a variant having had the pfizer you're not going to get ass sick yeah yeah so that's important that's really important to note um what's your theory why did india have such a late spike yeah that's really interesting it's so crowded there like why wouldn't they gotten it earlier right it's not like they have a really well organized society that just dealt with it perfectly yeah i don't have a good answer that i i thought about that myself it is a little weird that they didn't flare when everywhere else flared but now they're flaring so african countries too i've never heard of major outbreaks in african countries i could just be wrong about that it's just not reported but i believe that's somewhat correct yeah yeah we just don't know why but it's gonna percolate through all the world it just will eventually yeah i mean the whole world there's just less travel maybe through africa and yeah you know perhaps perhaps these things are kind of interesting or a vagary of the variant yeah you know the variants are doing their own thing and you know just like the flu i mean like the the place i was going with the um thinking about canada and um other western developed countries with their access to the vaccine is talking about our biotechnology um a lot of discussion right now in congress about price controls on on drugs drugs are too expensive in the us this frustrates us um frustrates a lot of americans at the same time the only way you get to argue about the price of a drug is if the drug exists okay and it turns out that we were the country that made it it turns out that um well over 300 uh vaccines and treatments are being worked on for covet in the united states the next country that even comes close is china with like 30. we have all the the innovation here i mean houston's a great place for it and the way that generally works is small biotech firms they they do the investor rounds they take that risk it's a few people it's a startup and uh they're hoping to get bought out by big pharma right evil evil big pharma but this is how it works and it's reason that we have access to far more uh drugs than other countries do right um just that that is a there's a fact especially when it comes to the really serious stuff the really cutting-edge stuff especially cancer treatments things like that um am i on the right track so far yes oh yeah i mean people need to understand that these big companies big pharma companies j j pfizer all these companies are not our enemy and you know they have issues of course but they are the hero here they are a hero there are many heroes they are a hero here and the insurmountable importance of innovation i mean basically major serious threats this country has the ability to innovate its way out of and that is because this country creates the ecosystem that allows for innovation yeah that's very important and without that ecosystem without uh the the what's the fertile ground to allow for innovation then we're stuck in the mud and things like this come around and then we're really at risk won't be able to innovate treatments innovate vaccines and that quickly and that ecosystem is driven by uh need for protection of ip yeah uh intellectual property right so there i know there's been some discussion about loosening in intellectual property and very much again against that yeah um intellectual property is critical for innovation you basically ensure that they'll never take that risk again right you know and by ecosystem you also mean profit right protection of patents and profit um there has to be provision i hear so many doctors you know leaning to the left go on and say the biggest problem with our health care system is that it's profit driven right people hear that it's a very populist argument well all they need to do is go and try to get uh health in uh one of the eu countries i also see it in the britain i also say to those doctors fine then let's cut your salary in half you know because that's what you're saying yeah and and that it's just lack of understanding of of the alternative right and and the alternative you know in britain is a great example because britain's a very civilized country but their health care system is 20 years behind ours and it is rationed fashioned rationed so you cannot get a heart transplant after age 65 or kidney transplant after age 65 in england and the the thing about healthcare like i got um i was posed this question it haunted me after it was the when i was on joe rogan's podcast like a year ago and he poses this question to me he's like why isn't it why can't we just treat healthcare like we treat firefighters and i tried to give him some kind of complex economic theory argument in hindsight that was just the wrong argument the right argument is look if we had all the treatments all the cures and all the all the basic equipment we ever needed for any kind of health issue um and we and we could plan exactly what it would be then you could maybe make an argument that it could be sort of confiscated by government and and distributed in a very equal way uh the way firefighting is but it's but it's but the problem here is that you're just comparing apples to oranges in in an extreme sense yes you know firefighting you do one you literally do one job you put out a fire you do it occasionally um and you don't you have no real need to innovate um the type the way that you fire fight you know it's you just pour water on a fire okay health care is so diff also also you do it once at a time there's not like ongoing care for a fire sure um healthcare is the opposite of that in every single way um and i don't think people get that because often look he was just asking a question that people ask all the time right which is i don't get why it's different yeah well for someone who is an insider i know because i've been to all eu countries i've i've worked in hospitals i've seen patients in hospitals in eu countries and in britain and and third world countries and i've been all around and seen all this as an insider i'll tell you unequivocally clearly there is no question that the healthcare system in this country is the best in the world just and by far by a large margin now is it too expensive yes it's expensive yes is it all run by all these uh big insurance companies yeah it's all run by these big insurance companies yeah there's probably that's the lesser of evils yeah yeah like we don't deny those problems and look i mean there's bipartisan legislation to fix some of the loopholes that drug companies do engage in to you know kind of screw with the patent system a little bit like you know they they they're not perfect actors and i don't want to i don't want to give the audience the impression that that i would propose that they're definitely not there's things we can improve upon but policy is about trade-offs and the what the democrats want to do with what's called hr3 which is basically a it is it is effectively a price control they call it a negotiation but that that has been long be debunked it is not a negotiation at all it is it is price controls and you will destroy in a future innovation right you can get away with it once you can you can confiscate all existing drugs right now and you can get away with that once and you can make them produce them and you can set your price and you can distribute them but you'll never get another drug again that's the thing and that's the trade-off that they don't talk about right yeah it's so hard to innovate in other countries even you know eu countries and it's just so hard yeah we're glad we settled that what else do you want to add to the discussion oh just you know quick uh talk about um you know drugs coming up so uh what we really need is a drug you can take like we take tamiflu for a flu and that's coming uh there are a couple of um drugs that are looking very favorable there one called the ear favipiravir a pyramid okay we're going to need to rename that and monoperovir so you know oral drugs that'll be an equivalent of like tamiflu for this so that's great dexamethasone is so great it's done such great things um you know we talked about our six successful lung transplants in the extreme cases yeah so we're on it you know we're on it and and and the vaccines are are great and they're gonna you know the boosters coming up sometime within the next year gonna incorporate all these variants so it's all okay so you know the the message is let's treat this like the flu let's let's get this you know like we've done with the flu for the last 30 years and and and and and get back to normal that's a good way to end dr delgado thank you so much for being back on yes and thank you again dan for your leadership and all this i appreciate it

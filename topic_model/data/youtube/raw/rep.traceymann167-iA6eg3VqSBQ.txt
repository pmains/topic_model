  LEGACY. ADVANCE FREEDOM, AND MAYBE EVEN  PROVIDE SOME HUMOR TO OUR NATION AND OUR WORLD. WITH THAT, MADAM SPEAKER, I'D  LIKE TO RECOGNIZE AND YIELD FIVE MINUTES TO MY FRIEND AND  COLLEAGUE FROM KANSAS, THE  CURRENT REPRESENTATIVE OF  SENATOR DOLE'S HOMETOWN OF  RUSSELL, KANSAS, MR. MANN. MR. MANN: CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND AND CONGRESSMAN  MR. ESTES: FOR -- CONGRESSMAN  ESTES FOR HOSTING THIS TONIGHT. BOB DOLE'S PASSING LEAVES A VOID FOR AMERICA. I THINK MAYBE ESPECIALLY THOSE  OF US FROM KANSAS HITS  ESPECIALLY HARD. AMERICA HAS LOST A STATESMAN, A  WAR HERO AND A KANSAN WHO NEVER  FORGOT WHERE HE CAME ON. HE DIED PEACEFULLY AT THE AGE OF 98 LEAVING HIS DISTRICT, STATE,  AND COUNTRY BETTER OFF FOR HIS  MANY CONTRIBUTIONS OVER 79 YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE. MY PRAYERS AND GRATITUDE FOR THE SENATOR WILL GO OUT TO HIS  FAMILY. HE WAS STRUCK IN THE BACK AND  NEARLY KILLED BY A GERMAN SHELL  MONTHS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED. HE CALLED IT A STING IN THE  SHOULDER. THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT ABOUT WAS HIS HOME, RUSSELL, KANSAS. HE WAS EXPECTED TO DIE IN THE  HOSPITAL BUT HE LIVED. HE WAS TOLD HE WOULD NEVER  RECOVER FROM HIS INJURIES, WHICH INCLUDED PARALYSIS FROM THE NECK DOWN BUT HIS SPIRIT CARRIED HIM  THROUGH. HE SIMPLY REFUSED TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER AND CHOSE TO FOUGHT  FOR HIS LIFE IN RECOVERY, THE  SCARS WHICH HE CARRIED WITH FOR  THE REST OF HIS LIFE. HE WAS AWARDED TWO PURPLE HEARTS AND A BRONZE STAR. BEFORE BECOMING A UNITED STATES  SENATOR, HE WAS THE CONGRESSMAN  SERVING THE FIRST DISTRICT OF  KANSAS. KANSANS SENT HIM TO THE UNITED  STATES SENATE WHERE HE SERVED  FOR 27 YEARS, ACTED AS MAJORITY  LEADER TWICE, AND BECAME HIS  PARTY'S NOMINEE FOR THE HIGHEST  OFFICE OF THE LAND IN 1996. IT'S INSPIRING AND HUMBLING TO  STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF SUCH  GREATNESS. A FEW WEEKS AGO I WAS BLESSED TO SPEND TIME FOR SENATOR DOLE. HIS LOVE FOR KANSAS AND HIS  PEOPLE WERE ON DISPLAY. ON THAT DAY, HE WAS THOUGHTFUL,  COMMITTED, AND ENERGETIC  CHAMPION FOR OUR NATION AND OUR  WAY OF LIFE IN RURAL KANSAS. HE ALWAYS TREATED OTHERS WITH  RESPECT AND KINDNESS, ESPECIALLY HIS FELLOW VETERANS. AS HE ATTENDED NEARLY EVERY  HONOR FLIGHT THAT CAME TO D.C.  TO TOUR THE WORLD WAR II  MEMORIAL. HE WAS A FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR HIS POLITICAL VIEWS BUT EQUALLY  COMMITTED TO CROSS-AISLE  FRIENDSHIP AND CAMARADERIE. IN OUR MEETING HE SPOKE OF THE  KANSAS APPROACH. THE MARKERS OF WHICH HE  IDENTIFIED AS HONESTY, HARD  WORK, RESPECT FOR YOUR ROOTS,  COMMON SENSE, SERVICE,  SIMPLICITY, AND GENUINE  THOUGHTFUL CARE FOR PEOPLE. I LEFT OUR TIME AS SENATOR DOLE  MADE IT CLEAR WE MUST NEVER  FORGET WHERE WE COME FROM. HE KNEW DEEP DOWN THAT THE  HEARTBEAT OF OUR NATION LIES IN  HOMETOWNS LIKE HIS RUSSELL,  KANSAS. I KNOW WE ARE ALL WORKING  ACTIVELY FOR WAYS -- ON LOOKING  FOR WAYS TO HONOR BOB DOLE'S  LEGACY. AND THAT IS TO SUPPORT THE CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAM WHICH AIMS TO  ADDRESS CHILDHOOD HUNGER,  IMPROVE LITERACY, TRAIN  TEACHERS, AND MAKE THE WORLD A  BETTER PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE  ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE PROGRAM IS NAMED IN PART  AFTER SENATOR DOLE TO HONOR HIS  WORK TOWARDS ELIMINATING  CHILLYHOOD -- CHILDHOOD HUNGER. I OFFERED AN APPROPRIATION  QUESTION TO THE McGOVERN-DOLE  PROGRAM. IN ANOTHER EFFORT TO HONOR HIS  LEGACY, I INTRODUCED A LEGACY TO NAME THE POST OFFICE IN RUSSELL, KANSAS, THE ROBERT J. DOLE  MEMORIAL POST OFFICE, QUICKLY  JOINED BY OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES  FROM KANSAS. SENATOR DOLE STAYED TRUE TO HIS  ROOTS IN RURAL KANSAS AND  EMBODIED HIS CORE VALUES OF  FAITH, FAMILY, AND FREEDOM. NAMING A POST OFFICE AFTER ONE  OF KANSAS'S FAVORITE SONS IN A  TOWN THAT HE GREW UP IN IS A  SMALL BUT MEANINGFUL WAY TO PAY  TRIBUTE TO THIS KANSAS GIANT AND AMERICAN HERO. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS  RESOLUTION'S SWIFT PASSAGE  COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF  SENATOR DOLE. I TALKED TO MY 8-YEAR-OLD SON  AUSTIN ABOUT SENATOR DOLE. AFTER I FINISHED SHARING STORIES ABOUT HIS WIFE. HE SAID, DAD, I THINK GOD HAD A  SPECIAL PLAN FOR BOB DOLE. THAT IS SO TRUE AND GOD HAD A  SPECIAL PLAN FOR ALL OF US WHEN  HE GAVE SENATOR DOLE THE FAITH,  VALUES, LONGEVITY, AND  LEADERSHIP PLATFORM THAT HE  STUARTED SO WELL. I WANT TOSH STEWARDED SO WELL. HE SAID, QUOTE, I OFFER A  WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD, TO  HANG TOUGH, TO GO THE DISTANCE. I OFFER THE STRENGTH AND  DETERMINATION MOLDED IN  AMERICA'S SMALLTOWN HEARTLAND  AND TEMPERED DURING A CAREER OF  PUBLIC SERVICE TO BRING  COMMONSENSE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX  PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA, END  QUOTE. HIS LEGACY WILL ECHO INTO THE  FUTURE AND HIS SPIRIT SERVES AS  A BENCHMARK FOR ANYONE WHO  BELIEVES OUR BRIGHTEST DAYS ARE  YET TO AM CO. THANK YOU -- YET TO COME. THANK YOU, SENATOR DOLE, FOR  WORKING TIRELESSLY TO MAKE THE  WORLD A BETTER PLACE. MAY YOU REST IN PEACE. THANK YOU, CONGRESSMANESTESS,  AND I -- CONGRESSMAN ESTES, AND  I YIELD BACK. MR. ESTES: IT'S GREAT TO HAVE  YOU HERE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK AS  A FELLOW KANSAN AN

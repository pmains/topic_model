okay this is one of our weekly updates of what's going on in the campaign and this past week we had a huge and really a lot of fun opening of the campaign headquarters here in Brunswick I don't know how many people were here 10,000 20,000 maybe it was a couple of hundred but it was it was great wonderful people all excited and so we're kicked off and running we've got people that with petitions that's the big project right now we're doing fundraising and speaking of fundraising will be filing our first required federal election commission report this weekend and very proud of how we've done in a very short period of time that will be coming out as I say this weekend and probably be in the news next week let's see also this week I've met with a bunch of different reporters both here in Maine and some people are coming from from Washington where they can't figure me out yet and they keep sending reporters asking the same questions so I've been doing that and then did some door-to-door politics in Kennebunk yesterday with some friends down there when through a bunch of stores talked to a lot of people learned a lot shook some hands and so that was a lot of fun and then next week we're going to be working again doing some of this kind of door-to-door politicking and Patriots Day is coming up and one of the things I want to promote on Patriot's Day is my new favorite iphone app which is called the USA manual and it's 299 i think it was 99 cents when i first got it but it's pretty good so it's think it's worth it it has the Constitution the Bill of Rights the Declaration of Independence Supreme Court decisions The Federalist Papers everything you need to know in terms of the documentary history of the United States and you too can carry the Constitution around in your pocket it's amazing how impressive it is to be able to pull out the Constitution at a party when people are discussing some of these issues that we're all concerned with what's going on at the Supreme Court for example so that's going to be one of our messages is the USA manual on Patriot's Day and again we're we're pushing forward and trying to discuss issues the principal issue of course being whether Congress itself can work and how it can work and how it can work better and how an independent can at least begin the process of changing the broken system in Washington so that's the week coming up and great to have a chance to chat and we'll be talking to you next week it may be in between as things develop

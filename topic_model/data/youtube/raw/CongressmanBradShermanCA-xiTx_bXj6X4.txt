uh last month the former united nations uh uh under secretary general for human uh humanitarian affairs and emergency relief uh focused on uh the famine and tigre and uh we saw that uh the ethiopian authorities aided by the uh eritrean authorities uh have used food as a weapon of war and then they've used their power in the united nations to prevent a uh declaration of uh the famine uh that they have created uh what's happening in tigre is the world's uh most dire and devastating hunger crisis uh in a decade since uh the devastating famine in uh in somalia of 2011. uh given that this is a man-made famine orchestrated by the ethiopian and eritrean governments who have who for so many months blocked aid from entering in tigre and are otherwise preventing the crew both the transportation of food and uh and preventing farming it seems odd that a declaration of famine can depend on a host government that's creating the famine will you commit to working with the united nations to formally declare a famine integrate i was just in rome as i mentioned representative sherman and spoke with david beasley who heads up wfp on ethiopia tigre and a number of other critical uh humanitarian situations and absolutely we are extremely concerned about the continuing humanitarian crisis out there um the un's access has been difficult challenging uneven unpredictable in many areas affected by these military operations uh obviously the conflict out there is a threat to peace and security in the entire porn of africa uh we are committed to working not only with the wfp but the other food organizations to facilitate the delivery of this badly needed humanitarian assistance well let me just to just energy i hope that you're also working for a u.n declaration of famine uh dealing with the political side of this obviously even more important is the physical side of getting the food trucks in and enough fuel in so that you can move the food around the tigre area

thanks for one minute thank you I rise in strong opposition to HR 933 I oppose funding for the Select panel to attack and intimidate women's healthcare the Select panel is a baseless committee formed with no regard to the facts or evidence of this case in fact the creators of the purposely doctored and highly manipulated videos that they consistently bring up that this investigation is based on have been indicted on criminal felony charges which shouldn't we should be investigating their illegal practices instead continuing to fund this panel as a disgrace and this investigation must cease immediately instead of taking action that would improve the lives of women and families across the country this panel continues to chase baseless allegations as an emergency physician I am exceptionally disappointed the reckless work of this panel puts women's reproductive rights in jeopardy and threatens to undo the progress we have made over the last 40 years it is also a complete waste of taxpayer money I strang it I stand in strong opposition to this resolution and call on this panel to be disbanded let's take real action to improve the health and well-being of this country I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yield

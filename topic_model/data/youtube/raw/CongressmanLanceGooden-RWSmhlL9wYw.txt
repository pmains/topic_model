Texas governor Greg Abbott announces the elimination of jail time as punishment for violating shutdown orders this after a hair salon owner was put behind bars for reopening her business I'm John Scott and this is an expanded edition of the Fox report it's the bottom of the hour if you're just joining us that controversial case is highlighting the nationwide debate on when and how to restart the economy here to talk about it Republican congressman from Texas Lance Gooden he is a member of the House Financial Services Committee congressman Gooden it's my understanding that a week from tomorrow you're gonna get to open Jim's office building buildings and non-essential manufacturing facilities in Texas at 25 percent occupancy how convinced are you that that's a good idea that it's not gonna be too soon you know the goal was not to cure this disease and have it totally out of our lives in two months the goal was to flatten the curve we've done that I believe we've done that nationwide we've certainly done that in Texas and we're to the point now where we've got to get back to work the economy has suffered tremendously we have to get Texans back to work and Americans across the country are ready to return to work they're tired of their government at least in Texas I won't speak for people in places like California and Michigan but in Texas people are tired of sitting at home people are tired of the government telling them that they can't go out and earn a living which is what you mentioned earlier on the show began about the salon owner in Dallas right you've got at least 37 thousand cases of corona virus in Texas roughly a little less than 1100 deaths but you've also got tremendous economic damage from the shutdown of this state and so many others it's it's a tough balancing act it is but you know in my district senior citizens that I talked to say Lance I'm concerned but I'm gonna stay home I didn't need the government to tell me to stay home and then you have people who are ready to get back out and work they were ready to work even when this started they didn't even want to take a break because they couldn't in the case of the salon owner in Dallas she was providing for her family people are getting to the point that they are so desperate that they are since breaking the law breaking these orders civil disobedience is becoming an option that people like her probably would have never considered I spoke with her legal team earlier today she actually faces the prospect of going back to jail her release was temporary she received a huge fine yesterday from the city of Dallas and she's got to deal with that now her story is not over and the story of Texans who are dealing with similar scenarios it's not over what we've got to do is get back to work and say no to the nonsense that is government locking people up for providing for their families would you be an advocate for greater testing dr. Tom Ingoldsby was on Fox News Sunday and he says that in his view testing is the answer listen I am concerned I think there are some places in the country which are doing a lot better which have low overall numbers and have had a two-week decline in cases or more and have been doing a lot of testing but there are other places which are really experiencing the opposite rising cases too little testing too little tracing dr. Inglesby from Johns Hopkins University so congressman is Texas ready and able to do more testing yes I think we are but you know I also hear a lot of skeptics from around the nation I understand that just in the last few days dr. Burks on the White House team has had issues with the CDC numbers when you look at the numbers for deaths from things like pneumonia those numbers are so low this year compared to other years does that mean that deaths for pneumonia have just vanished or are things being coded as Cova deaths I don't know the answer to that but I do know that there's a lot of skepticism out there testing is a great thing we do need to increase it but what you absolutely need to do is get this economy back at it we've got to get people back to work people can't afford to feed their families they're worried about paying bills and rent and mortgages and we've come to the point where civil disobedience is becoming acceptable because people are fed up they want to get back to their normal lives no we don't want to get sick we want to take precautions but I think people are tired myself included of the government saying what we can and cannot do you know the president has worried about the cure in this case an economic shutdown being worse than the disease of kovat 19 is that the tipping point that you feel we have reached absolutely I think we reached it a long time ago we're potentially in waters that we'll never get out of we hear of industries potentially never recovering the airline industries have taken such a huge hit unemployment numbers are through the roof people in my district have lost jobs that they they thought were extremely secure just two months ago we have hair salon owners going to jail when hardened criminals are being released because of this virus we're locking up salon owners that's just crazy this is not the America that I grew up to love this is an America that has just in many cases lost their minds I mean we've got people that are doing things that the government tells them to and sitting around waiting for the government to say you can take off your mask or you can go to work it's just crazy and in Texas we're fed up with it governor Abbott's fed up with it and he's done a great job he's seeing that the numbers have decreased he listens to his constituents and that's the people of Texas and we are sick and tired of sitting at home and not growing the economy and taking care of our families and that's what the constituents I represent want they wouldn't get back to their normal lives as we said at the outset he has revoked the idea of jailing those who violate stay at home orders representative Lance Gooden Republican of Texas thank you thank you

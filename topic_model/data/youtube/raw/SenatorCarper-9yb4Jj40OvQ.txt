chairman thanks for holding this hearing in breaking from the protocol to allow me to develop to deliver an opening statement I'm appreciative to you and to Senator Collins for the attention that you and your staffs have paid to this vitally important economic issue for some time now my subcommittee and I have been sounding the alarm about the dire financial situation facing the Postal Service unfortunately while a number of bills have been put forward Congress including this committee has been unable to reach consensus on the kind of dramatic and likely painful reforms that will be needed to avert a looming Postal Service shutdown in addition the proposals put forward by the administration to date have been insufficient today just a few weeks after narrowly avoiding the first-ever default by the federal government we may be just a few weeks away from the first-ever default of the Postal Service that default if permitted to happen would be embarrassing and dangerous in fact it would pave the way for postal insolvency by this time next year if not sooner while the office of management and budget unfortunately declined to testify at this hearing to discuss the administration's plans for preventing the postal service from failing it is my hope that the discussion we have here today will jumpstart the process of developing a bipartisan bicameral consensus around the reforms necessary to restructure the Postal Service's finances and transform its operations to reflect the uncertain future that it faces Postmaster General Donna who will testify today that the Postal Service's finances continue to deteriorate he is projecting a year in lost for the postal service of some 10 billion dollars new nearly two billion dollars more than he projected when our subcommittee last held the postal oversight hearing I think in May it will not be able to make the five and a half billion dollar retiree health payment due on sep tember 30th con October it will have exhausted his line of credit with the Treasury and will have only enough cash on hand to get by then under what is likely the best case scenario cash will be completely exhausted by the next summer and the Postal Service absent any lifeline from Congress or the administration a congress and administration that are short on life lines these days will likely be forced to close its doors if the postal service were to fail the impact on our economy would be traumatic as postmaster general Donohue and others have pointed out time and time again the postal service operates at the center of an industry that employs millions of people these men and women don't just work at the Postal Service they work at magazines at banks at printing companies and in businesses large and small across America they work in every state and congressional district in the country and as Senator Collins that said they generate more than one trillion dollars in sales and revenues each year given the challenging economy facing our country we cannot afford to put jobs these jobs and that kind of productivity in jeopardy in fact it's our job to do what needs to be done to save this industry even if doing so involves making decisions that might be difficult politically like it or not in a number of ways I don't like it very much myself Postal Service needs to right-size itself to reflect the decreasing demand for their product and services that it offers it needs to shed employees it needs to downsize its network of processing facilities to reflect that there's less mail to process and the technology has made getting it to its destination easier to do and the Postal Service needs to be able to close or relocate or co-locate some of the postal services that are provided in in communities across America the Postal Service has put forward a plan to eliminate a further 120,000 positions on top of the some 100,000 that will be lost through attrition they've also begun studying some 3,000 post offices out of about 33,000 crossed the country but looking at 3,000 post offices foreclosure or for colocation with other businesses the Postal Service is expected to propose similarly dramatic changes to its processing network in the next week or so we are rapidly reaching the point however at which the Postal Service no longer has the authority under current law to do what it needs to do to get by that's why I've introduced legislation that aims to clean up the Postal Service's finances and help it implement the ambitious reorganization plan to denounce last spring the main provision in my bill the postal operations sustainability and transformation Act aims to permanently address the various pension and retiree health related issues that have plagued the sir postal service for years the postal service Postal Service's Inspector General Postal Regulatory Commission and two independent actuaries one of them was actually represented here today have all come to the conclusion that the Postal Service has overfunded its obligation to the Civil Service Retirement System by some 50 to 75 billion dollars in addition numerous observers and even the Office of Personnel Management have pointed out that the Postal Service's paid some seven billion dollars more than I was into the newer Federal Employee Retirement System my bill and I think the bill that Senator Collins is introduced will give the postal service access to the funds it is over paid it would be able to use them to make it's required retiree health pre-funding payments taking upwards of five billion dollars off its books each year for the next several years and once those payments are satisfied the funds this bill would free up could be used to pay workers compensation obligations and to retire debt owed to the Treasury these reforms are something very similar to them can be a vital part of any effort to improve the Postal Service's financial condition in both the short and long term but stopping with these reforms and avoiding further potentially more difficult changes will simply not be enough to anyone taking an honest look at the numbers it should be clear that more will be need need to be done and that's why my bill takes important steps toward giving the Postal Service the flexibility that those of us in Congress always say we want to give them and to adapt them to the new realities and operate more like a business no business facing the kinds of difficulty the Postal Service faces today would survive very long if it were told how many retail outlets they should have and where they should be located or if were prevented from making operational changes are taking full advantage of the resources and expertise it has at its disposal yet that's what Congress does to the postal service my bill aims to address these problems and to take Congress out of the day-to-day management of the Postal Service that the postal service can continue to build on his recent cost-cutting efforts these changes could help set the postal service on more solid footing in the years to come but I don't just focus on my bill on cost-cutting the bill also aims to give the Postal Service new authority to leverage its nationwide retail logistics transportation and delivery network to attract new business in addition it gives the Postal Service more flexibility to work with existing customers to keep them in the mail and to partner with state and local governments to find new potentially profitable uses for the retail facilities that it needs to keep I mentioned at the beginning of my statement that there have been a number of bills introduced this Congress to address the Postal Service's financial conditions Susan Collins has one you know I've worked on its these issues for years and my hope and prayer is it will do it again this time to go to affect congressman Issa has another approach and there are parts of both bills that I don't agree with but also parts of the bills that I support and they had overlap with some of the provisions in my own bill starting with this hearing we need to focus on the areas of agreement and from there with input from the administration from the key stakeholders build a package that can prevent postal default and insolvency and set the Postal Service on the road towards stability and profitability Oh in conclusion mr. chairman and center console special let me just say this the Postal Service's in enterprise it's a business enterprise as an enterprise that has more people than it needs it needs to reduce its headcount they've tried to do that humanely and they'd like to do it to continue to do it you mainly we need to let them we have more post offices than we need and the the key is not just closing post office of keys to try to provide better service the postal customer's in communities across America work by co-locating the services in drug stores and supermarkets and department stores and and and the like and finally they have more processing so there's probably twice the number of processing centers that they need around the country they need to reduce the the number of processing centers and as they do those things we need to get out of the way there's not a huge bailout that's needed here but a large part what we need to still out the postal service act more like a business and then to come up with even more great ideas like flat rate boxes and last mile delivery that kind of stuff and if you do that and we do our job I think the postal service could be here for a lot a lot a lot longer thanks so much

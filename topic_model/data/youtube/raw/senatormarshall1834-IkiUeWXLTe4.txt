Mr Speaker I rise today to bring up-to-date by colleagues on my last visit to Clark County Kansas mr. speaker my colleagues may remember that earlier this year wildfire wildfires consumed a vast sum of Clark County the wildfires wrought havoc for many ranchers farmers families and landowners in Clark County and across much of southwest Kansas not to mention parts of Texas cholera Oklahoma besides the lives lost including one in Kansas thousands of livestock 650,000 acres and many family properties had been passed down through generations burned in this disastrous blaze through the perseverance of Kansas living in this region a considerable amount of progress has been made sense and when I visit right after the fires in March and thanks to so many people throughout the country who have donated hay as well as our personal services help helping rebuild the hundreds of miles of fences that were burned down after visiting with family the Geils family and the grizzly families both families impacted by the fires their resilience or strength and their faith was made clear these are the type of folks who are now working day in and day out to restore this section of the Heartland I'm delighted now to see the green rising in the pastures which was once Earth's corn burnt to the ground grass and I'm again reminded of the honor I have a worker working to represent some of the most hardworking Americans in the world the Kansas agriculture the Kansas farmers and the Kansas ranchers with that Mr Speaker I yield back

hi carson tracy mann here with this week's man minute back in washington dc today there'll be some things that are going to hit the floor this week we'll also be back in session here in washington next week as well it was a tremendous delight and pleasure to last week host congressman glenn thompson from pennsylvania in our district so gt thompson is the top republican on the house ag committee which means if republicans win the majority in this next election then he'll be the chair of the house ag committee which is very important to kansas as we're going to do a farm bill next year when the current farm bill expires i'll have some great times with gt all over western kansas and then finished with some time around manhattan area as well really excited to show off kansas and kansas agriculture to gt this was his first trip to kansas a couple other things that are very much on my mind that's the increased fertilizer process and really all input costs we're seeing for ag producers we're doing some specific work to work to see if we can lift the tariffs on some inbound phosphorus and nitrogen inputs would be a boost there so some more to come on that another thing that we're working on is just we're constantly talking about the need to increase our domestic oil and gas production there's no reason that we are buying any um oil from russia or any other nation that's hostile towards us so more to come there i'm really excited about some town halls we have coming up this week on wednesday night at six o'clock kansas time we're gonna have a tele town hall talking specifically about agriculture so feel free to uh to listen in on that also excited that next month we're going to have a bunch of days we're going to be all over the district doing town halls there's nothing that i enjoy more than getting out to listen to kansas so coming to a county or community near you and please stay posted as always if we can be helpful let me know thanks a lot

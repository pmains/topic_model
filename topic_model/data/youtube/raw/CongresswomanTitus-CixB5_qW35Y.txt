I'm proud to represent Las Vegas that's the entertainment capital of the world last year almost 50 million people passed through the gates of McCarran International Airport in my congressional district they were tourists business travelers and friends and family of my ethnically diverse constituents they were many of them from international airports of destination they came from all parts of the world and they didn't speak English yet much of what TSA communicates to travelers and transportation workers is through signs announcements and videos that are all in English let's be clear as you have heard the speakers before me say you shouldn't have to worry about missing a plane at an airport in the United States just because you don't speak English and that's why I'm excited that the house is passing the translate Act which I introduced to make sure that TSA goes the extra mile in Las Vegas and airports all across the country to communicate with the traveling public it's a basic courtesy I know we all appreciate seeing signs in English when we're traveling abroad so there's no reason we shouldn't make US airports as welcoming as possible to those who don't speak English or who may be visually impaired

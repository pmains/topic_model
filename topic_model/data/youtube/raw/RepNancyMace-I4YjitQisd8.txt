i'm proud to support this legislation that would help progress and retain highly skilled cybersecurity professionals in the federal workforce agencies across the federal government face an increasing cyber terrorism threat but we struggle to hire and retain qualified cyber security employees that's not how our government was meant to be operated and it's unsustainable and dangerous just in 2020 there was a major federal government data breach by a group backed by the russian government 11 federal agencies were affected and if the federal government can protect its own information and personnel how can it serve the civilians and firms these agencies are tasked with aiding and if i can't trust a company's reputation for securing my data how would we choose i would choose another company however american citizens don't have that luxury in this particular scenario this is a critical step in the right direction to address this undeniable risk the risk of cyber security threats is real and it's here and it's on our front doorstep and we have to take an active and bipartisan approach on all of these measures measures recent breaches of our federal cyber infrastructure which left vulnerable our nation's security show that our government needs to be integrated to have an integrated federal cyber workforce that has the knowledge and skills to counter ever more sophisticated threats my colleagues and i on both sides of the aisle are committed to working to ensure our government agencies get the resources they need to hire and retain properly trained cyber security experts to keep our nation safe

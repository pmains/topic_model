court thank you very much mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his leadership working with Congressman Walter Jones on this bipartisan amendment which has been brought to the floor they have worked again in a bipartisan way in a patriotic way to ensure that US troops are brought home from Afghanistan safely and expeditiously listening to the debate it's interesting because I don't know that we're that far off because we all want to ensure the national security of our country we all respect our men and women in uniform and the job that they are doing to keep us the land of the free and the home of the brave we respect them when they come home as our veterans but we have to know that involvement of nearly 10 years has serious consequences to our country I have told the president of afghanistan on my recent visit this spring that each time I go there I say the American people are growing tired of war were weary of war we went into Afghanistan in the fall of two thousand and one for about seven years there was no plan there was no plan on how we would execute what we went to do and how we would leave when President Obama became president many of us who were eager for us to bring our troops home gave him a chance to put forth a plan which he did which calls for a drawdown of troops this july two thousand eleven and terminating in two thousand drawing down more completely 2014 president obama himself has said earlier this month i've already made a commitment that starting in july of this year we are drawing down troops and we are transitioning we are training on forces so they can start securing our own their own country the afghans can secure their own country the president went on to say we don't need to have a perpetual footprint the size we have now and I so therefore I think it's really important for us to know what this amendment does that I think reflects the mood of the American people within 60 days of enactment a plan and time frame for the accelerated transition of military and security of forces to the government Afghanistan in 60 days we want to see a plan within 60 days of enactment a plan and timeframe for negotiations leading to a political solution and reconciliation in Afghanistan a plan within 60 days within 90 days of enactment a national intelligence estimate on leadership location and capabilities of al Qaeda and affiliated networks and sells who can be against that who can be against that we're talking about 60 days a plan 60 days a plan 60 days in negotiation I appreciate the efforts that this amendment as it underscores the importance of having a plan and a timeframe for a transition of responsibility but that's all negotiated a transition of responsibility for security and stability to the Afghans so that we can bring our troops home the national intelligence estimate on al Qaeda that is called for in the plant will also help ensure our policymakers that they have updated information on the threat posed by Al Qaeda and affiliates who remain a threat even following the death of Osama bin Laden careful intelligence analysis essential to keeping the American people safe so as I salute our men and women in uniform i also want to so in the intelligence community who are important part of keeping the American people safe and I commend them and CIO CIA director Panetta for his leadership in the capture of Osama bin Laden but back to this specific point of this amendment I found there year after year after year never thinking that we would be engaged in the longest or in America's history first seven years not even a plan and now the president has put into motion how we make judgments about how we stay and how we leave if you visited the women in Afghanistan if you visit the women in Afghanistan it many women and the Congress have done in some of our male colleagues as well they will tell you whether you're talking about educated women in Kabul but really more relevant to me poor poor women in the provinces I visited a group of women in the province of Zabul it isn't a number of provinces and spoken to the women there and the women there say we really want to educate our daughters we want to have access to health care clinics and the rest but we can't have that until we have security and we can't have security until we end corruption so many things going on in Afghanistan that must change and there will be a better chance of their changing if we make an investment in the civilian side of this transition whether its diplomacy whether it's part of the construction they tell me not to say reconstruction because not much was there before construction there whether it's building schools we visited little girls in school in different parts of Afghanistan it's very encouraging our troops know that we have to leave that we have to transition out but as I told president of cars I also we didn't come here and we're not seen here ten years so that when we leave women return to the subjugated position they were in under the Taliban so the answer to that is women must be at the table when you have the negotiations for reconciliation of the leadership of the Taliban reintegration of rank-and-file members of the Taliban as we move toward a more stability in Afghanistan women must play a role women in America women throughout the world care about how this all turns out there so here we are almost 10 years later in a situation where we just want to have some management of this issue let's have a plan for how we the negotiations will take place let's have a plan after we see the national intelligence estimate based on what the kind of threat is this is a very wise amendment I thank mr. McGovern mr. Jones for how they put it together because it's very reasonable it has a goal in sight it has a reasonable approach as to how we get there but make no mistake in overwhelming numbers the American people think we have done our job there in terms of of helping the Afghan people our purpose there was to protect the American people we can be do both by focusing more on the civilian side of governance issues on how Afghanistan is governed on anti-corruption issues and our initiatives that i have seen there on this recent trip are an improvement over the past by training the national security forces of afghanistan be a police or the military so they can maintain their own security and by diplomatically in listening other countries in the region because they all have this interest in the stability of Afghanistan but an open-ended unending war there which in the cost is there's nothing to compare to the cost of the loss of our young men and women so that's first and foremost what our concern is but also the cost in dollars the costing opportunity the cost in military strength this involvement engagement in Afghanistan is not strengthening our military so Americans are paying a big price there we want to make sure we're getting a return on that investment and time is a very important factor it's time for our troops to come home and I thank mr. McGovern and mr. Jones for their leadership and yield back the balance of our time hey gentlemen California this chairman might I inquires the

people are going to lose their coverage or they'll give up their coverage under this Republican plan but you know what that plan is better than an Obamacare it's not even going to exist he's getting the death spiral argument what do you say to that well I don't think David's ever been a doctor I'm a doctor by training and the Affordable Care Act actually has added twenty million people to the the rolls of the insured the CBO score for the House bill says 23 million people are going to lose coverage so it absolutely takes us backwards I don't think David's ever been a legislator either you know this is about solving problems coming together so yeah I'd love to see Democrats and Republicans come together and address the cost of health care because at the end of the day it's about those kitchen-table conversations David's a political operative this is political suicide for those Republicans what is the congressman let me just ask you though what should the strategy be here for Democrats in the Senate because it looks like the battle on the ledge on the Senate floor is going to start with these amendments like this issue of Planned Parenthood for instance they've put the defunding the one-year defunding in there sounds like susan collins may introduce an amendment that says let's strip that out democrats vote for that amendment should they boycott the process how should they handle it well look if you have a chance to put Planned Parenthood offending back in there go for it put it back in there because it's a vital health care provider for for women and low-income individuals if you have a chance to add coverage to Medicaid put that back in there I think Democrats should play an active role in here I don't think any of these Republicans are going to take any of the Democratic amendments though right

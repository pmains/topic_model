hi I'm Congressman Joe Morelli and here to participate in the Read Across America so on Sunday mornings I always get together with our family and we have breakfast and I used to do the cooking and cleaning today while I cooked I'm not cleaning so I get a chance to sit with Arabella Elizabeth stone my granddaughter and we're gonna read a book which she picked out called the pout pout fish in the big big dark it's written by Deborah decent and the pictures are by Dan Hanna you ready you ready good let me put my glasses on so I can actually see what I'm reading the pop-out fish in a big big dark a doozy of a drowsy may miss clam yawn then a big current washed and her pearl was gone mr. fish swam forth miss clam don't weep I'll find your pearl that's a promise I'll keep he swooped through the water swishing close to the sand and he eyed every inch of the busy bottom land he found a monkey marble where he thought the pearl might be then a hidden voice whispered it's further out to sea thank goodness so he swam a little deeper where the light grew dimmer as his heart flip fluttered mr. fish grew grimmer I'm fast as a sailfish caution fast fish no I'm strong as a shark I'm smart as a dolphin but I'm scared of the dark it's gonna be dark in the ocean oh yeah he kept that searching all along the ocean floor through a reef through a wreck swimming far from the shore ocean it's a tiny Titanic Titanic mr. Filch felt a pout pout poach on his hope then the whisper from before said it's down beyond the slope that's like a slope of a hill but it's underwater yeah he's going further down so he swam a little deeper where the light grew dimmer his his heart flipped fluttered mr. fish grew grimmer I'm fast as a sailfish I'm strong as a shark I'm smart as a dolphin but I'm scared of the dark the deeper he goes the darker it gets a whirl of wriggly worms made a search team swirl and then they helped with the hunt for the yawn gone pearl but nothing was discovered mr. fish felt despair then that soft voice whispered in the trench check their eight legs so he swam a little deeper where the loot light grew dimmer as his heart flip fluttered mr. fish grew grimmer I'm fast as a sailfish I'm fast as a sailfish I'm strong as a shark I'm smart as a dolphin but I'm scared of the dark and it's getting really dark down there there's signs around the page what are the signs say let's see rest stop suckers here come on in fun and games in here free food that's a good one I won't keep swimming in this heat deep black I know I made a promise but this fish is heading back then a whisper now-familiar whisked away his dread you can do it mr. fish her sweet voice said though there wasn't any light not the smallest slim glimmer mr. fish felt braver mr. fish felt braver cheered on by miss shimmer two hour faster than a sailfish two-hour stronger than a shark two are smarter than a dolphin two are bigger than the dark so they swam down together holding fin to fin when suddenly amazingly amazingly light shone in mr. fish said yes miss shimmer shouted yay dinners miss clams pearl hooray hooray wow it's a fish with a lantern on his head they smooched mr. lantern then they smiled as they swam weaving back through the water to a happy miss clam two working together the whole gang gathered feeling glorious and proud and they swam in a circle as they sang out loud the ocean is wide and the ocean is deep but friends help friends that's a promise we keep and look at all those fish friends round swimming helping each other we are bigger yes bigger always big big bigger and bigger than the dark that's a fun story wasn't it it's called the pout pout fish in the big big dark this is congressman Joe Morelli and this Arabelle Elizabeth stone say keep reading bye bye

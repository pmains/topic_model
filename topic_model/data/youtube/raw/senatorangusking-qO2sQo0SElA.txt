Republican senators Mike rounds of South Dakota and independent Senator angus King of Maine both men were involved in bipartisan negotiations to reopen the government government and voted yes gentlemen good to see you both thank you to see you Angus what can you get done in the next two weeks well first I want to say that one single factor Chris that probably pushed us over yesterday was that you wore your lobster tie and that gave us the Mojo thank you for the tie I wore it in the spirit of bipartisanship appreciate you noticing and it worked well where do we go from here I think it was it was important to have this group of 2025 senators that basically were pushing on the leaders in both directions to try to find the solution now as you say we've got three weeks to put up or shut up and it's gonna be hard I've already had two meetings in the last well yesterday afternoon on border security about another would schedule this afternoon we're serious about trying to make this happen it's not going to be easy because we've got people on both sides in both caucuses that are very suspicious of whatever comes out and as your people have been pointing out all morning then we got to deal with the house and the president frankly I think our best bet is to get a really good bipartisan bill 60 70 votes out of the Senate and then the president and the house have to sit up and pay attention and say hey there's a solution here let's take it pretty big disconnect though between the Senate and the house senator rounds especially when it comes to the dreamers there could be but we think if we do a good job of combining that with word of security toss in perhaps h2 B's it might very well come up with a solution that the president would endorse and if the president endorses it makes it a lot more difficult for the house to ignore it look we we all recognize Republicans and Democrats that the issue of the dreamers is not going to go away and we really do have to address it just not only because it's the right thing to do but because politically it's the right thing to do as well are you looking at one big omnibus bill here or do you think you'll break this into parts Angus well I think I think it's important to be clear on the budget part I think what we're looking at is agreement on the on breaking the caps setting that what they call the top-line number how much will be appropriated at point nobody should be surprised there will have to be another continuing resolution of probably three weeks for the appropriation committees to actually write the details on the budget a lot of that work has been done but that's what we're talking about is Oh an overall number and then the allocations between defense and the FAA and the Department of Agriculture a lot of that work has been done and I think it can be done in in general by February 8th and then the final sort of paperwork will be done in the next two or three weeks if we can do that and we're talking about two-year numbers here that will be a big breakthrough in terms of getting our work done and finally starting to at least think about doing budgets as they ought to do both Mike and I are very upset I one of the reasons I voted no on this bill the other night was I'm just sick and tired of continuing resolutions and not making decisions when we're supposed to well you were a governor you don't get to shut down on the state level the way you do on the federal level there's all kind of uh well it usually just not allowed in most states so in terms of if I hear you on all the budgetary stuff so let's say that's one negotiation it sounds like this immigration will be a separate negotiation the president will loom large here and I just want to remind people where he has been and left on this issue young people brought here no fault of their own this should be a bipartisan bill there should be a bill of love truly should be a bill of love and we can do this I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration immediately we're always talking about dreamers for other people I want the children that are growing up in the United States to be dreamers also all right so we don't really know where he is he just put out an ad basically saying that uh you know people who come in here illegally are all bound to be terrorists so what do you think senator rounds you're gonna have to break off the immigration stuff deal with the budgetary matter there's plenty there and that this will be a second bill now I think what you have to do is is in good faith work through the issues of immigration and that includes border security and if you can make headway on that and I think if the Dems recognize that there is serious attempt here and we honor our commitment to move forward to it then they have to honor their side of it which is to keep government open that's the condition and at the same time I think the president has given himself plenty of leeway in which to negotiate that's a good thing and at the same time look he wants a win as well on the border security side a lot of Republic has a lot of Americans want to make sure that when we do this we do it in such a fashion that we actually secure the borders but even more important that we provide evidence that we can actually reduce the number of illegal immigrant immigrants coming into the country long term that's not just border security it's also talking about what our laws look like with regards to how they're interpreted south of the border it's not just Mexicans coming across its a lot of folks from a lot of different countries who come into the country we've got to have some consistency across the board with how we deal with those individuals Kristen there's one other important important point that I think is largely missed and what Mitch McConnell said all last week and all for the last several weeks he's been basically saying we're waiting for the president he said something like if we don't know what the president will sign we're just spinning our wheels as of yesterday he said we are going to take this bill up on February 8th if it's not resolved before then that was an important step for him to say we're not going to wait for the president we're this is going to work on a bill and come to our come to a conclusion and hope the president joins now if the president wants to join in good faith and try to help with these negotiations ultimately politically I don't think this much doubt that whatever is going to get through the house has to have the president's blessing and I think that's going to be part of the sort of second stage my hope frankly is that he steps back let us work on it here let us come up with a proposal again involving daca and border security and I think we can come up with something pretty good that he can then endorse and we can get it done which is what happened over the weekend where the president basically stepped back allow the negotiations to go on and we were successful in getting to a conclusion well let's see some a temporary basis right so we'll see what happens maybe you're just a talking stick away maybe you bring that Susan Collins Talking Stick are you guys gonna tell me who threw the stick who threw the stick and poke Susan Collins elephant Angus was it you I wasn't in the room at the time oh here we go here we go let me guess centered around were you not there either were you look in the other way was there crosstalk and you missed it i I was there going through this stage of the game we're gonna leave that let me just folks to let me just say in the subsequent meetings we used to nerf ball it was a lot a lot safer well it did break the ice though I got it that it it broke a few other things as well but but it did break the ice and that in that group as well well look there's nothing like a good stick it to the head to make people start to focus a little bit more clearly before I let you go senators give me your take on this report out of Axios that the president was pressuring sessions to pressure ray to get rid of mccabe one of these senior agents there at the FBI who is on his way out but Angus what do you make of that report what does it mean to you if true well there's this sort of unwritten rule I mean the Justice Department and the FBI do work for the president but there have been a lot of both unwritten rules and written rules like the term of the FBI directors is ten years that clearly overlaps presidential terms that's designed to protect the independence of the FBI so it is not it's it's unsettling frankly if you have the executive leaning on law enforcement because they don't like somebody or they are afraid and there's one of your commentators earlier this morning said FBI people are people they vote and they have preferences and it's impossible they're not automatons so yeah I think leaving the FBI alone is probably the best policy and and this isn't doesn't help in this situation senator rounds around the same page you know similar except for one thing it does remind us that even though we're all human and we've all got our own points of view when it comes to the Justice Department it's got to be even-handed sure that means you can't play favorites either way and I think that message is pretty important as well sure you just got to show proof of the unfairness senators I appreciate the insight I don't believe Angus that you don't know who threw the stick I just want you to know that Senator Kent nothing but respect for you but I want you to know I don't buy it be well gentlemen I ability men and please check back with us when you're starting to make progress and you see what the pitfalls are pitfalls are let's have some transparency for the American people thank you thank you all right now what

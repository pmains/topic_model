uh good afternoon everyone and thanks so much for being here today for this webinar event on workforce development this is the optics and photonics caucus's second event since we launched earlier this year and just the start of our efforts to support this uh very very important industry we have an important discussion slated to begin in just a few minutes but before we do i'd first like to thank my partners in the optics and photonics caucus for their leadership and support it is a privilege to be joined by a co-chair honorary co-chair from the united states senate senator steve daines from montana we're going to be joined i hope momentarily by my co-founder in the house and co-chair congressman brian mass from florida and i also want to thank senator kirsten cinema from arizona together the four of us represent some of the largest optics and photonics clusters in america and the focus of our caucus is to share the knowledge of what this industry can offer and connect members with their own clusters to ensure we support this very important growing field and today we're here to discuss the years-long workforce strategies optics and photonics companies have dealt with an issue that has only been exacerbated by the pandemic we know that strengthening our growing optics and photonics industry is critical to maintaining america's position as a leader in global innovation uh and helping our economy to recover not to mention the importance to our national security but we can't get any of that going without the workforce to do the job in my own district of rochester new york i've long heard from businesses in this industry that they have jobs available but can't find a talent to fill them in our region industry leaders have focused on both college and graduate degrees and high school curriculums designed to engage students in optics and photonics setting them up to achieve a high paying job developing products that literally uh will change our world and locally we have a solid foundation but the demand for skilled technicians is still far outweighing uh that supply so this is a significant challenge and i'm grateful to our experts for joining us today to help dig into the issues at hand but before i introduce our panelists i'd like to turn it over to our co-chairs for some introductory remarks and first up i'm delighted to be joined by senator danes of montana senator thank you i know there's a lot going on but i appreciate you taking time to be with us and i'll turn it over to you sir hey congressman thank you and uh a big thanks uh for joining today's optics and photonics caucus briefing i started my day out in fact a few hours ago on a zoom call with the american chamber of commerce shanghai i as some of you may know uh during my 28 years the private sector i'm the only chemical engineer in congress i'm a big and passionate believer in stem but i i had a chance to work in chinex for six years for procter and gamble launching american brands to compete against chinese companies so i'm very aware of the battle that we face and the race in front of us here to ensure that we leave the world innovation particularly in this critical field of optics and photonics i want to thank my fellow co-chairs senator cinema as well as congressman morelli and matt for leading this effort and i'm really excited to have one of my hometown heroes mr trent berg the president of the montana photonics industry alliance with us here today let me just give you a little shout out on montana we're finding out on the workforce side uh some of the smartest folks like to live in the most beautiful places and uh so uh they usually will tell their folks are going out to study sciences at montana state they're really to go out there and ski a lot more and fish and backpack and ice climbing all the great things we do in montana but i was part of a cloud computing company we started up in montana over 12 years we took the company public oracle eventually acquired us but we built a enterprise cloud computing company headquartered in montana and we had this what we think was an advantage of a wonderful place to live to raise families and also not have to compromise having a world-class experience as related to sciences and building enterprise companies and we're leaving the charge in montana we've got a great cluster of optics and photonics companies in our state mr berg knows well the benefits and the challenges that come along with this growing high-tech sector in fact in my hometown of bozeman which i went to kindergarten through college there we have the highest concentration on a per capita basis of photonics companies in the united states so it's uh it's kind of this uh this secret that's becoming a more well-known secret there in montana we're seeing some some growth and more people wanting to come to our great state for the quality of life but also for the great opportunity so i look for this great panel and work for my colleagues to grow these high-tech jobs and ensure the united states leads the world innovation this is a big big deal uh just hearing this morning from uh our american companies on the ground in shanghai this is a very important race and we've got to win it for the sake of our long-term competitiveness in this global market so thanks much i'll turn it back over to you appreciate it senator thanks so much we so value your public sector experience but also your private sector experience and your devotion to uh to continue to help the united states lead the world in innovation so i'm grateful to you for your partnership and for your friendship i um i now um as i indicated senator cinema of arizona is unable to to join us today but the senator uh asked and we were delighted that she provided some remarks that i'm now pleased to share with you my arizona senior senator i'm honored to be part of today's optics and photonics caucus event arizona leads the way in innovation and our state's universities are at the forefront of economic and scientific development as some of you may know the university of arizona is home to the steward observatory and is ranked number one in the nation by the national science foundation for research in astronomy and astrophysics with the university of arizona at its heart the optics valley is home to the optics and photonics industry and research cluster in arizona this hub of innovation is an economic engine that contributes over four billion dollars to our state every year and with arizona's rapidly growing semiconductor industry our state and its innovators will become directly linked to the creation of the new technologies of tomorrow our work in congress to spur innovation yields results back home after my bipartisanships for america act legislation that restores america's leadership and semiconductor manufacturing intel announced a 20 billion dollar investment in arizona creating thousands of new arizona jobs now that's just one example of how common sense bipartisan legislation can open paths for innovation and economic growth and that's why i'm so proud to be an honorary co-chair of our bipartisan optics and photonics caucus and i'm grateful for your partnership to enhance america's competitiveness and ensure that we continue to lead in innovation thanks for having me and i hope you have a productive day thank you very much to senator cinema for her continued leadership and for her sending along some remarks and again she sends her regrets for not being able to join us uh congressman mast who is my co-chair in the house uh is currently in uh committee uh taking votes but as soon as he has the opportunity to join us we will give him the opportunity to save some to offer some comments as well but now it's my pleasure to introduce each of our panelists we'll make some opening remarks then we'll sort of dig in a little bit and ask some questions that we would like them to respond to so first off we have dr alexis vogt who has served as the endowed chair and an associate professor of the optical systems technology program at monroe community college in my hometown of rochester new york and has done that since september of 2015. mcc is the nation's oldest two-year degree program for training technicians to work in the optics and photonics cluster and industry and i'm incredibly proud of alexis's hard work on behalf of our community and on behalf of this industry without further ado dr vote thank you congressman morelli and co-chairs congressman mast senator danes and senator cinema for your leadership of the optics and photonics caucus and thanks to the national photonics initiative for supporting the effort it's very important that a forward thinking group continues to focus upon our industry on capitol hill our optics industry is responsible for remarkable innovations which improve our lives every day and that maintain our nation's defense superiority and national security efforts as congressman morelli said i'm the professor and chair of the optics program at monroe community college in rochester new york and i'm also the executive director for workforce and higher education at the american center for optics manufacturing americom which focuses on workforce development supply chain stability and manufacturing innovation in the precision optics industry nationwide workforce development challenges abound in every industry but within optics the need is critical the finger lakes region of new york state home to monroe community college has an estimated annual demand for more than 550 optics technicians and while enrollments in our optics technician degree and certificate programs are growing despite the dire enrollment statistics currently rocking higher education overall and community colleges in particular there are still not nearly enough technicians filling the pipeline here in new york state let alone across the nation it is clear that the work of organizations like americom matter greatly americom applies that same spirit of innovation to the development of optics technologies as it does to workforce development flexibility in higher education is key which is why teams at mcc and at americom support year-round on-campus and online instruction and two-year degree programs fast track certificate programs college in the high school courses and apprenticeship programs for those already in the workforce last week rochester hosted the international spie optifab conference the only conference in the united states devoted exclusively to optics manufacturing i'm pleased to say that more than 240 students from area high schools and monroe community college arrived on student day to meet with industry representatives we clearly know how to engage them now our next step is to help bring the successful recruitment and training model in place here in the finger lakes region to the rest of the nation we look forward to working with the optics and photonics clusters in arizona colorado florida montana and others across the country to share our innovative training programs including our precision optics apprenticeship program and share our best practices for expanded enrollment retention and graduation of underrepresented populations as well as our strong alliances with the nation's precision optics network pre-collegiate educators and industry partners our optics and photonics industry has well-paying in-demand jobs that are ensuring technological superiority for the department of defense and revolutionizing our world thank you very much thank you alexis um for all the incredible work that you're doing and it's always uh privileged to have you appreciate you taking some time to spend with us uh this uh this afternoon next up we have jake coombler who's the president of ian optic north america ms coomler has over 30 years of entrepreneurial and senior management experience he's a published author and has developed patents and speaks regularly on photonics so thank you uh for joining us mr kumar you have the uh you have the the floor i guess we call it thank you thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important event uh it's a pleasure to be here and on one hand i'm representing yen optic i'm the president of unoptic north america an optic is a company with 4 400 employees all around the world but we've got manufacturing facilities here in florida at our headquarters but also in huntsville alabama in el paso texas and michigan and california so on one hand i'm representing an optic because we're growing in all those locations driven mostly by the semiconductor drive and chip shortage but also developing new medical instruments and working on next generation telecommunications we're growing but we're having a hard time filling those positions so i'm here to speak for eunoptic but i wanted to make it clear also that we're really in this all together in our industry we're working closely with alexis and katie and trent and we're all in the same boat trying to solve this problem and trying to grow our industry that we're working as well as we can together on sharing best practices and exchanging things like apprentice programs and alexis pointed out that in rochester we all came together and worked hard in different workshops and panels trying to find solutions so a pleasure to be part of this caucus it's a real honor thank you for the opportunity thank you jay for for your leadership and i i uh appreciate the sentiment that everyone is working together to try to really address this and we're going to get back to you to give you give you an opportunity to uh address some questions related to particularly your experience in the private sector and now um i want to uh turn to uh trent berg who has senator daines uh introduced as the president of montana photonics industry alliance uh mr burke is currently the program director for the photonics and laser technology program at gallatin college montana state university he joined gallaudet in college in 2016 after working in the photonics industry in the gallatin valley for 12 years mr berg also is a senior hardware engineer at aurora innovations incorporated uh trent uh the um the webinar is yours thank you congressman rally and thank you senator danes for for your great shout out your great words uh in your opening remarks um i could pretty much you know second everything alexa said uh from a motivational area workforce shortages are everywhere you know especially in our industry right now as you mentioned uh in the beginning commons congressman morelli you know nobody's avoiding this this issue right now and the pandemics only kind of exacerbated the issue to some level um you know i'm a strong believer in functioning ecosystems can make a big impact on any issue that we face the the folks represented here on the caucus represent a lot of the high functioning ecosystems in our nation florida arizona new york montana and you know obviously others colorado new mexico michigan stuff like that and i think it's really essential that we we capitalize on those really high functioning ecosystems to really attack this problem um and really a high functioning ecosystem in my opinion is is the ability of having a large basis of companies in our industry um having an educational system that can support that locally and then really you know good collaboration between with our with our government agencies as well to make sure that our voices are being heard and that we're doing the appropriate things together to address these issues um and really you know what alexis mentioned was you know how do we work together to grow workforce for this industry in my opinion i think it's it's very strongly focused around the ability of industry and academia to work very very closely together um this could be increased involvement in graduate research programs i know we're talking mostly technician basis here but industry sponsored research i think is a big area where we can get a lot of collaboration going there to make sure students are being trained in the appropriate fields as they come into the workforce and collaborate for increased technical education americom alexis that you mentioned is very critical in that and really some examples of what we've done here in montana as senator daines mentioned we have a really strong ecosystem here we have a very high density of optics of atomic companies we have a really high functioning engineering school that has optics and photonics emphasis at montana state university galvin college which is a two-year workforce development arm of montana state university has a really like we mentioned has a strong emphasis in optics and photonics and we have a very supportive government system here as well and really we had to attack this problem a little bit differently because montana is a rural state hasn't been historically well known for having an optics and photonics emphasis and an innovative hotbed in those areas so in 2015 the mpia that i represent worked with gallum college to really address the technician workforce starters that we had here we just didn't have a really good work workflow pipeline into montana from the other strong colleges like monroe and others around the nation so we work together to form the laser and technology program at gallon college it's an associate program a two-year program just like monroe community colleges and the key part about that it was industry driven right industry is the one that came up with the the skill sets that we needed that really addressed our our local emphasis and technology here um went to the gallon college worked together got it passed through the board of regents together did the surveys together and it was very a collaborative uh exercise there and really over the last five years we've graduated nearly 40 students out of that program and 100 employment in the local valley here and so and literally in four years we've erased a problem we had a massive technician workforce shortage issue five years ago and right now we do not have that and so i think those are examples that we want to take to other areas other ecosystems that we can grow upon and really make sure we focus on on doing that in these strong ecosystems where we can have that strong growth so i've worked with alexis in the past and the things that she's doing there are fantastic and the stuff that we're doing at gallon college to continue to grow that i think will help make a regional and national uh impact as well and really transitioning that to new industries also like quantum and other areas like that i think is going to be a big focus of ours in the future so so thank you guys again for for allowing me to be on this caucus and i look forward to an engaging conversation trent thanks so much i uh you know we're we're uh delighted to have you and also very much appreciate your comments about academia and the private sector working together i don't think we can uh do this without that uh you know ongoing very close collaboration uh let me introduce our final panelist uh to say uh a few words uh katie schwartz uh who's a senior design engineer at edmond optics uh tucson arizona office i promise i did not know when we put this together that katie comes from upstate new york so uh that's not why she's here she's accomplished she's uh responsible for executing optical and opto mechanical designs tolerancing analyses and prototype evaluations for both internal development and external customers ms schwartz uh joined edmund edmund optics in november of 2010 and has served in various capacities including as an optomechanical design engineer and an optical research engineer so without further ado ms schwartz thank you thank you so much congressman morelli for having me uh i was just absolutely thrilled when i first saw the caucus even hearing about it being formed and then being asked to be on the the panel as you mentioned i and i believe that you didn't know in that in advance i did grew up in western new york and i attended the university of rochester undergrad and i relocated to arizona to come down to the university of arizona in tucson so i have an undergrad and master's degree in optics and as you as you mentioned in the introduction have been in the industry with admin optics for the past 11 years and um i'm i've always been involved with the the optics community i love the term ecosystem that trent used for optics it's a very high functioning optics community nationally globally and locally here in arizona we have the optics valley industry cluster that is active here that is part of the statewide arizona technology council and i'm involved with both of those as well as uh one of the two major nonprofits that supports optics alexis had mentioned spie who hosted the optifab conference i i'm currently serving on their board of directors uh and so having experienced the rochester region the arizona region getting to see kind of an international flavor from spie and edmund optics where i work as a is a global manufacturer of optical components and subsystems you really get a flavor for the industry across all of those perspectives um admin epic slogan for the past number of years has been the future depends on optics and i think that's very apt because it's not the future would be better with some optics or the future is helped by optics like the future depends on optics it is a field that is unbelievable to me how many people are unaware of it because you use it and rely on it every single day we serve markets and semiconductor and chip crossing advanced materials processing in semicon defense and aerospace in biomedical doing diagnostics which obviously with covet has been a massive field this this past year and so the importance of maintaining a pipeline and a workforce is so important and it's it's funny we're having all these conversations now about workforce shortages with with covid and and the great resignation um but when i went into my undergrad in the early aughts at that time they were saying there's never enough workers there's 100 placements really well paying jobs and i don't think that's changed in that time so i would say we run on a continual workforce shortage uh in the over the past 20 years uh and i'm glad that we're having the conversations and and raising the awareness it is really critical uh to to all of our futures thanks for having me yeah thank you thanks uh for your comments and for all your good work and maybe i'll start um for you and for other other panelists to just touch on something you were just commenting on and that is that we really had workforce shortages prior to the pandemic and i remember visiting with alexis and visiting with some companies back in rochester prior to cobit and they were already talking about workforce shortages but i'm wondering if you if anyone can comment on how the hiring challenges have changed since kobit are there special barriers now that we need to be thoughtful about is it changed dramatically or is it simply the same thing only doubled or tripled since cobit so are there are there differences that are substantive that we're experiencing now than uh prior to the pandemic i'd be happy to start by answering that from the student's perspective and then i'll turn it over to jay to get some insight into how his company has been impacted by covid uh when covet hit in march of 2020 i immediately was concerned that i was going to lose all of my students in the program and we'd had this historic growth in the program there were five students when i started at mcc six years ago we now have 101 but i was really concerned i was going to lose the students because they'd be losing their jobs and if they were losing their jobs they wouldn't be able to afford to come to monroe community college many of the students in my program already work in the optics industry i was shocked to find out that every single student maintained their job because all of the optics companies were deemed essential so this was recall at a time when medical facilities were deemed essential and really not much else but the entire optics industry was deemed essential in fact my students were working more than they had worked before because optics is enabling technology in so many areas and specific to covid in the coast covid research and diagnostics and development of vaccines and the testing all optics enabled so from my perspective our program has grown tremendously but we aren't anywhere in the need yet to fill the need for technicians that we have not even in the rochester area here but jay perhaps could you add something a little bit more about what you saw yourself so uh we were definitely growing before covet as you've already said and the effect on us from kobit was mitigated by the fact that we're a diversified company we're selling it to a number of different markets so some markets like aviation automotive were heavily affected by coded but we were bolstered by the fact that other of our markets were still going strong i mean we managed to not have any layoffs or have to let anyone go i think the smart companies our industry continued investing continued hiring as best they possibly could and prepared for what we thought was going to come this year in 2021 so now the situation i think it is a one-time effect uh from covid where we've got a lot of demand from 2020 stacking up against 2021 demand a lot of development projects were delayed by our customers last year now they're being now we're being told ship as fast as you can we still want to launch that new product in next year even though we didn't start on it last year so quite a bit of pressure on all the workers throughout our industry but but the most important thing is all of the megatrends are going in the direction of demanding more optics and photonics content so whether you want to talk about healthcare aging workforce the promise of genome sequencing and personalized medicine advanced telecommunications our safety and security i mean all of these different areas and we're going to talk i think about some emerging markets a little bit later but these these these megatrends are driving all of our industry so it's a one-time effect from kobit but we're on uh a 20-year growth uh track like katie just mentioned and i think it's we're experiencing that across the country and around the world for that matter yeah and and and has has the pandemic made it more difficult to attract workers or is it or is that does that seem sort of like what you have been experiencing prior to the the pandemic thank you uh for that second question so i think it's made it challenging it was very disruptive for families for people taking care of their kids a lot of people were displaced so i would say that the community colleges that we work with really did struggle with input with finding students and there was an interruption i think it's fair to say i hope at both indian river and at valencia there was an impact from covid that reduced the amount of students to a certain extent but even beyond the uh the schools the ability we we struggle now uh with being able to recruit and i do think it's exasperated by the code yeah so jay i want to just um ask you also about so you talked a little bit about industry trends um that are going to affect the need for technicians as the you know this space continues to be a requirement for so many different industries um sure and uh and happy to have you expand upon that but i'm also curious as to because you're an international company are the facilities overseas facing the same problems in terms of labor shortages are there any tactics or things being done abroad that we might learn from and that we should consider implementing here so overseas uh we're driven by the same two main factors of the chip shortage and the semiconductor growth which is driven by the internet of things and autonomous vehicles and a lot of other factors and then consumer electronics so everything related to the devices that you carry around in your pocket your tablets and then new topics like ar vr that's all driving the optics industry across the board and that's definitely a global topic as you know a lot of that production is in asia so as far as what we're doing differently in other parts of the world i mean the one comment i can make is that certainly i think there's stronger trade school programs in germany especially and i think through it's fair to say throughout europe so there's that doesn't mean that that solves the problem there's still high competition for qualified applicants and for for new employees but i i think that somehow maybe there's a bigger acceptance or appreciation of the trade schools and maybe it's just more established channels and ecosystems like trent was talking about where um indiana in our headquarters in germany i mean a number of schools they're all feeding the companies but still a high competition for for every single qualified student yeah i wonder uh trent if if if you have anything to add to that and also love to ask if folks have had a chance to look at the national apprentice act which would really expand apprentice opportunities away from sort of the traditional industries where we think of them and really try to get them into industries that have not typically had pre-apprentice and apprentice programs and whether or not that's something that you think would be a value here but trent did you have any additional thoughts i mean i'll second what what jay said i mean we've continued to see growth in our industry here in montana we're in a lot of high-tech growth areas quantum lidar autonomous vehicles gas mapping high power lasers defense type stuff where none of that slowed down really at all you know so i would say the same things that happened at inoptic as far as people displaced workers you know causing a backlog of work that now we're facing in a very large way to get uncovered from that and get back to our deliverables is the biggest challenge right now i wouldn't say hiring is a big challenge right now i think people want to come back to the workforce i think it's the lower paying jobs we're having a bigger struggle on you know getting workforce in shipping and receiving administrative things of that nature um and so regarding your question about the apprenticeship program it's a really interesting question too and i think alexis would be good to to chime in here there's kind of a two different models you can think about as far as the apprenticeship program where it's not maybe work through a community college or a technical college it's just on-the-job training and we've we've definitely looked at those programs here in montana to see if it made sense to spin up an apprenticeship program for optics and photonics we you know steered away from that to the two-year associates degree a lot of our like industries here in montana you know being in high power lasers lidar sensors autonomous vehicles quantum really do need that that sort of formal education background to be able to succeed in those industries and not only work on the manufacturing floor but work as engineering technicians which is essentially an engineering job just with a two-year degree and so we've most certainly geared our efforts towards really strengthening our two-year program as jay mentioned we did see a very large impact in enrollment and i think one area where the caucus can really help is taking these high functioning technical colleges that exist like monroe front range galton college indian hills indian river and making sure we do a good job to help promote those programs as areas where you should go here to get these degrees there should be no reason whatsoever that any of these programs are under enrolled if we work together to make sure that they're properly promoted and all of those programs i think have the ability to grow as well in size we could double or triple our capacity you know with some reasonable amount of funding but you have to have the recruiting pipeline the backlog of students that want to take that program to be able to sort of justify that growth so i would say to start to answer your question i think apprenticeship programs can apply i think they can apply to the areas where we don't really need that two-year formal education where potentially a certificate or an apprenticeship could apply to that but the areas that i'm mostly focused on that i mentioned i feel like the two-year education is very important and potentially you could supplement that with a an apprenticeship as well that could maybe transfer nationally but i do feel like the the aas and photonics and laser technology or whatever you want to call it uh electronic technician programs they're all called something slightly different they're all the same vein there but i would i would turn it over to alexis to ask her opinion on that and before before i do that alexis just to clarify when we sort of use the word technician the way that you've just described it really implies at least a two-year degree to be at that level is that sort of generally accepted throughout the industry so when i'm using the term technician level of training does that typically imply at least a two-year degree and maybe it can not necessarily i mean alexis can comment as well but you know you know we call it mostly in montana we use the term assemblers as doing the more generic work that does not necessarily need a tier education actually they may prefer that it doesn't so they don't have to pay quite the salary they would have to to a person with it with a degree and so i think there's levels inside of a company where you potentially don't need that that formal education and they would still be called a technician but potentially an assembler an optomechanical assembler um but you know as you sort of be the integrator of systems or high power lasers definitely the two-year formal background is is is very much preferred and that was part of our survey we did at galton college of our employers is do you need do you want a two-year formal education for your technicians and the answer was overwhelmingly yes for the higher-end positions within those companies gotcha alexis did you have something to add to that yes yes please the way i often will differentiate the role of a technician is compared to someone who would have an engineer an engineering background engineer is someone who would typically have a bachelor's master's phd who would likely sit at a computer and design a system a technician is someone who works with their hands side by side with engineers to manufacture to test to measure to do the assembly as trent mentioned people who make excellent optics technicians are artists musicians gamers chefs automobile mechanics bicycle mechanics athletes because they have excellent hand-eye coordination and they may have no degree at all they may directly come from the football field into an optics company to be a technician they may pursue a one-year certificate program they may have a two-year associate's degree when we think about someone who has a bachelor's of masters or phd that's how we would differentiate the engineers from from the technician i would like to also follow up a little bit more detail on the apprenticeship program that we are rolling out around the country and because the optics and photonics industry is what's securing our safety from as a nation from a national perspective i secured a 4.4 million dollar grant from the department of defense for our optics program here at monroe community college and a portion of that is to roll out a nationwide precision optics apprenticeship i have a colleague i hired named ross mccally and his job is to work with companies like jays and yen optic to create an apprenticeship program around the entire united states so as jay was mentioning the german model has been one that for centuries has worked really well apprenticeships are part of that so an apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job learning and related instruction that's taught in the classroom type environment so what we have done at monroe community college is take our optics classes and make them online so that now we can provide that related instruction to companies outside of the rochester area so you don't have to sit in a classroom in rochester in order to receive education from mcc so what we are doing now is rolling out this apprenticeship program around the country because if we think about all the other trades like plumbers welders electricians they have trade schools they have apprenticeship programs and in precision optics we don't have that so please contact me and i will put you in touch with my colleague ross mccally if you are with a company or interested in starting an apprenticeship program because we really do see this as the long-term solution to the workforce shortage within our industry yeah and i think one of the things that i'd say is the national apprenticeship act which is past the house and trying to get a hearing in the senate does that it really looking i mean you see that the success of apprentice programs for employees and employers and moving them to sort of non-traditional areas is something that i think we think uh in the house we think makes a fair amount of sense um and i don't know katie were you trying to jump in i don't want to yeah i i just wanted to mention that you know pima community college in tucson right now has been talking with alexis about the program that they've rolled out in mcc and looking to emulate that and starting to um run classes and looking at an apprenticeship program i just wanted to echo one of jay's statements that he said uh quickly but i think is really important is that the us in general has de-emphasized societally two-year programs and the value of of you know the trade uh part of our industry and so we feel that you know even outside of optics technicians um i think just with traditional machining knowledge uh among our our engineering staff and our technician staff so i do think you know i can't necessarily speak to how that's viewed internationally but at least in the us i think re-emphasizing getting more people interested in a two-year degree we really moved i think to a place where a bachelor's degree is kind of expected or needed for everything to the point where now people with bachelor's degrees and myself with a master's degree have gone and taken community classes for continuing education around trade work and working with our hands and making sure we can you know be functional in a lab alongside technicians uh so i think a re-emphasis on two-year trades is could be a very important part of the of the caucus and and our international education system so i think it's a great point i think trent mentioned this earlier that there's nothing that precludes having this sort of part formal education part apprenticeship program i mean sort of live in these you know ways of thinking about things that traditionally have been the case for decades but there's certainly no reason why you couldn't combine those experiences and really help suit i noticed when alexa was going through the list of people like football players and athletes and she had a whole list of people that could become technicians in space she did not mention members of congress so i i i'm sure probably she was probably well to avoid us but um and i certainly um don't think i have the skills to do it but but i am curious where are people coming right now into that space are they coming right out of high school are we seeing people come out of the military so what are the demographics i wonder if alexis uh katie if you could um or anyone trent certainly um and uh uh and jay who's in the private sector where are people coming from to get into these programs sure i'd be happy to to start and then i'll hand it over to you katie we are seeing historic growth in our program come from a variety of different routes one is straight from high school so we have 16 high schools in the rochester area who where there are teachers in high school teaching my introduction to optics mcc course so those high school students receive mcc credit in high school that's helping drive some of the enrollment we're also seeing a lot of career changers people who are bartenders their baristas they're looking for career opportunities and they've heard about optics and photonics and we all have these enabling technologies right in our pockets and so they now are becoming aware of the field that exists surrounding them and so they're coming that way we do have some people who join us from the military people who have served overseas and they're using optics on a day-to-day basis are then coming back for their formal education and we have a lot of students who are already working for optics companies perhaps they were those artists those musicians etc from high school who went to work right away for an optics company and then they're coming back for the formal education as well and i also wanted to make one additional point and just to follow briefly on the apprenticeship discussion we were having through the apprenticeship program the way that we have structured it the apprentices themselves end up earning their associate's degree through this path so just as you were saying congressman morelli about combining the two that's precisely what we're trying to do and really it does end up being a benefit for both the apprentice as well as the company too so we're seeing growth in all sorts of areas i mean people are becoming really interested in this area but let me turn it over to katie and you can add in your other thoughts on where you're seeing our our field grow yeah so i think for us our primary pipeline is certainly the local community colleges and universities admin optics is headquartered in barrington new jersey and they have very strong ties to the two and four-year colleges around there i will say the optics industry gets creative about where it recruits from i mean there's just not enough optics programs to support hiring people with optics degrees so we pretty much pull from any engineering um or physics type background uh for our engineers um for people with two-year degrees if you can work with your hands and like like i said that's a lot of different disciplines we train you internally so i think a lot of the optics industry does what edmund optics does and it's pull people who have the aptitude um who have some knowledge of general engineering and assembly and then we bring them in-house and and teach them the specifics of optical assemblies and optical engineering uh at the i'm sorry no i was just going to ask before we started um you talked about and alexis about how you got into the industry um when you were in high school you were sort of exposed to it were you and i hate to ask you like one data point but were you like an ap physics math whiz is that what was your background that you suddenly thought well this is really kind of an interesting thing and it is is you know is is that the sort of level or what are we looking for in terms of you know raw talent for for kids even in high school to introduce them to what we do yeah so yes i did have the good fortune of running into alexis as a senior in high school uh and ending up in the optics industry and if you ask anyone in optics overwhelmingly the overwhelming majority of people stumble into it it is not a field that people know when their kids or is advertised in school counselors offices um they they kind of stumble upon it being in the industry or having a relative or something like that um i'll say i was i was a good student in school but man physics never quite clicked for me which is kind of an odd thing to say as as an obvious engineer um but traditional physics was i was never all that interested in and i i liked numbers i'll say i liked numbers when i was a student and um when i learned about optics it just seemed like a really interesting applied field uh to take math and and numbers and knowledge and apply them to real world problems and technology that could help people so that's what caught my interest i think in general if you're going down an engineering track uh you know they're tough programs you do need uh you know a strong i'd say background in math or or science um but i think that's different when you're talking about a technician um somebody that works with their hands i don't think we have plenty of people that i don't even bother looking at their gpa when we interview them because i don't care um what i catch is if they were involved with like alexa said earlier like they work in their local garage and help out on the weekend because they like cars or they've built up their own software package for you know their fantasy football team or you know all sorts of things and that's the type of thing that catches my attention more than grades in school um so i do think it's important to to understand the amount of places you can take your education within the optics industry we have people in sales we have people in marketing we have people in hard technical degrees but all of that has to kind of enable the industry to to go forward um so whether you work with your hands or like working a computer with people or by yourself i mean there's there's a place uh in the industry um just to finish my thought process before on the um where we're recruiting from um here in tucson the university of arizona is certainly kind of the epicenter of supporting the local industry i think over half of our office of 30 so people here is degreed from arizona um and that has certainly generated the whole kind of startup ecosystem that we have down here and um i i think having that local bubble of a of a pipeline is really important and i think you hear it and that's why we have a representative from rochester and montana and florida and tucson because everyone's created their own local structure um so having national attention and national structure i think can really help pull that all together yeah i'm sort of curious too as it relates to you know there's a lot of talk around uh diversity trying to make sure that um we open up and give opportunities to people of color to women who traditionally haven't been well represented in the stem industries um how and maybe jay and and um and katie can sort of address it in the private sector how are you addressing that is that a concern are there special things that you're doing to try to reach out to non-traditional communities it's a it's a first off it's a big concern and a big area of focus for unoptic and i think for our entire optics industry and and you can't increase the diversity of your workforce just by trying or hoping right you really have to change your approach like katie said you have to cast a wide net but you have to recruit in different platforms you have to look for uh new strategies for recruiting a more diverse workforce which takes planning which takes execution so you don't just hope it hope to get there it's like hoping to be able to run a marathon so you have to change our approach and i'm not the best qualified person to say tactically every little step that we're doing to do that i just am very proud of our team that they've been able to increase the diversity uh here at yen optic over the last few years but it's it's a double challenge uh there's a challenge to fill positions but we're committed to a more diverse workforce and one thing that i would say about the great story uh with katie uh meeting alexis i think everyone that's listening on this uh this event realizes that we can all go back to basically one teacher or one person that inspired us and we collectively everyone that's listening in the caucus we have to use our a little bit of our time and a little bit of our passion to go and either visit the high school classes or just inspire the people you naturally come in contact with at school with your kids or at your church or wherever and use events like the landing of the mars rover where it's sexy and it's exciting for 8th graders and 10th graders and 12th graders we have to do that because it works right it actually works that katie had a fire that was lit in her and she was excited about learning more about it so we need programs and educational platforms for sure but it's also really about being able to tell why you're so passionate about the optics industry and just changing the life of one or two students along the way well it really is interesting to say that one of the things that i hope that we might be able to do as part of the optics and photonics cluster is to bring some of that technology here to expose it to members of congress and policy makers i i think i was telling you before we came on in the last couple weeks i've been to the uh laser lab for energetics at the university of rochester and i was at a um a private sector facility that deals with lenses and lasers and my i literally my mind was blown to go through and see the technologies and the work that they're doing and the people that were engaged in it it really is eye-opening and frankly to someone who's completely uninitiated and a layperson you know to think about the applications now that that are required and i think it was either alexis or katie said at the outset that these aren't just nice things to have these are essential to our lives whether it's healthcare or transportation or communications um but i think the more we expose people as you said uh jay and really can excite people about the the challenges i want to just ask trent you know you mentioned earlier that you weren't having as much of a challenge in montana with workforce shortages i just wonder if you could talk a little bit how are your companies and the colleges working together to address it and what strategies do you think are being successful that that we should think about implementing in other places yeah um well i already mentioned in my opening statements about the work that the mpia which is the montana photonics industry alliance did with gallatin college to essentially solve the local workforce problem so i really really emphasized that in my opening statements about that collaboration that this was an industry driven and a very collaborative work with with the college itself so i think that's really really important we're continuing to work with montana state university the graduate programs there to really emphasize to our local companies and regional companies about doing more industry sponsored research get projects that are non-proprietary into the university system so they're being trained on the actual technology they're going to be working on when they leave the leave the universe or the academic setting and i think that's really really important we're also working together i think a lot of the other clusters rochester you know arizona um have you know essentially centers of excellence florida creole things of that nature i think those are really important incubators for a lot of that stuff and i think it's important from a national perspective to take advantage of the ecosystems that we have and really grow those with these centers of excellence that really bring in you know academia government and industry all together to collaborate to push things forward and it's something that we're actively working on at montana state university with the mpia to go after an engineering research center to really bolster that and create a really strong collaboration between all those entities and it inherently solved the workforce issues as well so you know i think my statements aren't complex in nature but i think oftentimes industry and academia can be siloed and you know they do their own research and it's not really applicable fully to the to the the the work that's being done in the local community there and i'm we're trying hard of the mpaa to break those silos down and and make sure that there's you know cross-contamination between industry work and and academia research programs you know work on internship programs at the community college you know work on these apprenticeship programs as well and i think that's really the answer in my opinion and really drive these centers of excellence so in whatever whatever field that we're in in optics and photonics into these these strong ecosystems that can really take that and grow it and then just a few other comments too on lexus what you said about recruitment that's spot-on military people are fantastic they love coming into the program and working i also think it's important that you know the dropout rates at the four-year education level are very very high right now and what we've done is deployed a program at gallon college to work with montana state university engineering advisors to make sure that if people have decided that they want to leave engineering let's not let them leave the university system let's let's try to capture those people in the technician workforce because a lot of them their complaints are i don't get my hands on stuff until year two or three of the program well in these technician programs you get your hands you know dirty in the first day of these programs right so we've had a lot of success you know eliminating the dropout rate at four-year and pulling them into the two-year workforce and they're really some of the most fantastic outstanding students along with the females due to their their attention to detail and the military folks as far as their background technology and their willingness and desire to be part of a team and so i think all that's really important as well when you talk about recruitment and things of that nature but i think to answer your question i feel like i addressed that but if you have any further questions congressman let me know well thanks that what's really also helpful is the notion that this is a career ladder you could literally start out out of high school get a two-year degree you can keep working at and continue to build to go from an assembler technician to ultimately to an engineer as alexis described it we just have a couple minutes one thing i'm just curious about because it's sort of like where the rubber hits the road so um talk to our listeners about the quality of the job sort of salary prospects career longevity opportunity for growth can anyone just sort of give a you know obviously it will vary from region to region industry to industry and and you know along the that career ladder but what what can you tell us about that anybody yeah i'd like to take that one if that's our that's sorry um so sbie puts out a global salary survey every year it's available on their website it has some great information it breaks down by um looking at different countries looking at different sectors also talks about diversity and demographics that you had mentioned earlier um so this past year the median salary in u.s for employees in the optics and photonics industry was over 133 000 uh salary for technicians the national median right now is about a little over thirty dollars an hour and i don't know if lexis you might have some different local numbers um but about a 63 000 salary is the median for technicians and they can typically expect to start around a 45 to 55k starting salary with a with a two-year degree um the other thing that is i wanted to mention that i think it's important for the the people who are listening this call is the optics industry is a bit uh unique in the sense that it is largely comprised of small and medium-sized enterprises so there's not a lot of you know ges or you know major ibm companies in optics the people supplying optics and photonics companies um some of the numbers i pulled out of the industry report that we have is that the global photonics components revenue globally is around 282 billion dollars revenue but 75 percent of the companies in optics globally have a less than 10 million dollar revenue stream and so the large majority of the companies are small that are supporting this industry and so when we talk about recruiting and diversity it's important but a lot of them don't have um the large enabled human resources systems and things like that to truly put the effort into a diversity program admin optics we've definitely worked on having a dni committee that addresses diversity we look at pay gaps and things like that but women still only represent about 20 percent of the optics and photonics industry there's still a wage gap although it's much less in the early years and much more pronounced later stages in career but i think that's important to understand about the the industry when you talk about it and when you talk about other diversities i noticed one of the people in the chat mentioned there's lots of different diversities besides gender i mean black representation right now in optics photonics and physics is less than one to two percent um so there's lots of work to be to be done there and i think with a workforce shortage it makes the ground fertile for recruiting from all aspects of our society that's for that certainly sure um i hope to get to questions around sort of supply chain and manufacturing in the united states unfortunately i want to be respectful everyone's time so we'll do that in a later panel but i just want to ask if there's any final thoughts by our panelists before i uh close this uh this session any additional thoughts i would just like to add that we are heavily recruiting more students so please tell your friends your family members we'll even take your enemies send them our way into our industry and we really are growing like crazy we're the technology that's enabling the future advancements things like charging your smartphone only once a month that technology is being developed right now and we just need more people and we're diversifying we're 30 percent female 28 students of color here in our optics program at mcc and looking to continue to grow that as well thank you for this opportunity for the great work and please contact me with any other additional follow-up yeah i think anyone on the panel will be happy to talk more with anyone willing to support objects of photonics so we're all here for that thank you yeah and i'll second alexis right galton college is growing they need more people spread the word let's get people in the workforce let's do youth outreach the mpia is doing a lot of youth outreach with our ymca montana science center there's no reason we can't get people excited about it kids love lasers they love light um it's easy to grab people's attentions we should have no problem with workforce if we get out there and really reach out to our middle school and high schools and and really get spread the word to get our enrollment up in our graduate programs and our technical programs as well so appreciate the opportunity as well and and definitely let's let's get the word out there jay it's a solvable problem that's the good news i mean if we work together and we just have to have our stories be able to tell the story like you said congressman it's it's complicated and it's it's complex but we need to be able to tell a clear and simple stories about why we're so excited about our career well thank you i did learn one thing apparently to run a marathon you need a plan which may explain a lot about my lack of success in marathon so um but i do want to thank our panelists for joining this critical discussion today uh to my optics and photonics caucus partners and i'm sorry that uh representative mass wasn't able to join us but we'll certainly get him on our next session uh thank them for helping to lead the effort to all our listeners for tuning in today i hope to spend an illuminating discussion uh pun intended um and hopefully we'll get together to get together soon if we we weren't able to get to the questions in the chat but my team will be following up uh with each of you and as it relates to my team i want to give a big shout out to joe stiles my legislative director who does so much work in this space to bring all this together and to try to make me look at least somewhat knowledgeable on these subjects so i appreciate all the work that she does and i encourage our congressional stakeholders listening to consider joining our bipartisan bicameral caucus and for our industry experts um encourage your representatives to join us in this important work so again thank you so much your panelists for all the work you do for being here today and thank all of you god bless thank you so much thank you

mr. Stuber for five minutes Thank You mr. Jarrett and thank you for allowing me to ask some questions mr. Hoffman thank you for appearing today on behalf of the cattlemen the Duluth News Tribune a major publication in my district in Minnesota spoke to a farmer that lost a confirmed six head of cattle in one year to wolf kills can you estimate the economic impact this would have had on this farmer in northern Minnesota it's hard for me to really guess what that would be I know in the case of applying a loss in Oregon that's just a very small portion of the actual losses there's the emotional loss as well as the economic loss but also there's many studies that show and and we know this from animals coming back from grazing that that for every one you find and it's confirmed there's many more that you just don't know what happened what you think you know because there's a wolf pack living right there but so so anyway the impact would be much greater than just the animal I can assure you that and then that second question is like your state of Oregon Minnesota has had a successful management program for the gray wolf can you speak to why a estate management is more effective than the federal government well in my in my I guess my opinion there's there's many more staff for example we have two-thirds of our state that is still federally delisted which is therefore under their management there is one endangered species person assigned to the state at a Central Oregon and half of his time annually spent on walls so two thirds of the state is managed an endangered species such as a wolf half time so and the state obviously has many more resources local that can respond to the all the other pieces and parts about wolf thank you very much for those answers and then my second question were are gonna be to mr. Ashe during your tenure as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service the agency opted to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list in Minnesota why did your agency decide to take the gray wolf off the endangered species list because the scientists in the Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the gray wolf was recovered and and was and and was and should be delisting and removed from the Endangered Species Act and then to follow up do you agree with your agency's decision to delist the wolves or do you agree with the judicial activism of the DC Circuit Court's decision to list them back to Minnesota and I see you're smiling I think I know your answer go ahead I certainly agree with the agency's position I will say my position is a little bit sobered of late because I see the return of a philosophy particularly within a few western states about the kind of return to a view of wolves as as vermin and predators that need to be persecuted and so I believe that wolves are recovered I believe that our state partners have been have been invaluable partners in that but it wouldn't have happened without the leadership of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and and so again it's not a one or the other it's both and but I do see some disturbing trends today about state-based management in some states which wouldn't Minnesota be one of your concerns no sir okay thank you very much and I appreciate it and to mr. Huffman I will just say that you know we've had cattle killed we've had domestic animals taken right from their yards from wolves so you know the when I talked to people in northern Minnesota when they talk about you talk about the devastation when the kids come home and see the family pet disintegrated from wolves it's it's quite disturbing and and I I believe the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources they're well staffed and would do a very good job in the management and I know the Minnesota deer hunters Association and other groups agree as well so mr. chair that's all the questioning I appreciate this opportunity thank you

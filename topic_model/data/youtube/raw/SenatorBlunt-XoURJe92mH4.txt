the president today expressed some totally justified frustration in the continued lack of cooperation from the other side and our ability to get nominations through the Senate and to work the Intel committee today voted out the John Radcliffe nomination to be the Director of National Intelligence in almost any other time a nominee of that importance would not be left to wait for another couple of weeks but would get this done now you could do this with cooperation today or tomorrow nobody thinks that's likely to happen and that's unfortunate the president's frustrated by that we'll vote later today on Trey Trainor to add the fourth member and the even number back to an even number of Republicans and Democrats on the federal election commission Trey Traynor was nominated by the president in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and finally we've worked through all the obstacles to get that nomination to the floor and get the FEC back in business you know a lot of complicating things happen with the new laws and the new ability to raise money for other entities Vice President Biden just announced this week his committee did a structure to allow him to raise six hundred and twenty thousand six hundred dollars from one person for all the various groups he'd be raising money for I'm sure that that's legal but I'm also sure that we need an FEC in place to look at any challenges to that or any other issue so the FEC could actually open an investigation on anything which they have not been able to do for eight months now the longest time ever that the FEC did not have a working majority will do something about that today but there are other nominations that easily could have been dealt with this week if we'd had cooperation on putting people in play that should be in place to run the government and protect the country

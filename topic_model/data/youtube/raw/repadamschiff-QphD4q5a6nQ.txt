california congressman adam schiff congressman schiff thanks for being with us yes we have heard a lot of shocking and disturbing testimony coming out of these hearings but yesterday's many would say was at a whole new level how would you describe the reaction to hearing what cassidy hutchinson had to say yesterday in her sworn testimony well it was shocking and i found most difficult to believe but but only because it is so shocking the president on the mall uh there he is being told that these uh participants in the mob don't want to go through the magnetometers not because there's a weight but because they'll have to take their weapons away and the president's response is take the magnetometers down take the magnetometers down they don't they're not here to hurt me these are my people let them in and he wants to march with this armed crowd to the capitol uh to me that's the most powerful evidence we have yet of the presence of knowledge that the crowd was armed his willingness to bring that armed mob to the capitol and uh and incite what uh what followed so um very credible witness uh very powerful testimony uh and shocking uh at the same time congressman can you give us more insight into how this happened you didn't have a hearing a public hearing scheduled for this week and this witness is someone you are aware of but then apparently new information that you all wanted to get out and get out in a hurry well we thought it was important to get this information before the american people to let them know exactly the new information that we were gathering but also to push back against the potential intimidation of witnesses we want to let people know that maybe signaling or trying to influence witness testimony that we take that very seriously that we will confront that and if necessary we will refer any kind of intimidation to the justice department we also want to be able to use this information to encourage other witnesses to come forward and that was also an important part of our calculus and moving up this witness's testimony to yesterday and congressman one of the many disturbing claims hutchinson made yesterday was what happened in that vehicle in the presidential vehicle with the secret service agent i know that there has been some push back we know that trump has disputed those claims that he lunged at the secret service agent that he maybe even grabbed the steering wheel i know you've had some private testimony uh taking place what do you make of the pushback and is there any way to corroborate what hutchinson testified to well look anyone that wants to come in and testify under oath about any of these incidents we welcome their testimony i found cassie hutchinson to be a very credible witness you know speaking as a former prosecutor she was very careful to tell us what she knew she was very careful to tell us what she was present for and witnessed he was careful to tell us what she heard and to tell us what she didn't know and i find that a very uh strong edition of the reliability of a witness so i found her very credible anyone who wants to take issue with anything she said should come in and testify to us under oath and congressman has been back and forth and some think uh you are not necessarily there to refer criminal charges to the justice department for former president trump but did you hear anything yesterday that made things rise to an even higher level of maybe something that took place on january 6th that gets you closer to thinking that president trump did in fact commit crimes and you now have testimony that's closer to being evidence of that well even before this testimony i agreed with the judge in california the federal judge of california that there was evidence that the former president was engaged in likely multiple uh criminal acts uh the acts that violated our criminal laws but yesterday i think the justice department hurt as we did testimony of the president's knowledge of the fact that the crowd was armed his interest in taking down the magnetometers as i mentioned to let that armed crowd go with their weapons to the capitol his eagerness to march with him to the capitol this is all important evidence i believe that goes to his knowledge his intent his culpability his mental state so i i'm sure the justice department was watching watching carefully whether they think there's sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt will be a decision they have to make but i do think there's certainly sufficient evidence that warrants an investigation into the former president and congressman finally we heard you mentioned potential witness intimidation we also heard from congresswoman liz chaney referencing the same thing in her closing remarks is there any proof any evidence of that having actually occurred well look i think the issue of witness intimidation is a very serious one and we have seen it in other investigations in the past you'll remember that donald trump was tweeting at attacking ambassador marie ivanovich in the middle of her testimony just last week we saw the president issue a statement attacking republican arizona speaker rusty bowers just before his testimony and if other of the president former president's enablers are also contacting witnesses to try to influence their testimony that is a very serious problem and we'll be discussing as a committee what we should do in any particular case well congressman shift i know you've got more work to do important work certainly uh and americans are watching so thank you so much for spending a little time with us and i'm sure we'll see you again all right i look forward to it thank you

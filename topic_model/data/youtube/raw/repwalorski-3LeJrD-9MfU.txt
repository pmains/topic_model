Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in support of HR 1759 the building on reemployment improvements to deliver good employment for workers also known as the bridge for workers Act which I have worked on with my colleagues representatives Murphy and LaHood this legislation builds upon the bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 where we made a significant step forward in helping those unemployed through no fault of their own by pairing unemployment benefits certain with services over the last few decades there's been a focus on automation that has removed all human interaction from the benefit claims process beneficiaries really have become nothing more than a numbered enter into a spreadsheet or into a computer database during the last recession we saw that merely providing 99 weeks of unemployment benefits was not enough to help individuals return to the workforce that's why in 2012 we offered reemployment services and eligibility assessments known as Reese's to the long-term unemployed based on successful state efforts to engage UI beneficiaries since the recession many states have rebranded unemployment to repoint and focused on efforts to provide rapid reemployment because it's better for workers their families and an economy where we have 1 million more job openings than we have employed the bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provides States with funding certainty so they can invest in these services and serve greater numbers of workers that's why HR 1759 is so important it makes permanent a technical correction first made in FY 2019 appropriations this bill clarifies that reemployment services and eligibility assessments shall promote quicker reemployment to shorten benefit durations for all unemployment insurance claimants not just those likely to exhaust unemployment benefits in my home state of Indiana ERISA was redesigned in 2016 to assist UI claimants through early intervention to aid in a quicker return to meaningful employment and eliminate UI fraud Indiana's risa program is twofold the initial risa expects beneficiaries to make an in-person visit to a work 1 Center and approximately the 6th week of benefit during that visit they attended orientation to learn more about these services and then meet with a Risa counselor for a one-on-one assessment interview to develop an individual reemployment plan that plan may include workshops or improved job search or interviewing skills or referrals to other support services beyond the UI agency any of the Risa initial participants who are still collecting at the 15th week of their UI claim are contacted for re-engagement as a part of the subsequent Risa program these long-term claimants are brought in for a one-on-one reassessment interview to determine if additional barriers to reemployment are present at any point in the process where it becomes apparent that additional more intensive services are needed the customer then moves into the workforce system to gain more skills Risa's are a valuable reemployment tool for those that have lost their jobs through no fault of their own again I urge support of HR 1 759 and I reserve the balance of my time

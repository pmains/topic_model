Electrical Technologies should we be investing in and are we investing enough in these areas some that come to mind are quantum artificial intelligence and machine learning nanotechnology robotics even gene editing and synthetic biology that's question 1 question 2 is any strategic areas of concern where you would recommend a rapid acceleration of development so that we are better postured for that 10 20 30 year outlook that you noted dr. Mankin so I'll start with you I think that actually your list is a good one uh-huh and I think that's I think that's the right list and I think the nature of R&D is in general within limits the more resources the better because you don't know what's gonna pay off when it's gonna pay off to take the the example of directed energy that was that was raised earlier directed energy has reliably been sort of five or ten years out for my adult professional career except I think now we are actually at a stage where ret we're getting there so forecasting breakthroughs can be difficult so I think I think more resources are needed for those areas I think in terms of where areas where were where we may be falling behind many of the same areas I would I would put hypersonics in there as well I think that's an that's an area of of concern AI most certainly and and quondam most most certainly as well mr. Thomas yeah I think I think that's a great list that you've got a couple things one is that during the Cold War the United States was able to sustain technological leads across the board we just we just ran up everything I don't know if we're gonna have the fiscal luxury of doing that in the common the competition's that are coming so we're gonna have to be more selective I think your list is an excellent one in terms of how we think about perhaps narrowing scope I think the other is really think about what are the applications practically and in two ways one how are they going to change the sources of national wealth in the future how do you how do you get rich as you look out 30 years from some of these technologies and what what's the impact of that on our on our broader society and economy but then there's the more limited question of what are the military applications going to be and how is this potentially going to change the way wars are fought and in a number of these technologies quantum for instance it really happens across the board it changes our ability to sense it's going to change communications it's going to change computation and in ways that could overthrow kind of the existing warfare regime that would that we have today with super-sensitive sensors that can detect magnetic anomalies and things like that that are really beyond our scope today mr. schary so you heard my some of my views on this and in the last hearing I think that if I had to choose to prioritize I would focus things and information based technologies those are things were we're seeing most rapid advances and there's a lot of intersection and synergy among them and so relationships between for example artificial intelligence being able to then process large amounts of data and having effects on for example synthetic biology it's not to say there other areas like direct energy hypersonics they're not important they are important DoD needs to invest there because we're not seeing commercial investments in those places right Google's not going to go build a hypersonic weapon we have to do that but I think we're more likely to see the payoff in information based technologies they're more likely to mature or fastest and change warfare most significantly I have 30 seconds left you know as we consider making sure that we're maintaining an edge in 21st century technologies I'm concerned about our ability to enact national level whole of society plans obviously China has a distinct advantage just in their top-down whole-of-government approach what can we do to improve our national level coordination plans when it comes to this technological development

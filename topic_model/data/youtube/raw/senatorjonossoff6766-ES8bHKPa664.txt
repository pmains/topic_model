ms osborne appreciate that and another uh topic of great interest across georgia is the electrification of our bus fleet i've been working with mayor miller in macon advancing the electrification of macon's bus fleet as a top priority can you comment on how that can improve quality of life for the people of macon absolutely uh you know investing in clean transportation in terms of an efficient mode of travel light transit and clean vehicles like electric uh transit vehicles is incredibly important uh as uh senator warren mentioned it isn't just about climate it's about gas engines that emit pollution that causes heart and lung disease that have contributed to the very pre-existing conditions that make people more vulnerable to coven so ensuring that the vehicles that the the federal government is supporting are not contributing to those public health uh problems which greatly impact black and brown communities 24 to 25 more than white communities is going to be a part of uh you know being a responsible citizen uh but also in making sure that as we invest in clean uh vehicles that we're expanding service so that the same people were trying to protect are uh getting more access to the things they need uh that's the that's the one-two punch that's going to really support uh better equity and better outcomes

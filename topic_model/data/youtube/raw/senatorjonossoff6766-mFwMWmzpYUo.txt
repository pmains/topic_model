SEN. DURBIN: THANK YOU, SENATOR KENNEDY. SENATOR ALSO? SEN. OSSOFF: DIRECTOR WRAY, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I WANT TO COMMEND YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND ONGOING WORK. I KNOW YOU HAVE A NEW SAC THERE. WE WISH HER THE BEST IN HER NEW ROLE. SENATOR GRASSLEY AND I RECENTLY INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN FEDERAL PROTECTIONS OF CHILDREN SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION ONLINE. IN FACT, THE ATLANTA FIELD OFFICE RECENTLY ISSUED A WARNING TO GEORGIA PARENTS AND CHILDREN ABOUT AN INCREASE IN SEXTORTION CASES, WHERE ADULTS MANIPULATE MINORS INTO ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY OR ASK LICIT PHOTOS, AND THEN EXTORT THOSE CHILDREN OR THEIR FAMILIES FOR MONEY. WILL YOU COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN FROM ONLINE ABUSE AT THE FBI AND TELL US ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE DOING TO THAT END? DIR. WRAY: I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. IT IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY AND HAS ONLY INCREASED IN IMPORTANCE. SEXTORTION, IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE BEEN MOUNTING A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING. NOT THAT LONG AGO I FILMED A PUBLIC SERVICE ADVERTISEMENT WITH THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN, TRYING TO REACH OUT TO PARENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. NONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE SEEING THAT IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING IS AN UPTICK ON SEXTORTION CASES NOT JUST AGAINST LITTLE GIRLS, WHICH HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LONG TIME, BUT AGAINST LITTLE BOYS AS WELL. THE ARE SEEING A NUMBER OF THESE KIDS, MALE OR FEMALE, TURN TO SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THERE IS NO WAY OUT. SO IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A SOCIETY FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS KNOW THERE IS AN ANSWER THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN TURN TO AND THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM. SEN. OSSOFF: AND HE WILL COMMIT TO CONTINUING THOSE EFFORTS? DIR. WRAY: YES. SEN. OSSOFF: ON A RELATED NOTE, THAT MORNING THAT THE ATLANTA FIELD OFFICE CIRCULATED ABOUT SEXTORTION THREATS APPEARED IN ENGLISH BUT NOT OTHER LANGUAGES. I WANT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ABOUT THE WORK THE FBI CAN DO TO INCREASE LANGUAGE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION YOU DISTRIBUTE SO THAT COMMUNITIES IN GEORGIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY OR FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT A FIRST LANGUAGE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION TO PROTECT THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES, AND BUSINESSES FROM THREATS TO THEIR SAFETY. WHEN THE FBI ISSUES WARNINGS LIKE THAT OR OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION OR GUIDANCE, DO YOU TEND TO OFFER THAT AND LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH, AND WHAT STEPS CAN YOU TAKE -- PERHAPS WORKING WITH MY OFFICE -- TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO CARRY IT OUT, TO IMPROVE THE MULTILINGUAL AVERAGE AND COMMUNICATION THE FBI DOES? DIR. WRAY: HERE IS A VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT POINT. WE HAVE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS STARTED INTENSIFYING THE OUTREACH WE DO, DOING IT WITH ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES. BECAUSE WE HAVE REALIZED THERE ARE VICTIM COMMUNITIES FOR DIFFERENT OFFENSES, DIFFERENT THREATS, BUT SOMETIMES ARE NOT GETTING THE MESSAGE UNLESS WE DO THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, I KNOW OUR NEW YORK OFFICE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY PROACTIVE IN THAT REGARD, BOTH WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN NEW YORK, BUT ALSO THE AAPI COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF ADVERTISEMENTS AND LEAFLETS THAT ARE TRANSLATED INTO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO MORE AND MORE OF THAT, AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU. SEN. OSSOFF: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. EVEN THE GROWING DIVERSITY IN GEORGIA I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE GEORGIA FIELD OFFICE EMERGE AS THE LEADER, TAKING SURE TO CONVEY INFORMATION IN SPANISH AND KOREAN AND OTHER LANGUAGES WIDELY SPOKEN IN THE STATE. SPEAKING OF COMMUNITY SAFETY, YOU AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS ONE ON VIOLENT CRIME ACROSS THE COUNTRY. GEORGIA COMMUNITIES FROM COLUMBUS TO SAVANNAH AND ALBANY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH HIGH RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE, DANG ACTIVITY, OTHER THREATS TO PUBLIC SAFETY. I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE PLANS TO COME TO GEORGIA. I HOPE YOU WILL RETURN HOME SOMETIME SOON. YOUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE STATE. WHEN YOU DO COME, SIT DOWN WITH ME AND STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, FAITH LEADERS, OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS, TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO REDUCE COMMUNITY VIOLENCE AND VIOLENT CRIME IN GEORGIA. WILL HE MAKE THAT COMMITMENT? DIR. WRAY: I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH YOU. ONE OF THE MANY TIMES I AM HOME. I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL REASONS. THE D.C. AND BE BACK IN GEORGIA. SEN. OSSOFF: THAT IS A WIDELY-SHARED SENTIMENT. DIR. WRAY: WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW-UP WITH YOU ON THAT REQUEST. SEN. OSSOFF: WANT TO TALK TO YOU A BIT ABOUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR PROTECTION OF VETERANS. GEORGIA, HOME TO NEARLY 700,000 VETERANS, ANY OF WHOM RELY ON THE V.A.. IN RECENT YEARS MANY VETERANS HAVE BEEN TARGETED AS PART OF A PENSION-POACHING SCHEME, OR UNETHICAL ADVISORS PROFIT BY ASSISTING A VETERAN OR PURPORTING TO ASSIST A VETERAN IN QUALIFYING FOR V.A. BENEFITS. THESE SCAMS CAN TIE UP THE VETERANS'S SAVINGS IN INVESTMENTS THAT EARN LUCRATIVE FEES. WHAT IS THE FBI DOING TO PROTECT VETERANS IN GEORGIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM THOSE WHO SEEK TO FINANCIALLY EXPLOIT THEM? AND CAN YOU REASSURE THE COMMITTEE AND PEOPLE GEORGIA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT PROTECTING VETERANS FROM EXPORTATION IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE BUREAU? DIR. WRAY: I CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU MORE DETAILED INFORMATION AS A FOLLOW-UP, BUT I WILL TELL YOU WE ARE PURSUING A NUMBER OF TYPES OF SCHEMES AND SCAMS THAT TARGET DIFFERENT KINDS OF POPULATIONS THAT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER ARE ATTACKED OF TWO SCAMMERS. WHEN IT COMES TO VETERANS, IT IS APPALLING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD PREY UPON THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY SO NOBLY AND SELFLESSLY. IN FACT, I THINK THAT HITS PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO HOME FOR US AT THE FBI. HAVE A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF VETERANS IN OUR CURRENT WORKFORCE AND ALWAYS HAVE. AND SO, NO, AS THEY SAY, THEM'S FIGHTING WORDS. SEN. OSSOFF: APPRECIATE THAT, DIRECTOR WRAY. FINALLY, JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF MATTERS RELATED TO CIVIL RIGHTS. MR. CHAIRMAN, WITH YOUR INDULGENCE, I WROTE A LETTER REQUESTING THE FBI INVESTIGATE ONGOING GANG ACTIVITY AT POLASKY STATE PRISON. IT IS OUR SECOND LARGEST PRISON FOR WOMEN. I REALIZE YOU CANNOT COMMENT ON ONGOING AND BEST OCCASIONS, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT CORRESPONDENCE AND IT HAS RECEIVED THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THAT STATE PRISON. OR BROADLY, WHERE DOES THE INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS FALL AMONG THE F -- THE FBI'S PRIORITIES, AND I WAS THAT COMMUNICATED TO YOUR FIELD OFFICES? CAN YOU ASSURE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT INVESTIGATING CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS REMAINS ATOP HER ALREADY? DIR. WRAY: AS TO YOUR LETTER, I HAVE READ IT, AND READ IT WITH INTEREST. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. AS TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT, WE, AS I THINK I MENTIONED EARLIER, WE ELEVATED THAT TO A NATIONAL THREAT PRIORITY. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IS THAT IT COMMUNICATES TO ALL OF THE FIELD OFFICES IN THE HEADQUARTERS DIVISION THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS TO BE ONE OF OUR TOP PARITIES. AS A RESULT, BOTH RESOURCES AND INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EMPHASIS FLOW FROM THAT DREAM IT WAS LAST YEAR AND IT WILL BE AGAIN THIS FISCAL YEAR. SEN. OSSOFF: IN CLOSING, WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO WILL LISTEN TO ALL OF THIS, HERE ARE WORDS ON RADIO ACROSS GEORGIA WHO WANT TO HEAR THAT REASSURANCE FROM THE PERSON THAT YOU ARE OUT THERE INVESTIGATING CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS? DIR. WRAY: WE VIEW OUR CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAM AS AT THE HEART OF OUR MISSION TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION. THE FBI HAS DONE SOME GREAT WORK IN THAT PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS AND IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE PROUD OF AND STAY COMMITTED TO. SEN. OSSOFF:

hi I'm congressman Donald Lim Payne jr. and I proudly represent the 10th congressional district of new jersey we have made great strides in the fight against colorectal cancer thanks in large part to increase awareness and screening the incident rates of this type of cancer have been declining for 20 years nevertheless in 2014 an estimated 100 36,000 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer claiming the lives of 50,000 people it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women combined in the United States although colorectal cancer is largely preventable 23 million adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with recommended screening on a personal level watching my father go through the treatment and ultimately losing his fight with colorectal cancer was painful and difficult for my family detecting and removing precancerous growths or polyps is our best weapon against the disease regular screenings such as colonoscopies are important for both the early detection and removal of these polyps today I remind others to get their colonoscopies and ensure that they know the importance of early screening so others may not have experienced the loss my family has endured please take the opportunity to talk to your family and doctor about the importance of colorectal cancer screenings these conversations aren't always easy but they could save a life by working together we can raise the awareness about this life-saving cancer screening thank you

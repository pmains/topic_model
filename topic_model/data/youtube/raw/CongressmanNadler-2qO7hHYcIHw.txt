ler he's endorse Hillary Clinton congressman's good to see good to see you the problem is real Donald Trump yes the celebrity yes the media hype but him grabbing this issue with both hands catapulted his candidacy early on it's a problem people think not enough has been done and that is the momentum here isn't that a fact that there is a real problem it hasn't been handled the way it needs to be well I don't know that there is a problem but we have been a lot of we have been doing a lot of things unfortunately deportations under this administration our way up from what they were before we have increased the border security budget I think by something like four hundred fourteen hundred percent noise you say unfortunately why unfortunately I don't think they're I think they've been too many deportations but that's a different question but we have we have been enforcing the law much more rigorously than previously but you still have by a shallow estimate about six million people in this country who have criminal records of one kind or another than I document I think six million is way way overboard you can get up when our question was have six million is overstayed visas and the criminal stuff but so let's play with that number because the but that's a lot of people you know the number of people with any kind of serious crimes is in the tens of thousands not the millions number one number two this kind of scapegoating I mean Donald Trump made it sound and makes it a mean he's scapegoating immigrants he's making it sound like you have millions of illegal immigrants undocumented aliens who are criminals running around rapists murderers he had people there who were whose kids were victims but the fact is that undocumented aliens commit less fewer crimes per capita than native american then people who are here it is not immigration enforcement may be a problem but it is not a criminal problem because the people who are here without documents commit crimes at a much lower rate or substantially lower rate than people who in regular we've heard this argument also that what happened to Katie Steinle is the exception not the rule that that's an unfair standard A to point out but you still have six million people who have cheated the system and are here how is that a way of looking at it as success let me just say this this kind of bigoted approach you could take five or six people whose kids were victimized by Jewish criminals or Irish criminals or black criminals or Italian criminals and say the Italians are the Jews of the blacks or somebody else is the problem that is appealing to rank of bigotry your scapegoating the the foreigners especially the Mexicans who were here and saying they're the cause of the crimes they're not do you think that Hillary Clinton should have gone to Mexico well I think as secretary of state she was in Mexico many times and she was in a lot of other what do you think was a mistake for her to allow Trump to play to advantage going down there and I don't making this appeal that he can be presidential no I mean the fact is that he went down there because he has shown no ability to be presidential he made a try to sound reasonable for a few minutes with the president of mexico and then it comes back here and makes a blood-curdling speech being as irresponsible and as bigoted as ever why is it bigoted it's bigoted because you're blaming a group of people for larger crimes it's exactly the same thing as the fascists did in Europe the problems were all because of the Jews here the problems row because of the Mexicans the problems were all because of the Irish in the 1850s in anti an anti-immigration is Terry in the 1840s and 50s but no doubt things it was all the problem the country is being destroyed by the Irish immigrants it's the same thing you blame all the problems on a group of people who are not responsible for those problems well yes there are people who commit crimes who are here illegally who are here improperly but most crimes are committed by people who are here another stick that he swung during his speech last night was about Clinton's own problems with the law uh obviously he's talking about the foundation he's talking about the emails you believe that she's handled that situation uh well enough or do you believe that's why it's dogging her in the polls well I think she's done what she good about the email she said she made a mistake she's apologized to that there's nothing else you can say really the FBI investigated said that there were no crimes and that's it now the fact of the matter is the Republicans in Trump in particular these days with Republicans for 30 years have bringing up alleged scandal after scandal whitewater travelgate Benghazi that have proven after millions of those investigations not to be anything that she did nothing wrong in magazi she did nothing wrong and those other things but you throw enough mud against the wall some people get the basic impression she's untrustworthy you're not concerned by the foundation overlap with what happened as Secretary of State well i think that the foundation has now announced the extraordinary steps that will happen starting immediately but especially if she's elected president the foundation remember is the foundation I mean Trump said that that she's benefiting from this that there's pay-to-play foundation is not an income-producing thing Foundation has has has been a tremendous charitable benefits saved millions of lives of people of aids and and other things in Africa in other places and has she met with people who had donuts the foundation yes as Secretary of State she meets with a lot of people she met with elie wiesel he's a donor to the foundation she met with Nobel Peace Prize winner I think its peace by Nobel Prize winner who's that donation to lose a donor to the foundation they're donating to a major charity and she would meet with these people in any event congressman jerry nadler appreciate you making the case from the Clinton perspective thank you it's good to have you here Allison

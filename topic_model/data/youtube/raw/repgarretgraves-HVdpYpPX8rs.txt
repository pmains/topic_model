I'm standing at the bottom of the new Comey diversion this is where White's Bayou comes in the comet river is over here the Mississippi River is over there this is what progress looks like this is part of 1.6 million cubic yards of material that's been removed and is digging effectively an entirely New River that I think they said estimates are that this is going to carry as much flow as the Arkansas River from the comet river flowing West over to the Mississippi River taking flood waters out of communities like Baton Rouge like Gonzales like Denham Springs all through East Baton Rouge Livingston and Ascension parishes it's going to benefit communities of Zachary Baker Central as well as again all the way down into Port Vincent French settlement on down into those those more Park communities so this is pretty awesome to see what progress looks like this this project started in the early 1980s and has largely been stalled ever since but we were able to secure the funds and now this thing's moving forward so we're really excited about the progress

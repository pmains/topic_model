uh madam president uh like my friend senator durbin i uh to rise in support of attorney general javier becerro a longtime public servant and as president biden's nominee to be our next secretary of health and human service for a year now i've been saying to anybody to listen that the only way to really get our economy back on track put parents back to work and kids back in the classroom and life back to normal in the us of a is to do all that we can to put this devastating pandemic in our nation's rear view mirror that means vaccinating as many at-risk americans as safely and as quickly as possible thankfully under the leadership of our new president america is leading the way in the production and the distribution of vaccines how about that leading the world and each day we're breaking records on the number of new americans that are being vaccinated uh madam president after going through one of the darkest periods in american history we are finally beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel but as we ramp up relaxing distribution throughout america and help make sure that all people all people from rural communities to urban cities have equitable access to life-saving vaccines we need to make sure that the department of health and human services has the right leader at the helm going forward and for my money and my judgment that leader is javier becerra i believe he is the right person for this job at this point in our nation's history as a key member of the biden administration he will work with the white house he will work with us in the congress to tackle coronavirus pandemic and to coordinate our nation's response to it and just as he has done throughout his career he will fight to expand affordable health care address persistent health disparities and respond and and and restore hhs's mission to protect the health and well-being of all americans madam president i've heard several of my republican colleagues call into question javier becerra's attorney general barcera's qualifications to serve as hhs secretary but obviously they're free to express their concerns as senators it's our duty to evaluate to vet and evaluate cabinet nominees and make sure that we believe they're going to be best able to serve the american people i take responsibility seriously i know a presiding officer does as well but let me set the record straight if i could on javier becerra i'm confident that with his decades of experience working on health care issues in congress and on as california's attorney general he will be an invaluable part of president biden's administration as we work together to combat the pandemic nationally some of the critics on the other side of the aisle uh say that what does he know about health care well it turns out he served for i want to say two decades on the house committee on ways and means if i last time i checked modern president you may want to double check me on this i think they their primary responsibility that the committee is medicare and for somebody who's turned that along in that committee i bet he knows a thing or two about medicare as it turns out he does throughout his career in public service javier becerra has shown an unwavering commitment to protecting and expanding health care availability for millions of american families and workers especially those in vulnerable communities who remain under served the house representatives who's a senior member of the ways and means committee which helped to make the affordable care act which is based on a republican idea i think out of the heritage foundation in 1993 that as i mentioned earlier mitt romney helped make a household word in the state of of massachusetts when he was governor there and uh i think half the people who are under without health care coverage now who didn't have it when the we created these aca happened to have it today we cut out in half the number of people that don't have access to health care coverage and in the state of delaware the cost of coverage is actually dropping and he exchanges he stopped by i think 19 over the last two years alone as market forces are taking place and taking hold and as attorney general uh of california has been mentioned we'd led the charge for a coalition of states to defend the affordable care act against multiple attempts by the trump administration to dismantle this landmark legislation altogether and as they had i once asked somebody ask him i said what what is it about your experience that would suggest you could run a big operation like the department of health and human services and he said well i have run the department of justice in calif in california it's the uh second largest department of justice in the country second only to the federal department of justice i forget how many uh thousands maybe tens of thousands of employees they have but it's a huge operation in a huge state with a ton of people and javier basera brought together attorney generals from both sides of the aisle to hold opioid opiate manufacturers accountable for the addiction crisis that we're still struggling with and when the pandemic had he went to balance for californians and everything for protections for workers from exposure to covert 19 increasing transparency in nursing homes to securing key safeguards to the right of frontline healthcare personnel his past leadership his past leadership is a major reason why president biden is asking him today to be uh to accept the responsibilities of overseeing the responses to many of our nation's most urgent needs including the distribution of covert 19 vaccinations vaccines restoring the public confidence in vital public health institutions and boosting family health and financial security in the wake of the pandemic madam president with so much of the code 19 response being executed at the state and local level we're fortunate that president biden has chosen as his hhs secretary javier becerra a leader with relevant on-the-ground state-based experience as a former state treasurer former governor former chairman of national governors association to have somebody with this kind of state-based experience what a blessing that would be as the head of the state the largest state department of justice in the nation overseeing thousands of employees attorney general becerra has a proven prac record and the management experience necessary to take on the massive operations at hhs he will also make his senator durbin has mentioned also make history as the first latino american to take on this role providing an important perspective as latinos and other minority communities continue to be disproportionately impacted by the pandemic as we try to make sure that about a third of the american people who are saying that they're not going to take the vaccine they don't care uh they're going to take a chance wouldn't it be nice to have a lot of those people latino wouldn't be nice to have a secretary of the department of health and human services could reach out to that community literally reach out to them and uh and touch them and convince them that no this is something they should do they should take this chance they'll be glad they did the modern president four years ago this body confirmed president trump's nominee for health and human services within just 20 days 20 days of the start of the administration and he we knew then that this role was important to phil it took us 20 days and now in the midst of the deadly uh deadly pandemic one has taken the lives of over 530 000 americans told that exceeds the number of american deaths on the battlefields of world war one world war ii and the vietnam war in which i served we cannot afford to let another day go by without confirming javier becerro so without all that madam madam president i just want to say colleagues it's time it's overtime and we need to can confirm javier and uh i think in fact i'm convinced that he'll he'll do a good job he'll make us proud and uh we need him president needs him then with him on board as the leader of hhs we can go he can go to work on behalf of the american people and put this pandemic behind us for good for good and we need that data come soon and madam president i don't see anybody else waiting to speak and i think maybe i should note the absence of a quorum

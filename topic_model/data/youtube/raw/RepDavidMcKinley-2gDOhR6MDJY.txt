from this side of the table but we've heard comments made about the the sequester we've had 22 votes on seaquest we're trying to avoid the sequester but we can't get the other side of the aisle to support us on that oh they'll say they they their concern about it but we've given them the votes and they don't take them so I'm just I'm concerned about it I'm concerned about where we're going to go with this I listened to that initial polling I thought was a very good question that chairman came up with and it was just show hands and certainly it wasn't scientific but when he mentioned tax code and regulations that's more than all the other combine the issues that were raised tax code and regularly but yet we can't get the people on certain areas of our Congress to accept that they think it's more of what we've been doing for the last four years in Congress more regulation more government intrusion more taxes higher energy costs is that the direction is that what you're telling us now I'd like to make sure we're going in there should we be going in that do you really think the last four years is the best direction we could go if we're going to make manufacturing all that it can be where we have American exceptionalism again in our manufacturing is this the direction we should continue or went what would you suggest to wake up members of Congress to understand what it's like to see a demise and struggle within the manufacturing business can you give us some direction on where you might where you might give it to us I heard you say tax code regulations but EPA and OSHA regulatory Tax Policy Obamacare I've heard how that's affecting businesses all over the sequestration are indeed energy costs what what should we be doing not just sweet-talked but actual what can we do what should we do if we're going to reverse manufacturing the demise then you can a few of you give you some some good examples thank you for looking why did you ask what Congress should do and honestly for our industry the regulations and taxing healthcare everything that we see coming down the pipeline is becoming more burdensome what you could do is stop thank you you could stop that would allow us to be the manufacturing engine that drives this country why don't you think where people are hearing that it's so basic get government off our backs free up that I hear time time to get manufacturers will get back and we just backed off but the Congress doesn't seem to want to back up it thinks it's going in the right direction by becoming more intrusive in your workplace how do you do it why what are we missing here why aren't people listening to you well basically we have been vocal for years and why that has not reached Congress is beyond us but I think when you look at the jobs lost and how our entire manufacturing sector continues to struggle you know when is it going to be too late when we're all out of business so I appreciate the opportunity to be here and express our issues of not only my company but our industry and manufacturers in general thank you any others in the time remaining yes sir the it's not so much the regulation as it is the unknown congressman waxman talked about you know gridlock in an argument from both sides is a necessary part of the government process we need that but when something is enacted get to it then on specifically what we've got to do about that we've had the Obamacare for two years now the only thing I've seen out of that we provide hospitalization for our employees our insurance costs has went up twenty percent a year for the last two years and yet it's not even enacted yet but the anticipation of that the unknown the insurance companies have had to respond that way so what we need is swift action I talked for a second about the dredging of the entrance to the to the channel in Brunswick the Corps of Engineers has been working on that for four years they don't get the allocation of the money to be able to do that completely at one time so it's piecemealed and it feels right back in we're in a world where we have to respond to the market conditions immediately and and governments not responding as quick you thank you very much mr. Johnson from Ohio you recognized for five minutes well thank you mr. chairman nya

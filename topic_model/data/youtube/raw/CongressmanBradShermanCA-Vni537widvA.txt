good morning everybody and thank you very much for joining us for a discussion that is overdue about one of the most important issues facing our country that gets very little discussion here in Congress or in the media and I'm delighted to be joined by Congressman Brad Sherman who is from California and Brad is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee right thanks so much for being with us and we're also joined joined by Simon Johnson who is the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund the IMF he is currently a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management where he also serves as head of the global global economics and management group something thanks so much for joining us as well um here is what my great fear is and we're gonna touch on that tangentially today but overall I worried very much that in our nation today we are moving toward an oligarchic form of society where a small number of very wealthy individuals and large corporations have enormous control over our economic and political life today we are in a country where three people three of the wealthiest people on more wealth than the bottom half of American society and 52% of all new income is going to the top 1% now in the midst of all of that what we can be discussing today is Wall Street which in my view is the most powerful economic and political force in this country as we all know ten years ago as a result of the greed recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street this country was plunged into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s was an unbelievable tragedy for many many millions of people unemployment rate shot up to 10 percent real autofit real unemployment shot up to 17 percent at the height of the financial crisis more than 27 million Americans were unemployed underemployed or given up looking for work 15 million Americans lost their homes and many many people many millions of people lost their life savings American households lost over 13 trillion dollars in savings shattering retirement dreams wiping out life savings and making it impossible for families to send their kids to college in other words this was a cataclysmic event which had a traumatic impact on the lives of people all across this country some of you will recall on October 3rd 2008 President George HW Bush signed legislation into law not to help the disappearing middle class but to provide a seven hundred billion dollar bailout to Wall Street banks because they were too big to fail and that's the main point we're going to be discussing tonight too big to fail that if they were allowed to go under they would take on much of the economy with him and that was the rationale for bailing them out now 700 billion dollars is obviously a lot of money and if that was all that was provided to Wall Street during the financial crisis it would amount to the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world but of course that was not all that was given to Wall Street not by a long shot one of the things that we did during the debate over the bailout is that I was able to get an amendment of pass to audit the Federal Reserve and what we learned in fact what is what really went on behind the scenes above and beyond the 700 billion dollar b√©la we learned that our nation's central bank the Federal Reserve provided more than 16 trillion dollars and financial assistance to every major bank in the country including Citigroup JPMorgan Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo not to mention large corporations Florin banks and foreign central banks all over the world now one might have thought that as part of the bailout these huge banks which were bailed out because they were too big to fail would have been reduced in size one might have thought that somebody said hey we ain't going to do this anymore we are gonna break you what well needless to say that did not happen in fact what has happened over the years is the very opposite today the four largest financial institutions in this country are on average eighty percent larger than they were before we bail them out so in other words they did not shrink in size what they have today eighty percent larger incredibly since the financial crisis JPMorgan Chase has increased its assets by more than 1.1 trillion dollars Bank of America and the other large banks have also significantly increased their assets listen for this today the six largest banks in America have over 10 trillion dollars in assets equivalent to 54 percent of our GDP 6 banks have assets equivalent to 54 percent of the GDP are you comfortable with that I'm not and that's kind of the issue that we're going to be talking about today but it's not only the size of these banks but within that size I have these six financial institutions hold about half of all credit card debt control over 90% of all bank derivatives underwrite about a third of all mortgage debt and control over 40% of all bank deposits if these banks were too big to fail 10 years ago what would happen if any of them were to fail today and that's the issue we're going to be discussing in my view I think you'll hear no Bank that is too big to fail is too big to exist so the issue is preventing another collapse another huge bailout but there's another as well and that is that not only am i worried about another collapse and bailout I'm worrying about the lack of competition that we see today as a result of this huge concentration of ownership and one of the manifestations of that has to do with the outrageously high level of credit card interest rates in this country today while banks borrow money from the Fed two percent two percent they charge consumers an average of about 17 percent for credit cards and if you have mediocore a bad credit interest rates could be as high as 25 or 30 percent that's you that is millions of people today who may not have great credit maybe they are unemployed for a while couldn't pay their bills paying 25 or 30 percent these banks borrow the money at 2% I think the time is now to break these banks up and that's what the legislation is about that we're going to discuss and I'm delighted that congressman brad Sherman isn't working on this issue for years and what this bill will do is cap the size of the largest financial institutions in this country so that the total exposure to our economy is no more than 3% of GDP that's about five hundred eighty four billion think right Marge you pick it up from there senator thanks for having me here brad sherman from California's best name city Sherman Oaks and for 22 years I've represented most of the San Fernando Valley in Congress for 22 years it's been my pleasure to work with you senator particularly on this bill which we have been working on and reintroducing since 2009 ten years ago the largest banks in this country were able to hold us hostage they said if we go down we're taking the entire economy with us and as the senator pointed out there in a stronger position to do that today because there's almost there well over 50% larger than they were then that bill that was signed into law would have been even worse if it hadn't been for the efforts of the critics the original plan for tarp was to give the banks the money in return for toxic assets the worst trash would be converted to cash the worst mortgages in the biggest vaults in the biggest banks for real money that would have enriched the banks by almost by the lion's share of the seven hundred billion dollars due to the critics of that proposal they back down just a bit and instead the 700 billion dollar bailout was structured as a investment in preferred stock and as the senator points out though that was just one part of the bailout that bailout was a violation of the social compact that we have in this society that when capitalists invest they take the risk and reap the profits and instead we ended up with socialism for the rich a form of socialism that nobody here supports where the taxpayer takes the risk but of course the enormous profits have gone to the banks this so what happened then would happen again we'd get the call you're gonna take the entire economy down with us and Wall Street understands that that's why the IMF issued a paper saying that the biggest banks are able to borrow money from their creditors at 80 basis points less now 80 basis points that's eight tenths at one point sounds like a trivial amount unless you supply that to two or three trillion dollars and the savings by saving just point a to 1% of that tends to be roughly equivalent to the profits of these banks so their profits are attributable to the fact that they can borrow money for less because everyone on Wall Street knows if they're going down they're calling us and the politics of this country they believe would lead us to bail them out again now the idea of breaking up the big banks is not some wild we should have Republicans here sorry it's real capitalism real competition and the concept of breaking up the big banks is supported by the independent community bankers Association which represents 90% of the bank presidents in this country not known to attend Trotskyite meetings the we need real competition that's fair we're medium-sized and regional banks and small banks can prosper without suffering an 80 basis point disadvantage because a bailout is not just bad for our economy it's bad for our judicial system because we were told by Eric Holder these banks are too big to jail we can tonight any of them without bringing out the economy and what kind of license does it give bank executives if they feel they're too big to jail and it was a clear disruption of the social compact in the countries you'd think that wanting to break up the big banks means you're hostile to Bank someone but we're doing it for their if we're in a capitalist system that's works and that's fair and it's not difficult to do it when a protozoa a one-celled animal gets too big it divides into and I'm hoping that the geniuses on Wall Street are at least as smart as the rich healthy protozoa that they should simply divide themselves into two or three units that will be healthy that will compete reasonably and there will not have an unfair competition competitive advantage right thanks very much and they exfoli work Simon Johnson is not only a leading economist he wrote a paper for the Minneapolis Federal Reserve on how to break up the big banks which forms the basis of the legislation the granite and I are offering today assign me what's going on the situation well thank you senator and congressman for taking up this issue I think it's it's long overdue I I agree completely that what we're facing today ten years after top is a potential repeat of the same situation where you look at the biggest banks and we are or whatever size took them at six really big mega banks that will be directly impacted JPMorgan Chase Bank America Citigroup Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley any one of those is now at a sighs great larger than Lehman Brothers Lehman Brothers cause many of the problems September 2008 owes remember too vividly if any one of them went down with begin a big knock-on effects across the entire economy globally and then the officials would come back to you in the Senate and the house and they say we have to save the world and you'll be placed in exactly that same impossible position you were placed in into September early October so 2008 so the only way out of this and we dice aborted many parts of dodd-frank I think dodd-frank has moved some dimensions of measures in in a better direction more competition more transparency but it's not enough it's clearly not enough because the biggest banks had become even bigger the largest bank in 2008 with Citigroup of 2.5 trillion dollars now as JPMorgan Chase in three point five trillion dollars break them up make them smaller make them more comfort make them more competitive as congressman Sherman said and you'll get more of the benefits of competition and make them smaller politically which is going to address exactly your issues about the oligarchy one last point which in fact we just emphasized the top legislation would you were you felt in which after which had to pass otherwise the consequences were dire ended up supporting these large banks exactly you said where was the bailouts for the homeowners many people had a experience a fall in house price and what underwater on their mortgages couldn't make those payment if they've been able to find internet positions there was underwater positions for two to three years like the banks were they wouldn't have had they wouldn't be foreclosed on they wouldn't have lost their house they would not have gone bankrupt they would not now face high interest rates lots of health insurance and so on so the bailouts are always some people at lemon socialism the upside is for the oligarchs the downside is the lemons which we get there's no support provided ever to ordinary Americans in this kind of crisis that's why your legislation is so important to avoid a repeat of that experience so let me just start off by asking a question given a horrific situation of 2008 and the trauma of course and people are still feeling that to the African American community was devastated by them why is there not more discussion of this issue why are people not asking the simple question if they were too big to fail it's a great question senator basically and easier is a problem in this country more and more generally look former Fed chair Alan Greenspan a Republican as far as I know in October 2009 said if it's too big if they are too big to exist for the other banks too big to exist they're too big to fail so at that moment after the crisis there was great clarity across the political spectrum but unfortunately you know various politicians have decided that they like the status quo there's a lot of money that comes from the banks to politicians on on both sides of the aisle the status provider is extremely strong and and people have really just forgotten or or choose to ignore that the lessons of 2008 just pick up on Simon's point since the 1990s the financial sector has given more than 3.2 billion in campaign Lucian's and last year alone spent over 200 million dollars on lobbying maybe that has something to do with the fact I think if we get public financing we'll be in a stronger position to deal with this and a whole lot of issues but you're on the House Financial Services Committee how do you see the power of Wall Street related to all of this stuff well we may see a big change probably the biggest change you've ever seen in a committee you served on that House Committee for many years our current chairman is jeb Hensarling our future chairwoman is Maxine Waters if this election goes as we think it will and I cannot think of a bigger change in the leadership of a committee in the history of our country but that being said Wall Street still they've got at least four networks dedicated to the worship of Wall Street the people could be watching on their cable systems now in my area there are only three channels dedicated to the worship of Jesus Christ it's not just the money to politicians it's a national worship of Wall Street a belief that anything that makes the markets go down is bad for America and anything that makes the markets go up I remember being criticized when the house we were able to stop this bill for a while change it and the markets dropped six hundred points well they've dropped six hundred points for a host of other reasons as well but the idea was you're anti-american because you did something that Wall Street thought let me have supposed a good a pretty simple question what is the likelihood of another crashing Balon what it's like a really a likelihood or not so much I think another crash you did absolutely something's going to happen the history of you believe it will happen I'm not saying the date but I'm saying then will you will have another major disturbance of the kind of we experienced in in the 2000s the history of the United States the history of world finance says these things do not go away the question is does the disturbance become a major crisis the Cataclysm or the amount of Cataclysm and then you have to provide the bail there's a choice and that's what your legislation addresses which is yes we'll have turbulence yes we'll have problems but can we resolve them just with ordinary bankruptcy until the congressman's point I would say what what is more American than antitrust breaking up Standard Oil breaking up ATT these without anti-market anti-capitalist things these also didn't fix up all of our fundamental problems by the way but they weren't things that were completely consistent with more competition and more even playing field for all Americans who choose to participate a business strong likely another question at some point we'll see what dodd-frank does instead of breaking up the big banks is trying to make them less risky which might delay the time that it happens it's like throwing the dice at Vegas and being told well you don't crap out with a three or two you only crap out with a two so you'll be able to play the vise longer but eventually are you above and beyond the fear of another collapse what does it mean from a competitive point of view I'm the average consumer who cares well why care for this one banker 50 banks what does it mean to me that you have so few banks controlling so much so many assets and such a large part of the economy well as you said senator this concerns about the high interest rates we've already seen a lot of price fixing in in the London interest rate market that that was a huge scandal has it been fixed perhaps a little on the margins are these big players going to cook up some other version that they can also manipulate almost certainly right the pattern of behavior is that these very large banks get out of control they abuse the consumers well fog at Wells Fargo extraordinary well you see any fundamental change no that's in other words did they learn their lesson and become good boys and girls no of course not they kicked the heads down for a while with a little bit of pressure but by September 2009 hey we're back at the same games it didn't take a bomber administration let them off the hook they gave them the top money the capital was very very very few strings attached so we'll see that's just a good trade not great we made this money we handle to be handed up with some of the downside the taxpayer let's get on with it the particular thing which was mortgages being given to people without documentation etc I don't think they'll make that exact mistake again but that doesn't mean there are other ways and that's a history of financial crises you find another way to meltdown based on whatever you fanger craziness is in fashion what does it mean and Brad you raise this issue what does it mean that despite the fact that many of these large banks have to pay very very heavy fines no major Wall Street figure was jailed what is that what's your sense of what is it totally American people that the people who caused so much pain and instability in this country and world suspended sentence no one got even close to that process it means that a certain class of folks I hate to sound cynical but they made money on the trade if you look at the compensation received by the top financial executives in 2000 2008 and you include whatever hand slaps the word subsequent which would incredibly mind at the personal level they've made money on the trade that's all they care about they do not care at all about anyone else they're in it for themselves they're in it for the money it was a good trade they wanted to find a way to do it again and on the point of the funds paid by the companies they may vote begging in terms of headlines but for the individuals involved it's zero and who do they find if I understood the people who were taken advantage off on the last cycle it makes no sense they're all sort of the propaganda they can say look at this I lost my job I couldn't pay the rent I'd be desperate that is a huge punishment but they walk away with a hundred million dollars you know if you're unemployed with a hundred million dollars it's not so bad right and then you could pay the right right right all right I mean what have we not gone over I think we've covered it senator I think the heart of the matter is an oligarchy an oligarchy that is multi-dimensional across many sectors but it is absolutely manifest and very dangerous in the financial sector through the form of these very large banks it's a it's a strange oligarchy in the sense that their most devastating power comes when they threatened to fail because they're basically giving it either you support us which is awful or you have global Cataclysm and they come to you they'll come to you as they did in September 2008 the responsible people from the administration and and people of all experienced Republicans and Democrats will say those are the choices well it doesn't have to be that way old but only if you reinforce everything else that's been done the Haas ice cap which is a legislation and we're suffering from this now it's not just when the crash as the senator points out you've got the high interest rates but I'm an old CPA and it worked with a lot of small businesses small businesses are able to get loans from small and medium-sized banks I mean Jamie Dimon testified before us and he said we couldn't find businesses in the United States to lend money to they really said that therefore he sent the money total to his London office where it was eaten by the whale remember that the trade and they lost many many billions of dollars they could have been lending that money to small businesses but that's not their focus if you're sitting on the 70th floor and an on Wall Street you're not thinking how can I lend money to a pizzeria at Omaha so if we can get more of the deposits and more of the power closer to small business I think absolutely this legislation is very strongly supportive of community banking and as you said the innovative Pina Bank of America consistently supported this kind of size cap because they understand that the very big banks damage them day in day out and they damage them even more when there's a crisis for obvious reasons some of which we touched on this morning you're not going to hear this discussion too much on CBS or NBC or ABC and you're certainly not going to see it on CNBC or the Fox Business channel or Bloomberg or a lot of flaws of the Congress I must say as well all right so it is up to the American people to begin to stand up and start this discussion again none of us are naive we understand the or of Wall Street we understand their ownership of many members of the Congress in the media and so forth and so on but this discussion has got to take place now or else we are going to find ourselves where we were ten years ago today with that devastating moment when the economy virtually collapsed and so many people were thrown out on the streets lost their homes lost their life savings we cannot allow that to happen again and we cannot allow so few people to have so much power we can't continue a situation where what married people have to be 15 20 percent interest rates you know because they may have lost a job or whatever but just use your yes that's not acceptable so this is an issue where serious discussion has got to take place and we hope you the viewers out there will help us with that discussion get on the phone call up your members of Congress find out how they feel about this issue if they are prepared to take on Wall Street and prevent another major collapse Anabella gentlemen anything else okay well thank you so much thank you all right good thank you one related issue

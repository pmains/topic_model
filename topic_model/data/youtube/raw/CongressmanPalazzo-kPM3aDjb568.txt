Mississippi mr. Palazzo gentleman from Mississippi is recognized for one minute thank you madam Speaker the citizens of Mississippi's fourth congressional district overwhelmingly do not support the president's handling of Libya and I agree with my constituents our country our military and their families are fatigued by ten years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan the White House is yet to clearly explain to the American people why we should commit more of our precious blood and treasure to a third war where is the leadership Americans expect and deserve when it comes to committing our troops to foreign wars with reservation I will support House Resolution 292 only because the United States must honor our commitment to our friends and allies engaged in the Libyan conflict this resolution gives the president 14 days to explain to Congress the scope of our objectives in Libya and if he fails we should immediately withdraw our support from the conflict and as much as we care for our friends and allies we cannot cast aside the laws of our land mr. president the American people and this Congress have questions and deserve answers we cannot afford a failure in leadership when American lives are on the line I yield back

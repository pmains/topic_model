the US Secret Service is one of the department's one of the areas that had been experiencing some negative morale bad morale look maybe maybe the best way to say it is a decrease in morale and for the last several years there's been a turn around there the US Secret Service director mr. Randolph Ali's was part of the turnaround and was there when that was occurring I want to talk a little bit about then when you identify in please the President of the United States was doing that with the director of the US Secret Service and while he was turning it around he ridiculed him called it calling him names before he fired him what do you think that does to employee morale well as I said when I answered mr. Higgins that I don't think it can help but but I think employee Omar Inc Lee is a lot more complicated when you're looking at an agency across 15 to 20 thousand people there are just a number of factors that go into how people answer that survey I understand I'm trying I'm trying to ask you don't do you think there's a negative impact when the president United States is basically calling names of the director of the US Secret Service who has been turning around the Secret Service to increase morale well ma'am I don't have any data showing what sort of impact that has on morale across such a large organization I you know I don't it certainly doesn't it doesn't help morale but I think there's just there are so many factors that go into two individuals morale at a component and a component morale that I think it's the difficult question answered mr. stired you've ended so congressman I think there's no question that when senior leaders in any aspect of our society but certainly ones that are actually running the government have negative things to say about their employees or civil servants that are there as career merit-based employees it's a bad thing and we ought to have you political leaders across the board and you to understand that this is a problem that we've seen not just now but it's one that we've seen for decades and I think it's a mistake because fundamentally these are folks that are working for the American people they're working not for any particular policy that the political leadership decides they're working on the basis of supporting the Constitution the United States so fundamentally one of the things that we do as an organization as a service to America medals where we try to highlight great stories of federal employees we'd welcome we're actually getting nominations right now we'd welcome nominations from any of you on the panel we need to create a culture of recognition in my view again focus on the good you're gonna create more uplift than anything else that as possible to get done right mr. steyr there are currently 13 senior positions vacant throughout the department from the secured from the secretary to the deputy secretary to the heads of CBP and ice most of these roles are filled by acting yes officials what effect does a lack of permanent leadership have in an organization's ability to promote that positive change you're talking about in the metaphor for me it's like the substitute teacher we've all experienced before you can be an amazing educator but if you're the substitute teacher you don't yourself perceive your job as the long term difficult problems and those on the outside the class the children other other teachers don't see you as that long-term partner either so it is it diminishes the ability of leadership to do their job well and it's a mistake so I would say that part of the problem here is a systemic one we have 1,200 senate-confirmed positions that's too many to actually get through the Senate so one of the things we would advocate for is fewer senate-confirmed positions and then disaggregating them taking the operating ones like the undersecretary for management away from the policy ones and trying to create long term continuity among them one of the best things this committee could ever do for the department homeland security is to keep tax alles in the job of undersecretary for management as the confirmed individual in there for a lengthy period of time you would see huge improvement so creating that as a structural option would be fantastic great thank you I yield back

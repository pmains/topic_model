mr. Pascrell morning mr. chairman director elmendorf do you believe that when Social Security was passed it had an impact on labor supply since we are this thing wishing between labor supply and demand yes absolutely that very clearly in a similar way that you would project Obamacare will have I mean this will be different but the basic point is the same congressman which is the provision of income to people over age 62 or 65 has allowed some of them to choose not to work who otherwise would have felt compelled to work I wonder if there was a headline back then in 19 36 and 37 about what was going to happen to demand if it were repealed let me ask you this question or if the benefits were cut due to privatization an option on that would have an impact on labor supply wouldn't it yes that's how how we push up labor supply if the impact we've done estimates of the effect of raising the eligibility age for Social Security we think that would increase the amount of work that people do primarily in their 60s particular with seniors more than would work beyond what they could be working is that correct and it worked longer than they would under crumbs off the fact that Americans won't be tied to a job they don't want or need solely because it is the only way for them to get affordable health care is a feature of Obamacare not above as I looked at it director elmendorf if your assumptions prove correct and 2.3 million Americans removed themselves from the labor supply what effect will that have on the unemployment rate and unwaged so congressman we think that people leaving the labor choosing not to work because of the incentives provided by the Affordable Care Act would have essentially no effect for the unemployment rate we said that very clearly in our report the effect on wages is we did not analyze formally complicated depends on how the capital investment responds to changes in work and we have not tried to model that or estimate that specifically so what you're saying is that because of the security of Obamacare that it from a 60 year old let's take that as an example might decide to retire early yes and open up a job for someone who was unemployed today is that correct yes that's right congressman this is an example of the drop of the labor supply now in fact the CBO's report you specifically state the estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net declined the amount of labor that workers choose to supply rather than from a net drop in businesses demand for labor portland fault i didn't see this in any of the announcements about this yesterday i just wonder what very curious about that you said it I didn't so in other words this isn't employers cutting jobs newly empowered workers choosing to go a different path yes that's a good thing chairman Ryan my good friend you said in 2009 when we were debating Obamacare why not we want to address job lock this is what you said so the key question that ought to be addressed in any health care reform legislation as are we going to continue job lock or are we going to allow individuals more choice and probability and portability to fit the 21st century work force unquote I agree with you a hundred percent I think the answer is yes giving workers more choice is not unique to Obamacare other federal programs have reduced the amount of labor that workers choose to supply just like Social Security right mr. German i will take the rest year 39 seconds to respond or a couple points Social Security then was to help produce a system so that older workers could not be destitute and compete for younger workers for jobs so it was sort of the opposite attempt which was to bring younger workers into the workforce by providing associated benefit back during those days this is the opposite this is saying younger workers the very people we want to go into the workforce to work are being dis incentivized to do that so it's sort of the opposite of what you're trying to suggest and I took my time but I'll just I'll just just since you invoked me I'm going to do this turn oh don't don't shut me out there God locks job lock in this case is a subsidy that ends and it's a cliff that traps what we've always said is it should be it should be structured differently so that you don't produce this kind of effect so we have literally a very different idea on how to address this issue so that you always encourage a person to go into the workforce so you always encourage a person to work and Obamacare is structured the opposite of what let's Europe intended that's your thing I mean I'm still going to have at the end and we're still basically talking about older workers like my point to my friends on the other side and I'm glad what you've said because now we can all look right without any might be a socialistic scheme gentleman's gentleman has expired the pillar to say is oh

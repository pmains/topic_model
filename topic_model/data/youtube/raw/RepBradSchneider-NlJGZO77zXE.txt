joining us now Democratic congressman Brad Schneider from Illinois represented thanks for being with us here today and I hope you're having a great Sunday I want to start with Richard yet you you bet you recently hosted a healthcare forum with your constituents and they've been quite heated as we have seen over recent months what were you hearing from moderates and independents well this issue I hear about more than any other issue in my district we've received more than 5,000 emails letters phone calls about health care concerns about protecting the progress we've made they don't want to see repeal and going back to what we had they want to see us working together and in particular working across party lines to build on the successes address the problems and what can't be fixed looking for new solutions and that's what I'm focused on and that's what I'm hearing from everyone in the district what are some of the ideas that you are hearing from moderates there in your district well so what we're hearing a sense of number one protect making sure we protect issues like pre-existing conditions okay in my district that I met a woman named Diane who after 30 years at the same job lost her job to outsourcing but because of the Affordable Care Act she was able to get health insurance for both her and her husband in spite of the pre-existing conditions these are some of the concerns what we're seeing as far as ideas moving forward is looking at making reinsurance permanent its strengthening that the cost-sharing reductions we introduced to that piece of legislation that would just require terminating employees to be told or allow terminating employees to be told that in addition to Cobra there are options on the market exchanges that might even be less expensive than Cobra and more permanent so these are some of the things we want to do to move forward also just based on I know you're summarizing what you have heard and is certainly not an exhaustive list of what you did learn during your townhall there was an idea that you would support one of them that's been floated based on what you said so far is do focus on the private side of this question and then on the Medicaid side leave that alone for now would you support that well we've got to make sure that we protect Medicaid the Republican bill that would cut Medicaid by more than a quarter in the first ten years more than more than a third and in the second ten years puts the most the people who are struggling the most at the most risk which is just the absolute wrong way to go what I support is trying to get more people access to health care more people with insurance that's why I think this idea of stronger cost-sharing arrangements where people who are struggling who are earning significantly but represent is that a yes or no to the again I was saying leave the Medicaid which has been floated on the right or leave their Medicaid alone and which this on the private insurance part of this including exchanges well we should leave the Medicaid alone and we should be focusing on on trying to strengthen the exchanges absolutely okay all right great thank you so much Democratic congressman Brad Snyder from Illinois appreciate your time so far okay thank you glad to be

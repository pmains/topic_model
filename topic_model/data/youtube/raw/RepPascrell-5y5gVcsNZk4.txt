to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district hello I'm my congressman bill Pascrell I like to welcome you to the latest edition of to the point we have two great congressman from the Northeast join yesterday first up representing the first congressional district of Connecticut is congressman john Larson congressman Larson began serving his hartford-based district in Congress in 1999 I was Esther happy 10 yes but before that he was a high school history teacher just like me you also owned an insurance company served on the east hartford Board of Education and the east hartford town council before being elected to the connecticut state Senate and ultimately Congress he's former chairman of the House Democratic caucus and Jon Jon's leadership in Washington is well known it's profound and he's a man of integrity that's why is here he sits alongside of me on the Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over nation's tax code trade policy Social Security will talk about that little while and Medicare second person to good friends here representing the 7th congressional district in Massachusetts is Congressman Mike Capuano okay Congress capuano is serving in nine term representing the District of Massachusetts that covers much of Boston and includes the his hometown of Somerville of course he served as mayor and the nice we got two mayor's here John you rolling on the City Council correct correct but I was a Senate President ok I forgot to mention I'm sorry did sorry he's a lawyer by trade Congress and capilano serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Financial Services Committee very critical to critical committees and the House Ethics Committee John Oh Mike thank you for joining us that I'm proud to have both of you gonna be here with you bill and you know things have changed since you got here in 90 became me the same year I was here one term ahead of you guys what's changed the most John as far as you're concerned the operations that you come into this Congress and offer well Congress has always been a place where you would have division along the party lines but it's never been as partisan as it is today would I say partisan but when i say partisan I mean that it's become more factious with one element having a particular precedence over the other members of the Republican Conference they're primarily known as the freedom caucus but for the last six years what we've seen is obstructionism but it's essentially a core group of people who are opposed to government in general instead of focusing on it's not about so you think it's worse now than you were warned your first got here yes I know I think and I don't think they're bad people by any stretch of the imagination they come from a different point of view but I think their point of view is one mmm that George Washington warned about it as farewell address when government is at war with itself and that's what's happening in the United States Congress them that's the worst thing that can happen to a Republican and democracy and so it's up to people like us to continue to reach across the aisle and hopefully be the governing body in the majority and then do it then but to reach out and get something done on behalf the American people thank you what do you think Mike what's quite simply I just think that Congress right now is being held hostage to a minority group but a group to hold sway in the Republican caucus that came here promising this is shouldn't be a surprise anybody promise to not compromise on anything that's what they said in their literature they said it and they're doing it done when I come to Congress I tell people I'm going to fight for social security education however I do it and in this case it's not the substance it mean we have substantive disagreements obviously right it's the unwillingness the absolute total unwillingness to compromise on the important issues so therefore of course if you and I disagree on something you know if you take a step forward I'll take a step forward if you take 2 i'll take two and that's the way life is politics but in this case we have people who they just think that compromises a swear word and we've no one's going to change until that changes the three of us have talked about how do we meet halfway across the bridge anyway on some subjects that we think we can get some compromise and one of the subjects that you two guys have worked on and I was fortunate to work with you with social security so John you worked on a piece of legislation which mike and i are co-sponsor of and we travel to eat northeast to talk to people about this legislation can you tell us quickly well you're both original co-sponsors and I think we start from a from a basic premise that very group that Mike is talking about is referred to Social Security is an entitlement program it's not an entitlement it's yours bro reference that you paid for right and I think that that's where the where that's where I think compromise can be achieved because this is not about an entitlement program this is an insurance program it's called FICA the Federal Insurance contribution Act whose contribution yours and the constituents that you represent right and so they've paid into a system and so they expect it to be there and it's both of you know the system hasn't made a significant adjustment since 1983 what insurance premium amongst any of your constituents hasn't gone up since 1983 and you know the business John you were in insurance I was in the insurance business and listen the insurance industry would be the first to say when it comes to your financial security when it comes to estate planning there's three legs on the stool and one of the most important legs is social security others personal savings and finance that would happen to people after 2008 their 401ks became 101 case thank God we resisted the efforts of George Bush the privatize social security so we find ourselves in a position where really all we have to do is make it a premium adjustment and adjustment in a way that we enhance the program not cut it not have people wait longer or say that you you know you have to be older in order to receive it or cut their benefits as they age so this legislation definitely does not pay homage to privatization of Social Security no no two ways about Michael what's your take on what John came to us about and we hopefully gave you some good ideas we all we all know that something has to be done Social Security mean it's not going to disagree it tomorrow right part of the problem as I see it is that there's very few people around today that remember what life was like before Social Security how many millions wrong how many people who are their marketing you know my ancestors my grandfather's and many people had nothing it's easy to put some money away when you make some money but if you drive a truck your whole life and raise five kids and struggle to keep a home together it's almost impossible to put anything away in Social Security gave them the dignity of having some income in there later lives and it's easy to say and it sounds wonderful problem is nobody understands what happened before Social Security or night once people see it again I think they'll be clamoring left and right to make sure that we we stabilize it again in the meantime there is plenty of room John's proposal is a great proposal but there's also plenty of room to compromise that but again you have to be happy to track the part of it absolutely you just said but you have to have somebody on the other side of table who's willing to add that discussion in Razvi it's almost impossible to find anybody who really wants to but let's remember the people that won't compromise right now at the very people that for 60 years 70 years said they didn't like Social Security right they said they wanted to kill it right from the get-go the thing that is so owners to me is the fact that for instance in 2016 2017 there is no increase in the cost of living in Social Security so you got the same as you got last year or whatever this has happened a few times in the past several years six as in the patent six years wow that's a lot longer than I thought what does that say to the seniors and then again what don't we like and we we've discussed this before what don't we like about that formula and quickly how should it be changed well what the bill does it does for things first and increases social security across the board by two percent right a modest increase secondly it says especially for working women who find themselves in the god awful situation where they could have paid in all their quarters but retire into poverty so our bill says that the new floor for Social Security will be a hundred and twenty-five percent of poverty the third thing we do addressing the concern of a cola is say that colas will be calculated much the living not on CPI but on what we call cpi-e something that the AARP has been pushing for a number of years and that means essentially your cost of living is based on medical devices food food heating and cooling your home's doctor visit most people don't know that that's not included they don't right now well as you know how we calculate you're saying the I in general and so that accounts for when you take into all consumer goods a lot of things that the other they don't spend on that's we don't have an increase the other thing that we do and most significantly is we provide a tax cut there will be 11 million Americans currently and that's only going to grow with the baby boomers coming continuing to come through social security get an instant tax cut and that's 11 million people why because we haven't touched this program since 1983 and because it was an indexed if you're single and making more than 25 thousand dollars you're taxed on your social security if you're a married couple and you know what that's like in New Jersey and Massachusetts and Connecticut you're married couples probably have more than thirty two thousand dollars in income which means their social security is taxed and people are either working for two reasons one because they like the idea of feeling useful in having a purpose and the other more likely because they need it and so why should we be taxing them again on those benefits this has received broad appeal as one of the catches that a number of our Republican colleagues really like about this and the program's completely paid for it doesn't increase the name we're going to get to where they're really good to have we pay for it in a second sure but Mike you and I talked about this first bit you know back ten years ago when Lindsey Graham was in the House of Representatives he and i came to some agreement on how we're going to make some changes with Social Security one of these agreed was raising the threshold so what does that mean my pole no longer we do I mean right now I'm under was there 117,000 something like a 110 hundred and fifteen so I'm like you don't tax me on that yeah which means Warren Buffett pays the exact same amount of money in fiker is yeah hi there you go and and I I gotta be honest I mean everybody this is a controversial issue but I think that people like Warren Buffett and he's not a problem yeah she agrees with this concept but you know Donald Trump they should be paying into it and they should be part of the solution making sure that seniors don't have to make the difficult choices they used to make a part of the bill goes from when the threshold us from 117 to 400,000 correct so now more money more revenue is going to be coming in and you know and we're out in front of seniors talking about this we essentially say this for Bill Gates or Warren Buffett they stop paying into the program at nine o'clock on january first that's how much money they have and so what 400,000 represents is four tenths of one percent of the american people so why do that well because of the buffer that's needed because of the increase of baby boomers coming through the population that's why we opted to go that it also follows the republican change in the tax code that was made in 2012 in an effort to attract Republicans to this and say that we're you know this is being reasonable and also quite frankly the look at middle class individuals who are dealing with paying for education having to refinance their houses having to deal with medical expenses and loss of benefits and so it was felt that this would add on to them too much of a burden but everybody's going to have skin in the game because we've got to do something about social security and we got to pay for it there's no two ways about it it's not pie in the sky we need to extend that this plan extends it for 75 years at least and and beyond the only one with an actual report that says it does very good and that's why it's gotten support from both the left the right in the center how I get into this subject that all three of us said I've had something to do it because in our state's it's a very important issue transportation and a lot of states of the union have a major problem of dealing with their own trust funds their transportation trust funds money that categorically set aside for whatever they choose to raise the money in that particular state to help them the roads the airport's the bridges etc etc etc why will we not invest in our transportation system in our roads and when we know that it's important not only for us but for commerce in the United States of America Michael you're on the Transportation Committee we looked at your leadership their gas tax is what primarily funds transportation in this video is supposed to mention yeah that's what it is it's an 18-point yes hasn't changed since I wants almost 30 years and everybody knows you cannot buy anything today anything not milk not steal for a road for the same amount of money you could pay for it 20 or 30 years ago just can't be done that's not unusual but raising that amount of money has been impossible thus far on in a climate where all taxes as inherently evil and what's ended up happening is that infrastructure is slowly deteriorating it's not just the roads and bridges it's also our sewers and a lot of pipes of things you can't see that I'm around and that it obviously impacts everybody's daily life and it's in your mass transit is part of this the roads are part of his the airport's a part of this and the problem is it really kind of strikes me as funny because the godfather of the modern republican movement ronald reagan was the last president who doubled not just increase doubled the gas tax because he understood that an investment in infrastructure is an investment in ourselves and it was dwight eisenhower that actually started he started it the image system in the Ronald Reagan went from nine point eight cents to a year and 9.6 sense to 18.2 and because that put hundreds of thousands of people to work building all these roads and fixing them and stop and think about what this life would be like if we had the same road system of the 1970s we can't move as it is exactly I I mean New Jersey has some real serious commuter problems I mean so does Boston so this Connecticut it's no angle almost everywhere the largest public transportation system all country yeah if you cut off federal money what you can't drive so we're going to fly your own helicopter maybe we'll get to that so that people don't realize it's not just commuters it's also interstate commerce I mean the rail system from Washington to Boston's the most heavily traveled rail corridor in the country one of the most heavily traveled in the world referring and yet guess how many tunnels go from New Jersey to New York for trains one yeah and guess how old it is almost a hundred years it is it's just in yet we can we screwed up building a new one when the president governor decided that we work on the we're gonna cut that off because there was going to be some / / costs that is so now we're going to build another tunnel was gonna cost more than the original tunnel tell me what I'm missing here just simply a matter of people not wanting to put investments into themselves yeah but I think that Mike's exactly right and I think the whole question is investing in the American people and look at whether it's by way of what I would call a user's fee meaning you're going to be on the highway you got to use gasoline so when you fill up tax it or I would favor a carbon I would favor anything that creates the revenue for us to address the problem that every single certified board member who's taken a look at our infrastructure and by that we mean roads bridges sewage systems levees but airports deep harbors bus systems broadband for our schools all of the things that are essential for as Mike points out the flow of Commerce but also to take us into you know we're already in this century we have to prepare for the next century we've got to have the vision of people like Eisenhower and people certainly like Ronald Reagan which is amazing that the party in control doesn't look at this as an investment in them in the American people instead they look at this as a tax and so calm ently thank God through the efforts of Mike and a good guy like bill Shuster were able to get a somewhat of a nonpartisan program right this was always a nonpartisan well within law Congress only lately because it's been scribed as a tax issue do people refuse to invest in a meanwhile the infrastructure is crumbling around us I think I believe strongly that Hillary Clinton's going to be the next president and but whoever it is I believe is going to be going to invest robustly in our infrastructure because we have to when the Republicans are finally coming around to the idea that if we're not able to look at congressional directive projects as Mike likes to point out and to make those investments in our own districts then what good are we representing our district if everything comes from the top down from the executive branch and if we're not going to invest in our own people then how are we going to move the country forward economically and from joshua has your stay past its trust fund that kept up Noah course all states are hurting because they yours and let's just increase the gas tax a little bit right not enough to keep up not ahead not enough to get ahead enough to kind of catch me about New Jersey I know the weapons done anything I know the answer today so how do I argue down here in the Congress of the United States or the only 12 congressman here Democrats Republicans in New Jersey we haven't even taking care of our own situation and I'm asking the federal government to tax its citizens and sudden monies in New Jersey but res but that's a state not putting enough money on the table it also makes you relatively de facto ineligible to access billions of federal dollars right now one of the projects that I've been working on for years is extending a subway line out to a very urbanized area it's going to cost two billion dollars the federal government is coming up with 1 billion if any state can't get the state can't come up with it shift the federal government won't give it it's not the federal gov'ment doesn't pay for it on bail set what you can't if the state doesn't have the money for its share of the cost but how do you answer those people Michaelson but now you're going to go deeper into debt in order to bilder well because like you actually say Martin we get all the Torre simple I went dieter guys gonna break us and you know when I'm to debt for an education I went deep into debt to buy a home why did I do that those are boasting that both investments in my future and the future of my family I don't want to go into debt I would have rather gotten a free education right well somebody give me a home but there are times in life when you go into debt in order to invest in your future transportation has always been one of those things and bottom line is again if people are so short-sighted I think the roads are somehow going to be built for free or the tour the transit the daily commute from Paterson in New York and back is going to become so much easier by doing nothing they know they're kidding themselves I mean no one likes to perry wants free stuff and nobody wants to pay for anything but if that's the case then you can't complain about having terrible infrastructure but I I see some glimmer of hope in the fact that we've got folks from the other side that I want to talk to us about cutting about taxes increasing revenue cutting taxes certain taxes etc etc and being fair about it and not you know moving towards simply those folks whose make a lot of money you know protecting them what about the average person an American people are angry about this kind of stuff I see that as hopeful my and transportation the same way that we even had a compromise mike is a surprise to me it was everything but the money we got the money flat I want to be clear two or three years ago now the US Chamber of Commerce one of the most Pro republican national organizations in the country one of the most obviously the most business pro group in the country endorsed an increase in the gas tax or not because they think it's so easily done there's no better truckers they represent all the people would be paying the trucks pay a lot of taxes when you increase the gas tax they did it because they know that the investments important if the US Chamber of Commerce can find a way to support new revenues certainly some of my political friendship I don't think it's a matter of courage as well I mean the very people in the Congress of the United States democrats or republicans argue about any increase revenue don't even want to talk about tax that they don't want to use the term in any any narrative whatsoever so what does this mean it means that well we're going to have to cut these programs in order to build this highway now I'm oversimplifying but I think the idea i think that's not oversimplifying it off and and what that means is well the program maybe does it affect you but it may affect all of these people over here and you know we know programs have to be reviewed reformed a better etc but we let you get down to the nitty-gritty and and people don't understand revenue expenses and how you going to pay for this kind of thing but you don't pay for it on the backs of other people but they but they do if they simply put it in their own personal lives look I want a beautiful indoor pool in my backyard I can't afford it so therefore I don't have it at the same time I do have to paint the house every 7 to 10 years have to do it I find the way to do it and this country is a very wealthy country and a very innovative very innovative country and there are ways to get these things done but it cannot be done for free and it cannot be done on the basis of income that's now 20 years without an increase no one at home could put their lives together based on what they were earning 20 years ago Michael do you think that we would have better answers for the problems that face Americans if we had authentic tax reform in the United States like the comic congressman but talking about it for 15 years nothing's happened do you think that that would be one of the very germane ways of getting this thing moving it could be in a realistic way but the last person that proposed a comprehensive tax reform was a Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee go and they day he put it out he got a croaked by his own party yeah nobody had a thoughtful discussion about what he did they just crucified him on the basis of he was raising some things lowering some things actually was a plan that I didn't like but they had some good things in it some bad things in it more than happy to engage in a discussion but he just got croaked and the thing when nowhere and that's when they were in the majority and you know they're still in the majority and they haven't been able to bring a plan forward even though there's not much space between what the president proposes and even with dave Camp proposed absolutely but their lack of ability to compromise yeah because they're dug in on these issues has presented prevented us from doing the right thing not only my where the higher individuals but also for corporate America you know they're you know we should be lowering the tax rates on our on our companies and providing extra incentives for manufacturing because of the right 421 payback but we also should be lessening the burden on individuals but we have to look to lighten the load with earned income tax credits and other ways for us to recognize people who are at the lower end of the pay scale and then buttressing the ability of people in the middle class to hold on to what they've been able to make and make their dollar go further and we can do that through the code and there's and there's not a great deal of difference but what the reluctance has been is a anything that Obama would be in favor of they couldn't be they couldn't see it passed because it would be accredited ultimately to him that's a shame but that shows you what a small group of people dug in I can do Grover Norquist most famously said look we want to take government and shrink it up so small we can drown it in the bathtub and unfortunately there are a group that really subscribe to that theory until they take a step back and realize we'll wait a minute that's my district who am I drowning in a bathtub like instead after all it's still we the people and it's the people that are drowning because government isn't doing the responsible thing including stepping up and making reasonable adjustments to the tax code so that we have the revenue to sustain ourselves and then also looking at cuts in a way that will be beneficial that provide incentive all of us voted for the research and development tax credit which is very helpful long time so I'm not supposed to talk about taxes oh the 20,000 some odd pages in the tax code most of those pages are put there by rich corporations that had enough money to hire rich lawyers to make them richer and that's the fact of life I mean the average guy had nothing to do about that back scored very little I made a proposal eight years ago to the then chairman of the what Ted what later became the freedom caucus wasn't even the freedom caucus then that we get rid of every single exemption every single deduction every single credit in the corporate code and simply make it a one item that would have by doing that you can keep the revenues the same it would have reduced the rate by about ten percent we don't have we run out of time I want to thank you congressman Larson Congress a couple and I really really really want to thank you from bottom my heart you've done a great service to the country and now I would like to hear what you think about what we were talking about today so you have any comments if you have any other concerns or questions you got to stay tuned our address our phone number and the website address will appear in a moment and thanks again thanks to our guests they were terrific I think you'd agree and we'll see you on the next time on to the point thank you John

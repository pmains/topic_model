to you thank you Mr chair I know the it's been a lengthy substantive hearing appreciate the participation of both of our Witnesses and all apologies in advance for jumping into some weeds here the the questions that remain to be asked I believe for today uh do get technical and specific and I'll start with Mr Watson and your testimony you mentioned that crimes of genocide and other war crimes merely carry the generic five-year statute of limitations when the violations do not result in death you also stated that the crime of torture carries an eight-year statute of limitation if the acts did not result in death or serious bodily injury or the foreseeable risk of such so take this as an open-ended question do you believe the statute of limitations changes proposed into Justice for victims of war crimes act are a step in the right direction and can you uh it just reference any any data or experience in uh sort of supporting the suggestions for a the changes um thank you for your question Senator um yes is my response that I believe the changes to the extension of statute of limitations would be helpful um to uh the law enforcement Partners at the human right violators War crime Center and I would just highlight in support of that assessment um our investigation of of a Rwandan National Beatrice mignon who was implicated in genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and she by way of fraud came to the United States in 1998 and through up to nine uh trips by HSI Boston special agents to Rwanda to collect information of evidentiary purpose for criminal prosecution which wasn't presented until uh in or about 2000 um I want to say 2010 I believe it was but nevertheless she obtained U.S citizenship in 2003 right so when we look at the context of 1994 when the uh Tootsie and hutus were engaged in in in those activities those heinous crimes against humanity and genocide um clearly with the statute being what it is there was more time right in excess of 10 years uh before our special agents and Regional support team members historians were able to work with our International Partners to obtain the relevant evidence to present a viable criminal prosecution and even so we only presented fraud by way of naturalization and potentially perjury as two substantive charges that were ultimately perfected where umezi was convicted so I would say by way of that situation in that investigation where she was sentenced to 10 years ultimately served about just over seven and was subsequently Deport did to Rwanda and is currently on trial right now for crimes of genocide that that specific incense would apply that's a excellent example so safe to say that the The Five-Year and eight year uh statutes that I referenced uh serve as a disincentive for longer term investigation let alone identification or prosecution yes Senator okay thank you now go back to Mr Rosenbaum you acknowledged in your testimony that our current body of substantive human rights law is limited jurisdictional temporal and evidentiary limitations while the justice for victims of war crimes act would allow the Department of Justice to prosecute alleged war crimes who are present in the United States the requirement of establishing specific intent to prove alleged offenders have committed genocide and torture presents an often insurmountable evidentiary bar I can explain how our current jurisdictional and evidentiary limitations would affect potential prosecutions of Russian Nationals present in the United States for crimes committed in Ukraine thank you Senator um because we don't have a so-called present in jurisdiction in general Russian war criminals who might come here would not be prosecutable criminally for the underlying uh war crimes um and the justice department believes strongly that that that should be corrected um I would say also going back to the discussion that you had or the question you posed to my colleague assistant director Watson statutes of limitations definitely should be expanded as we see it not only for substantive offenses but also for the immigration and naturalization fraud criminal prosecutions that are often our only recourse in human rights violator cases those are five years for a Visa fraud and 10 years for naturalization fraud as you probably know it's often decades before the government even learns about the underlying human rights crimes and by then the statute of limitation says run that was our experience in all of the World War II Nazi cases for instance okay thank you very much for I have other questions for the record thank you Mr chair

for one minute thanks mr. Speaker I rise today speak about the importance of impact aid which helps more than 1,300 school districts in our country make up for lost revenue due to the impact of federal activity in federal lands that reduce the available tax base among the most heavily impacted districts in the country the central kitsap school district is home to many students whose parents work at naval facilities for too long this school district has not received the heavy impact aid funding that has it is historically relied on to support these military-connected kids I'd like to thank the education work force committee ranking member mr. Scott for working with me to include a provision in an amendment that will soon consider to help school districts like Central Kitsap get the impact aid funding that they rely on I look forward to working with the committee and our colleagues in the Senate to include this provision in any final legislation that reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act mr. speaker this is important to kids thank you mr. speaker and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman from Washington

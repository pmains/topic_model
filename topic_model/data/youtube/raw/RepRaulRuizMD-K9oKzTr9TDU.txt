thank you mr chairman for holding this important hearing i'm especially excited for this hearing today because what it means for my district and the salton sea as you know electric cars around the globe use lithium-ion batteries and mainly get their supply from countries like australia chile and china however right under our noses there is potentially massive supply of lithium right here in the united states and that's underneath the sea in fact the world's fifth largest lithium deposit is under the sun obviously this lithium deposit presents an incredible opportunity to transform our region and our entire nation into a global leader in clean energy production the area is appropriately nicknamed lithium valley because of its incredible potential to power our clean energy future and to manufacture the batteries that we need with the lithium underneath the sultan c we can help end our nation's dependence on foreign oil with clean energy technology that means we won't be dependent on countries like russia who clearly doesn't share our values the lithium deposit under the consultancy also means good paying clean energy jobs that will stimulate our local economy and move our nation forward towards our clean energy future so i am dedicated to ensuring that the benefit of this lithium extraction goes back to the communities and working families where it is needed and frankly where it belongs mr holy cross in your testimony you stated the need to strengthen our domestic supply chains for batteries do you include lithium in that assessment absolutely thank you and also you note in your testimony that there is soaring demand and excitement for electrical vehicles assuming these vehicles use lithium batteries for power does the us currently extract process and recycle enough lithium to support a robust domestically sourced battery manufacturing industry we're you know we're going to need to continue to accelerate the pace of having more supply domestically and that's why we're hopeful that with the signals we've sent with the capacity we plan for the vehicles that that will reinforce the importance of policies to increase the supply and materials you indicated thank you uh and it is also critically important to ensure that communities environmental health is protected and the lithium that could be extracted from the uh salted sea is a byproduct from the brine the fluid the brine that geothermal companies use to generate geothermal energy so there's no breaking new ground in this but how can policy expand the domestic supply chain for batteries and their materials in ways that protect public health and the environment well it is what you said and it's also utilizing the best practices that companies like ford have had in place for some time in terms of how to responsibly do this how to make sure we partner with our supply chains to ensure that this is done in the most environmentally and socially responsible way by investing in the new technologies to extract these materials and to create the kinds of jobs that you spoke about so that it's it's equitable and it's also providing access uh to the broader economy to participate in this so we're excited about the opportunities you've highlighted and it's it is all about exactly how we do this in the most responsible way well i'd like to continue to discuss this further with you and potentially uh visit the salton sea with your company and other companies this is going to require a very large public and private partnership in order for us to do that the important part here is to make sure that the communities are involved that there is community benefit projects and investment and that labor and working families are at the table so that we can maximize the value for everybody uh in in the area it is an economically depressed area but we have cheap uh electricity and we have a labor pool that is willing to work uh and they've proven themselves of being very hard-working uh families and so this is a great opportunity look the president in his address to the nation said that we need to stop our dependency in buying batteries from china and produce them here having the fifth largest lithium deposit underneath the world underneath the salton sea can make us the second largest lithium exporting country even using the lithium for our own battery production needs so this is a great opportunity chairman i think we should pursue and have more hearings on and with that i yield back my time

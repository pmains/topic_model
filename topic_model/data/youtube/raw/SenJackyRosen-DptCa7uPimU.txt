i want to talk about small arms range for nevada for training in nevada so secretary warmuth nevada does not have an approved small arms qualification range in order for soldiers to annually qualify in an approved range nevada's units must transport soldiers somewhere between 200 and 600 miles out of state to meet this requirement the average cost for a unit to tend to attend the out-of-state weapons qualification is 500 000 half a million dollars a year per unit some units mitigate this by sacrificing training days in order to travel using vehicles assigned to the unit it takes an additional two to three days of travel time which is not often an option so the national guard bureau has justified the requirement for one multi-purpose range complex for nevada and the nevada army national guard has required excuse me a 25-year lease at hawthorne army depot which is already in the center of our state however the current timeline for milcon funding to be approved is 2030 at its earliest so given that financial court cost to transport soldiers out of state far exceeds the cost of building a range can i have your commitment to incorporate a small arms range at hawthorne army depot into future years defense planning or unfunded priority list so that our soldiers can meet their annual requirements at greater convenience and actually at a cost savings to the taxpayer senator rose and i will absolutely look into that and again you know work with it sounds like uh general jensen the director of the army guard and general daly to see if there's something that we can do there well i i was not aware of that you know arms requirement we will take that on you know thank you okay for that marksmanship our soldiers need to be able to shoot we shouldn't have to go all over the state to do that i i just was not aware of that one i'll take that one on personal at hawthorne army depot it's easy to get it shameful senator but we owe it like the senator said let's take a look at it thank you first i've heard of it and i've been in the army for 41 years but we will we'll take take a look at that and we'll get on it i i appreciate it

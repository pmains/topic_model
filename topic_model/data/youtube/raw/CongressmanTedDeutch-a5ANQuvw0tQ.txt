  PROBLEMS GOING FORWARD.  MR. WALDEN: I WITHDRAW MY  RESERVATION, MR. CHAIRMAN. MR. DEUTCH: I THANK MY FRIEND. THE CHAIR: THE RESERVATION IS  WITHDRAWN. WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE READING   IS DISPENSED WITH. IS THE OBJECTION TO THE  ORIGINAL REQUEST?  WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE AMENDMENT IS MODIFIED. THE GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA IS  RECOGNIZED.  MR. DEUTCH: THANK YOU, MR.   I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I  MAY NEED.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN IS  RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. DEUTCH: THANK YOU. I THANK MY FLORIDA COLLEAGUE,  REPRESENTATIVE CASTOR FOR HER  LEADERSHIP IN PROTECTING ACCESS  TO PTECTING HIGH EQUALITY  HEALTH CARE ACROSS OUR STATE AND THE COUNTRY, TO HELP MORE  AMERICANS SHOP FOR AND SIGN UP   FOR HEALTH PLANS ON  HEALTHCARE.GOV.  MY AMENDMENT REQUIRESIG NAVATORS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION IN PLAIN  LANGUAGE ABOUT THE 10 ESSENTIAL  HEALTH BENEFITS THAT ARE A PART  OF EVERY HEALTHCARE.GOV PLAN.  OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE,  EMERGENCY CARE, HOSPITALIZATION, PREGNANCY, MATERNITY AND NEWBORN CARE, MENTAL HEALTH AND  SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES, PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES,  REHABILITATIVE SERVICES, LABS,   PREVENTIVE CARE, AND PEDIATRIC   CARE, INCLUDING DENTAL AND   VISION SERVICES. IT ALSO REQUIRES NAVIGATORS TO   HELP CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THEIR  PROTECTIONS UNDER THE MENTAL   HEALTH PARITY LAW. ACCORDING TO A SURVEY  COMMISSIONED BY THE AMERICAN   PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, ONLY  4% OF AMERICANS WERE FAMILIAR  WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY  AS OF 2014.  AND JUST 7% WERE AWARE OF MENTAL HEALTH PARITY MORE BROADLY.  OSE NUMBERS DIDN'T CHANGE FROM THE TIME OF PASSAGE OF THE   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN 2010  THROUGH THE FIRST YEARS O   ENROLLMENT IN 2014.  MENTAL HEALTH PARITY MEANS   INSURANCE COMPAES C'T  DISCRIMINATE AGAINST AMERICANS   BATTLING ADDIC ITIONN THE OPIOID CRISIS.  PARITY MEANS INSURANCE CPANIES CAN'T MAKE IT HARDER TO GET CARE FOR DEADLY EATING DISORDERS THAN IT IS TO GET CARE FOR DEADLY   CANCER.  PARITY MEANS WE TREAT MENTAL   HEALTH CARE LIKE HEALTH CARE,  BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT   IS.  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S  PROTECTIONS HAVE SAVED LIVES AND THE FINANCIAL SECURITY OF  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. INCLUDING ONE FAMILY WHO TOLD ME THE STORY OF THEIRTL BATE TO   TREAT THEIR 19-YEAR-OLD  DAUGHTER'S EATING DISORDER.  HERE'S WHA THEY SAID. R DAUGHTER WAS A SOPHOMORE IN  COLLEGE WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED   WITH AN EATING DISORDER. SHE HAD TO TAKE SEVERAL LEAVES   OF ABSENCE FROM HER STUDIES TO   SEEK TREATMENT.  THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN   FINANCIALLY POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE A.C.A. HAD SHE LEFT SCHOOL FOR  TREATMENT BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF  THE A.C,.A. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN  DROPPED FROM OUR FAMILY  INSURANCE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE A.C.A. SHE  COULD CONTINUE UNDER OUR   COVERAGE.  IT WAS THIS ONGOING TREATMENT  THAT HAS ALLOWED OUR DAUGHTER TO REGAIN HER HEALTH ENOUGH TO  GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE AND  MAINTAIN FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. AND WHILE IT'S CLEAR THAT PARITY HAS MADE IMPROVEMENTS, WE STILL  HAVE MORE TO DO. THIS WEEK I HEARD FROM ANOTHER   FAMILY IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT  THEIR DAUGHTER'S STRUGGLE TO GET COVERAGE AND TREATMENT.  IN THE CYCLE OF DENIALS AND  ARBITRARILY REDUCED LEVELS OF  CARE, HER FAMILY WAS ABLE TO USE THE PARITY LAW TO FIGHT FOR  THEIR DAUGHTER'S LIFE IN THE   COURTS.  BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. PARITY PROTECTIONS HAVE OPENED   DOORS TO BETTER MENTAL HEALTH  AND ADDICTION TREATMENT FOR SO   MANY AMERICANS, BUT AS WE  OBSERVE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS  MONTH, IT'S IMPORTANT TO   ACKNOWLEDGE HOW FAR WE HAVE TO   GO.  MY AMENDMENT WILL HELP MORE  AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THE   BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS   AVAILABLE TO THEM AND HELP THEM  GET THE CARE THEY NEED.  AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO  SUPPORT IT AND I RESERVE THE   BALANCE OF MY TIME.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN FROM  FLORIDA RESERVES.  FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE  GENTLEMAN FROM OREGON RISE?  MR. WALDEN: THANK YOU, MR.   CHAIRMAN.  I SEEK TIME IN OPPOSITION TO THE GENTLEMAN'S EALED. -- AMENDMENT.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN IS  RECOGNIZED.  MR. WALDEN: AND I RESERHEVE T  BALANCE OF MY TIME.  THE CHAIHER: T GENTLEMAN   RESERVES THE BALANCE OF HIS  TIME.  THE GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA.  MR. DEUTCH: MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS   IS AN IMPORTANT AMENDMENT SO   THAT EVERY AMERICAN UNDENDRSTAS  THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS HEALTH AND THAT WE NEED TO CARE AS MUCH   ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR BODIES,  FROM OUR SHOULDERS UP, AS WE DO  FROM OUR SHOULDERS DOWN. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE  MADE AWARE OF. SO THEY HAVE THE ABILIOTY T  FIGHT FOR THAT ACCESS TO MENTAL  HEALTH CARE. I YIELD BACK THLAE BANCE OF MY   TIME.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS  BACK THE BALANCE OF HIS TIME.  THE GENTLEMAN FROM OREGON IS   RECOGNIZED.  MR. WALDEN: THANK YOU, MR.   CHAIRMAN.  I APPRECIATE THAT. I APPRECIATE THE GENTLEMAN'S   COMMITMENT, ESPECIALLY ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  HE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS  AREA.  AND I KNOW, MR. CHAIRMAN, WHEN   WE IN THE LAST CONGRESS WORKED   TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN WAY, WE PASSED 60 DIFFERENT BILLS  RELATED TO THE DEADLY SCOURGE OF OPIOID ADDICTION AND OVERDOSE. AND IN THE PRIOR CONGRESS TO 
  THAT, I BELIEVE IS WHEN WE   REWROTE AMERICA'S MENTAL HEALTH  LAWS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN   DECADES. WE ALL HAVE FRIENDS, FAMILY,   PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT   NEED HELP, ESPECIALLY WITH   MENTAL HEALTH AND, AS WE KNOW,   WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS.  AND WE DID A LOT OF GOOD WORK,   I'D SAY, AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE   SURE, TO THE GENTLEMAN'S T,POIN  THAT THE EFFORTS WE HAVE PUT   FORWARD, THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE  INITIATED, AND THE FUNDING WE  PUT BEHIND IT, BEHIND THOSE  PROGRAMS, ACTUALLY GET TO THE  PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HELP.  I MIGHT YIELD SOME TIME TO DR.   BURGESS OF TEXAS WHO WAS   CHAIRMAN OF OUR SUBCOMMITTEE   WHEN WE WERE IN THE MAJORITY AND IS NOW THE TOP REPUBLICAN IN THE HEALTH SUBCOMMITTEE, TO TALK A   LITTLE BIT ABOUT THESE ISSUES. I YIELD TO HIM.  MR. BURGESS: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING.  I THINK THE KINDEST THING I CAN  SAY ABOUT THIS AMENDMENT IS IT   SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. JUST A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE   HISTORY OF MENTAL HEALTH PARITY  AS IT RELATES TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  OF COURSE THOSE OF US WHO WERE   HERE IN THIS CONGRESS, THE DAY   AFTER THE LEHMAN BROT HERS BANKRUPTCY WAS DECLARED IN   SEPTEMBER OF 2008, WILL RECALL   PATRICK KENNEDY'S BILL DEALING   WITH MENTAL HEALTH PARITY WAS  USED AS THE VEHICLE TO PROVIDE   TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM,   WHICH FOLLOWED IN THE WAKE OF  THE LEHMAN BROTHERS BANKRUPTCY.  SO MENTAL HEALTH PARITY WAS  ACTUALLY WRITTEN INTO LAW IN   2008, SIGNED BY GEORGE W. BUSH.  THAT WAS TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THE  PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE   ACT SO, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  COMES ALONG -- ACT, SO THE   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COMES ALONG, THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS  DISESCLOD IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN NOVEMBER OF 2012, ABOUT A WEEK AFTER ELECTION DAY, IF I  RECALL CORRECTLY, THE MENTAL   HEALTH PARITY RULES WERE NOT   WRITTEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF   HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNTIL  PROBABLY TWO YEARS AFTER THAT. BUT THEY WERE WRITTEN UNDER  SECRETARY SEBELIUS AND AS A  CONSEQUENCE THOSE ARE THE --   THOSE HAVE BEEN THE RULES OF THE ROAD EVER SINCE. I GUESS WHAT I DON'T QUITE   UNDERSTAND IS WHY THE NAVIGATOR  SYSTEM CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS NOT  CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY THAT WOULD  HAVE ALLOWED THIS INFORMATION TO BE PART OF THE PACKAGE OF  INFORMATION THAT IS DISCLOSED BY THE NAVIGATORS.  PERHAPS HAD WE HAD A HEARING IN  THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE  COMMITTEE DEALING WITH THIS, IT  MIGHT HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTIVE. WHEN WE DID THE 10-YEAR  RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE STATE  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE  PROGRAM A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO , THE PARITY LANGUAGE WAS IN   FACT INCLUDED AT THE REQUEST OF  A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THE   ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE. THE PARITY LANGUAGE WAS INCLUDED IN THE REWRITING OF THE  RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE STATE  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE  PROGRAM. BUT MY RECOLLECTION WAS IN THE   NAVIGATOR PROGRAM, THIS SHOULD   HAVE BEEN PART OF THE BASIC  INFORMATION OFFERED BY THE   NAVIGATORS AND I GUESS, TO SUM   UP, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT   WOULD NOW TAKE AN ACT OF   CONGRESS TO GET THEM TO DO WHAT  THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DO UPON  THE SIGNING OF THE PASSAGE OF  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I YIELD BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN  FROM OREGON. MR. WALDEN: I WOULD JUST   CONCLUDE, I APPRECIATE THE   GENTLEMAN'S COMMENTS.  AND AS I LOOK AT A BUNCH OF  AMENDM CENTSOMING UP, TO MY  COLLEAGUE FROM TEXAS, THERE ARE  A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE THAT  THEY'RE SAYING, OMB WE'VE GOT TO ORDER THE NAVARRO -- OH, WE'VE   GOT TO ORDER THE NAVIGATORS TO   DO THIS, DO THIS, DO THAT. YOU WONDERAT, WH IS THEIR  CURRENT TRAINING?  DO -- THAT WE HAVE TO PASS LAWS  TELLING THEM TO KIND OF LEARN  ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THEN GO   TALK TO PEOPLE.  THIS IS PART OF MY ARGUMENT. WE'RE PUMPING A LOT OF MONEY   INTO A PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW  THERE'S BEEN -- I DON'T KNOW IF  I CAN SAY FRAUD, BUT IF YOU GOT  $200,000 TO ENROLL ONE PERSON OR $2.7 MILLION TO ENROLL 314,000,  SOME OF THE NATION'S LEADING   EDITORIAL WRSRITE HAVE HAD   STRONG WORDS TO SAY ABOUT THE  CORRUPTION AND SCAM ARTISTS AND  THAT SORT OF THING.  AND WE'RE HAVING TO PASS LAWS  THAT TELL THEM, BY THE WAY, TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, TALK ABOUT  SUBSTANCE ABUSE, TALK ABOUT  REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY-BASED   ORGANIZATIONS, NAVIGATOR SYSTEM, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, ALL  THESE THINGS.  HOLY SPOKES. WHAT DON'T THEY KNOW?  AND WHAT IS LEFT OUT?  WE SHOULD HAVE HEARING ON THIS   ISSUE IN THE COMMITTEE AS WELL   AS THE MEDICARE FOR ALL  PROPOSAL.  MR. CHAIRMAN, I YIELD BACK THE   BALANCE OF MY TIME.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS  BACK THE BALANCE OF HIS TIME.  THE QUESTION IS NOW ON THE   AMENDMENT AS MODIFIED BY THE   GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA.  THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE.  THOSE OPPOSED, NO. IN THE OPINION OF THE CHAIR, THE AYES HAVE IT.  THE AMENDMENT, AS MODIFIED, IS   AGREED T

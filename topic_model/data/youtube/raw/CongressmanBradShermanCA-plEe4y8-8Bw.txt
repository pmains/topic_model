that congressman brad Sherman congressman welcome here to the program but we're glad to hear from you now in an interview in the last couple of days Donald Trump gave himself an a-plus for effort a c-plus for messaging how did you rank that performance to Congress last night well certainly not an A+ for content I i think the tone however was a much more subdued than all of his other speeches almost all of the speeches are given at rallies where people are standing up or of course the inauguration where he had hundreds of thousands of people mostly standing up in a rally type situation this was more subdued and I think got him a lot more support among my Republican colleagues I mean after that election win he talked about unifying America we've seen a very bumpy divisive month can you unite a country on the agenda he's just laid out again I I don't think so we've had many presidents say we're going to get more United and we've never been more divided at least not in my lifetime so it's it's going to be difficult so I did like the paragraph that ivanka road in a speech the one about childcare and unpaid maternity leave for one or both parents I think there was some stuff in in the streets the Democrats can can get again behind if if Trump serious if it's you can get behind what are you gay to oppose what stood out for you from what you heard that you know now you are going to oppose to the now well obviously this effort to get rid of Obamacare although for many years Republicans as in saying so it's just repealed they voted to repeal it over 50 now its repeal and replace I hope it just becomes reveal and republished it's going to be very difficult to to offer the benefits of Obamacare without all of Obamacare or what we call the Affordable Care Act what worried me the most was his statements before the speech where he talks about cutting the State Department and foreign aid and our international broadcasting of by thirty-seven percent he taught to do that doesn't me you know pretty outline spending on infrastructure over a trillion dollars when defense spending is going to go out fifty four billion he's got to find that money from those areas that he touched upon doesn't he well if you cut our efforts at peace by a few billion dollars maybe that's why you need to increase our expenditures for war by sixty billion dollars or thereabout so I think that if you want to be fiscally responsible spend the money on talking Dick Cheney one said deficits don't matter do you think we're back to those days of actual big government despite some of the things don't come potete along the way well he's going to massively increase the deficit and everybody cares about the deficit just not as much as they care about everything else he wants giant tax cuts for business giant tax cuts for individuals huge additional spending on the military and he's promised a lot of infrastructure that adds up to a giant deficit he got a lot of applause across the aisle when he was talking about extinguishing I asked lawmakers on both sides a huge thunderous applause when Donald Trump a tribute to Ryan oh and the Navy SEAL who died on that raid in Yemen I'll ask you about that in a moment but I just want to play for our viewers that moment from the president we are blessed to be joined tonight by Karen Owens the widow of US Navy special operator senior chief william ryan owens Brian died as he lived a warrior and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation [Applause] congressman what do you make of that you were there listening was that a maybe where people looked and thought that is a presidential moment from Donald Trump well it's an easy thing for a president to do we all applaud those who fight for us who put their lives on the line and of course the families of those who fly you know to die in battle but when a president tries to cloak himself in the applause that's his programs aren't any better just because the widow of a serviceman is there in the audience that's what you were thinking he was doing trying to cloak himself I mean that's quite a charge he is trying he's trying to get support for his policies and he got to applause not only for the servicemen but also people who survived terrible and rare diseases I wish he had is I wish his program was solid enough that it would get applause from both sides of the aisle of obviously we would all applaud those who survived terrible illnesses those who died in the line of battle and so many other heroes in our country just on a more general note i mean the democrats took up the shell-shocked after that election results you amongst others have been grappling as a party to know quite how to oppose donald trump is it clear in your mind going forward how you're going to do that well I wasn't that surprised when he won because we've seen declining incomes of those especially with those without college education we've seen a nineteen percent decline in family incomes this century and we've had terrible trade deals Donald is doing this or the president Trump is this bait and switch where he says he's for eliminating the trade deficit and yet he's doing absolutely nothing with regard to China he has the authority under our laws to impose additional tariffs or to threaten to do so he's done none of that and our exports to China face the same Communist Party barriers and Michael enquire moves when he say bait and switch you actually like to see and do some of those things he said he do I would like to see a sensible and highly aggressive plan to force China to open its markets to to our exports and to eliminate the trade deficit if we could eliminate even a half of the trade deficit just with China we would have a labor shortage in America and Wall Street would be very upset because they'd be paying much higher wages just the Final Four Tops listening to Tina Brown yesterday giving an interview and she predicted that Donald Trump's war with the media of coming months would morph into a war with Congress as he gets snared up with actually trying to bring it to fruition many of the things he said last night is that how you see it that it in the coming months there is going to be almost a war against Congress and and and struck as a almost Congress sporting the will of the people you know he's going to have a hard time doing that he needs Republican support to spy me the investigations into his campaign which either did or didn't conspire with with he can't go to war with an institution that is majority Republican he will attack congressional Democrats he thinks that when he is going to war with with the media he's going to war with the group that's majority liberal or majority non Republican so I think that much as you might prefer that he's going after me I think he's coming after you but congressman that we are very grateful times thanks very much for being here on the program thanks

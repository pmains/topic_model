what are we to make of all of that let's ask south dakota senator mike rounds kind enough to join us from south dakota senator um that presumably is the wind that a lot of democrats back that they've got momentum with the with them and that you know joe biden wants to deliver on that momentum the question obviously becomes is he the guy to do it but what do you think i think it's a smoke screen i think what he's focused on are independents right now he's uh real close to about 19 points down with independence personally but he sees at this stage of the game uh it's almost 50 50 uh with independence on who should control congress he's focusing on independence and he's trying to basically tell them to you know don't don't look at the inflation rate don't look at gdp don't look at the energy prices don't talk about you know gas being a buck 40 more than than when he took office and if he can refocus and change the scenario then he thinks he's got a chance at winning those independents our message to those independents should be the same one that ronald reagan had way back in the 1980s are you better off today than you were four years ago and clearly the answer is no they're not well as you know senator he's seizing on the fact that gas is high as it got it's half what it was and that buck 40 surge has been cut in half and and that it's going to continue now maybe for all the wrong reasons oil's been sliding largely on the belief here that the whole world's slowing down but you take what you what you can is it your sense that that's enough for him or that americans are looking at things way beyond just some late relief at the pump part of it is what we focus on and whether or not we allow him to change the subject we have to focus number one on getting our conservatives out to vote and second of all letting independents understand very clearly that that you know these issues are something that they can change and if they want inflation to come down and if they want energy prices to come down and if they actually want to see a future where you've got a border that's secure and you're not going to have 200 000 people you know a month coming over the border and you're not going to have fentanyl in your communities then you've got to change who's at the top and that also means providing them with a congress who's going to work with them so this should be a focus on independence and on convincing them that it's okay to consider your views as being conservative in nature and you should be able to look back and say when conservatives did control our country we had a lot better things going on in our economy we've got to refocus once again and we can't let this president uh change the focus and and actually succeed with the smoke screen that he's trying to put out in front of the american people right now but do you worry senator that uh donald trump might be sucking all the oxygen out of the room maybe not intentionally but with all the fixation on the legal back and forth on the fbi raid of his home a few weeks ago uh and then the back and forth battle with republicans and whether the president's hurting his party's prospects particularly in the senate where you are uh that that he is is what's getting in your way of republicans taking that message to the people part of the focus that we as republicans have got to have during this 2022 midterm election is on the people that are on the ballot right now and you know there is no presidential election in 2022 and as much as joe biden would love to focus on getting independence to up his his uh acceptance and he would love to have a straw man in the middle of it we can't have that we can't let that happen but that's strong right i mean and some republicans that have expressed angst about that and hurting their party's chances on mitch mcconnell as uh you know wondered aloud the quality of some of the candidates i don't know if that was a direct reference to some of those supported by by the former president but do you worry that it's your party that has this conflict going on getting in the way of this very well laid out message is spelled out you know if if you talk to the members of our party they will tell you that they remember just how good things were in the united states under the previous administration when you use conservative values and that's what people are talking about is i know but those same people the senator are the ones talking about how you know unfair it was for the fbi to raid the president's home to sort of flip the party's normal narrative on supporting law and order that this is complicating things for you yeah if if we allow this as a smoke screen to get in front of what the real issues are right now and what the american people are going to be deciding this november then it's our fault let's refocus on what really counts right now in america today we've got inflation that is out of control we've got a gdp which is going down in value we've got energy prices that are still way over what they were four years ago and i'm going to say it again to those independents that are out there were you better off today than what you were four years ago and the answer clearly is you were better off four years ago when you had conservative policies in play that's what we have to focus on that's what we've got to get back to and this is a midterm and let's look at the folks who are actually on the ballot in this midterm election all right we'll see what happens senator mike grounds great seeing you again

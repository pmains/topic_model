john kennedy republican senator from louisiana good to see you today senator first of all i just want to get your top line thoughts on what's playing out and and how the white house fits in what's happening in cuba is it's a contradiction for me it's it's both beautiful but it also disgusts me to my core it's beautiful because what we're seeing is people's innate thirst for freedom i mean our desire for freedom is deeply seated it's almost part of the human condition and the cuban people want their freedom when castro took over he promised them freedom instead he gave them socialism which we now know of course is just trickle down poverty so that part is beautiful and i think we ought to do everything we can to support the people and the good people of cuba what i find disgusting is the fact that all president biden has done is issue a press release that's it i don't even know if he read the thing president biden needs to be on the telephone he needs to be calling the leaders of the uk of canada of new zealand of australia of india of japan of south korea of the european union and saying saying let's issue a joint statement supporting the people of cuba let's talk about additional sanctions on the the castro government we've got the castro government down now the people have must choke them to death president biden ought to be using all of the cyber skills that exist in the united states of america to keep that internet open in cuba so the whole world can watch and the cuban people can talk to each other and try to reinforce their actions instead rubio said it best i i i'm gonna paraphrase he said i wish president biden would spend one tenth of the time helping the people of cuba that he's spending uh spreading fairy tales to the american people when he says that the texas voting rights statute is the worst thing that happened to the uh to america since the civil war in which 700 000 americans were killed um it's a fairy tale either that he's he's the only person in the milky way who believes that either that or he he was playing frisbee in the quad during history 101. the miami mayor francis suarez no doubt will have your reaction to this he actually says bombing cuba is an option that has to be explored watch this you had interventions by by democratic presidents uh you know taking out osama bin laden and pakistan and president clinton in kosovo intervening in a humanitarian issue uh with air strikes so there have been many many opportunities uh in the history are you suggesting air strikes in cuba what i'm suggesting is that that option is one that has to be explored and cannot be just simply discarded as an option that is not on the table senator kennedy your thoughts on that i don't agree with him i don't think it's necessary to help the people of cuba i think the best way to help the people of cuba is to marshal the freedom-loving uh sources across the world in all of the countries that support freedom get together hit hit the castro government with additional sanctions and get that internet open and never let up never let up don't just issue a press release president biden ought to be talking it talking about it three times a day and twice on sunday senator real quickly you know normally we make it a binary choice what's worse staying silent or doing the wrong thing we do know from the campaign trail that joe biden and candidate had talked about easing unilateral some of them sanctions i mean that way he might work with other countries so which would you want him to be silent or are you concerned he might go down the wrong road i want him to do something i want him to get i was going to say something i shouldn't i want him to do something say what's on your mind i i won't no i'm not not not this time uh i want him i want to see the world let me put it in generic terms i want to see the leaders of the free world not just america but all freedom loving countries get up off their ice cold lazy butts and support the people of cuba not just with a press release with sanctions with uh with their cyber skills and do it repeatedly now we've got the castro government down let's choke them to death got it all right we'll get to this a small school district in california reportedly is planning to spend 40 million dollars on teaching what they call ethnic studies to high school students with consultants training teachers on the new curriculum at a cost of fifteen hundred dollars an hour it's the hayward unified school district and in june it became the first in the state to officially adopt that new curriculum promising in a press release so we're not guessing about this they put it in writing it will be informed by and include critical race theory democrats and many teachers deny crt is actually being taught in our schools 40 million dollars to put it in hayward senator um in march of 2020 we gave california two billion dollars for its elementary and secondary schools that's 2 000 uh uh million dollars to deal with corona virus proper ventilations keep from laying off teachers offer summer school for kids we didn't send that money to california to teach critical race theory we didn't send that money to california to teach its kids that all white children are born bad and all bad all african-american children are born without hope we didn't send that money to california to teach its kids that america was wicked when it was founded and it's even more wicked today that it's racist to the core because we're not uh should should we teach in our schools about uh slavery yes should we teach about the tulsa race right yes should we teach about uh about the civil war yes should we teach our kids that america is fundamentally racist to the core no and no one beli in his right mind believes that

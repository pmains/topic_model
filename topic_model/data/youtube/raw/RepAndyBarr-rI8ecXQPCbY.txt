thank you madam chair and i appreciate this hearing especially these witnesses who i think bring a great deal of expertise to the topic let me start with mr botson um uh on on gamestop specifically uh as you noted in your testimony the temporary restrictions on trading by robin hood and others were due to the additional collateral required by the dtcc um but those were extraordinary circumstances in an exceptionally volatile market for the sake of retail investors of course we don't want to see uh generally speaking halts and trading to happen frequently or ever again i do appreciate your testimony that moving to an accelerated settlement could reduce margin requirements and and specifically bar charges by up to 40 if we go to t plus one but can you describe how dtcc communicates with brokers regarding their collateral requirements and specifically are there ways to improve that communication or otherwise increase transparency to mitigate the risk of repeating uh this kind of surprise margin call and what happened in january thank you congressman uh our our process for computing uh the margin and communicating such i was laid out in our rules uh which include the the market formula itself there are margin guides we have uh a portal that they can use to estimate their their margin you know the calculation takes it works overnight it's every day it's uh it's run at the end of the trading day it takes into consideration market volatility it looks at specific security volatility uh concentration of activity in certain securities so what you saw in gamestop was almost a perfect storm going through these retail platforms where a lot of buy activity massive buy activity 130 times normal volume we saw weeks before in stocks that were moving around anywhere from 100 to 300 a day and you know just uh highly volatile over this period of time so the margin calculation reflects the risk that the firm is presenting to us that calculation is done overnight um and it is communicated the next day automatically by email generations in the case of robinhood there was an additional charge a capital premium which was as a result of the fact that their margin requirement was in excess of their net capital indicating that they were taking out more financial risk than we felt would be proven that charge was later waived but the core uh margin charge with billion four again it's articulated in our rules we give the client a tool transparency is always a is a good that we'll always try to get better at but we believe that we do provide those tools thank you very much uh moving to uh chairman gensler congratulations on your confirmation look forward to working with you sir and um uh let me just revisit a question that uh mr luchtmeyer and also mr lucas uh asked and kind of uh bring them together uh the the regulation by enforcement question from uh mr luke meyer and the esg disclosure question from mr lucas we don't want to see regulation by enforcement we want to see notice and comment rulemaking whenever possible on march 4th the sec announced its new enforcement task force focused on climate as was discussed earlier in esg issues but it wasn't until march 15th that it issued a request for public comment and the sec has not completed its recently announced review of the 2010 guidance chairman gensor can you explain the sequence in other words why is the announcement of a new focus on enforcement coming before market participants know the rules and will you commit to adhering to requirements under the administrative procedures act and completing notice and comment rulemaking prior to engagement in any enforcement action so i i am committed to complying with the administrative procedure act on rule making and i said in this hearing and in my confirmation process i think the market investors do want to bring some consistency and comparability to climate disclosure human capital disclosure and moving out and getting that comment but there are rules of the road that are already in place the guidance from 2010 our overall securities laws and we're going to be vigorously enforcing the laws and rules that are in place as they're in place but yes i'm committed to using notice and comment for new rules but we still have to enforce the old guidance and old rules as vigorously as you would want us to well thank you and i i don't have time for this question but i'm going to be talking to you about horse racing uh chairman gents so i represent the horse industry in kentucky and we've got a reg a problem we want to democratize ownership of securities and race horses and uh we look forward to working with you and the commission on that issue i look forward to that a different issue than gamestop that that's right and we just finished the kentucky derby so it's a timely issue right yield back

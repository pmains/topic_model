[Music] i don't think they care and i think they're only trying to get a fig leaf to justify billions of new spending there's a gimmick here they have a limit on the uh obamacare subsidy that program is supposed to go away in three years it's not gonna go away if you play it out over ten years this adds to the deficit so john once this passes the senate then the house needs to vote on it there could be though a major hiccup when that happens on wednesday we're expecting the inflation numbers to come out from july if that number is bad it's possible that some house democrats worried about inflation may decide not to vote for it john interesting times ahead hillary vaughn on capitol hill thank you let's bring in louisiana republican senator bill cassidy great to have you here we're awaiting the white house obviously a lot of these questions will come up in that briefing room but good to have you senator first up republicans they're taking on this president for what they are labeling his weak approach to china pelosi obviously with her visit standing firmly with taiwan how do you view president biden's approach on china yeah so you got to stand up to him i agree with what lindsey graham said you've got to be strong whether or not we can whether or not we're projecting strength right now is arguable you can you can imagine that they see president biden as weak and that's why they are being as aggressive as they are being aggressive i think that's actually a fair statement you could also argue the same thing about russia going into ukraine and it may have been precipitated by us retreating so disastrously from afghanistan so at some point you set up a narrative international rivals are reading that narrative we need to change that narrative the former secretary of state mike pompeo was on fox earlier today and he had this to say about the administration's approach listen this administration just seems on its back foot it seems defensive it seems fearful for the most powerful nation in the world we ought to act like that what do you think about the last part of that we ought to act like we are the most powerful nation in the world well the time to act that way is not when the other is provoking you it is to act that way before they provoke you because they have second thoughts about provoking you uh so i agree with what he's saying now we have to implement what is our new strategy i'm not sure this administration has the capability to lean forward to do anything but to react and always they seem just a half a step behind of where they should be we need to be a half a step ahead i want to i want to transition now to the economy as this is likely will be a big topic of conversation in that white house briefing room a short time from now as well you've got 230 economists from all over all over the country all walks of life different parties they are writing to this white house and warning that this massive spending plan to bring down inflation might not even bring it down could make it worse they're saying quote would it would create immediate inflationary pressures by boosting demand while the supply side tax hikes would constrain supply by discouraging investment and draining the private sector of much needed resources and there's questions over how much it's actually going to bring down inflation we put that to the white house jared bernstein joined us last hour and here was his response the the deficit reduction is clearly uh disinflationary and that's why you have furman and summers making that comment there have been various estimates of the extent to which it lowers inflation to them from our we we have seen estimates that take inflation down uh by uh i think if you look at mark zandy's work uh it takes inflation down by about a third of a point it's a lot of spending to bring down inflation at 9.1 percent by a third of a point yeah i agree with that by the way that's 300 billion which is probably arguable maybe 100 billion over 10 years to put that in perspective i think there's 90 billion a month that the federal reserve is allowing to roll off their balance sheet so it's truly a small small fraction but but just take their argument for what it's worth it's going to be a third of a point yeah my folks back home who can't afford their electricity their gasoline uh who can't afford their groceries is down from 9.7 to 9.4 that's a big help no they don't notice as one of them says president biden should live where real people live interesting that this uh this bill includes tax increases on imported oil uh if that's the case why is the white house not admonishing domestic oil producers to get busy and get out there and pump more oil out of american soil well one thing we can say about that tax on oil is it's going to roll right through to the pump the president way back when staying in the rose garden he's going to do everything possible to lower the price of the pump not true in fact among the things he's doing is increasing the tax on that barrel of oil which you'll pay whenever you fill up this is a lot of misleading statements that are going to hurt the american people in their pocketbooks senator appreciate you joining us on all things china and the economy two big topics that are likely to come up at the white house shortly senator cassidy thank you very much sir

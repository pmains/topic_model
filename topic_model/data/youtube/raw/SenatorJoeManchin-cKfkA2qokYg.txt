Hello. I'm Brian Aluise. Your United States Senator Joe Manchin
III's outreach manager. Senator Manchin appreciates your interest
in serving your country and being a part of something bigger than yourself
by attending a United States Military Service Academy. Standardized testing is a major application factor
that service academies consider closely. While it's important to meet
the leadership and physical requirements, each academy places
most importance on the scholarly component. While there is no set score
that will ensure students receive an appointment, the higher
the score, the better your odds. Here are a few tips
that will help you increase your chances. Number one, in order to be competitive,
we recommend a composite score of 32 for the ACT and 1420 for the SAT. The service academies accept
either forms of standardized testing. ACT and SAT scores matter
because they make up 40% to 45% of the rubric that determines
whether you receive an appointment. Please note that the service academies
weigh math heavier than English
for both the ACT and the SAT. This is likely due to the fact that service academies'
curriculums are STEM oriented. Number two, the sooner you take the SAT or the ACT, the better. That way,
if you need to take the test again, to improve your score,
you'll have ample time to do so. If your score doesn't improve after your third or fourth attempt,
it may be time to focus on other areas of your application, specifically
the leadership and physical components. Number three, there are a variety of ways
to improve your SAT and ACT scores for your service
academy application. We recommend
finding a method that works best for you. This could be self-study with a textbook,
taking an ACT/SAT prep course at school or working with a tutor online
or in person. Again, on behalf of Senator Manchin,
I thank you for your interest in attending a US Military Service Academy.
We wish you the very best of luck.

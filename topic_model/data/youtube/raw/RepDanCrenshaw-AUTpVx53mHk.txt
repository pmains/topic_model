we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody another great episode here if you like these episodes you should give it five stars um because i don't know it makes me feel good so i would appreciate it but uh this episode is great it centers on a topic that obviously if you listen to this podcast i like to talk about a lot which is the environment and how to make it cleaner and the right way to go about it um and as you know i have long advocated for better innovation uh as a way to clean up the environment uh and improve our environment and maintain our environment uh help us with that conversation today we have houston's very own uh yusuf chamu he is the vice president of research at rice university uh yusuf thank you so much for being on thank you so much for the invitation this is a really great honor i like your podcast a lot i'm happy to be here oh great i appreciate that have you given it five stars i'm gonna go back and check i got i guess i better get on that yeah yeah i i honestly i say this all the time i have no idea what it does for me maybe it helps me with ratings maybe it doesn't but um it's not like i can monetize it so it doesn't really matter but i do appreciate people listening to it we try to try to always bring on experts like yourself to actually talk about a given subject and i hope people learn a lot so let me talk about your bio real quick um you got your bachelor's from carnegie mellon uh you have a doctorate in molecular biophysics and biochemistry from yale wow that's um i mean it's no harvard but you know it's pretty good um i'll let you i don't have a whole lot of affinity for harvard i mean i did my master's there but i certainly didn't get a doctorate so you i was gonna say i thought you went to harvard a little bit yeah yeah i did i did and um i watched yale beat us in a football game and you know it was it was that's what happened um i don't i don't have a lot of emotional attachment to it either way um you've served as the vice provost for research at rice university since i said vice president earlier but clearly i misspoke its vice provost for research at rice university since 2014. you oversee strategic planning for university research including engagement with the industry uh through research and technology transfer you're appointed a professor of biosciences in 2012 you first joined rice in 1998 uh you served as rice's director of the institute of biosciences and bioengineering from 2008 to 2014 led the coordination of interdisciplinary research amongst the rice faculty and let's see what up that's that's basically it already read about your phd from meow um uh it's worth noting of course that i did not get into rice university um though i do represent it um hoping maybe one day for an honorary degree or some some some kind of thing that'd be nice but uh i was uh i was not given the honor of attending rights and i'm not resentful in the least so that doesn't even doesn't even cross my mind ever um so we're going to talk about innovation today i mean it's um there's so many interesting uh anecdotes that that we'll talk about um from uh you know what one thing that i worked on actually legislation that we got passed was the leading act uh which designates uh additional grant funding for carbon capture technology uh in the in the natural gas space similar to what we see near houston here at the net power plant which actually takes natural gas and creates electricity recirculates the carbon dioxide through the plant somehow and uses that um uh to repower the plant and then has zero net emissions as a result powers about 5000 homes and so uh just an example of of really having our cake and eating it too which is i think uh what we'd be looking forward to um in the future of clean energy but also not destroying our economy um i mean what's your what's some what's one of the most exciting things you guys are are working on right now i think there's a lot of we've got going on in the research space one of the best parts about my job is learning about you know new research is happening all across campus and different disciplines you know i'm a biochemist by training biophysicists so it's been fun for me to learn about energy and i think we've got a lot of really good ideas that are sort of in the same vein of you know i think we can really use innovation to solve many if not all of the problems associated with you know keeping prosperity going keeping the world developing and doing it in a clean and safe and sustainable way i think we've done it over and over again as a species it's kind of what we do right we keep inventing new technologies and moving forward you know and i'm very optimistic so you know i feel really strongly that you know this is the way to go for us as a country and as a as a world really and so you know i'll give you an example so we have something at rise called the carbon hub and it was started by you know professor here and the idea is you can take natural gas and you can actually make hydrogen from it right so that doesn't produce any co2 but what you get out of that process is you make a lot of carbon materials so you can you have to find a use for the carbon you don't want to just throw it into the ground because that takes away you know a product stream of something you could make into building materials or you could make into aircraft parts or car parts or building materials for construction and so you know there are ways to actually use fossil fuels and do it in a net zero way just like you've described and i think you know when we think about how to solve the climate problem i think that's a big part of the answer so and you know if you'll forgive me i'll sort of walk through a mental like exercise a little thought process here about why technology is really critical to solving climate problems and to do that basically you know we can think about a just a thought experiment i'm a techno to be clear i'm a techno optimist i believe that we can invent the technologies and have the innovations to actually be successful in fighting all these fights so let's imagine that you and i have built a time machine right it's going to be you know dan and yusuf's excellent adventure right we're going to go back in time and we're going to go back to when uh to 1900 and we're going to sort of decide that we're going to stop the use of carbon emissions so we want to stop climate change from you know getting getting going basically so we go back to 1900 and somehow we convince people that this is a bad idea to burn wood to burn coal and things like that and i picked 1900 for a reason because we're also going to have to get on our horses and go to spindletop texas to stop the first you know big oil discovery in in texas and we'll have to take horses because of course we can't use trains now because we've limited the use of trains so what happens what happens in the world if we were successful well nothing happens and what i mean by nothing no electrification no cars no airplanes no internet no computers no actual advanced medicine right we're sort of stuck and you know we don't have agricultural you know we don't have fertilizer for agriculture the world is stuck in a place where you know the population would grow there would be you know essentially more disease food shortages it would be a horrific world we would be living in and so we've you know that the idea of just abandoning a whole technology area just doesn't make any sense when you can you know look at all the good we've done over the last hundred years and it's important to note why um why would have none of that been created uh it might seem obvious to you but i i'm not so sure that everybody is is equipped with the the tools and arguments to make that case and and so it's important to say well why would there be no advanced medicine you know what does advanced medicine have to do with with oil and um you know people need to understand that it's from petrochemicals that come plastics uh it's also you need to power industry that creates things like advanced computing i mean the just the mining necessary to to to get these rare earth minerals and then to to build them in the factory all of these things require power and steel and industry and none of that would none of that occurs without without that initial discovery yeah steel steel remains one of the most energy intensive industries and you know like you said we need to make plastics we need to make materials that actually underlie everything we do every the reason our phones work our batteries work essentially everything even the fabrics we wear are all materials that came out of discovery and innovation so you know i think yeah i agree that you know we don't think about it very much we don't think about all the technology around us but we've been very fortunate to be born in this time when we didn't have to worry so much at least in this country about you know basic you know health care and things like that we have a very advanced society and at large that we could have that because of all the energy we have used in the last century to build those technologies right and on the carbon hub so so what are some interesting things that we would be able to to utilize carbon for i mean we we think of carbon dioxide as this pollutant um i don't think that's the right word for it i mean you know does it does it contribute to global warming i i think we can assume that it does yes i think the evidence suggests that it does we also breathe it out every time we breathe so you know i don't i don't think it's fair to call it a pollutant in any case the idea of a carbon hub is to is to research uses for it and and and look at it more as a commodity so what do you think is that we're on the verge of doing with that so i think you're right it's really a commodity carbon dioxide itself is just a gas it's not good or evil right and so you know if you think about how to use carbon in the form of not co2 but rather just carbon like charcoal right in this carbon basically you can use it for soil remediation you can use it in building materials you know i think we're familiar with parts for cars that are made from carbon fiber materials right so bicycle parts things like that carbon fibers are really powerful because they're they're strong and they're very light so they have a lot of applications and so there's a lot of ways which you can use carbon in productive ways as a commodity rather than a waste product so in fact when you burn you know natural gas you make co2 you're kind of throwing some carbon in the air that you could potentially use for something as opposed to just throwing it into the atmosphere but to be sure it takes commercial development so the carbon hub has uh partners and the idea is you have partners that are involved in the production of fossil fuels like shell for instance and you have companies that are part of it that are going to potentially use this carbon what are we going to use it how are we going to weave it because carbon is different than steel right you don't use it the same way it's more like a fabric almost if you think about it you weave it you make materials from that rather than stamping it out like a like a car part so there's a lot to be done just to commoditize this properly that's important to success it how far away are we from i mean because carbon dioxide you know you're essentially talking about sucking it out of the air and then creating material out of it it's a it's a bit hard to visualize how that happens and at what point do you think that would ever be feasible well this particular process jake's takes the the natural gas and as you actually you actually convert it directly to the hydrogen and to the carbon material so you don't release it as co2 you actually convert it directly to a carbon black type metacarbon material so you don't have to recover it out of the atmosphere which is a big advantage of this particular technology so as we yeah because i think it would be hard to imagine sort of pulling air out of or sort of pulling co2 out of the atmosphere actually trees do that really well that's a good reason to reforestation and you know keep reclaiming land as we get more efficient in agriculture and things like that because you know trees are quite good at this that's interesting um and so i want to talk about the 100 million dollar award for advanced materials from the texas based uh welch foundation uh to found the welch institute for advanced materials and um i think rice also got a big investment from army futures command and diamond materials so what are we doing with these advanced materials again what do you see on the horizon yeah it's a very exciting time uh rice has been a real leader in advanced materials since the discovery of the buckyball and the nobel prize the smallian curl in the 1990s and so the advanced materials represents a lot of the things we've already been talking about so you know when you think about quantum computers people thought this next generation of computers are going to have the ability to do calculations much much faster than the current computers we have today those computers um you know are still very much in the early stages of development but they're going to revolutionize how we do weather prediction uh cyber security things like that and of course at the heart of any computer are materials so silicon valley is called silicon valley because of silicon right because essentially people stamped transistors onto these wafers of silicon that essentially underlie all the chips in our phones and all the computers that you and i are now using to record this podcast and so you know the army's investment with us is in a new type of uh replacing silicon essentially with the diamond uh thin film so it's it turns out diamond which is a carbon material has really cool properties in terms of being able to generate high frequency rf radio frequencies it does it he dissipates heat really well there's a lot of reason it could be essentially the next generation of types of chips that would be made for lots of different applications and so that would produce better networks better phones we've got 5g now who knows my kids will have 10g right i mean there's a lot of things that'll happen that'll make things uh more efficient and more energy efficient as well so we'll get more calculating power and we'll be more energy efficient which is sort of coming back to our theme which is you can keep imaging a world where we just keep getting better at you know doing things with the technology and becoming even more efficient with the energy yeah you don't even have to imagine it i mean you know economists would point out that uh the more developed the nation comes the cleaner it becomes uh that that seems to be true across the world and throughout history um so it stands to reason that this that the the the push for innovation as a solution to both climate challenges and the environment seems seems to be the right one um it's not just theory it's it's true in practice i would think um one other thing you guys focus on is so we talk about reducing emissions um you know i give net power is an interesting example of that uh but but also reversing the impacts of of climate change is do you have an overview of what rice is working on and that's in that space as well well i think you know this that's a long arc problem right because there's a lot of co2 in the atmosphere already and so i think if you think about the 25 so companies like bp have already come out and said they're going to really actively manage their energy transition to be an energy company and i think houston is well positioned to be a leader in the energy transition so i think you know we are the energy capital of of the world and i think that rice and and houston can be a leader in developing those technologies and trying to you know and trying to essentially bring the next generation of sustainable energy as well as the transition right because countries need to develop as you point out right as countries develop they get cleaner they get safer they get essentially more product poor productivity so countries in their developing still as they develop will become cleaner will become essentially more able to contribute to the you know to the world and so you don't want to just sort of cut those countries off or cut them off with the knees while they're trying to develop they need to develop we need them to develop right to solve many of the world's problems like population as countries develop they have you know because your kids actually have a chance of making it to adulthood you know you don't need them to you know maintain your farm anymore you don't need 10 kids anymore so there's ways in which as you develop essentially it's this virtuous cycle everything gets better right not just for that country but for the world and so i think this idea of innovation is an important one and houston can be a center for advanced materials and energy discovery not just um you know and not just in fossil fuels but i think in all types of energy and i think that's what many of our companies are thinking about now how to be you know a player 50 years from now because they're they want to be here they want to be relevant right 25 and 50 years from now so i think that's important yeah it is and you know it it it really goes along this this this line of of reasoning and i think that is that continues to be true okay i'm trying to figure out how to how to answer or how to ask this question um maybe i'll just ask you to define some of these these terms but um there's an interesting story at rice and discovering a new way to eliminate what was thought to be these forever chemicals right so so people get really upset when they think about plastics and chemicals that basically never go away um and you know they never they never decompose and this is chemical of gen x and pfoa and there was an there was uh using a molecule that's actually so ubiquitous that it's commonly found in eye shadow so how did rice students discover this innovation can you can you tell us about that give us some background because i don't think the way i described it makes sense to anybody listening that's all right um yeah this is work that came out of mike wong's lab here at rice he's a professor in chemical and biomolecular engineering so a chemical engineer would have been the classic that's what that department would always be called when i was in college and so yeah there's a lot of chemical compounds that are hard to break down they don't break down naturally plastics are a good example that we're all familiar with and his students you know we're actually working on strategies to try to break down these long-lived products because you know they're in teflon they're in a lot of different parts of our our economy and so the idea was well if we can't you know replace them with new materials and how can we remediate them from water they get into water they get into all sorts of things and they can be seen and they can be carcinogenic and so the idea is how can we reduce or get rid of these these compounds and you know to be honest and they at least they were very forthright in discussing it it was a bit of an accident like so many things in science you know luck favors the prepared mind you know the students were actually thinking this was going to be a what they call a control experiment this was going to be the thing that showed what would happen if nothing happened right so this was like okay we'll set this up and this will be nothing happens then we'll try the thing we want to try and that'll be the thing that does something right that's the that's the experiment right and what they found was when they uh mixed a relatively common chemical called boron nitride and they they shine uv light on it which is the type of ultraviolet light that the sun produces it it produces you know if you have a lot of it can cause a skin cancer but it's also what tans that's why we get darker when we're outside and they found that it that combination of this this uv light and this compound was able to break down these really difficult to process chemicals that you've mentioned you know polyphoral alkyl substances right and so that's an exact version of this idea that you know we can if we know what we're trying to you know fix we can usually find discoveries or innovations that allow us to you know in this case break down something which people have thought have been very hard to break down now does that mean that it's it's always easy no i mean it takes it takes time and it takes a lot of really smart students uh and some really smart people to get together and work on the problem so that was an example that was almost by accident they admitted it so now they're working on how to implement it and so at rice we have the national science foundation has centers for specific types of technologies and so you know rice is fortunate to be the host of one of those sites called newt and it has to do with water purification right so it's about all about purifying and remediating water and newt i'm how i'll tell you what it stands for but it's nano systems engineered research center for nanotechnology enabled water treatment so we'll just go with newt right it's a lot easier right so there are companies that are part of newt so the nsf brought together rice gale utep and arizona state to build this center and there are industry partners in water filtration and water processing that are looking at how to use these technology how do we bring them to the market right because it's one thing to discover it in a lab right it's another thing to get it out in to you know commercial applications where it can do some real good right so i think the idea here is that the government's catalyzed a partnership between universities and in this case industry and i think that's a really good model because you need to get the technologies off the campus and into society yeah and that's a good point it was something i was going to get to a little later which is you know asking you to describe the government's role in all of this i think a lot of people and i definitely have this conversation all the time when it comes to pharmaceuticals a lot of people believe that it's it's the government that create you know it's government funding government research that creates a given technology and that's why we have it and that's why it should all be free and that's why anybody who profits off of it is basically stole it um and i have to explain especially in the case of pharmaceuticals that's just not what happens the basic science is funded and it's usually at a university or an affiliate of some sort but to actually bring that to market and commercialize it uh takes billions of extra dollars and that's not and that's not coming from the government right that comes from private investment and that that partnership is extremely important is that similar to what you guys do at rice yeah that i mean that's exactly right so as you know in biomedicine really if you think of it if it takes a dollar to bring something to the to the patient's bedside really only pennies were spent on the initial discovery typically it's the bringing it to make it safe to produce it in large amounts that requires the pharmaceutical industry to do that development no no university is going to develop 300 million doses of of a vaccine or produce a new antiviral or antibiotic at scale that's not what they do and in fact i don't think you'd ever want them to and nor do i think the government should be doing that because that investment would have to be huge if you look at the the budgets of of those big pharmaceutical companies that like you said it takes a lot of money to bring a product forward and so you know even if the even if the us government said we're gonna take all of our r d money and put it into pharmaceuticals it would be kind of a drop in the bucket compared to the investment worldwide in developing these new drugs and new molecules and so you know the role of the of the government is i sort of see it as seeding ideas out there allowing a lot of flowers to grow right so the idea is the government spends money on basic research and i would say early stage research to get it going and then should not be in the business of picking who's a winner and who's a loser let's put it that way i think if anybody could do that they would be billionaires anyway so if anyone can do that good luck i mean you don't even need to be you know nobody can do that right so the idea is the market can do that though right you're right and what i tell people too because that argument doesn't always work with with people who are a little bit more idealistic um they say well if it's good for the if it's good for society then government should just pick that winner and what i have to tell them is you don't know if it's good for society yet right you're asking a government bureaucrat to make a value-based decision here and they're because they're in government because it is the government they're susceptible to lobbying and you are picking winners and losers without really knowing the outcome and you it's it is not this this it is not this utopian uh reality that you wish it to be they're you know they're the government bureaucrats are not perfect uh people with with omniscient knowledge it just doesn't work that way they're susceptible to to influence um right and left and you can imagine a government bureaucrat being having letters written to them from the various congress people uh in various districts depending on depending on where that winner and loser is located i mean it's there there is no actual uh i think objective uh value being considered in a in a case like that yeah i think that's right i mean i can give you another really good example where i think nobody could have predicted the success and this is this is really true this story repeats itself all the time through history so you know i think all of us are really familiar with the human genome project so you know essentially the for the you know in around the year 2000 we were able to sequence the dna of a human being and that has revolutionized personalized medicine it's revolutionized our understanding of cancer because now we can we can understand the how tumors have have changed over time it that discovery of how to that technology how to sequence the human genome was really really transformative in all of medical and biomedicine and it will continue to be for generations to come that technology that allowed people to sequence the human genome actually has its roots in the early 1980s with people that were studying this you're not going to believe this people studying these bacteria that actually live and grow in yellowstone uh hot springs so you know those of us who've been to yellowstone you sort of see you know the geysers there and these these really ridiculous pools of water that are boiling and they're actually acid too right so you can't imagine anything could live in that water but things do bacteria do and people were like well how the heck can that work right how can a bacteria live in something that should dissolve it yeah they studied these bacteria and from those bacteria they actually isolated the molecules that allowed them to work at those high temperatures and those ridiculous conditions and then that's the fundamental technology what's called dna amplification that is the ability to essentially make more dna from a small sample and that's what allowed the human genome project to work it's also the reason why if you watch one of these crime dramas like you know csi miami or something like that you know they can take a little speck of blood and then they can you know they can get the dna out of that little tiny speck of blood or the spit on the sidewalk and then you know match it to the suspect or something like that nobody would have predicted nobody would have predicted in the early 1980s those studies would have produced the polymerase chain reaction which would have been gotten a nobel prize a few years later and then that would be the technology that would underlie the human genome project i mean who could have predicted that it's impossible that's fascinating people don't i didn't know that that story of how that works um you know and again along the same lines of you know again what what is government's role there's a there's a study that i should mention um that came out of that it was published at the from the oecd and it's a study about federal r d and they found that economic growth was linked not to public r d but private r d um it it's not that public r d can't do good of of course it can but there's almost no actual economic growth associated with it and and there is a crowding out of private a private r d that occurs when the public r d uh takes its place and um and then there's and then there's less economic growth involved in that it's difficult to get people to understand that that trade-off i think and i mean would you agree with the with the results of that study is that sort of what you see and i mean and what's what's the right balance from the public policy perspective yeah i mean i don't know that i agree with it entirely that's for sure i think there's a part of the equation that gets missed there and would the public make as an investment and to say and i'll use my own laboratory as an example i'm an infectious diseases researcher and i have you know support from the national institutes of health and department of defense um to do work on emerging pathogens and so i have you know i do i produce something that makes economic benefit initially well no it's like the previous story we do a lot of discovery work that we think informs how the pharmaceutical industry might think about new drug discovery a new drug development but i also train people right so the people who work in pharmaceutical companies they have to be trained somewhere so my students undergraduate and graduate students come and work in the lab they learn how science works they learn how to do good experiments and then they go off and get jobs presumably you know a lot of them go off to be doctors a lot of them go off to be research scientists and big companies and so you know you have to calculate that too right that's part of what i do is i train people i do research not only do i do research but i train people right and that is an economic good that i'm not sure you know is you know properly evaluated i'd have to read the study carefully of course but i think that we do a lot the public money does a lot of good yeah and i'm not sure exactly at what um step in the process they're talking about r d it it might be referring to r d in the actual commercialization of a new drug i mean who who knows but it's it it would seem to me that maybe we actually agree with it given our own experiences there um but we got to look more specifically at it you mentioned antibiotics a couple times and i know that this is a this is a focus of yours an antibiotic resistance and how bacteria becomes uh less susceptible to antibiotics and so what kind of research are you doing at rice to to solve this problem and how does this affect you know our our current situation with covet 19 yeah i mean it's a you know unfortunately it's a boom business and infectious diseases right now it's a very unfortunate situation but even before covet 19 these sort of multi-drug resistant bacteria which really inhabit hospitals mostly uh have been a problem for you know a long time that it's continued to get worse and you know i think for the public's point of view antibiotics are one of the most important uh discoveries ever made in our history in terms of health probably the most important thing we ever got right as a species is clean water that's that's job one you have to have clean water and after that antibiotics have saved a great many lives probably the single most uh wives so if you think about it in you know like in the civil war more people died to disease and infection than actually died from combat wounds right so if disease has been a bigger bane on our existence than almost anything and antibiotics when when uh fleming discovered penicillin and then there's the golden age of antibiotics that caught all the way through the 60s at one point people were writing articles saying infectious diseases are done we don't have to worry about them anymore but you know what happened was as we used antibiotics the bacteria you you actually you select for organisms that actually can become resistant that is the antibiotics don't work anymore and so when that happens you go to the hospital you get an infection and you know now suddenly the doctor uses the first antibiotic and it doesn't work and then they have to use the second one right and then eventually the bacteria become resistant to that one and they try the third one and so at some point you can get to the point where essentially the infection is not controllable that actually kills a lot of people per year even even young healthy people because these infections can grow really quickly so a lot of what my lab does is try to understand how they're becoming resistant and what tricks are they playing to fool the drug or how do they evading the the therapy the antibiotic so we spent a lot of time studying a particular you know from the texas medical center unfortunately we've got lots of good test subjects in terms of bacteria that we get from the medical center we have a lot of good collaborations over there to to identify how these bacteria become resistant and the funny thing is so most people don't realize where most antibiotics come from you've heard of penicillin maybe penicillin came from a mold right but the most antibiotics actually came from a very humble soil bacterium called streptomyces believe it or not nobody's heard of it it's made like two-thirds of all the antibiotics you and i have ever heard of or discovered in human history so it's a soil bacterium that lives you could go outside right now pick up some dirt and find you know lots of them and they make different antibiotics because they make antibiotics to kill their competition right so they make this molecule and they sort of put it out in the soil around them to kill their competition right and then of course their competition fights back says oh no i'm not i'm going to become resistant to that i'm going to make my own molecule and kill you that's it's all like a big you know uh arms race and so what happens is we come along you know we say oh this is great this is a great molecule tetracycline or vancomycin or something like that and we make it an industrial scale start using it in hospitals and of course the bacteria yeah we've seen this before we know how to deal with this right so they become resistant really rapidly because it's you know they've been fighting the soil battle for like a billion years so they're they're used to seeing these drugs and these molecules and so it's inevitable when you use them that they'll be resistance so the idea is how do you make new molecules new drugs that would actually you know evade the strategies they have already and then get you to the point where you can have sustainable antibiotic development but it's an ongoing battle it's not going to be easily solved you know fascinating okay glad we have people who are smart enough to look to solve it because uh most of that went over my head but it is really fascinating uh i do want to i do want to switch to food production this this one uh piqued my interest quite a bit when we're looking at the research that rice is doing and i want to talk about a little bit of a background here and again it just gets to this broader point that that it's it is i think improper thinking to believe that we should just stop doing uh some of the underlying industries whether it's energy or whether it's food production just because we we observe some kind of environmental impact because um well we can look at the history of this between 1970 and 2010 we tripled our production of corn added 80 million people to our population yet our water usage has remained flat there's other interesting statistics as well in industry so technology is always pursuing efficiency industry is always pursuing efficiency and uh we've seen that the economy was using 40 percent less copper 32 percent less aluminum 15 less steel compared to the peaks in 1990 of course it's not as if we stopped developing and um and so this is this is the same with farming we've we've transitioned to more precision farming methods uh we use less and less land less less water so what is some of the technology uh that has contributed to that and what is what is rice doing um in its research to produce more food using less resources protecting our environment all at the same time yeah i think you know clearly actually agriculture is one of the great success stories you know not just of the america but of the world right i think when i was a kid i used to read all these very dire predictions that you know we would run out of food overpopulation would you know overrun the planet and it would be essentially you know this sort of post-apocalypse kind of scenario and of course with each generation we find better ways to be more efficient in farming and and in agriculture in general like you said water utilization has gotten more efficient precision farming has allowed people to um you know get more from every acre of land than they've ever gotten before um and feed the world i mean that's a that's an important thing to have gotten right you know feeding the world and american farmers contribute dramatically to that right so you know that seems like a win to me um so you know at rice one of the things we're interested in sort of if you think about the future is you know we're very interested in a field called synthetic biology so biology is a field that started you know largely by observation you know darwin went out observing uh turtles and the galapagos islands and things like that but it's moving more towards you know what's called what i would call a harder science like you think about physics or chemistry that is the ability to you know understand how biology works at its real basic principles so you know plants you know oftentimes will work with bacteria to fix nitrogen from the air right that's a very common strategy that plants use and there are ways to make that more efficient for instance because then you would you know you wouldn't have to use as much fertilizer potentially right so if you understand the it's not just the you know the plant but there's a world that it lives in this complex soil ecosystem that it that it's part of and we for you know we i always say we've ignored it it's just we didn't have the tools to actually uh investigate it very clearly just like we haven't you know understood how our own microbiome in our gut has contributed to our health so as we get discover new technologies we can look deeply into how do plants interact with their environment like how do we supplement the soil with biochar for instance which is a again a carbon product right so the idea that when you you know burn like a charcoal you know you make you make ash and you can use things like biochar to sort of supplement soils and if you do that right you can actually do better water retention you can do all sorts of things just in that exact idea of making efficiency better every generation and there's you know there's reason to think that i mean i don't see any reason to be pessimistic about it we keep coming up with better crops better essentially management strategies and i think that you know i think it's a very promising area i don't think that there's any reason to be worried that you know our farmers won't continue to be better and better with each generation yeah do you think there's a bit of a misguided animosity towards um gmos uh pesticides things like that are you know is the balance out of whack i mean what's what's the truth behind some of these debates yeah i mean gmos have always sort of puzzled me because you know we we have been breeding plants and animals forever basically and so you know when a farmer finds a new variety of a tomato and he's crossed this plant with that plant that's a type of genetic engineering when you think about it and so there's ways in which we you know we if you think of wheat now it doesn't look anything like what it looked like in the fertile crescent you know 3000 years ago that plant doesn't in any way like even a strawberry doesn't look anything like a strawberry a wild strawberry that you know people found you know hundreds or thousands of years ago so the idea that you know that we're like genetically modifying plants is not an evil thing we modify think you know we breed things all the time and so to me the idea that gmos are somehow inherently more dangerous doesn't make any sense to me nature experiments all the time right with combinations of of ways of building plants and trees and you know we've we've taken the plants we like and we've made them better we like big strawberries not tiny strawberries you know we like to have good yields of wheat right we like sweet corn we don't like i mean i don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to ever taste uh the kind of you know like what you'd use for animal feed it doesn't really taste all that good you know we want sweet corn right right that isn't how that's not how it came up out of the you know you know 2 000 years ago so i i you know the i don't really understand why gmos are seen as this perplexing and in fact it's the future to be honest with you because we'll be able to use plants to do better job in dry climates we'll be able to produce plants that do better maybe have more nutritional value all sorts of things i would argue too we have a moral imperative to pursue these ends um because it's america that innovates and it's the rest of the world that um benefits from that innovation uh whether it's whether it's cleaner energy you know i say cleaner but also reliable which is an important point um when we sort of discuss the trade-offs between you know cleaner fossil fuels uh or cleaning up our fossil fuel use but but the trade-offs between that and say wind and solar because there are trade-offs there's significant trade-offs and um you know we we talk about developing nations and i think we have a moral imperative to allow these developing nations to rise out of poverty uh they can't do so with with unreliable forms of energy that can't power industry that's it they simply can't the physics just don't work and it's not so it's not but it's not just that it's it's farming as well i mean you know again people uh avoiding starvation rising out of poverty requires crops that actually uh work that don't that don't that are that are less susceptible to drought or famine or or or insects or whatever it is i mean this is sort of the point of genetically modified plants yeah it is strange that it's gotten such a bad name and it it almost i don't know where those arguments come from necessarily they they feel a little bit dogmatic um sometimes uh but yeah i agree it's it's it's hard i mean for me and of course i represent my own views i'm not representing the university's views here you know gmos have have done you know can do a lot of good and especially as the climate change you want heat resistant and you want you know insect resistant crops uh but your point about you know you know west texas has got a great deal of wind energy which is great for the texas economy you know solar is a very good energy source but you know there's going to be a lot of ways to approach this energy problem and you know we need to have better transmission lines we need to have better uh storage of energy because you know when the wind doesn't blow you you've got a problem because you need to you need to still have energy because like you said you need to turn the switch on and it works and you know there's other technologies which you know i grew up in connecticut actually and connecticut had 50 percent of its power and still to this day has 50 of its power from nuclear for instance um and so there's lots of technologies yeah i mean we talk about nuclear a lot on this podcast it would seem to me that nuclear makes a lot more sense um for a variety of reasons if we're going to be investing in something um you know modularized nuclear uh seems to me to be the better investment again when you're talking about trade-offs you're talking about costs and benefits and reliability of of of energy i happen to be a big fan of nuclear um uh just it seems to work better um but along these same lines we've we've talked about again improving our energy resources but also storing carbon and um i kind of i should have brought this up when we were talking about carbon utilization and and what to do with it or how to store it but you guys are also researching something really interesting which i won't really try to explain because i'll just sound dumb trying to do it but basically a um a bacteria in the ocean that stores carbon in kind of a fascinating way do you uh do you want to explain that there's a there's a discovery at rice that basically says it can be zombified by bacteriophages or viruses that infect bacteria okay so i have no idea what any of that means maybe you could explain it but it's rather interesting yeah i think it's you know most people don't realize like half of the oxygen produced on this planet is actually produced by you know not by trees actually by bacteria or microbes algae things that live in the ocean in the soils and so it's actually they're a pretty big contributor to our our uh you know co2 oxygen cycle and so you know you know you can't ignore them and if the question might be are there ways to actually um sort of use that resource that sink the ability to take co2 and and produce oxygen in a productive way and so that's the idea behind this work is to say you know there are these bacteria called cyanobacteria they're very important they were actually one of the the very first things they were actually the first organisms that actually helped produce oxygen on this planet so they've been around a long time and they're still here and so the idea is can you actually use these organisms in a way that you know to produce more oxygen and take up co2 and produce what they do with the co2 of course they make it into a trees do they make it into stuff right you know trees make it into bark and make it into leaves and so that's a very a positive thing it's not floating around in the atmosphere it's not causing global warming so you know all these solutions are going to be whether they're technologies that are in biology or that they're going to be things like wind solar and nuclear or carbon sequestration these are all going to be answers because it's not going to be one thing right there's not going to be one answer that produces you know solves the problems right there's going to be lots of different answers and some of them are going to work better than others and some of them will be you know more scalable than others so you know the idea is to make use of this carbon capturing bacteria to take the co2 out of the air which is the problem we were talking about a little bit earlier that's kind of a hard thing to do right to do that in an energy efficient way how do you pull co2 out of the atmosphere that's already there but these bacteria do it anyway that's what they do right so you can use that yeah and is it easy to reproduce these bacteria i mean where you know what what could we expect is there a breakthrough on the horizon what would we expect in mass scale well i think you know the oceans are full of them right so they're they're they're huge right and so the question might be could you facilitate could you farm them basically could you have conditions where you you know you encourage them to grow or could you have ways in which they would produce more oxygen more efficiently but basically they're already super abundant and so you know it's an idea more than it's i'd say a reality at this point but i think it reflects the way in which something that you know right now seems sort of like science fiction 20 years from uh might be producing something which is you know that people are saying oh that was a good idea right and so you know you could imagine you know i think trees are a good example reforestation pasturage are all ways you can actually sequester carbon dioxide right out of the atmosphere so we've got solutions all around us plants are great at it right and you know farming and pasturage of animals and you know you can do that very efficiently to do more carbon capture so again it's part of a bigger solution a big basket of solutions so um we haven't even though this is uh part of your uh background and expertise we haven't actually talked about uh covet 19 very much throughout this podcast how um how optimistic are you on the vaccine production and uh or are there any other general thoughts about how americans should be thinking about the disease well i'm very optimistic about again about the vaccines i think the world has quite a large number of vaccines under development at this point not just in the united states we tend to hear the ones about that happening here in the united states but they're you know there's vaccines being developed in europe at oxford for instance and all over the world and that's another case of technology and innovation right in the past it's you know taken five to ten even more years to develop a vaccine but with the case of kova 19 you know basically what was said to the scientific community in the pharmaceutical industry is we need a vaccine we need it as soon as you can make it right and within a year honestly right we're not even at the one year point yet really in the united states we didn't really experience the outbreak until the beginning of the year um we'll have a vaccine now we'll won't be developed in enough doses yet for everybody that's going to happen over time but i think it's a pretty amazing accomplishment to say basically we want something a vaccine against this virus and we need it immediately and you know in that sense that's a pretty remarkable discovery so again i think when given the chance the you know the scientific and in this case the pharmaceutical industry has come through i think will come through for us i think that covet 19 is here for a while uh i think we i think we were caught flat-footed by it i think you know for me as a person in infectious diseases i don't kind of understand why because you know those people in my field have been saying for a long time pandemics are a problem and they're going to be a problem because as we as human beings expanded into the world and into the into places where animals live there's more interaction between people and animals and that's how diseases start you know it jumps from an animal to another animal to a bat to a human and so um i think though we're we're rapidly recovering you know at rice we've been we have about half of our students here on campus we've got a pretty aggressive testing program and i think we've been really good about educating our students about good behavior and um maybe to some people's surprise our students seem to be really good at uh at sort of understanding what we're trying to get accomplished so you know but maybe that won't surprise you because i think if you've been in the military you realize you can train young people to understand operational discipline and do uh be intelligent and hard working and and not do dumb things you know there is a way forward through all this and we're going to have to do it over the next several months there's no way to avoid uh that that need to to sort of get on with that we need to we need to sustain some development in our country we can't all just sit home you know for the next year so there's smart ways to do it and i think you know rice has managed to navigate those waters pretty well but it doesn't mean we won't have an outbreak no no of course of course not but if you listen to my podcast you certainly know where i stand on this i mean i believe very much and and simply informing the american people and and people will engage in risk and probabilities of risk um uh accordingly and i i i think we've i think we've made enormous i think we've implemented enormous costs on society um uh with with limited benefits and and at heart we really do have to trust the people that we um that we seek to govern and uh it sounds like that's the the approach at rise it's it's an education um you have to educate people on the risks and and provide guidelines and um and let that play out what um but you mentioned caught flat-footed and this is an interesting discussion for policymakers because it seems like it's easy to well maybe not even easy but it's at least you can wrap your head around the notion of being prepared for the last crisis that we faced you know the last pandemic but then there's always the future pandemics and and what is it that we we should do better to prepare for those given that we don't know exactly how the next one would look yeah i think it's really it's always a difficult problem in terms of policy making right because he said we're always ready to fight the last war right so you know and when rice was developing its strategy over the summer you know we looked really hard at countries that had seen sars originally a few years ago the original sars like south korea for instance and you know we implemented a lot of their um strategies on our campus and that is all very familiar to us now things like social distancing wearing masks testing you know contact tracing all those things because those countries had in taiwan had for instance had seen them before and so they they knew how to respond right so we just sort of took a page from their playbook right when we stood rice back up and so i think that again you know this is an area that is near and dear to my heart um what i would advocate for is essentially to have you know we can scan the horizon right a lot of it is about you know preemption and understanding what could come next and so that's a lot of what you know people in infectious diseases and epidemiology do they try to understand where the threats are coming from whether it's ebola coming from africa or whether it's flu which comes every year from asia you know there are there are some very bright people that can help us be ready for the next you can't be sure right because it could be a sars-like virus it could be something like ebola or encephalitis which of course came up into texas over the last few decades and so you just have to keep scanning the horizon right you have to be vigilant right so you've got to have monitoring stations around the world you've got to be really engaged because otherwise you get you just these things come fast as we've seen yeah but i mean i thought we did you know and it's uh in a place like china they're they're they're not exactly transparent with what's going on so we could have all the monitoring in the world and it wouldn't it wouldn't matter um you know in this case yeah it's hard because if if you don't have um transparency right and and to be clear nobody wants to be the the host of a plague right i mean you know it's you know no government and you can't even imagine the city government doesn't want to be known as the place where this thing started and so there's a sort of natural human desire to sort of you know not be transparent about it or even see it when people get sick here in the united states say you know people if they get covered 19 they sort of don't want to say i i had covered 19. you know it's like you don't want to be the you know scare people or be the bigger bringer of bad news but that's something that china is going to have to get over to be honest with you right i mean that's just something that's just not acceptable for a modern nation right this idea i mean i might expect it of north korea right but it's really not appropriate for a country of its scale to sort of engage in in that sort of um you know misdirection i would say or sort of not being completely open i think they were embarrassed to be honest my impression is this is more in your space than mine is that they just didn't want to to sort of make it clear how how vast this plague was and we'll still still don't know really how big it was in china um and that it had spread from from china to europe and to the united states so i think there was a bit of uh i think pride gets wrapped up into these things sometimes and that's unfortunate yeah yeah i know i think it's about accurate we um we try to analyze the intentions and motivations of the chinese communist party all the time and in this particular case the most rational explanation does seem to be an element of pride do you have any opinions on on the origin of the virus itself um whether it came from a lab accidentally released or whether it was uh uh you know transferred from bats to humans um is it naturally or is do do we do we have any indications of that yet i think there was some pretty good studies both out of um actually out of federal laboratories as well as uh universities that looked at the the uh the sequence the the genetic sequence of the covet 19 it's pretty clearly it's easy to see that it probably came out of a natural environment now you know whether that natural environment you know whether it had been spread in that market like the you know was originally thought or whether it came from a different source it it almost doesn't matter it seems to me that it was probably there's no indications that it was there's no indications that it was genetically modified by people it's clearly a natural strain and so the fact that it's a natural strain means you know and people still argue about did it come from bats or did it go through bats through pangolins and you know all that sort of thing and i think we'll probably know more about that and you know after the science gets done but it looks like it's just a natural virus that spread into the pop and we see how contagious it is right i mean it's easy to imagine once it gets into a person right it makes that jump from animal to human it just spreads like wildfire and at that point there was you know if you look at the measures that china used to sort of suppress the spread of the virus they are really much stronger than any country any western country would ever think about implementing essentially oh yeah i mean there's videos and testimonies of people being welded shut into their apartments which is uh yeah i don't think that would go over well in houston no no i mean we argue about lockdowns uh at all and right rightfully so again i know you know where i stand on this um you know i think there's a sense of humility we have to have about what we can accomplish at a large scale right i think it's um you know when i like i've looked at how some of these asian countries have dealt with it in taiwan and south korea and i and i i think we wrongly believe that they that they controlled the population to a much greater extent than they actually did uh you know as it turns out there's there's their long time historical exposure to a lot of these diseases appears to have prevented a spread in and of itself there's i think various studies have shown that and so i just think there's a lot we just don't know um about how it spreads and about what we can actually do and weigh the proper costs and benefits of how to how to deal with a pandemic which is kind of why i asked the original question it's like what it is it is not actually clear to me what lessons um we we should be deriving um and we should continue to have that conversation the oh you know one thing i did want to ask you is there's a lot of people who are very skeptical of a vaccine um the support for a vaccine people saying they would actually take it has dropped significantly it's become deeply politicized uh and you know i don't need to get into it everybody knows what i'm talking about and i i find that to be problematic so what would you say to people who are concerned about the vaccine and concerned about the the process the fda and how it's been accelerated yeah i think people should become this is again the fact that these things get put aside is really frustrating to me as a scientist and it sounds like it's frustrating to you as well as as a as a legislator um there's the fda you know the the companies that are making these these vaccines um are pretty amazing companies they're run by very responsible scientists and business folks and i think you know they've produced lots of biopharmaceuticals over the decades that have been you know instrumental in curing cancers and and and making vaccines and the idea that somehow whether you believe it gets politicized or not that they're going to change their business model right to somehow meet a timeline is it's just it doesn't make sense to me i know a lot of people who work in the there a lot of my friends are in the pharmaceutical industry who i went to college with and things like that and that's just not how it works i mean they're quality control and testing it's very rigorous that the sort of phase one phase two phase three trials that they go through they have to go through to show that the vaccine works and that it's safe um you know that hasn't changed that doesn't change whether you have a republican or a democrat or whoever it in terms of the the executive branch so i think people should have confidence in the vaccine confidence in the fda to to work with our industry to deliver a vaccine which i think will be effective but if people don't use the vaccine then they'll then we'll be stuck in this world where we're wearing masks all the time i think if we get a good vaccine you know i think by the fall of next year you know we will be in a situation where life will be back to some basically normal as far as i can tell you know we'll have um we'll have antibodies we'll have made ourselves you know able to hold off the virus so i think that it's really important that we send a consistent message to folks saying that you know that that science is good here the the regulatory processes are very tight and they don't change with the government they don't change because you know you might want it as a congressman or somebody it doesn't work that way and so i think people should be confident that these vaccines are going to be these are going to be good vaccines now if you know they'll get better with time you know like i said all over the world there's over 30 vaccines in development right now and five years from now we'll know the one we think is the best but this year i think you know the us has several that are really promising look great so far so far and i think tony fought he's very clear that you know until you finish the finish until you get across the finish line you don't know but i i think the people you know the public should be really confident that those folks are doing a really good job and trying really hard to produce something that can they'll be effective against covet 19. and i think if you don't think that's a good idea i mean i don't you have to get used to wearing masks all the time and being six feet apart from people that doesn't seem like what i would be living in all the time no well it you know this gets another conversation i mean around houston the reality is um people aren't living like that uh depending on where you're at and where you're hanging out but uh for the most part you know it's it's it's mixed right and um you know people are congregating again they have been for a while you know weeks if if not months after our initial spike so i you know and i i i think i i think it just remains to be seen i just again i just think there's a lot we don't know and i'll be interested to see um are we gonna spike again are are we not i mean if we were gonna spike again you would think it would have happened by now because i've but i've seen people uh behaving in this manner for for weeks uh now perhaps even months and so you know this this virus continues to surprise us i i think i don't know if you have opinions on that absolutely i absolutely there's a lot we've learned a lot already to be clear we've learned a great deal about this virus at record time basically i mean the world's whole scientific community's been focused on this virus almost to the exclusion of everything else for for months now but there's still some mysteries here and there's things we don't understand about it so flu spreads in a very so you know when the when the covet 19 first started rolling out from asia into europe and you know we started using models that were basically based around the flu which makes sense because that's our usual ex that's our usual um model that we have the most data on and you know but covet 19 had some tricks up its sleeve right it had it spread differently had these super spreader events right that's not something that happens much with flu flu is kind of a democratic it spreads and contaminates people kind of equally so if you and i are standing in a room with a person who's got flu you know probably might give it to two of us you know one person gives it to two then two people give it to four then four people give it to eight it's kind of it goes up in the kind of a predictable way whereas covet 19 had this really weird dynamic of having these super spreader events where essentially one person contaminates 20 people there's these famous cases now where you know you can sort of see in south korea where one guy goes club hopping during the night and essentially contaminates every single person at those clubs basically right so it's you know it spreads differently and we understand that super spreaders are a much bigger concern so you don't want to have big congregations of people right that's why i think you know standing around a barbecue and is not as dangerous you know outdoors as being cooped up in a room with you know 20 people right right right so we know that now um and there's things about the way if you look at these waves that we're experiencing they sort of travel around the country they ripple around the country now they're rippling in back to the midwest and europe is seeing it rising yeah yeah and it's really weird the way that's happening i think there's things we don't kind of know about how this this thing is spreading and how our immune systems are responding to it yeah it it's it's it's fascinating and it's i think that some of the evidence and studies are pretty compelling that that show that at about 20 infection rate it's not necessarily herd immunity that would be perhaps the wrong word to use but a burnout and this burnout meaning that just mathematically it's difficult to see additional spikes in a given region at about that 20 infection rate and then the question becomes well have we reached that in houston and again i asked the question because i see i see very normal lives being lived in our city and um but i don't see this this uptick in cases again where is that that's exactly what you would think would would keep happening um if people let their guard down and so in new york city being the the exact same thing it almost it almost seems like the the curve and the trends tend to look very similar uh no matter what our no matter what our actions are um and uh you know i don't know it just seems like we're still learning well i think it's a combination of things right so i think part of it is you know when the the virus sweeps through an area of course some people become immune to it and that's you know moving towards but classic hurt i mean he's not reaches you know until you get over 60 percent of people had had it we don't have that indication right now but we still have people doing things like being a little bit more cautious right they're not they're not you know i guess we're not having big um events right now people are still and although not everybody is wearing masks at least here in houston a lot of people are wearing masks and they sort of still be social so i think it's a combination like all those things matter right it's not one all those things actually matter and make it harder for the virus to spread so you know i think if we might be seeing kind of a combination of things that we're doing that are being relatively effective and so yeah i hope we don't have another wave in houston um i think i don't know i you know i don't think anybody could tell you at least i wouldn't believe anybody told you they knew exactly what was going to happen over the next three three three to six months but yeah it does seem to follow this pattern it waves then it sort of burns out for a while and the question is we'll see in europe i think is going to be the real indicator whether they have a significantly large uh sort of second wave right you know i hope not but i mean we'll see yeah and i wonder what would cause that i wonder again it seems like we still haven't answered the basic question of if you've had it uh you're immune to it from now on because i mean there's been a few there's been some known cases where somebody's gotten it twice but it seems to be pretty rare oh what are your thoughts on that yeah i think i think the the science is still clearly you know out on terms of how long the immunity lasts for so i hope that you know it lasts for a long time so you know when we get this vaccine that we're you know that hopefully be coming to spring you know for in terms of mass deployment you know i hope that it's a once a year kind of dose but you could imagine that you might only give you immunity for three months or six months but what i would argue is if if we can deliver a vaccine to most of the world we'll say at least to you know um in doses larger say get half the population and they all get safe even if they only got six months of immunity well that virus is essentially extinguished right it can't it won't have spread there's no animal reservoir in the united states or in europe presumably for this virus so hopefully you know you sort of extinguish it now can it rise again out of out of it china it could but i suspect the chinese will be vaccinating like heck and also being very vigilant for it because they don't want to have this again so they'll be motivated to to keep it under control so my feeling is we're in it we're going to be in a good position a year from now um but we just have to you know we're just sort of playing for time until the vaccines get here that's really what our strategy is we're just trying to get through this until we get a vaccine and then i think we can have life as normal again i like that optimistic tone uh to end with perhaps and uh no and i think it is important to give people the the expert truth on on the vaccines and the safety of those vaccines because there's a lot of uh doubt being sewn out there so you said we really really appreciate that and appreciate all the other really cool stuff you guys are working on at rice um it really is fascinating if only they'd let me in right as a student you know i talk more about it were you on the admissions board back then no i'm not that old come on man but i can tell you i often tell my students i'm not sure i could have gotten into the into rice university i went to carnegie mellon right so it's a good school i'm not sure i could have gotten into rice yeah no it's it's tough um i'm not i'm not bitter about it i just joke about it sometimes on the podcast especially when i have uh guests from rice so um always appreciate it hometown university one of the best in the country and working on some really interesting research uh thanks to guys like you youssef shamu i really appreciate you being on the show thank you for having me all right it's a lot of fun

that's mr. speaker my amendment would prohibit funds in this bill from being used by the Defense Department to train the Afghan special mission wing to operate or maintain russian-made mi-17 helicopters over 93,000 people have died in a tragic war in Syria that is being fueled by Russian arms being supplied to the Assad regime over 1.6 million Syrian refugees are now hosted across five countries by the end of the year half the population of syria will be in need of aid we know for a fact that the Russian arms manufacturer Rosa Boren export is arming Syria the Syrian arman army requested 20,000 kalisch knock off assault rifles 20 million rounds of ammunition machine guns grenade launchers grenades and sniper rifles with night-vision sites and Russia also recently announced it would provide Assad with advanced s-300 missile defense batteries yet our Defense Department continues to channel business to this Russian arms manufacturer DoD recently skirted around a prohibition on purchasing mi-17 helicopters from Russia's state arms dealer in last year's defense appropriation bill signing a contract with Rosa Boren export to procure 30 mi-17s for the Afghan specialty mission wing using 2012 Afghanistan security forces fund monies this contract signing flying in the face of congressional intent incredibly came just days after this house voted 423 20 to strengthen the prohibition on Pentagon business with the Russian arms dealer a prohibition also included in this defense appropriations bill even more egregious it also came on the heels of a report by the suspect the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction that recommended suspension of the plans to purchase these helicopters for the afghan special mission wing as the afghans do not even have the capacity do you them the Defense Department touts the 30 years of experience the Afghans have with the mi-17 helicopters as a key reason to purchase them yet we are still trying to train them to fly these helicopters instead of american-made helicopters training that the Inspector General report says has been slow and uneven the report also argues that moving forward with the acquisition of these mi-17 helicopters is highly imprudent until among other things an agreement is reached on NATO's Afghanistan training mission training mission concept for reorganization within the Afghan government to support this special mission wing mr. speaker US taxpayers should not be subsidizing the Russian state arms dealer that is fueling the war in Syria the language already included in this bill states this we should also not be spending money to train an Afghan unit to fly these Russian helicopters particularly when the Inspector General has raised serious questions about the content of that unit capabilities I urged for support for my amendment and I reserve the balance of my time

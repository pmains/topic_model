for more than 200 years our democracy has been distinguished by the peaceful transfer of power when an american raises their right hand and takes the presidential oath of office they are transformed from an ordinary citizen into the most powerful person in the world the president this is an awesome pirate power to acquire it is even more awesome when is handed on peacefully when george washington relinquished the office of the presidency it set a precedent that served as a beacon for other nations struggling against tyranny when ronald reagan described it as a kind of miracle in the eyes of the world he was exactly right other countries use violence to seize and hold power but not in the united states not in america when donald trump used the power of the presidency to try to stay in office after losing the election to joe biden he broke that sacred and centuries covenant whether his actions were criminal will ultimately be for others to decide but what he did was without a doubt unconstitutional it was unpatriotic and it was fundamentally un-american and when he used the power of his presidency to put the enormous pressure on state local and local elections officials and his own vice president it became downright dangerous on january 6th that pressure became deadly ruby freeman said the president is supposed to protect every american not target them and she is right if the most powerful person in the world can bring the full weight of the presidency down on an ordinary citizen who is merely doing her job with a lie as big and heavy as a mountain who among us is safe none of us is none of us in city councils and town councils on school boards and election boards from the congress to the courts dedicated public servants are leaving their posts because of death threats to them and to their families this is not who we are it must not become who we are our democracy held because courageous people like those you heard from today put their oath to the constitution above their loyalty to one man or to one party the system held but barely and the question remains will it hold again if we are able to communicate anything during these hearings i hope it is this we have been blessed beyond measured to live in the world's greatest democracy that is a legacy to be proud of and to cherish but it is not one to be taken for granted that we have lived in a democracy for more than 200 years does not mean we shall do so tomorrow we must reject violence we must embrace our constitution with the reverence it deserves take our oath of office and duties as citizens seriously informed by the knowledge of right and wrong and armed with no more than the power of our ideas and the truth carry on this venerable experiment in self-governance thank you mr chairman

this time recognized gentleman from Missouri mr. long for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman and thank you all for being here today I when we started this hearing I didn't have this document in my hand and I represent the seventh District in Missouri with your Springfield Joplin Branson Missouri and we've got a lot of successful businesses that germinated their bass pro shop started from nothing and has become what it is today O'Reilly Automotive which is across the United States very successful company we have a great medical community there a lot of successful businesses and a lot of people that just want to raise their kids in a good part of the country have a good job raise their kids have a nice place to raise their family and I saw in my notes today my little handy dandy pocket card here that city of Springfield was coming to see me today and I thought that's great they think enough of me to come and talk to me about some issues that they have pressing I'm glad they came to Washington to see me but they didn't come to Washington to see me they came for a conference and the reason they came to this conference there were two cities in the United States they were invited to the conference to speak on this one was Richmond Virginia the other was Springfield Missouri and the reason is they have done such a good job such a forward-thinking job with these different issues that were discussing here today I want to read you just a little snippet of what we have then kind of ask your all suggestion on something but this is from mayor Bob Stevens mayor Springfield Missouri affordability and unfunded environmental mandates like I say the you can think what you want about things but I stepped off in the side room here and got this at our meeting I couldn't run back to my office and meet him over there so I was required to meet him here due to time constraints affordability unfunded environmental mandates as you know the city of Springfield Greene County and Springfield City utilities have been working cooperatively to develop a proposed integrated plan framework that would foster a more holistic approach to the various unfunded EPA Environmental mandates that all communities are facing wastewater stormwater drinking water air quality and solid waste our integrated plan framework attempts to consider all of these issues together instead of each one separately into focus resources where the community can achieve the biggest bang for the buck we appreciate your efforts to ensure that future unfunded environmental mandates must be affordable for the community and the citizens now one of the things that they did in this report that they're in here in Washington and we're honored enough to be thought of highly enough of the conference to be one of two cities is they did the math I know you all are constitutional scholars and such but I don't know how your math is but the math that they did was over the next 15 to 20 years these unfunded mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency are only going to cost each individual in my district little over forty six thousand dollars per person over the next 15 to 20 years so I guess I'll start here with Professor is it revesz give any suggestions what I tell the folks back home about these well it's a little hard for me to comment on a document that I that I haven't seen but I can tell you from my experience one of my areas of expertise is a cost-benefit analysis of environmental regulation and I actually care a lot about the having the benefits of environmental regulation exceed the cause and I'm a big proponent of the use of cost-benefit analysis to justify environmental regulation which sets me apart from actually the vast majority of environmental law professors in this country who don't like it as much as I do but I can tell you that often these early cost estimates turn out not to be accurate and are usually low aren't no actually empirical studies show that initial cost estimates tend to be us tend to be higher than the final then the ultimate costs are and there's a good reason for that is additional initial estimates are generally made on the basis of sort of current end of the pipe technology but there is a great ingenuity in American business and businesses figure out where of doing things more effectively and more cheaply and for that reason in the end costs end up being lower than our predicted there's a lot of debate on cost estimates there are huge there's huge variance and in and eat each of those estimates should be submitted to serious peer review by serious experts and and I would take well-conducted cost estimates very seriously but I don't question we and I hate to enter of about out of time but Johnny Morris the owner Bass Pro Shops has a sane we all live downstream we all do live downstream we want to have a clean environment to raise our family and whether it's in the Ozarks or Washington DC or the state of Washington we all want a good clean environment but unless you own bass pro shops are you know Riley automotive or one of these businesses in our medium income is under the forty six thousand dollars a year it's it's pretty tough to explain to the folks back home that you got to put a a cup in the storm water as it passes through Springfield and dip it and make it palatable and some of these ridiculous regulations I think I'm more of my time I was going to yield some time back but I don't have any mr. chairman thank you gentleman yields back this time recognize the gentleman from New York mr. Tonko 45 minutes Thank You mr. chair

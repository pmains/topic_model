- thank you between 2009 and 2016 federal funding for affordable housing in Los Angeles County declined 35% that is certainly one of the reasons why we've seen this huge increase in homelessness but another as mr. Lin points out is just the incredible cost of building a new apartment unit given the very high fees the local government impose on each unit and given the high costs of land and given the fact that you're strictly limited as to how many units you can put on a piece of land mr. Lin what would be the impact of the administration's rent reform and work requirements the so called making affordable housing work act on homelessness in the Los Angeles area with this initiative help the city serve more people or would it exacerbate the problem I think it would clearly exacerbate the problem I think the concern that we have in raising minimum rents for people who are McCory Stokes that that are in Los Angeles is of grave concern very concerning the impact of work requirements on on households particularly families with children families with disabled members I think it would only exacerbate the problems are now although Los Angeles County does have 10 million people and New York has even more although it's divided into several different counties we see one in every four people experiencing homelessness it E or a Los Angeles is that because of the high cost of housing in those areas because it occurs to me that unemployment is neisha a problem nationwide addiction is nationwide psychological and other health problems are nationwide and yet we've got one in four people in those two cities is there is there something else that causes disproportion and homelessness and the two largest metropolitan areas that you can put your finger on other than other very high cost of an apartment so I think I think high cost of living is is the key is the key issue both of those are very unaffordable communities and that and the unemployment rate is actually quite low we're experiencing quite a robust economy in the Los Angeles area the challenge is that most of the most of the jobs and most of the income has actually gone to above median income households so what happens is as the economy picks up people have better paying jobs folks who are making minimum wage and people who are below minimum wage who have fixed incomes they're on benefits programs they're on pensions they feel an extreme squeeze as the rents increase as people can pay more and there's a fixed housing stock it we we in California need to build a hundred eighty thousand units a year or growing state we're building eighty thousand what can the city of Los Angeles do to bring down to it to encourage people to build more apartments condos affordable housing or even housing that somebody would move into thereby vacating another unit that would be affordable how do we how do we get more housing built in Los Angeles so I think that the the city and the county are looking at this one of the issues that that has driven a lot of interest is the the building of accessory dwelling units which are generally as of right in in most areas and I think there's a there's you know the ability to put a second unit on your lot you know often called granny flats or you know as second dwelling unit I think that holds out a lot of promise I think there's been a lot of work to address or you know this concern and think through what are what is the impact of land use policy on constraining supply and to address what fee is charged in Los Angeles per unit to pay for the sure the parks etc that's already there let's say you have the right to build a five-unit Burchell but we use around number 10 unit building what's the city charge you for the right to do that I don't actually know sir I've been given a couple a lot of zones but that one's a little far outside my zone sir okay because I'm told figures of well over a hundred thousand dollars whereas in most of the country the cost of construction land everything per unit would be less than that so I don't know if the figure is that high but advocates for making it easier to build apartments are saying that it totals totals that I will find adding it back to you sir thank you the termini hills back

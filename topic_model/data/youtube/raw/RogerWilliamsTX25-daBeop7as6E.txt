congressman Roger Williams is here with us republican representing district 25 during the congressional recess good see it's good to be here as always tax reform yet something you want to talk about them you've got an initiative that you call jumpstart America it's a great name tell us about what you propose well I'm a business guy and I see the I see that we're leaving in many cases the grass asset America has Americans and small business owners in the dust right now you know the economy is not back wall street is doing fine and that's great but Main Street America is not back we've tried some things last several years zero percent Interest stimulus money and frankly I think socialism and it's not working the last thing to turn our economy around is to empower small business people to begin to take risk and hire people look we've got an economy of 47 million people on food stamps we got an economy of 48 million people between the ages of 18 and 64 which we'd all agree is the heart of our workforce then work one day and twelve months fifteen percent of people in poverty seventy-six percent of people living paycheck to paycheck 18 trillion-dollar debt that's not an economy to get the economy going again we've got to empower small business on America does quickly the following we cut the corporate income tax across the board we cut the personal income tax across the board we cut the cap gains we cut the dividends we cut the payroll tax in half for the employee and the employer we allow the money that's overseas really reap a treat that those profits generated by American companies overseas at five percent that brings jobs back we never had that brings John back we lost and then we have done away with the death tax inheritance tax most unfair tax anywhere in the world that's the first component of what we've done with jumpstart we got out of the house several weeks ago gone on to the Senate and then we're going to allow businesses and families to deduct a hundred percent what they buy in fixed assets would it be a new vehicle a computer a tractor write it off here you do buy it which is a huge deal and then allows you next year and not have to appreciate so you make more money possibly pay more tax I know it's a businessman you a favor less government not more you're in Congress now and with a proposal like this you see how the federal government works would you implement this in phases is this something like you could do it right away and you think it would work what about existing programs and making up the difference when we started in phases we put it through where we're passing through the house in phases but at the same time as a package that it will work look at nobody knows where we are on taxes right now there's so many regulations that banks can't loan small businesses money because the dodd-frank legislation and some other stuff so it needs to start him if we could if we could wave a magic wand it would start as a package to enable people to cash flow this country we're not talking about loopholes here we're not talking about deductions we're talking to cash flow in America because it's evident i can tell you there is no appetite in Washington to cut expenses like moms and dads do and small businesses do so we got a cash flow the country and the only ones that can do it or small business owners take a risk get reward and let's bring up real unemployment down to five percent let's have a four percent growth let's get America back on track

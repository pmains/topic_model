my president last month I came to the floor in fact that come to the floor just about every month to highlight the great work that's being done by the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security and last month I focused on the folks who work at phim it's one of 22 agencies who make up collectively the Department of Homeland Security the newest youngest Department in the federal government just a few days before my speech much the East Coast was inundated may recall by one of the largest snowstorm that we've had in a long time and FEMA at that done that day was working around the clock to prepare for and respond to what could have been a much more devastating storm we were hit hard but we would have been a lot worse off if not for the preparation and the training that FEMA had done in the days not just the days not just a week's nothing just a month but a little of the years ahead leading up to the storm in order to make us better prepared for more than a year now Madam President I've come to the floor and I have focused on a different agency within with the Department of Homeland Security it will take about two years to knock them all out but we're making making some progress there and I've done so to just a highlight the exemplary work the important work done by some of the more than 200,000 people who collectively comprised the Department of Homeland Security they work around the country they work outside of our country they working since they work in Mexico they work in Central America South America they work in Europe they work all over the place in order to make us safer in this country these when and women performing a wide range of vitally important work they do it every day they inspect their fruit and the vegetables that arrived in our ports of entry ports like the port of Wilmington in my state top banana port in the country and that a patrol our borders like the Border Patrol agencies dealing with increased migration from Central America they defend our computer networks in cyberspace responding to a new and growing 21st century threat and they keep our president and our Vice President and their families and former presidents and their families as well as Canada's for for those positions as well as foreign dignitaries as safe from harm they have a lot of work to do other work of these DHS personnel deployed at the frontline is made possible in part because of the dedicated work of the men and women behind the scenes at the Department of Homeland Security's magic Directorate and as my colleagues have often heard me say management really does matter I'll say it again management really does matter and there are a few places where that's more true than at the Department of Homeland Security the management Directorate works to support the missions and employees of all 22 component agencies which together comprise the Department of Homeland Security they rent field offices they buy essential equipment and vehicles and they help to ensure that department employees receive the paychecks and benefits that they've worked for and earned and within the the management director Directorate the office of the chief of human capital officer works to ensure that the department is doing what's best for its employees while providing department managers with the guidance the resources that they need to help DHS take care of their own one member of the management record is a an especially committed fellow who his name is Phil Nowak and he is committed to DHS employees his fellow colleagues is the chief of staff in the office of the chief human capital officer Phil I grew up not in Iowa not in Delaware he grew up in San Francisco enough why are far from where i served in the Navy floor for a while he joined the US Coast Guard right after college after serving the Coast Guard for 20 years he retired as a commander I was once a commander my favorite rank as we both of us serve him and the exchange salutes all the time Madam President but Phil retired as a commander in 2007 and joined the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help coordinate disaster response in 2010 film moved to the office of chief human capital officer and in 2013 he took over as chief of staff as chief of staff he'll supports the work of the chief human capital officer and managing the workforce of the third largest capital cabinet agency in our federal government third and with 22 component agencies and DHS employees station literally around the world Phil and his team of 200 men and women certainly have their work cut out for them supporting Department employees and providing them with the resources they need to excel and grow in their work is critical to maintaining a motivated effective and capable department with some notable exceptions we know that many of the components of this relatively young Department have struggled with employee morale almost from its inception each year the partnership for public service releases its best places to work in the federal government survey and each year the Department of Homeland Security ranks at or near the bottom of all the agencies when it comes to overall employee morale with Congress imposing short-sighted budget cuts across government imposing pay freezes and just last week threatening a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security in the middle of our fight against Isis it's no wonder that sometimes DHS employees feel unappreciated we probably would too despite to use the setbacks leaders like Phil Nowak are working every day every night to right the ship and improve morale at DHS and a bunch of us here in the Senate Democrats and Republicans are trying to be helpful in that in that regard in providing leadership and direction for human capital management for the department Phil the lack make sure that the department's efforts to improve morale translate to each of the 22 different component agencies of the department of homeland security and our felt by each of its 240,000 employees to help do this secretary jeh Johnson has created well he calls a unity of unity of effort initiative to bring the Department of Homeland Security components together and make the department greater than the sum of its parts Phil leads one of the unity of effort initiatives it's called the human capital Leadership Council which brings together Human Resources managers from across the department through this coordination and other unity of effort initiatives Phil's team works hard to better ensure that the department's 240,000 employees feel like part of the larger DHS family in such a large agency with so many people with diverse talents and backgrounds spread around the world it is easy to focus on the broader mission and lose sight of the individuals who helped the department achieve its many mess missions but Phil I'm happy to say hasn't lost lost sight of them filling his team do yeoman's work and they focus on the value that each said every employee adds to the department's mission it's fitting them that fills colleagues describe him as caring deeply for them and for other employees throughout the department his commitment to them is clear it is welcome it is unwavering in his own life fulfill values professional resilience and in a job that sometimes overlooked yet incredibly important I think that's a necessary trade it's also a fitting or quality for a runner and Phil is an avid runner I like to run with this man madam presidents real deal he has completed both the marine corps marathon and the JFK 50 mile ultra marathon twice I'm not fit to carry his running shoes and when he is it running Phil is building or fixing something around the house he's cheering on those San Francisco 49ers and in San Francisco Giants it's not hope it's not when they're playing my Detroit Tigers and spending time with his family his wife of 26 years Christie there are three children Sam Elizabeth and Andrew and we're grateful to them for sharing their husband and their dad Phil nowacki is just one example of the thousands of men and women at the Department of Homeland Security who work behind the scenes every day every day to support their colleagues and make our country safer for all of us filling his team focus on individuals they bring together components through a unity of effort they work tirelessly to improve improve employee morale a management really does matter and without Phil and his colleagues at the management Directorate the department's mission to protect our homeland would suffer so to film the lack and to his team in the office of the chief human capital officer to every other hard-working employee at the department of homeland security and at the directorate for management and i just want to say a couple of a couple of words thank you don't say them again thank you this past week I was doing some traveling Madam President then going through some airports and being going through agregar usually you usually try to use tsa tsa PreCheck which goes a little more smoothly people been pre-screened and one place we were flying out of TSA PreCheck the advertiser was open but it wasn't so we had to be just regular ordinary ordinary people and each of those places the folks at TSA right there at the front line trying to protect us as we fly around the country around the world and these airplanes they were doing their job it is a hard job and i would say probably a thankless job everybody wants to get through they don't to take their shoes off their belts off or to take your toiletry out they want to get through there and get on the plane and go someplace but not get home and you it all safely and that's what i do when i fly my new president I a lot of times I'll say to the folks at TSA I'll tell him who I am committee that that that we serve on and just to let him know that we appreciate the work that they do for all of us for all of us every now and then somebody like including over the weekend 11 TSA officer said to me nobody's ever thanked me before think about that nobody's ever thanked me before and I said well we thank you again and they keep doing your job well and hopefully you get a lot of a lot of things but to all the folks at DHS your take on a hard job and do it well and we thank you for what you do every day to protect our country the land of the free and the home of the brave and may God bless you

I rise to speak about the humanitarian crisis happening right now in our country at the border something that I implore my colleagues to fight to stop the Department of Homeland Security is tearing young children from the arms of their parents they are traumatizing infants and children and Congress needs to urgently act mr. president I know that we have disagreements about immigration policy in this chamber and I know we have disagreements about how we should fix our immigration system which we've desperately needed to fix for decades but surely we must be able to agree that federal agents should not be tearing young children from the arms of their parents we must be able to agree that families with infants should not be forcibly separated where's the outrage where is the urgency I hear my colleagues speak all the time about federal government overreach well if this isn't federal government overreach what is this is the moment that they have gone too far one mother was breastfeeding her infant a federal agency took that baby out of her mother's arms handcuffed her arrested her mr. president where is that baby now how was that baby doing where's the baby's mother from mid-april through the end of last month almost 2000 children were separated from adults at the border nearly 50 times a day on American soil our government has separated a child from their parents creating fear and terror in their lives and just today it was reported that the Department of Homeland Security is now holding eleven thousand seven hundred and eighty five minors eleven thousand seven hundred and eighty five minors this is a disgrace one worker at a detention center for children just resigned as a conscientious objector and he described the children being held there as quote traumatized a traumatized population that has no clue what is going on he said the staff wasn't prepared at all to look after four and five-year-olds that are coming into these detention centers he said the kids are screaming and crying for their moms and dads pediatricians Madam President pediatricians who have met these children are calling it government sanctioned child abuse pediatricians are calling it government sanctioned child abuse one of our colleagues in the house was able to meet with mothers whose children have been taking them have been taken from them at the borders she said that in some cases the mothers were quote literally sitting in the room next door to where their children were being held and could hear their own children screaming mr. president have we not studied Madam President have we not studied our own history because this is the kind of thing that we read about in history books and shake our heads and discussed we asked ourselves how did we let this happen we asked ourselves why didn't Congress stop this why didn't anyone do anything do we not remember what happened during World War two with the Japanese internment camps children were traumatized families were damaged in some cases permanently the memorial to remind us of this is a stone's throw from the US Capitol just for the purpose of reminding us to never do it again we cannot let our country go down this dark road again but if Congress does not stop the out-of-control Department of Homeland Security if Congress does not stop families from being torn apart even though it's happening right in front of our eyes than this Congress Madam President this Congress will go down in history as a weak Congress that did nothing to stop one of the worst horrific chapters of American history this has to be the moment when we do our jobs we stand up speak truth to power do the right thing we don't know how many kids are gonna be traumatized for the rest of their lives because of our actions these young children will never forget that when they first came to America they were separated from their mothers and their fathers Madam President the president of the United States is not telling the truth about this policy to the American people it is not true that this immoral and repulsive practice of separating children from their parents is a mandatory result of existing law it's just not true this is the stated practice and policy of zero tolerance by this administration it is important it is immoral and the administration could stop this all by themselves today if they wanted to but since they won't Congress needs to act if this Congress can't or won't push back against this administration when it's actually harming children when will it act I urge my colleagues to come together right now to stop this stain on our nation we have a bill it was introduced by senator Feinstein we already have 49 co-sponsors we should vote on that bill it would protect the welfare of children it would make sure that children would not be separated from their parents and the only time they would be separated from their parents or the adults they are with if they are being trafficked or abused otherwise families should be allowed to stay together Madam President we should do the right thing this is a moral issue this is a humanitarian an issue this is an issue of right versus wrong as a mother as a legislator I can't imagine the terror that these parents face to not know what is going to happen to their children it is wrong of us to stand by silently it is wrong of us to do to do nothing this is what the darkness looks like we have to stand up against it I yield the floor

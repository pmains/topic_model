hi I'm Eric Wilson this is another Capitol report I represent the great people of Springfield and unlike all other parts of the nation we've experienced job loss and we've seen decline in businesses and that's why it's our top priority in the House of Representatives to create jobs you know we we we don't necessarily believe that we create jobs we believe that manufacturers and businesses create jobs and so it's our role to get out of the way and that's why this week we passed house bill 1675 it's a great bill that will enable the manufacturers to be able to be more competitive on the world level you know for decades the US has been the leader in industry and in production and while our industries are still strong and the United States is still the number one industry in the world we've seen other industries and their industries emerge and become more competitive with the united states and i think that the decline that we're seeing the reason why we're not seeing our industries move and shake like other countries is because we've we've shackled them with so many to so many taxes and so many regulations that they can't be nimble they can't compete with the other country with the other industries in the other countries of the world and that's why I house bill 1675 is so important what it does is it helps manufacturers that are trying to create jobs and so those businesses and those companies in Springfield that are trying to create new jobs will be able to see tax relief for any new jobs that you create the first part of this bill will help job employers manufacturing employers those businesses that employ a lot of people for every new job that they create they'll be able to retain fifty percent of the rivoli knows withholding taxes for a period of ten years and if you're a company that sends your product overseas if you manufacture something and sends it to other countries and sells it then we'll be able to give you a with hope withholding release of one hundred percent for a period of three years for any new jobs you create Springfield is is the jewel of the state of Missouri we have great businesses and we have hard-working individuals and people out there that want jobs and so this is a bill that hopefully will help people be able to find jobs will help employers be able to get back to work and be able to start competing with on the world stage again I'm Eric Burleson I appreciate you watching this video if you have any comments please put post them on my Facebook page you can also reach me at Eric Burleson Eric Burleson @ gmail.com and I look forward to hearing from

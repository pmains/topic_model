all right let's talk more about all this with congressman tom malinowski he's a democrat from new jersey and a member of the house foreign affairs committee good to see you again a congressman your your own family history is tied to fleeing communism during the cold war so how does this refugee crisis resonate with you right now well i you know all of this reminds me of stories that my family told me about hiding from the nazi invaders of poland during the second world war it brings back a lot of those family memories they're not my personal memories of course but look the the good news in this uh huge refugee crisis is that unlike most of the world's refugees these ukrainian families have western europe wealthy countries as their first port of call they're not in a refugee camp with no food and water and even more important they're not looking for permanent resettlement they are looking for temporary safety and then to go home to ukraine to a free and liberated ukraine as quickly as possible and so as we think about all of them on this this easter passover weekend uh let's redouble our efforts to help ukraine win so that these folks can go home as soon as possible so thus far the us has pledged to welcome up to a hundred thousand refugees from ukraine in your view is it happening fast enough uh does it seem like there's real clarity on that open invitation i look i think it's a it's a wonderful gesture that that we have made and uh some of these ukrainian families have family in the united states and those are the ones i think we we will be prioritizing for resettlement in the u.s but again i just want to stress the overwhelming majority of these refugees are not refugees in the classic sense they are not looking to permanently move to europe or to the united states they have male relatives back home in ukraine who are fighting to liberate their country and if you know if we take hundreds of thousands of people of ukrainians to the united states that would be a failure success is helping them go home and so the main thrust of our effort has to be to help help them liberate their country and then to help them rebuild their country that that is success so you see this as an opportunity for you know as a temporary refuge the us was would act as a temporary absolute refuge okay well um let's talk now about russian assets uh german authorities just seized a yacht connected to a russian oligarch and it's believed to be one of the most expensive in the world as we see right there and then you actually co-wrote an op-ed this week about legislation that you have introduced that would give president biden authority to seize russian assets and um and also increase support to ukraine explain how you see this working the you know seizing the assets and how that would then translate or turn into assistance to help rebuild ukraine so look first we have to help them win second we've got to plug the holes in the remaining sanctions there's still too many opportunities for these russian oligarchs and the russian government to make money and to hide it in third countries around the world but third we've got to start thinking about how we rebuild ukraine in partnership with the ukrainian people we have seized uh we have frozen uh over 200 with our allies over 200 billion dollars of russian central bank assets we have seized or frozen uh yachts and villas and private planes and bank accounts belonging to russian oligarchs all over the world and the reality is we're not going to be returning that wealth to putin when uh there's a ceasefire not well ukraine lies in ruins so the question is what do we do with that massive amount of wealth and and i i think we need to find a way to repurpose it for the purpose of rebuilding the country that putin is destroying and this week ukraine's president zielinski asked president biden to name russia as a state sponsor of terror and currently there are four cuba north korea iran and syria that would seem to escalate the level of sanctions against russia even further right i mean is that something the u.s should consider i i don't think it would have any material impact on the sanctions because we we are already massively sanctioning the russian government people who support the russian government it would be a symbolic step uh and and i understand president zolensky wants us to to label russia with every possible uh horrific negative label uh that they that they deserve that's that's good symbolism but uh in terms of the sanctions i don't think there's much more that we uh that we would do with such a label the important thing is enforcing the sanctions that we've already put in place i don't like reading stories about russian oligarchs setting up shop in the united arab emirates for example that's supposed to be an ally of the united states i don't i don't love hearing about india stepping up purchases of of russian oil uh or russian diamonds being laundered through uh the gulf states or israel to reach the united states all of these things have been sanctioned on paper but you know it's hard work to actually enforce them and make sure that all of these third countries around the world are choosing the right side all right congressman tom malinowski thank you so much for being with us today thank you

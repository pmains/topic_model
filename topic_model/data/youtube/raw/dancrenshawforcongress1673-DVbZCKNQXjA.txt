- Thank you. Now I have a long history and a deep history with
my own personal faith. We grew up in Kady, going to St. Peter's United Methodist and I think we need to
as a society we need to look at the difference between freedom of worship
and freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is
what we are fighting for. We are fighting for the role
of religion in our society. We can look at history and we know that secular
societies do not survive. We need that higher moral
authority to drive our society, otherwise morality is just and opinion. And that is no way to run a society. So I deeply believe in
the role of religion in America when we need to defend that. Thank.

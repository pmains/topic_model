thank you mr chairman um dr ayala i have to start with a confession i've never admitted this publicly so bear with me um the harvard school of public health has maintained a list throughout the whole covid pandemic showing the vaccination rate by congressional district and i have taken sole credit for the fact that the sixth district of illinois has consistently been the most vaccinated district um in the state and uh and i really don't deserve that now you're 50 of my constituents so uh so credit where credit is due you deserve credit for that and of course you've led on testing as well and it's and i you know i meant everything i said about how fortunate we are to have you there um i also don't think i'm putting any words in your mouth to say that both of us probably wish those numbers were higher and i i want to start just by asking you to reflect a little bit throughout certainly through the first year of this pandemic there was a the demand for everything exceeded the supply whether that was the demand for ppe or for ventilators and then for testing and then for vaccines and in theory there's an optimal public health way to allocate those scarce resources in practice as you and i know too well some of those decisions were political there were situations where you know we certainly gotten a challenge here as far as intra-state allocations and then once they were at the state level in the county allocations and i i wonder now that we're sort of you know hopefully on the back end of this was all of that tension completely inevitable or do you think there are things that we could have done better at the federal or state level to ensure that that scarce resource allocation was done collaboratively rather than competitively so that's a that's a very provocative question and um i think that to a certain extent when you're allocating limited resources there will inevitably be um contentiousness and um uh and and um unhappiness um however i think the lesson learned and i remember the conversations that you and i had um transparency around those decisions at the time as well as benchmarks or metrics for how the decisions are being made i think those are the tools that could not not eliminate but certainly reduce some of that um unnecessary um angst well here here we could talk for a long time about that i want to shift though if we can to the mental health issue that's come up a couple times um i think we're all keenly aware of of how much we as a people need social engagement and how much we've become a little bit sort of socially crippled for lack of a better word as we've been in our in our bubbles over the last year at the same time there's a part of me as an american that that gets confused and and in some ways angry at the fact that the same country that was willing to completely transform the way we travel our rights to data privacy enter into 20-year wars after 9 11 is not even talking about the fact that we lost two 911s last week um almost a million americans and somehow we've either at best decided that we're just ignored to it and at worst decided that that's an acceptable price to pay so that somebody's kid doesn't have to wear a mask or that somebody can have the freedom not to get vaccinated because that's more important and i don't want to trivialize those mental health issues but you of course oversee a pretty robust mental health division as well out in wheaton and i wonder how you think about the trade-off between the public health issues of saving lives and and the real mental health issues you see how you how you think about that how you communicate how we should think about it sure so when we when we talked about earlier in this hearing when we talked about the impact of covet on children um i think one of the one of the opportunities that we did not take full advantage of from the public health standpoint in in working with families around the need for children to get vaccinated as well as the importance of masking and some of the others is the impact of the loss of uh someone close to them when we look at the reports around children who have been orphaned um and lost that primary caregiver again the most dramatic um losses have occurred in our marginalized underserved populations those children not that any child um needs to to uh you know experience trauma to to build any sort of character going forward but those are kids um who who absolutely need people in their lives who are steady and um supportive for them i i think that i i share your concern that um when we talk about the numbers and in dupage county alone we have um we have nearly 2 000 deaths that have occurred over the last uh two years um in in large part um unnecessarily and tragically too soon and and preventable now that we know that there's um this is a vaccine preventable disease i think that to us in public health and health the the the most tragic outcome is having a death in an otherwise healthy healthy individual and so when we talk about the concerns of economics and concerns about restaurants and bars staying open um i i think that we need to to take a really deep look at what is important from a community standpoint and i know i'm over but one of the issues that we've all talked about is the need for schools to have been open without a doubt however when we had other facets of our society who were unwilling um to to abide by some of the prevention strategies so that we could get back kids back in school i think that's when we that's when um the priorities of a community um are felt more than they're heard thank you um two questions uh first uh one more for dr ayala and i want to get to dr matus before we wrap up here who has been far too lonely on the screen um the uh um when when this pandemic first started we had some experts come in dr emmanuel you may have been one um advising us on how to talk to the public through a crisis and the the message that stuck in my head was for goodness sake don't be the elected official who um who some significant number of people didn't vote for and say i'm the one who's right get the public health officials to stand up next to you and speak to that and certainly availed myself of of your skills in that department more than one stock trial the trouble was then we got home and social media was ablaze with all sorts of completely garbage information that was running contrary to that and we weren't sitting there with the expert on hand and and i'm curious dr ayala you must have felt that as someone who was communicating this in your soul i'm i'm curious what you think we can do better for future pandemics about that role of social media and communication and what advice you'd give to us if we were going in now about how to anticipate that sort of nonsense in the future and inoculate the public against it sure sure so i think that um although although i feel it in my soul i think one of the ways that i've survived the last two years is to completely divorce myself from reading any um social media posts or many social media posts post however i think that as far as communication goes i think that when we stay silent around misinformation and disinformation from from a public health or a health care legitimacy we undermine ourselves and so i think that no we can't possibly address all of the issues that are brought up on social media however some of the points that dr mcbride dr manuel have made um about communicating the nuances around vaccinations around communicating the nuances around um the the need to for layered mitigation that just like there's no one metric there's no one um prevention strategy that is going to be the silver bullet um i i think those would have gone a long way and instead i think we just took um i don't know high road or didn't want to get involved in those kinds of um discussions but i think it really worked against us and that would be definitely a lesson learned going thank you two questions first uh one more for dr ayala and i want to get to dr matus before we wrap up here who has been far too lonely on the screen um the uh um when when this pandemic first started we had some experts come in dr emmanuel you may have been one um advising us on how to talk to the public through a crisis and the the message that stuck in my head was for

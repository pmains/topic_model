the continued Russian hostility certainly makes it necessary for us to analyze everything we can of the critical role the United States has in a stable energy source of energy across the globe but we can only do this with energy policies that allow Americans to flourish that we can produce and not be paralyzed by policies and the agendas that harm that and we witness the dangers firsthand when the Biden Administration enabled Russian energy initiatives before Putin's Invasion and how did the Biden administration's early action to restrict U.S oil and gas production how did that Aid Russia's plan for energy dominance to flourish well I think it it allow Vladimir Putin to feel sure of um that The Invasion that he was planning will actually put a bigger um hardship on on Europe for example so that kind of probably emboldened uh President Putin President Putin in um in getting through with his plans thankfully these plans did not realize but this is because of the way that U.S LNG exports were ramped up when we look at the exports and how they ramped up of towards the peak of capacity um it's been something that's exceptional something that the U.S industry not only the government USC industry helped Europe whether the storm or at least until now and hopefully going forward

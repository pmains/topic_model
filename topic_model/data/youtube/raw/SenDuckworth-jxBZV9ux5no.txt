Thank You chairman Fischer thank you so much for holding today's hearing on freight and multimodal transportation infrastructure I am so excited to be ranking member on the surface transportation and safety subcommittee and I am looking forward to working with you on issues important to our state our both our states and the nation as you know one of the most critical issues facing our nation is the growing need to reinvest in our nation's infrastructure our economic competitiveness depends on the efficient movement of freight whether it is carried on highways railways or waterways every day our Freight system moves fifty five million tons of goods worth 50 billion dollars supporting 44 million jobs most Freight enters our country by ship through ports its then moved to businesses across the nation by a combination of truck and railcar intermodal connections become extremely important to ease to transfer a freight from one mode to another and unfortunately this transition is not always smooth as we all know too well in Chicago in my home state of Illinois we often call North Eastern Illinois the crossroads of America the Chicagoland region is the busiest rail hub in the nation and for decades has been the main transportation hub for goods moving throughout the United States six of seven major freight rail companies traverse the region daily but the region's rail infrastructure built more than a century ago has not kept pace with demand fortunately a diverse group of stakeholders is changing that the create program a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership and a project of national significance will provide the important investments needed to modernize the region's rail infrastructure to improve reliability and safety I'm very proud that create has received significant federal funds including a 132 million dollar infra current in 2018 these improvements will not only help the Chicagoland region but the entire state of Illinois and our nation federal funding for freight and intermodal projects is critical to attract state local and private infrastructure investment this is why I am a big supporter of federal funding for programs like infra and build the federal government must be a strong partner to spearhead Freight projects from which we all benefit highways and bridges also suffer from underinvestment traffic bottlenecks costs of trucking industry more than sixty billion dollars a year in lost productivity and fuel this increases the cost of everything we'd make buy or export to many bridges are in need of repair according to the American Road and transportation Builders Association more than 54,000 bridges across the nation are structurally deficient 54,000 in Illinois 2300 bridges or essentially 8% of all the bridges in my our state are in structurally deficient and Cook County in our instructor structurally deficient state and Cook County has some of the most traveled structurally deficient bridges in the state and in the country I want to thank all of our witnesses for joining us today in particular I want to recognize Joe Sabo who is here today Joe you have been a real leader on transportation issues from your time in the rail industry to village trustee and mayor to the fre administrator to see map executive director few others have the knowledge and experience that you bring to the table on these issues thank you for being here I look for from hearing from the rest of the panel about how we can improve our freight transportation system I thank you each and I yield back

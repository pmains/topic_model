welcome back well what a surprise a new york times columnist confesses that the democrats inflation law was misnamed uh gail collins says quote i'll admit that the inflation reduction act was perhaps not the perfect name for this bill but what a moment for the presidency she writes she goes on to describe the bill as the country's first big step toward combating global warming joining me now is north dakota senator kevin cramer he's a member of the budget banking and armed services committees and we're happy to have him back senator it's good to see you this morning thanks so much for being here thank you maria good to be with you i only in washington can you get away with a massive hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and call it an inflation reduction act when we know all the spending has sent inflation higher over the last year how do they get away with that well well you get away with it because you have a complicit media willing to help you with your marketing and your branding and that's exactly what happened it was interesting even now the mainstream media still refers to it as the inflation reduction act i always call the inflation enhancement act there's nothing about the economic formula that backs this bill up that would reduce inflation and very well could increase inflation so um you just get by that because the media allows it you don't obviously well senator look even former obama economic advisor larry summers has been trashing this president's policies and all of the spending from the democrats larry summers is now warning against student loan forgiveness summers tweeted this quote i hope the administration does not contribute to inflation macro economically by offering unreasonably generous student loan relief or micro economically by encouraging college tuition increases the white house has promised an answer on loan forgiveness by the end of the month senator but all of these policies seems to have stoked inflation what and i don't even know about the fairness of this what about those people who worked incredibly hard took on debt and and and paid it off and went to college now we're forgiving some people's loan forgiveness just because they're lucky to be doing it now no question about it the loan forgiveness suggestion is really in my mind would create so many perverse incentives starting with to larry summers point the increasing of two of tuition costs this is what uh on oversupply of money in a low demand market creates it creates inflation so you so right away if you gave every kid in america a thousand dollars to go toward their next semester of college the price of college goes up a thousand dollars what they ought to do if they want to spend ten thousand dollars per person on for giving student loans they ought to just buy several thousand copies of dick army's memoirs or or pay for a supply-side economics course and the whole country would be much much better off than simply flooding this uh this economy with more money and then creating these perverse incentives because already maria if you look at the statistics of freshmen who don't finish you know college but they take out student debt in order to to experiment with college if you start forgiving that first ten thousand dollars for people that just enhances this this these reckless decisions we ought to have people making more thoughtful decisions and applying good economic principles as well as their personal circumstances and then you have both fairness and you have a much much more economically literate electorate senator look we are now 77 days until the midterm elections you would think some of these issues are affecting people and their votes given the fact that inflation is still at 40-year highs we're teetering on recession foreign policy is a mess what are your thoughts in terms of the senate races and and should the republicans have a bigger gap in terms of winning well we'd always like to have a bigger gap in terms of winning you always want to have both the lead and the momentum but we don't you know politics isn't in a vacuum there are the big issues of the day republicans certainly as a brand and as a party are in better shape in terms of the people's confidence senate races in particular tend to be one candidate at a time they are not in necessarily in a vacuum but they're less subject to national waves but maria i believe that there will be a wave i believe that wave will usher in a major majority in the house and i believe that it's going to carry our senate races as well but people you know as we get past labor day when people really focus on these things if if the economy is not better if inflation isn't better and i can't i don't see how it can be much better um i just i just don't see that um that this is going to be a good year for democrats i'm very confident in in taking control yeah well it's a good point maybe the focus becomes clearer and we get more clarity after labor day we'll certainly uh be talking about that then and have you back senator it's great to see you

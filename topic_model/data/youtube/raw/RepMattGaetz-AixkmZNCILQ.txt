I fully associate myself with the comments from the gentleman from New York condemning anti-semitism full stop entirely appropriate thing to do I just think it's curious how we ended up here but we are having this debate right now because Democrats had an objection to something said by a Democrat and so they launched off on this drafting project and then lo and behold I hear all the remarks on the floor and a lot of the substance in the resolution is about president Trump and criticizing him and trying to open wounds and so this is unfortunately becoming the new mantra of the left in the Congress when they've got a problem that they can't solve it must be president Trump's fault it's a lot of the sentiment that we see echoed out of the Judiciary Committee where there is no Russian collusion the Muller report is about to drop Democrats know it is not going to allege Russian collusion and so they have to launch an 81 pronged investigation to harass our president they can't get their own house in order so everything's got to be the fault of a president who is creating more economic opportunity reducing unemployment ending wars and doing a heck of a job for the country

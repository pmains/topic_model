I reserve the balance of my time in reserves the gentlelady from California is recognized Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume the gentlelady is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of HR 7279 the very bipartisan as my colleague was saying water infrastructure Improvement Act let me first start by thanking the primary sponsor of the bill gentleman for Ohio mr. gifts and his great cooperation in this and let me say that it was a pleasure doing it this like he said and I associate myself with his remarks it is very bipartisan it is something that we all agree on that needs to happen for the people of this nation Thank You mr. Gibbs finally reach a bipartisan agreement on this very important issue after more than four years this legislation codifies the concept from the Obama administration knows known as integrated planning that can assist communities meet the requirements under the Clean Water Act while maintaining their obligation to achieve improvements in the local water quality EPA's integrated planning framework provides communities will have voluntary opportunity to prioritize local clean water investments with the greatest benefit to human health and environment this incredibly important to my community in the congressional district as well as many others as they meet the challenges of the Los Angeles County MS for term water permit and also across the nation to be clear the integrated planning is not about diminishing communities existing obligations under the Clean Water Act rather it provides an opportunity for communities to work with federal and state regulators to optimize their clean water infrastructure investments the sad reality is that until the federal government increases in its investment under the Clean Water Act community will still struggle with affordability challenges we can we must do better first we need to reauthorize the clean water state revolving fund known as SRF and I am hopeful that this is one of the first things we will accomplish next year on a very bipartisan basis again we passed similar reauthorization of the drinking water program by voice vote in September now it's time for a similar effort to protect local water quality second we need to address the cost of water and sewer services to these households with the least ability to pay no hard-working American families should be forced to go without water and wastewater services simply because their local rates are too high clean water should basic human right yes the utilities should be able to recover the cost necessary to upgrade their local systems but when those costs disproportionately affect individual households we can and must do much more to help struggling families afford these basic services that will be another issue I hope this next Congress will address in the coming year protecting our nation's clean water and making it affordable for all American families Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time the gentlelady reserves the gentleman from Ohio is recognized

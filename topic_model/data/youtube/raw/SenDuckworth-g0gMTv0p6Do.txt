Thank You mr. chairman I hope I not right see dried you didn't try to get them to do a hammerhead or anything did you with any aerobatic maneuvers stay within there within the restrictions gentlemen thank you so much for your participation today general Scaparrotti I want to return to the discussion about logistics challenges especially in the Eastern European area I Illinois National Guard has been the sponsor in the state partnership for peace programme for with the nation of Poland for 28 years now I believe 27 plus years so through my service I'm somewhat familiar with the challenges that did we face there could you update us on how the establishment of the NATO joint support and enabling command is going and let's remind us of why it was created and what it will better enable you to do in theatres to respond to Russian aggression and when would this command be fully operational the establishment of Jacek as you called it is is moving I think on timeline it's actually ahead of pace in my view the Germans who are the framework nation for this headquarters and own Germany I have in my view they've really leaned into this so they've already got their commander designated they have a portion of the staff there they've been present in my headquarters in shape to do the further planning that needs to take place to ensure that it's right size to make sure that the planning the understandings roles and responsibilities are correct so that's really the piece that we're doing right now but it's going that's moving along very well this fall is IOC and it's another year before it be fully operational so we've got some time here before it be fully operational that I would say to you that I think they'll be ahead of that in terms of real output they're already making a difference in terms of our logistics planning with with other legit legit Amanda then within the headquarters and throughout the components so I think they'll actually be leaning that before they're actually fully established so to speak why did we set that up primarily because in a you know in a European environment where we've got to be able to support and move 360 not just to the eastern border but North to the high north south and west with a threat that's actually 360 and then we needed to protect the central lines of communication critical ports seaports and infrastructure in doing that because it's been testified to here and by General Lyons this is we're now in a contested environment we needed a headquarters that that both look logistical II as well as protection of those key assets and that's really why we stood up that command and it's well placed being in kind of the central a heartland of Europe so to speak in sense of Germany so it's it's a very important step for NATO to take and I think it demonstrates NATO's focus on being making sure that it will be relevant to the environment that we're in today thank you gents Airlines how would try and calm plug into the Jacek and has this been tested yet I mean how would you plug in in times of during conflict for example and have we tested it first let me say just thank you for your understanding of logistics and the importance of logistics to warfighting really appreciate that I've actually been to Europe several times I met with the leadership that were developing the Jacek and I understand that concept very well I think it's a great initiative that general Scott the inter Scaparrotti and his team are moving out on I don't know that we plug in directly we plug in directly to his EUCOM headquarters through a european deployment and distribution operation center and then across you know at echelon to include his headquarters and we would take the signals that he would be sending on his priorities for for mobility and then meter them accordingly and he would have the role than to integrate that from a coalition perspective thank you I'd like to with that I'd like to returns general Scaparrotti to an understanding of seal if we had a discussion earlier today and I understand it recently made a reactivated its Atlantic come and to guard the sea lanes of approach into Europe in the event of war can you describe me in general terms and amount of Sealift that would be required to move significant US forces to Europe in the event of conflict and are you comfortable at the amount of Steel if that your disposal right now in the event of a conflict well centered alright when we go to the clothes section I can probably get into more detail on that but I would say it's significant and because of the types of forces I move and exceed would agree that we rely on Sealift largely for a lot of that that Balkan heavy heavy movement you know I'm aware of the challenges to our particularly our reserve force for naval forces and our you know our commercial support that's all important if we had a full conflict in Europe and so I would just underscore the importance of funding that making sure that and making sure that we have the readiness in the right place because we'll rely on it heavily for any crisis in Europe I think you will probably try to follow up and such a later stage thank you gentlemen Thank You senator Duckworth that

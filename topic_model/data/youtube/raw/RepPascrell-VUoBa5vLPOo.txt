congressman Pascal thanks for being with me so the White House says the public has no right right they're no longer coming up with the president says I really want to do it I really want to do it that's all over there are not ghosts or there's no right what's your reaction well I think there's one fish story after another the president has nothing to do with this the request was made to the IRS not to the President of the United States you don't send a letter to the president say can I have your taxes that is not how it works the law is very specific there are in 6103 section F the code they should read it once in a while to know what the heck they're talking about this is going to be determined by the IRS which has never turned down and requests this way president is not above the law I'm not above the law none of us are want to know for instance did the president pay his fair share of taxes you know he's been ordered it so many times in the last 25 years we want to know what's happened some of these audits wound up in the fact that taking him to court taking his organization that's true and and he was excoriated in those cases as david johnson as you know reported extensively on but but but do you think given that he has been audited before given that there's been plenty of questionable or or problematic things in there if there was anything hugely criminal or compromising from some other country wouldn't wouldn't we already know well know the what what was usually when you're doing order you're after a specific area of your tax returns but this goes beyond your 1040 this is not a 1040 discussion we're talking about his personal accounts we're talking about his business dealings he has business dealings all over we don't know what that's going to show there may be nothing here but what is he hiding what are the Republicans for over two years trying to defend the president when no one's accused them of anything we want to see what's in his tax returns and we're not going to make it public that also is very clear in the law and the Republicans had no trouble or and this is what burns my Fanny four years ago and they went after if you remember they went after the head of the IRS Elizabeth Lerner yes yes I do remember that and 50 individuals because they belonged to Courtland quote liberal groups to prove their point their taxes their tax returns were audited their tax returns were unfolded their names their business and that would happen nothing nothing was found nothing was illegal what are they talking about this is total hypocrisy I asked the chairman when he was a Republican when the Republicans were in charge yes in 2017 let's do this together so it is nonpartisan they don't want you all to be able to do this it's a precedent right I understand there's also a precedent a public policy of a public relations precedent right and that is release your taxes we all know what that is they've all done it Mitt Romney did it he's taking the president's side today maybe that's because you gotta slam facts right right but but but a precedent we're talking about now is different that's utilizing Congress can go out and just and just snatch someone's tax returns like the president is that a different precedent that concerns you yeah the president has always thought that the presidency the executive branch of government is in article 1 it's an article to we are honorable one this is HX imbalance government no one is above the law be a democrat or republican this was done for Democrats this was done for Republicans this president is going to have to release his returns primarily because he's been audited we want to know what's and that's that could be the beginning of other research this is gonna be if you take this to court we're gonna win the law is on our side I'm Ritchie Neal did a good job and sending the letter to the right person all right well as we know there's a big fight coming up ahead of you thank you so much congressman Pascrell I appreciate your time my honor

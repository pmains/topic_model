some lawmakers and computer scientists are concerned about the growing dangers of digitally altered video and audio this fake video created from clips of Saturday Night Live shows how advances in artificial intelligence can make anyone from Hillary Clinton to Vladimir Putin appear to say or do almost anything and we told you about this on Friday about a recent study that found false information on Twitter reached 1,500 people six times faster than truth Tony to cope was here with a new effort to separate fact from fiction Tony good morning and you were all real I am real for now but imagine this leader appearing on video to give a speech that never actually occurred computer-generated imagery has made this more possible than ever and while the technology does have legitimate uses experts are afraid it could sow chaos or even war Alec Baldwin is to some a perfect stand-in for Donald Trump China John but take a look at this that's president Trump's real face on the right digitally stamped on two Baldwin's performance it's part of a wave of doctored audio and video now spreading online the idea that someone could put a another person's face on an individual's body that would be like a home run for anyone who wants to interfere in a political process Virginia Senator Mark Warner believes a manipulated video the investigation is ongoing could be a game-changer in global politics this is now going to be the new reality surely by 2020 but potentially even as early as this year the anonymous maker of the Trump video has made similar videos of Hillary Clinton and Vladimir Putin in a message to CBS News he said he does it for fun and though he sees the potential for fake news he adds people will have to adapt as the tech is here to stay are we ready no we are absolutely not ready for this we are absolutely not ready for on so many different levels we're not ready for it honey Fareed runs a lab at Dartmouth College aimed at exposing digital fakes that want to replace your face with Nicolas Cage's for starters we asked him to make one and why Nic Cage because it's awesome already you can see he's identifiable in the first frame right so I'm gonna go ahead and play it there on a mobile device you can look at that all day long and that a day it's a pretty compelling fake the method recently published online by an anonymous developer is one of seven is tracking this program can change facial expressions in real time and this Adobe program can create new audio from text I separated from my mother right out of the gate that's terrifying I mean itit is just terrifying and now I can create the President of the United States saying just about anything I want Adobe calls this an early stage research project and while the company acknowledges the potential for objectionable use it believes the positive impact of technology will always overshadow the negative all these methods have legitimate uses in digital video and design but farid worries they'll be weaponized - I think the nightmare situation is a fake video of a politician saying I've lost you to the weapons against the country the other country reacts within minutes seconds and we have a global nuclear war his lab is developing tools to quickly identify fakes so what you have here is a non doctor damage and even pulse doctor video but for Reed suspects this is just the beginning of a much longer struggle we have a fake news phenomenon that is not going away and so add to that fake images fake audio fake video and you have an explosion of what I would call an information war there's no democrat or republican that would be safe from this kind of manipulation but boy oh boy we have as a country to get our act together senator Warner is asking the major tech companies to work with Congress to rein in false news and now also false video now we reached out to a number of tech companies for comment heard back from Reddit and Facebook both companies are aware of this false video phenomenon and are looking for ways to regulate it now it's not perfect but imagine where it's gonna be in a year in two years in five years and imagine what it does to things that are genuine it undermines the credibility of what is real no it's scary just looking at it in its infancy I can't imagine what happens when they really good good at it because right now Tony it looks pretty good well maybe don't force us all to be a little more on our toes and not accept everything so uncritically a fond hope

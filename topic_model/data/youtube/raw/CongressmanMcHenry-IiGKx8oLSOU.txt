. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. THIS MORNING I RISE TO   CELEBRATE A TRULY GREAT  AMERICAN AND ONE OF THE FINEST   MEN NORTH CAROLINA'S EVER  PRODUCED, THE REVEREND BILLY   GRAHAM WHO YESTERDAY CELEBRATED  HIS 99TH BIRTHDAY. BORN NOVEMBER 7, 1918 IN   CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA,   REVEREND GRAHAM HAS DEVOTED HIS  LIFE TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL OF   OUR LORD, SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST.  WHILE REVEREND GRAHAM WAS  ORDAINED UNTIL 1939, IT WASN'T   UNTIL 1949 THAT HE GAINED  RECOGNITION THAT HE'S KNOWN FOR  TODAY. IT WAS THAT YEAR HE HOSTED THE   LOS ANGELES CRUSADE. THE CRUSADE WAS ORIGINALLY   SCHEDULED TO LAST ONLY THREE   WEEKS BUT IT ENDED UP GOING ON   FOR OVER TWO MONTHS. AS HUGE CROWDS CAME TO HEAR  REVEREND GRAHAM'S SPREAD THE   GOSPEL.  IN THE YEARS SINCE THE LOS   ANGELES CRUSADE, REVEREND  GRAHAM HAS TRAVELED ACROSS THE   UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE   WORLD TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL.  ACCORDING TO THE BILLY GRAHAM  EVANGELICAL ASSOCIATION AND IN   HIS LIFE, REVEREND GRAHAM HAS  PREACHED NEARLY 215 MILLION  PEOPLE, OVER 185 COUNTRIES AND   TERRITORIES AROUND THE WORLD.  REVEREND GRAHAM HAS SERVED AS A  SPIRITUAL ADVISOR TO POLITICAL   AND FAITH LEADERS HERE IN THE  UNITED STATES AND THROUGHOUT   THE WORLD. IN THE 1950'S AND 1960'S, HE   JOINED DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING  JR. FOR INTEGRATED CRUSADES,   AND IN LATER YEARS, HE   DELIVERED INVOCATIONS AT THE   INAUGURATION OF FOUR DIFFERENT   PRESIDENTS AND IN 1983,  PRESIDENT REAGAN PRESENTED HIM   WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF   FREEDOM WHICH IS OUR NATION'S  HIGHEST CIVILIAN HONOR.  REVEREND GRAHAM NOW RESIDES  WHERE HE'S RESIDED MOST OF HIS   LIFE IN MONCRIEF, NORTH  CAROLINA, WHERE I HAVE THE   HONOR TO SERVE AS HIS  REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS.  WHILE PHYSICALLY HE'S SLOWED IN  RECENT YEARS, OVER HIS EIGHT   DECADES HIS WORK IS STILL FELT   BY US ALL. THROUGH THE BILLY GRAHAM   EVANGELICAL ASSOCIATION, HIS   LIFE'S MISSION CONTINUES AROUND  THE WORLD. IN FACT, HIS FAMILY'S MISSION  HAS CONTINUED AROUND THE WORLD.  PERHAPS THE GREATEST TESTAMENT   TO REVEREND GRAHAM'S DEDICATION  TO THE GOSPEL IS HOW HE HAS  CHOSEN TO SPEND HIS SIN TENNIAL  YEAR.  -- CENTENNIAL YEAR.  HE WILL CELEBRATE THE WORK GOD   HAS DONE THROUGH HIM.  MR. SPEAKER, ON BEHALF OF  EVERYONE IN WESTERN NORTH  CAROLINA AND ALL AMERICANS AND   SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE  WORLD, I'D LIKE TO WISH  REVEREND GRAHAM A HAPPY FIRST  DAY TO HIS 100TH YEAR. REVEREND GRAHAM, I THANK YOU   FOR SERVING AS A ROLE MODEL AND  SPIRITUAL GUIDE FOR GENERATIONS  OF AMERICANS.  THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE  TO HELP THOSE IN TIMES OF NEED,  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THANK YOU  PERSONALLY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE  FOR ME.  I YIELD BAC

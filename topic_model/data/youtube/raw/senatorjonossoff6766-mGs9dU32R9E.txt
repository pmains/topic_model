MS. MALEY, DON'T FEEL BOUND BY THE PRECISE TIME ON THE CLOCK -- YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR OSSOFF AND RANKING MEMBER JOHNSON, FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF, WHOSE WORK MADE MY APPEARANCE HERE TODAY POSSIBLE. MOTHERS AND SONS HAVE A SPECIAL BOND, A BOND NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BREAK TRAGICALLY, IN MY CASE, THAT BOND WAS BROKEN. IT WAS BROKEN BY A FOR PROFIT MEDICAL PROVIDER THAT BROUGHT A PAINFUL DEATH ON MY ONLY SON, MY ONLY CHILD. MY SON MATTHEW WAS SCARED AND ALONE IN THE CHATHAM COUNTY GEORGIA DETENTION CENTER ON A NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSE. MATTHEW WAS SUFFERING FROM CARDIOMYOPATHY, WHICH THE FOR PROFIT MEDICAL PROVIDER IGNORED. STUDIES SHOW THAT THE PROGNOSIS CLAUDE FOR PEOPLE WITH UNTREATED CARDIOMYOPATHY IS BLEAK. AND MATTHEW WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY TREATMENT. THE FOR-PROFIT MEDICAL PROVIDER HAD NO INTENTIONS OF TREATING HIM, BECAUSE CARDIOLOGY APPOINTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE JAIL WOULD CUT INTO THEIR PROFIT MARGIN ONE OF HIS JAILERS CALLED HIS PAIN AND ANGUISH, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, FUSSY. MATTHEW KNEW HE WAS DYING. HE TOLD ME MANY TIMES BY PHONE AND IN A SINGLE JAIL VISIT THAT, QUOTE, I NEEDED TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE, AND THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE HERE. THE PURE HORROR OF MATTHEW'S VOICE MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS -- DYING AS WELL. MATTHEW DIED A SLOW PAINFUL DEATH OVER THE COURSE OF WEEKS. HE WAS TOO SICK TO TAKE PHONE CALLS OR VISITS. AFTER THE ONE TIME I GOT TO SEE HIM IN JAIL, I NEVER GOT TO HOLD HIM, TO TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM, OR PRAY WITH HIM. THEN THE NEXT TIME I GOT TO SEE MATTHEW, HE HAD ALREADY SUFFERED BRAID INJURIES AFTER BEING RESUSCITATED THREE TIMES BY THE JAIL STAFF. MY LAST VISIT WITH HIM WAS TO TAKE HIM OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT. HE WAS STILL HANDCUFFED TO AN ICU BED AND UNDER 24/7 SUPERVISION BY A CORRECTIONS OFFICER. AFTER 32 YEARS OF LIFE WITH MY ONLY SON, OUR BOND WAS BROKEN. NO AND NO ONE, NOT THE HEALTH PROVIDER, NOT THE INFIRMARY STAFF, THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE, OR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WAS WILLING TO HELP. THEY DID TAKE TIME TO ENACT ONE LAST INDIGNITY UPON MATTHEW BEFORE HIS DEATH. THEY ISSUED HIM A PERSONAL RECOGNIZANCE BOND AFTER HE WAS BRAIN DID. SO HIS DEATH WOULD NOT COUNT AS AND IN CUSTODY DEATH. NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT MATTHEW WENT THROUGH. THIS IN CLOSING, MATTHEW'S STORY MIGHT NOT BE OVER I WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD AWARENESS OF THIS PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS I AM ABLE WITH OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS AND JAILS, THERE ARE MORE MILLIONS OF MOTHERS, FATHERS, SIBLINGS AND FRIENDS WHO ARE IN THE SAME OR WORSE SITUATIONS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. THIS IS WHY ENFORCEMENT OF THE DEATH IN CUSTODY ACT IS SO IMPORTANT. IT COULD BE A TOOL TO HOLD THE FOR-PROFIT JAIL AND PRISON MEDICAL PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR UNNECESSARY DEATHS

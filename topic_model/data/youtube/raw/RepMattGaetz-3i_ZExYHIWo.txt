this week we received the principal conclusions from the Mullen report no collusion no obstruction of justice the President did not commit crimes we've been saying this for two years that this was an invented Russian narrative that started when our intelligence community was politicized and they used dirt paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign to act as if there was some collusion between the president's campaign in Russia now 22 months tens of millions of dollars over 500 interviews thousands of subpoenas and document requests later no evidence of collusion and so I'm grateful that we've got a president willing to take on the establishment willing to face the headwinds that so many in Washington send his way but at the end of the day now we're able to focus on legislating not investigating we're able to focus on bringing the country together rather than dividing people the way that Democrats and so many in the media have done on this Russia story I'm still convinced the best days for the Trump presidency and the Trump economy and the United States of America are still ahead

hi I'm Elizabeth Warren and this is Bailey and we made this video just especially for kids or at home right now and missing their friends and missing school so let's hear what's on your mind [Music] I am 10 years old and I'm nervous my mom is an ER doctor and Jessie were anxious to share opinions I know you're nervous Salvador but let me start by saying your mom is really brave as sushi really she's really brave and thank you for sharing her with us because she's helping keep everybody else safe and our job especially those of us who are in government is to make sure your mom has everything she needs so that she can stay safe that's how it's supposed to work and that is we all help each other you help your mom your mom helps us and we'll try to help that's how I'm sure right then let's see what else we've got what is our central logo good question tear essential workers of the people who are keeping our country going right now it's the doctors and the nurses who take care of us if we get sick and also the people who are cleaning the hospitals so we can be there and delivering food to the hospitals it's also the people who are keeping things going so that the rest of us can stay home the people who are stocking the grocery store shelves and who are driving the delivery trucks the people who are driving buses so that the workers who have to get out can get where they need to go it's very important that our essential workers the ones who are keeping the country going are fully protected and that means that they've got the masks they need and other protective gear now if you see someone who comes to your house someone who delivers things maybe it's the person who delivers the mail you might think about writing a sign that says thank you and putting it in the window because it's the essential workers who keep us going right now right Bailey they keep us going hi I'm Maggie I'm nine years old University Place Washington hi I'm various wondering what we could do to help out in their pandemic Maggie and Quinn that's a great question the first thing you can do is stay healthy and the best way to do that is follow all instructions right now be sure wash your hands regularly stay in and practice social distancing don't be close to other people who aren't in your house and if you do go out wear a mask it's really important and it's important not just for you to stay healthy for yourself it's important for you to stay healthy because it means that our doctors and nurses will have more time to take care of other people who've gotten sick so that's number one number two think about all the people who would like to hear from you maybe people who live alone maybe people you haven't seen for a long time this is a good time to reach out to call them or text them work FaceTime them or however you like to be in touch with them but get in touch with other people because people need to know you're there and you care it matters a lot and remember all those people who are keeping our country running right now all those essential workers that Tanner was asking about those essential workers remember sick thank you wave at them in the window put up the sign but remind people that we really are grateful for all the help that they're giving us you know we all work on this together we're gonna make it and I think Quinn has another question Quinn how do you spend how do you spend your free time during quarantine oh I'm lucky because when I have any spare time I've got family so I spend my spare time playing with the dog [Music] I hope you're having some fun too we all take care and send me your questions I'm always glad to have them bye-bye

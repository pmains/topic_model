thank you very much let's discuss with a key member of the january 6 committee congressman adam schiff he's also the chairman of the house intelligence committee congressman thanks for joining us will the committee in fact be asking the former vice president to come in and appear voluntarily yes i think our sherman has now acknowledged that we will be um and that's our practice which is to invite people to come and voluntarily hope that they'll do so um and he would have i think very undoubtedly relevant testimony for us about that pressure campaign no one would be in a better position really to speak to it than he would uh all of the efforts to get him to violate his constitutional duty uh to uh to count the votes and instead uh reject votes uh without basis and so we hope that he'll be willing to do so and as the chairman has indicated we intend to extend that uh invitation fairly soon will you subpoena the former vice president if he chooses not to appear voluntarily um you know we we don't you know like to speculate about that until we have a chance to see whether people come in uh on their own volition and look he did the right thing on that day um i certainly uh have a lot of differences with mike pence and i think for four years he was tragically a dutiful yes man for the president but on one day that really really mattered he said no and so i think he's got a good important story to tell i think it's a story the american people should hear and it would be invaluable to uh our work so let's hope that he's willing to do the right thing yeah he did the right thing on that day in certifying uh the election and his top aides uh while at the white house his chief of staff his national security adviser and others who worked very closely with him uh they are fully cooperating right now aren't they you know i can't comment as to particular witnesses uh and their level of cooperation but i i can say that we're getting the help of a great many people uh some who were in the administration in the white house uh others uh uh who were outside of the the government uh but um still i think even with other witnesses uh who are you know potentially helping the committee mike pence knows things that only mike pence knows and it would be very important to completely fill out our work and i think this is one more public service that needs to be performed by the former former vice president the house speaker nancy pelosi congressman suggested on cnn last night that she believes some of her republican colleagues were in her word perpetrators of the january 6th attack does the select committee have evidence of that uh you know i can't comment on what evidence we have at this point and certainly i don't want to comment vis-a-vis members of congress except to say that in my view um you know those who even after that attack on the capitol continue to vote to overturn the election bear responsibility uh now that may not be a kind of a responsibility that breaks the law but i think it violated their oath of office their their oath to uphold the constitution um in terms of whether members were aiding and abetting the insurrectionists in a way that that ought to result in either the justice department taking action or the house taking action i'm going to await the the conclusion of our investigation we now know that then vice president-elect kamala harris was at the dnc was evacuated when that pipe bomb was found outside does this revelation congressman further underscore why the investigation into the many acts of violence that occurred on that day that investigation remains critical right oh yes you know i i think that's unquestionably true you had the current at that time vice president mike pence in danger of his life with people with scaffolds outside the capitol wanting to hang him and you had the incoming vice president who if these reports are correct was in proximity to a pipe bomb that authorities have said was a viable uh weapon and could have killed someone so i mean all of these things uh i think underscore the importance of a full accounting of what led up to that day and more than that day a full accounting of all the multiple lines of effort by donald trump and his enablers and anyone else to overturn a presidential election to essentially stop the peaceful transfer of power to the person who won joe biden and you know that's what we're determined to to do and to find out and to make public uh and protect the country through our legislative process lots going on right now we will stay in touch congressman adam schiff thank you so much for joining us thank you wolf

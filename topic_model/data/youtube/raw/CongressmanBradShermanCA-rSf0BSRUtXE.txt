so let's talk about this and more I want to bring in out congressman brad Sherman he's a Democrat from California and the senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a Clinton supporter welcome sir good to be with you will you meet with Secretary Clinton today absolutely just as soon as we're done with this interview and what will what will that be like what will you guys talk about well this is is going to be a pep rally as your reporter said not almost all of us have been with Hillary from the beginning and those who are with Bernie are now with Hillary and this is going to be a chance for us fired up and ready to go and also to to talk about some of the finer points of the campaign and especially how the presidential campaign can also help us take back the House of Representatives Donald Trump is doing so poorly that's a possibility will you be watching mr. Trump speech I will actually be in the room with chairman Yellen of the Federal Reserve Board and that'll be a little bit more policy oriented than what mr. Trump has to say so you'll be busy working and afterwards mr. Trump's speech though it's expected to be no holds barred mr. Trump has already responded to Clinton's claims that he profited from dead at the expense of working people listen Hillary Clinton's only right about one thing I understand debt and how to handle it I've made a fortune with debt but debt for this country is a disaster and Obama has piled it on and she's been there watching mr. Trump told ABC he was simply using the laws on the books as any good businessman would what's wrong with that what's wrong with it is when he refuses to pay the small businesses that help build his buildings when he stiffs plumbers when he stiffs painters and then hides behind the fact that I'm rich I've got a lot of lawyers you can't sue me you don't have a legal counsel so I think that that's not the way most people do business and it's certainly not the way the United States can do business he has talked about putting our full faith and credit on the line and and and and and not honoring us debts that would be such an incredible disaster for the world economy because while hundreds of years ago gold was the standard now the standard is US government bonds and the entire world economy is dependent upon the Full Faith and Credit of the United States which should never be put at risk mr. Trump will also likely hammer mrs. Clinton and her husband and how much money they made in speaking fees allegedly fueled by Clinton's time in the state but CNN found between 2001 and 2015 2015 the Clintons earned more than 153 million dollars for 729 separate speeches some of those speeches were delivered to groups with ties to foreign countries mr. Trump will likely charged Clinton turned the State Department into what he calls a private hedge fund why is he wrong presidents have been giving speeches after they left office certainly since Ronald Reagan who received a much bigger speaking fee when he went to Japan than anything that I think any president has earned since now it's true that President Clinton has given probably and Secretary Clinton is probably given more speeches they've worked hard at it but in terms of what people are willing to pay testitude to bring to their audience a present for more president of the United States there are groups that are willing to pay a lot and they certainly fav Ronald Reagan a lot more than my date Hillary or bill 53 million dollars isn't it time that Hillary Clinton released the transcripts of those wall speeds small street speeches wouldn't that put this matter to rest I'm sure that would do nothing to put the matter rest just because Trump will never rest he is negatives are so extreme he's called by speaker Ryan a textbook racist he will do nothing but attack attack and attack the Clintons have been under attack for 25 years and of course Trump will try to continue that the problem he has is it salt on the table won't put voters minds to rest if Hillary Clinton released the transcripts of those speeches after all Bernie Sanders called for her to do that yes in a primary many things happen but the fact is that the she has given thousands of speeches that are on the record we know what she has to say we know what our positions are and of course our web page lays out her positions for the future you go to the Trump webpage and all you see is a tax all you see is is is bile we need a positive prescription for the future of the history preferred for the future of this country and you'll see that in Hillary's program let me ask you this mark zandi the well respected economist determined mr. Trump's economic plan would be disastrous for the country but he donated money to mrs. Clinton and two Republican John McCain and he was a guest speaker for the Clinton Global Initiative mr. Trump will surely bring this up how should voters take the sandy report they should say that mr. sandy knows something about economics but so do thousands of other economists in this country and they've all reached the same conclusion and that is that we better not let Trump's hands onto this economy what she about these donations from from mr. sandy to mrs. Clinton and to John McCain whose no huge fan of Donald Trump it's clear that mr. sandy has put a little bit of money where his mouth is I don't think that he's that the amounts of the contributions are significant they'd say you can't say that xandi controls the Clinton campaign because he's donated one or two thousand dollars but it does show he is so motivated it he's willing to put his money where his mouth is and he speaks not yet he's a centrist economists the the vast majority of economists in this country they may quibble with Hillary's plan but they all agree Trump is a complete disaster and i'm glad that Sandy's enough of a patriot to try to do just a little something with his own money to prevent that disaster all right congressman brad Sherman thanks for

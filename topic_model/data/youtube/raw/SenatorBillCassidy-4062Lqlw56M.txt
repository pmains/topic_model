senator bill cassidy is joining us the uh senate energy committee sits on the senate finance committee beautiful state of louisiana it's a little hot and humid this time of year uh but anyway senator good had you um what do you make of what's happening with gas and now the president want to keep it going presumably by tapping the reserve for still more oil well first the gas prices are still too high for the average family who can't pay their bills yeah it's less than it was but it's a lot more than it was before and i say that because if you're driving a 15 year old truck to work 45 minutes one direction 45 minutes the other you're you're doing that not because you necessarily don't want a new car you can't afford a new car so so the president still kind of like putting the american people behind the eight ball how's it going but on that on that i definitely see what you're saying senator it's a lot higher than it was but it's a lot lower than it was as well um so this is part of the theme you're hearing from any of the administration that things are getting better and then along comes jerome powell today the head of the federal reserve to kind of concur with that what did you make of that well first the reason it's getting better there's also been demand destruction and so the fact that people are not taking their driving vacation or they're otherwise limiting their life they're buying cheaper groceries not more expensive groceries that's not a good thing oh yeah um you know we have fewer people getting sick because more people have already died so i'm not quite sure i'm accepting the rosie scenario being tossed out by mr powell or by the administration so senator what do you think of this notion now that we can have a soft landing that we can avoid an outright recession you wonder what the federal reserve chairman knows when he said we're not in recession because that gdp data for the second quarter doesn't come out so tomorrow he he probably might have a hint of it of whether there's a plus or minus in front of it but if it isn't a negative number um technically it wouldn't be a recession it's very different though i know you talk about people in your state and elsewhere who feel it regardless of whether the numbers prove it right well i think if you look at consumer sentiment that's reflecting that we're already in a recession so there may be some macro number that's good or is not so good or is bad or not so bad but if you're talking about the family trying to pay the bills and the groceries are going up the utility bill is going up their fuel costs are going up it has hit them already so i think this kind of is going to be a soft landing is from the view of those who are in washington one of my constituents said that joe biden should come live how real people live if you live like real people are living this has not been a soft landing and they don't anticipate it being a soft landing so what do we do it seems to be up to the federal reserve right now whatever it's doing whether it's raising rates to tackle inflation or find that right balance uh there seems to be very little faith that you and your colleagues on either side you know of the political aisle are going to get anything to address this or do anything to address this is that right well first yeah first the things that they were the things that democrats are suggesting to to address it would be to spend more money now we can argue that the 1.9 trillion kicked this off they call it the american rescue plan it was more like the american recession plan so so with the 280 billion dollar chip industry help package that overwhelmingly past the senate i don't know if you approved that today senator but that's an authorization i understand but it is still a lot of money right yeah but that's an authorization it's not an appropriation and it's a lot of money right so where's that money coming from so the money is that it's authorized yes you can fund it if you wish but it's not necessarily funded of that only about 13 billion or maybe i think it's 13 billion is actually funded so first there can be a kind of decision as when to fund secondly let's imagine they fund it all it's still not 1.9 and that 1.9 was spent directly on consumption if you will not going to build things which are going to increase productivity things which have their payoff 10 years from now but no money in people's pocket like right now which extended unemployment benefits and encouraged some people to not go back to work other things started in the trump administration too i'm not disparaging either president or party but uh no one has a lock on on you know the fiscal sainthood here right i mean i'm going to argue with that let me know say that when we first put out the under the trump administration on a bipartisan basis that was an attempt to keep the economy from fully plummeting keep in mind businesses were shuttered and small business was going to lay everybody off that is different from the american recession plan that was a 1.9 trillion thing that left of center economists said was not needed and would contribute to inflation i thought we had a kind of goldilocks just right and then boom there went a lot of gasoline with the match filed to follow and inflation ignited just as it was predicted inflation was not predicted after the plans that we put out on a bipartisan basis under the previous administration but do you think it had its seeds there is what i'm saying because you could talk about the trillion of trillions here and this president that president but trillions were spent again to address an emergency maybe less so to your point senator uh given uh you know the early days of the buy administration uh but money was going out from both parties well you can argue about the first but you can also argue that it kept our economy from going into the great depression again now the one and you did not hear economist on the left and right saying that that was going to cause inflation they said that was a needed safety net to keep the economy from crashing on the 1.9 trillion again the american recession plan that was where economists on the left and the right were saying that it would contribute to inflation and they proved to be right unfortunately well unfortunately you know economists don't have the best track record they also you know looked at this and saying so i'm spending justified some things out it's a moot point it's after the fact i get it what you're saying is no more spending now cool it stop it be done with it right yeah if it's going to be spending on things which are of immediate consumption and or things that would encourage people not to return to work or otherwise limit us labor supply don't do it now if you're going to build a highway a bridge if you want to redo a sewer system that's going to increase productivity that has been shown to decrease inflation going forward that would be kind of an appropriate way to go forward got it senator thank you very good seeing you again

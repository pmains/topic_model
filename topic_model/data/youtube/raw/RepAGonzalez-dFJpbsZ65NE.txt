hello everyone I'm Congressman Anthony Gonzales welcome to my third quarter update yesterday I asked many utila to leave questions on Facebook and Twitter I have those questions here as we've done each quarter but before I answer them let me give you a brief rundown of what my office has been up to since my last updates been a busy couple months as you can imagine and quite if it's going on so if you didn't also if you didn't get a chance to ask a question yesterday you can email us directly on our website at Anthony Gonzalez house.gov and we'll get back to you as soon as possible first on the constituent side we always start there so over the last three months my office has opened 338 cases on your behalf with the federal government closed another 213 that brings our total number of constituents helped with respect to cases to 1046 so we tracked that in metric on that and and I think we've done some great work they're really proud of the team frankly for doing everything there and then also we've secured nearly 6 million dollars in grant funding for Ohio 16th district for causes like combating domestic violence for serving disabled veterans through adaptive sports programs it's hugely important and improving transportation infrastructure at Wayne County Airport so I've mentioned this at various points and that we have somebody in our office who focuses exclusively on bring grant dollars back to the 16th district these grants are out there and you know I think makes sense for us to proactively go get them so if you're somebody who's looking for federal grants in a different organization please contact our office because if it's out there we'll find it and then additionally we hosted two town halls conducted a number of roundtables on different topics and connected 443 veterans to resources through our veterans resource tour which again if you're a veteran I hope you'll you'll check those out and please spread the word it's just a great place for veterans to kind of access all the different services all at once so that's that on the constituents side on the legislative side I was proud we passed our first bill this quarter the bill is HR 26:13 Noah's known as the AI to assist enforcement which works to ensure that new and innovative technologies are available to law enforcement that are working to stop money laundering specifically in Northeast Ohio and across the country this is hugely important it's one of the tools that I think we should be equipping our federal government with to make sure that they're going after the drug traffickers the human traffickers in the most efficient way possible so the way it works now is it's basically all on paper and it's very analog where people are looking at each of the individual cases directly and what I would like to do when you really study this issue it's tailor-made for technology so what I would like to do is set up a system where we can use artificial intelligence and we can use machine learning to comb through the data itself and find the patterns to uncover the drug dealers we need to cut them off in any way possible and I think this is a good way to do it through the work I've been doing on the Financial Services Committee so really excited about that and additionally on the tech front I introduced the IO ghen act to combat manipulated media content known as deep fakes if you follow these videos that we do these weekly updates I mentioned a deep fake is basically what you saw in the movie Forrest Gump so when you saw Forrest Gump sitting with President Kennedy and all these different people throughout history in the movie and it looked like it actually occurred that's a deep fake when that technology was developed years ago it was very expensive only Hollywood studios could do it and now because technology has evolved so so quickly and it's gotten so cheap pretty much anybody can do it you could do it if with an iPhone and your MacBook if you have that so so this bill that we passed would help us improve our national security by helping us research and identify the various deep fake technologies so deep fake is designed to erode public trust and I want to make sure I'm equipping our law enforcement with with the right tools so that's that's also in the works additionally secured a number of new co-sponsors for the JOBS Act which will help close our skills gap by allowing Pell grants to apply towards short term job training programs at community colleges like tri-c starts today anywhere across the state we're up to 52 co-sponsors in the house and just this week we received the endorsement of the bipartisan problem-solvers caucus which is 48 Republican or I'm sorry 48 members and in a great endorsement to get in August actually held a roundtable at tri-c with various stakeholders and educators to hear about how Pell Grant expansion is important to students in their community there's a great discussion with people from all over the district now if you have a story to share about how you think this legislation would affect you please do reach out to my office through our website or social media we'd love to hear from you on and I'm really proud of this it's it's picking up steam I'm hopeful we've been working this pretty hard on the House floor and I know senator Portman and senator Kaine are doing the same in the Senate so hopefully we can get that through and then lastly before I get to your questions I just want to let everyone know that if you are interested in more updates like this you can subscribe to my weekly email newsletter it's called the weekly huddle guess why a little bit of a pun there that goes out every Sunday and so with that we'll get to your questions which we have right here and thank you as always for for allow me to be a representative and for participating in today's session so the first question well first let me just open with this obviously a lot of the questions that came through we're on the impeachment inquiry now that we're going through the house so I'm just gonna start by giving a blanket you know five minutes or so on my stance with respect to what we're doing here in the house and then we'll get into the rest of the questions I hope to kind of answer every one but the majority of the questions frankly weren't we're on impeachment I'm so figured I'll just knock this all out at the beginning and if you have additional questions either write in or comment in the comment section and we'll make sure that we get to those and so with respect to impeachment a couple things I think are important first I think we need to take a big giant step back and ask ourselves what are we actually doing here and what we are doing in any impeachment is you are literally overturning the wishes of the American people I believe that there are two things that I vote on and consider in Congress that are of the utmost important that are the most solemn and serious things that we can do or one is sending our troops into harm's way I think if you're gonna do that you have you better be darn sure you know what the mission is and what we're doing have a clear plan for success you need to be committed to that because that is such a solemn act to send our men and women to fight on our behalf so that's number one the second is impeachment because it represents a fundamental shift in who we are as a people we were founded on the notion that a free people can govern themselves and in an impeachment what we are saying essentially is we're not so sure anymore we want a political body to make that choice for us and so I think those should that should only be pursued in the most serious instances and so with respect to to impeachment I believe you need so essentially two things in order to consider this number one you need clear compelling unambiguous evidence of a major crime that threatens the future of the Republic that's number one and number two and this is how you can figure out whether you have number one you need the most open transparent process possible if you're going to impeach a president the American people need to know exactly what the evidence is why you're doing it it needs to be unambiguous you need cross-examination basically the amount of due process that we afford any American citizen at a minimum we owe that to the President of the United States any president no matter who it is the president if you're going to impeach them desert him or her deserves incredible due process and so what are we doing today I currently sit on one of the Committees of jurisdiction I'm on the Financial Services Committee speaker Pelosi when she unilaterally decided to kick off the impeachment inquiry articulated six committees that she said are gonna look at this okay so I'm on a compel another point every other time we've gone down this path that's happened with the vote on the House floor and the reason why that's important is because that's what establishes the rules in the process that you're going to go through when you unilaterally decide in the speaker's office it's anything goes it's whatever the majority product party wants to do so what are we doing I'm on a committee of jurisdiction you would think that as somebody on a committee of jurisdiction who is tasked with looking at this specific thing that I would be able to read the evidence that I would be able to cross-examine witnesses I think that we should be able to call our own witnesses if we'd want and to at least participate in the inquiry seeing as I'm on one of the committees that's supposed to be doing it currently I'm not even allowed in the room I'm not allowed to sit through the through the testimonies I'm not allowed to ask questions not allowed to do much of anything frankly and neither are any Republicans except for those on Intel and Foreign Affairs and so with respect to an open and transparent process to respect the due process that everybody deserves especially the President of the United States is a duly elected officer in this country we're failing miserably we are completely failing and so frankly I don't support this and I don't know how anybody does right now given that the only information we have is coming directly from Adam Schiff so all the news reports all the leaks that you're seeing 100% of those come from Adam Schiff and that's not an exaggeration because the way that this committee is set up the Democrat Party Adam Schiff controls the transcripts controls the typing controls the unlock the electronics controls any information that comes out of there and so all of the things that you're seeing the little snippets of information our things are little bread crumbs in my opinion that he's dropping to ultimately help him make his case and his goal which is not to run a transparent process that is not his goal his goal is to impeach the President of the United States I believe that that is his goal and so everything that he's leaking is designed to move people in that direction what is not coming out and what I don't think ever will come out which is unfortunate is the cross-examination the questions that those on the Intel and foreign affairs committee are asking to understand again what is actually happening the other things that have come out the other two things that have come out one is the transcript itself from the call the summary of the transcript I read that I didn't read a quid pro quo I didn't see anything that certainly that I thought was in ficha and so that was that my read on that transcript and then the other thing that came out was the president of Ukraine said I didn't even know the money was with being withheld and I didn't feel pressured and so if that's all that we have we have a broken process that's not open that's not transparent again I'm on a committee of jurisdiction and I'm not allowed to look at it that's crazy to me I don't understand how anybody could support that kind of a process when we're talking about overturning the wishes of over 50 million Americans I just think that's wrong and I think it sets a horrific precedent so we're in that situation and we're in a situation where the only two people other than Adams just leaking that have talked about it President Trump and the president of Ukraine have both basically said the same thing one said there's no quid pro quo the other said I didn't even feel pressure and I didn't know that the money was being withheld so we're gonna keep monitoring it like as you remember Congress that's my job but again I'll go back to what I said at the beginning we govern ourselves in this country the voters choose the president we hold the president accountable the voters choose and the way that this is going on the only way you could possibly ever returns is with unbelievable evidence and a clear crystal clear process with great transparency and we're just failing miserably on that front and so I do not support it and and and you know that's kind of where I stand on that again I know there'll be additional questions and comments for sure this is a very divisive issue as I said the first time I commented on that my fear is that this is going to rip the country apart even more than we already are and that's definitely happening but you know please feel free to submit your comments and questions and we'll be sure to answer those as well so that's that's the impeachment moving on to next questions yeah so this one is from Cristina question is why hasn't us MCA been brought to a vote the short answer is because the Speaker of the House doesn't want to put it up for a vote so when you're in the majority and you have the speakership the speaker control everything that goes to the House floor there's one way to get around that and that's what the what's called a consensus both and I think you need like 300 members to support something in order to get that but by and large that almost never happens by and large the only things that come to the House floor are those things that the speaker puts out and so at this point and this is another problem with impeachment at this point the speaker has not been willing to put us mca up for a vote and frankly this has been my number one priority since I got into Congress was helping us pass us MCA I believe us MCA would be the most positive economic policy that we can enact in this in this Congress so independent organization the u.s. ITC has scored the trade deal the projection is it creates over 175,000 jobs in particular in manufacturing in agriculture to industries that are incredibly important to the 16th district and it will raise GDP by a quarter of a percent I actually think it would do even more than that but but that's the projection and so I haven't heard either in committee and I've challenged my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to to make the opposing case I haven't heard in committee or anywhere frankly an economic argument why we would not want this oh there's out that it's also projected 2-ways rages raise wages so to me it's a no-brainer in private everybody has said to me that they like the deal and they want to want it to go forward but because we're so distracted with everything going on and the speaker is playing politics with this one we're not getting a vote quite yet but I will continue to work on that continue to work with my Democratic colleagues to try to force a vote before the years over certainly before the Congress is over we need it we need it in a 16th district we need it in Ohio generally and and I look forward to supporting its passage when it comes up which is hopefully soon it's a great question on that Kyle rights are we working on a trade agreement with the UK for when brexit occurs is it at least a draft so the answer Kyle for that question is yes we are working on a trade agreement with the UK president Trump and Boris Johnson have a very strong relationship and have been my understanding I've been working quite closely their teams on on making sure that when brexit occurs I think it'll probably occur there's a little uncertainty there but when brexit occurs that the transition at least with respect to the UK and the United States is as seamless as possible I think that's that's smart frankly we're in unchartered territory with brexit and no country has ever left as the EU and in this way and so there's a lot to be figured out there and if you're following British Parliament politics at all we keep a little bit of an eye on it because of the brexit situation and you'll see that they know they want to leave but they don't quite know exactly how and they can't agree on it and so looks like there's been some movement in the last week or so but but nothing final yet I'm hopeful but again the short answer to the question is yes we are working on it we want to make sure that there's no residual negative effects on our US economy and I don't think there will be at least not any major ones so that's that question next one came from Twitter Salladhor I liked your question about how Facebook would comply to keep social and financial data separate but Z I assume you mean Zuckerberg Zuckerberg response was inadequate the current FTC settlement does not cover any requirement to keep such separate so can Congress require Facebook to sign up two additional stipulations against this expressly great question so this is in reference to our committee hearing Financial Services hearing that we had yesterday with Mark Zuckerberg about their Libra initiative so if you're not following this Facebook some of you are probably watching this one wants to launch their own what they're calling a cryptocurrency else the technical jargon on this but I don't actually think that's what it is but in any of it so they are they are running with this notion that they're going to create a coin called Libra concurrent with that I have a lot of challenges with that I don't as a general statement I do not trust Facebook to protect our data to do much of anything I think the tool has been abused quite horribly over the last couple years and really I just had a lot of issues with the company generally but I don't think that Facebook necessarily has been a great thing for this country or the world despite their best intentions and so when a company like that wants to get into the payments business and wants to launch their own currency we need to take a really hard look at it the question that one of the questions that I asked Mark Zuckerberg yesterday was with respect to keeping financial data and user data profile data separate I think that's an important distinction if they're gonna run this thing you better not be commingling you know but our profile data you know things that you're doing with your family and friends with all your financial data I just think that that separation is important and that's awfully intrusive to allow that kind of integration and so that was my question and he said well we're gonna comply with with a a settlement that we reached and with the federal government not long ago I also did not find his answer to be particularly compelling on that front and so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna submit basically the question that you just asked I'm gonna submit that for the record and we have seven days to submit written questions so I'm gonna submit that question to Mark Zuckerberg in writing exactly as you said it with maybe a few tweaks but and and we'll update once we get that back because I think what you're saying is exactly right so the next question comes from Drew is there this is going is there anything you can do to put an end to these constant spam phone calls I got on my personal cell phone in my business landline on a daily basis isn't that annoying we get it I get them just like you might get and it's so the answer is yes I voted in favor of a bill earliest earlier this Congress to address these spam calls there are legitimate calls that we that we need to make sure get through and we're not silencing you know individuals in this country but but with respect to spam calls specifically ah yes we we can do something about it we are doing something about it hopefully that takes effect soon because I feel like at least half of my calls or are these spam things you answer and there's nobody there you get some goofy dial tone or something kind of scares you to be honest but in any event so that's that this one comes from WJ is there anything you can do to help it's a Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority it needs major investment and letting it decay due to neglect is destroying a major part of our infrastructure so the answer to that is yes so I mentioned earlier that we're bringing grant dollars back to the community we have people in our office one person in particular who spends all day every day working on this and that's what we're doing in support of of the RTA and we don't have a status update quite yet on it but but I will say that that's the route that we're taking I also believe if if we have an infrastructure bill which i think is a longshot frankly but if we get that done there's a chance that some of those funds could be could be dedicated to RTA as well we did a nice and interesting roundtable down at Gojo a couple weeks back and we were talking about the JOBS Act but we're also talking about the local economy generally and one thing that really struck home for me we talk about a lot of issues but one that kept coming up was just how difficult it is for some of our folks to travel and transit to their places of work and you know you talk to some people and it's it's an hour and a half each way just just to get to their job and so we do have an issue with transportation in our region for sure and I think you're seeing it across the country in cities like Cleveland cities that kind of share our our demographics and our industry mix I think we're all struggling basically with the same thing and so one of the things we are going to do is is work to help out RTA but additionally I actually think this needs a little a lot more creative thinking with respect to how we think about transiting people across our region so that they can get to work they can take care of their kids I mean I can't even think of this you got an hour and a half both ways and then you somehow have to you know get your kid to daycare you got to get your kid to school make sure they're picked up I mean it just creates all kinds of struggles for a family that wants to work wants to do everything right and so I take the point and I just want you to know that that we are working on it not just with RTA but transportation generally in the region and connecting people to their jobs great question next one is from tag Ohio do you support Trump's approach towards Syria where he betrayed the Kurds who lost over 10,000 people fighting Isis or us I'm sure okay so a basic statement I released a statement earlier on this so for me I I do not believe that we have a role in the Syrian issue I really don't military role certainly we could have we have a diplomatic role but I don't believe we have a military role but at the same time I do believe that a better it would have been nice if we would have provided some sort of safe harbor for the Kurds I share the same frustration this current spot alongside of us to help us defeat Isis which is for me the scariest terrorist organization that we've dealt with in my life it's easy to forget that it wasn't that long ago really the 2015 2016 where they were lighting people in cages on fire they were taking land they were cutting people's heads off on on YouTube I mean just the most horrific things when al-qaeda says we don't want to be a part of you because you're too extreme I think you've got a real problem on your hands and and the Kurds to put it mildly and the Kurds were instrumental in helping us secure that and to defeat Isis so in that sense I would have liked to see something a little bit different on that front the good news is there has been a permanent ceasefire that was just an and and I think the whole you know now we got to monitor that but hopefully that provides the safe harbor but again I would I would say at the outset where I absolutely agree with the president I just don't believe that that we need our men and women fighting in that particular region it's there really truly is this sense and I've heard people say this frankly in Congress well we always need people there we always need to be fighting I don't I don't believe that I just don't I think we need to do whatever is going to keep our country safe and secure sometimes that means we need to be in places but this notion that we should be there forever I think is just wrong I think it puts us in the middle of a situation that we can't ever win and and I don't want to send our troops into a situation that is unwinnable that's not good question they're all great questions by the way so this is a multi-part question let's see it there's kind of a lot here but well I'll get two of them so one's from Nicolas and Nicolas and Mark kind of go back and forth I'll read the first two and then I'll stop and so Nicolas says how are we addressing the student loan debt and payback struggles for families what action steps are we taking to cap tuition costs and loans to ensure a successful future for our youth and what are we doing to create better worker candidates in Ohio many customers are struggling to hire and retain workers you're a hundred percent right on that mark rights following on this question my college-age son recently was explaining some of the student loan repayment options what is an income based repayment plan so if a couple with student loans married they could potentially have higher payments I do realize there are options my point is I have never heard of such a loan before why would we do this to students who have just graduated and are still trying to establish themselves um so great questions so with respect to you know what are we doing to create better worker candidates in Ohio again I'll go back to the JOBS Act and I'll mention this briefly I know you guys have heard me talk about the JOBS Act law but what the JOBS Act would do is it would provide real skills training that could are directly applicable to the economy using Pell grants for our low and middle-income students so I actually think this is an amazing option for a lot of people and I think we'll provide and when I talk to employers and I've run through exactly how it would work I get a lot of excitement that's why I work on this so hard frankly is because I'm hearing so much enthusiasm in the community how what I'm talking about it so I'm so I think the JOBS Act would be a big a big help on that front for sure but what you both get at and you're a hundred percent right is the student loan crisis that we have in our country the reality is a lot of people mark are in the same situation that your son or your daughter college-age son that your that your son is dealing with where they're trying to start their lives have done everything right they've gone to high school they're gone to college they're going to graduate they're doing everything that they were told to do everything we said if you do these things you're gonna be just fine in this world it sounds like you found a great person to marry as well um and that's should be the American dream but the reality is because of the rising cost of tuition people can't get out from under the debt they can't they feel like they can't get married they can't buy a house they can't buy a car so they're just saddled with all of this I mean everybody's frustrated by it two things I'll kind of put in here here things that I'm working on so number one the tuition cost is what drives the debt if tuition were lower or weren't quite as high there would be less debt right you take out debt to afford the tuition in the living cost that's where the debt comes from and so to me I think we need to first say okay what's causing the rise in tuition it's pretty clear and the New York Fed just to really released a statement on this or just released a study on this as soon as the federal government took over the student loan the federal student loan program the second that happened and guaranteed all the loans back to the University they no longer had any incentive to keep tuition cost low and so you've seen tuition cost continue to increase year after year after year and I would argue a lot of that is because of the fact that the federal government has taken over those loans and the universities know that and they know that if they keep raising tuition costs it's just going to get back stopped by the federal eventually now that debt sits on your son and daughters your sons and daughters balance sheet but it is guaranteed at the federal level essentially and so part of the thing that I would do that I want to work on is finding a way to get rid of that to get the federal government out of the student loan business I don't see a reason for them to be in it frankly I think they've caused more problems than they've solved and and the incentive structures is totally backwards right now so that's that's number one number two you mentioned another thing that I think is a huge problem in our society so we have all these little marriage penalties built into our system right now where just by getting married and raising a family you combine the incomes you combine the balance sheets all of a sudden people start losing benefits or their costs go up there and all kinds of bad things happen that basically penalized them for doing what is I think the greatest thing in the world which is to marry the person you love and raise a family I think that's the most important thing that we can all do as people in this in this society and so if that's your calling and so we have this system set up where we're penalizing people and it doesn't make any sense and so so we're also looking at what I'm calling marriage penalties all throughout the tax code and throughout the federal government system to try to get rid of those so that we're not saying to people hey if you get married your costs are going up because now you don't qualify for things that you thought you did but maybe to get it to a point where we're actually encouraging couples to do just that to get married to find a love of their life get married have children raise them in a beautiful community and live happy lives and so we're working on on on all of that and then the last point is on the loan servicers I don't know if you met if you're referring to this but the crazy thing is when you take out a federal loan for student loans the servicer you don't even you can't pick your randomly assigned to a servicer somewhere so by the government by the Department of Education your application comes in you now have this servicer you have no choice which is absolutely in say I don't understand why that's the case so that's that John writes how about getting the subcommittee to do something about HR 303 that seems to stall in every Congress since the early 1990s the disabled retirees that earn their full retirement shouldn't have to take a reduced retirement to fund their own darn disability talk with Bill Arrakis from Florida he's addressed this issue for years winner the Republicans going to push back this is enough this at its best so first off thank you for flagging this bill for me I will you have my word I will go talk to Bill Arrakis when we get back next week specifically on it I'll get his thoughts directly we have started looking at it but but frankly I don't have fully articulated thoughts on it right now but as a general rule and I think I think my record shows this I'm somebody who believes that there's literally not not enough we can do for our veterans if you're gonna lay your life on the line for this country and defend it then we need to take care of you and so we will look at this I will talk to Billy raucous directly like I said next week early next week we'll have a more fleshed out answer for you at that point and we'll reach out directly and have your name will so we'll connect but I certainly appreciate you giving me a heads up on this one next question is from Steve please do something about the cost of health care $25,000 a year for health insurance for regular families is near impossible it won't be long before I'll have to cancel my health insurance and hope for the best Steve Amen I'm with you a thousand percent on this so that to me and again it goes back to what I said earlier we are best as a society when we are in a world where people have the opportunity to get married raise children have a good job afford their lifestyle live their version of the American Dream in a community that they love that to me when I think of this country and what my my father came over here for that's what I think about I think about having barbecues on Sundays after church I think about being able to and take care of my family my kids and my grandparent being able to see my my parents and my kids grandparents and just live in that version of the American Dream that to me is what this country is and what I love so much about it and when you have health care costs that are going out 10 20 30 percent a year $25,000 a year for health insurance people can't do that they just can't do it and we have to get this under control and so one of the things that I've taken on if you've been following this videos as I've said look I I know for sure that Medicare for all is a terrible idea for a whole host of reasons number one you can't pay for it maybe that's enough for everybody but for me it would actually bankrupt our rural hospitals if you live in Wayne County the chances are very very good or Medina County but the chances are very very good if you live in Wayne County and if we went to Medicare for all all the hospitals would shut down and and that would happen all across the country because that you just couldn't survive on Medicare rates they need more than just Medicare rates for hospitals to stay open and so the only way you could do it is by either cutting services which is probably what would happen or raising taxes to such a level that that nobody could stomach it I mean you'd have to just soak the middle class with taxes to get to Medicare for all and so I think that's a disaster but that seems to be the number one plan coming out of out of the other side right now what I've said is I'm going to come up with my own plan I want to come with my own plan that has two basic goals bring the cost of health care way down in this country we're way higher than any other country in the world in the developed world there's no real reason for no good reason for it anyway but we need to bring the cost of health care down that we need to expand coverage because if we are sitting here in a world where we have families who again have done everything right have been working hard sending their kids to school who are literally saying well I can't afford this anymore I'm just gonna have to take a chance and hope that I don't get sick in the next year that's a horrible outcome there's no reason for that we don't have to have it that way and and I'll be releasing my plan sometime in the new year and it'll be pretty comprehensive we've been working on for basis I got in the office as you can imagine meeting with all the different players in the healthcare sector and coming up with a plan that that makes sense that takes care of our seniors that gives people choice and options and flexibility and allows you to get the care you want at a low cost it's it's not simple if it works somebody else would have figured it out by now frankly but but I'm working on it and and look forward to presenting my plan and rolling it out here in the near future but great question this one's from Josie are we going to address prescription prices and the cost of health care for seniors so again similar to the last question the plan that I'm putting forward will address both of those issues at a base a comment on prescription drugs just quickly basically in this country where we have generic alternatives our drug prices are actually quite low and are and are okay it's where we do not have generic alternatives and when formularies don't cover the right things and that those costs really spike and so one of the elements of of having a plan that makes sense in my opinion for seniors would be to get more generic alternatives into the market quicker and make sure that there's more competition it's just basic economics right if you have a monopoly you can charge whatever you want if there's a lot of competition guess what all of a sudden the price goes down and so that's that's one of the tenants but again stay tuned for a more robust rollout and discussion on that I think this is our last question so this one's from Leah how are you doing thank you for asking I appreciate the question I'm doing well so personally we haven't really talked about this I don't do many personal updates but my wife is expecting our second baby this one will be a girl and I couldn't be more excited really look or to that so we'll be having her soon and I just couldn't be happier on that front my son's healthy my wife's doing well family's great and and from what I've know that's on the personal side and then from what I've noticed the district's doing well and and I put you know the way that I prioritize my life is I basically say my family you know God comes first my family and those are the two things that you know that you got to be clear on your priorities and that they're always first for me and I got to make sure I do I'm a dad and a husband before I'm a member of Congress and and so I take care of that but then on top of that my work for you I don't have a social life really I don't really do a whole lot on that front but but I spend as much time as humanly possible trying to work on your behalf and and I take it seriously and it truly is an honor and so while this job can certainly be frustrating at times it it couldn't be better in that sense because I get to serve you and it's what I've always wanted to do my whole life so I appreciate the question and thanks everybody for for listening and thanks for your questions and if you didn't get yours answered please please submit it I will get it the next time but just really appreciate everybody have a great weekend and thank you for allowing me to be a representative thank you

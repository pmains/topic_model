i'm your host chip got davis with us and a new voice a new voice one that we've not had on the show before but i am really looking forward to this representative tracy mann representing the first district of kansas representative mann welcome to agritalk chip my david thanks for having me on this morning uh great to hear with you guys i'm glad you're here because i saw i caught your february second speech on the floor of the house about the farm bill yeah and you're i i first first things first i got to say you are absolutely right this is policy that we must get right uh i think farmers know that but what about the other 98 out there how important do they view the farm bill do you think well they're they're not thinking about it yet and that's therein lies a challenge so you know i grew up on a farm and that's what our family has always done my district's the third largest ag producing district in the country so high priority for me and that's why i took to the floor last week to say look everybody you know these farm bills happen every five years the next one expires in 2023 i've been very disappointed with the house ag committee which i serve on the leadership there has not been focusing on production agriculture or this next farm bill but it's time and that's why i'm going to do that regardless and that's why i took the floor and said what i said last week okay um you said that the that the uh the leadership of the house ag committee is not focused on on uh commercial production uh there's more animosity between the the two parties in the the house ed committee that that i can recall from and then ever um is it gonna take an election to fix the situation or we or is there going to be productive talk about the farm bill leading up to it i'm optimistic that there's going to be productive talk we'll see i'm a freshman in my first term so we will see but here's what's at chip you know the farm bill um it's about agriculture but we've got to convey um to the rest of the country and the rest of congress that it's also about freedom because you know a reason america is as free as it is because we've never had to rely on another country for our food supply if we don't get our farm policy right uh there's nothing less than the freedom of our citizens at stake i think covid maybe brought that to the forefront or maybe made people more appreciative or realize that hey if if we don't get production agriculture right in the country we have issues there's going to be big impacts so that's what at stake and that's why i'm talking about it okay so whenever the farm bill uh comes up there's always the conversation about whether it should be evolutionary or revolutionary does the existing bill do existing policies need an overhaul or tweaks yeah great question i envision this farm bill will be evolutionary and not revolutionary okay i think about our farm you know in the 90s freedom of farming that was revolutionary yes i think this will be evolutionary um you know i think things like my top operators are going to be things like protecting crop insurance with no major changes you know some of these programs like crop insurance that are so vital we got to make sure that we protect them and we we prevent those that would want to weaken them that certainly will be a huge and really my number one priority moving forward here okay all right so that's great to know great to know uh you another comment that you made in your your speech on the house floor is that you want to see a bill that invests heavily in agriculture what does that look like yeah i think you know we got to protect crop insurance then we need to amp up programs like the livestock indemnity program and other emergency assistance programs that producers depend on during national disasters you know we have wildfires in kansas this year when we have floods those kind of things we need to have those programs in place and then third for me chip agriculture trade promotion and market access programs uh you know those are good investments we've got to continue to increase our trade around the world to create demand to put upward pressure on all of our ag products and so you're going to see me work to uh to fund those appropriately increase funding because there's a great payback for the american taxpayer and for agriculture on those investments okay uh one year extension of the current policy to push it out to after the elections well well the current farm bill actually expires um 2023 which is next year which is after the election okay so you know it's amazing i feel like we just finished the last one right we're already talking about the next one um but but yeah so so it will be after the next election that said though and this is where my concern is and why i said what i said shift we need this congress this year needs to begin having hearings and really lay the groundwork for this next farm but we can't wait till after the election to start working on it uh now is the time this year to leave us listening to producers um and have a producer driven um farm bill coming up here next year gotcha yes and you're right i have my timing off on that uh thanks for the the correction on that um there's another piece of legislation out there that's gotten a fair amount of attention the next generation fuels act what's your position on that piece of legislation yeah you know i am all for increasing uh our ethanol production our demand for ethanol i am all for increasing or you know providing an increased demand for our commodities sorghum corn uh those types of things we're not really seeing that legislation get much traction yet there's a lot of good things in there there's also some unfunded mandates for gas stations those kind of things so we're continuing to take a look at that okay continuing to take a look at it would suggest to me that you're not supporting it what would it take to get your support for next gen well i'm concerned about the unfunded mandate that we're going to put on our gas stations in rural you know in the rural part of districts like kansas you know we've got you know i think every day about how do we increase demand for ag products but also how do we keep the grocery store going in a lot of our rural communities how do we keep the gas station going an unfunded mandate on them i have a lot of concerns about um and so that's what we continue to look at and see how we can go about solving that very good very good i saw that you had an opinion piece out this morning i have not had a chance to read it yet but i love love love the headline us must hold china accountable that's how deals work you're talking about the phase one trade deal right that's exactly right you know the phase one deal we've now transitioned in into phase two but you look back you know that deal was a two-year deal um china made commitments going into that deal on the num the amount of ag products you're gonna buy they are 16 billion dollars short and we need to provide accountability there you know those are ag products they committed to buying that they didn't the bite administration has not really done anything about it not been talking about it we are raising the flag and trying to raise the awareness of what's going on there um you know we need for china to uh follow through on the commitments that they made to our country in the phase one um part of the agreement boy it would be uh it would be spectacular and you know south america and the lost bushels that were that that are starting to add up down in south america on the bean crop potentially on the corn crop could force china's hand to come back to the us for some of those supplies um talk what is this competes act boy it's uh so so this just came up last week um it's called the competes act which is supposedly going to help us compete with china here's the reality of this bill chip 3000 pages the word coral reef is mentioned more than the word china many of the things in the buildback better bill that did not pass got stuffed into this bill and it'll actually it's 325 billion dollars it'll actually weaken our position with china it makes no sense we need uh to be firm with china we need to have policies in place that in you know that protect our intellectual property uh we need to do some serious things with that country but unfortunately the competes act which i think is really the concedes act um does not do that and i voted against it last week exactly is is this part of the effort to bring back some of the build back better policies yes yep it is and so you know buildback better you know did not pass know that buildback better included 150 new programs what you're going to start seeing and we saw that in the concedes act is part you know some of those programs are going to get stuffed into other pieces of legislation and try to move it forward that way and this is the first example of that that we've seen this year the it's been called dead as a doornail but it's not these these policies in buildback better are going to continue to come up aren't they that's exactly right yeah i know it is not dead um that big big bill and you know that bill if you fund all 150 programs chip over 10 years costs 5.1 trillion dollars 5.1 trillion in 10 years but no there's going to be efforts by those who support the legislation to pull pieces of those programs various ones and put them and tuck them in other forms of legislation and try to jam them through and we're working to try to prevent that well this bill this competes act or concedes act um 350 350 billion dollar price tag and and it's barely gotten mainstream media's attention it used to be a 350 billion dollar bill would be top story on the evening news right it's remarkable um you know we are 30 trillion dollars in debt 30 trillion dollars i think as you look at the rest of this century chip big picture you know our three really threats are number one our debt to china uh and three we've drifted from our basic founding values and those values are still alive and well in our rural communities by and large but we are drifting from a nation and we very quickly need to need to come back and have serious legislation um and those are things i can support but this can seem to i could not and by the way it was 3 000 pages that just got introduced on monday no hearings no uh no republican input and uh and just got jammed through unbelievable unbelievable it's been good to get to know you a little bit i hope we can do this again it sounds good have a great rest of the day thanks a lot excellent that is representative tracy mann first district of kansas davis and i will be right back

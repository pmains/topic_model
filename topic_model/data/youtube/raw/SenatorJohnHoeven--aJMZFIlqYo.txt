we've been covering look at it now 2950 is the price we've been covering the bust in North Dakota's Bakken Shale region all week cheap oil is really slamming the fracking industry there and the state in the local economy as well joining us now is Senator John Hoeven Republican North Dakota Sarah what's it you can't be happy about your state being subject to such boom and bust cycles it reminds me of parts of Texas well no question it's tough right now but you know we have a state that understands commodity cycles I mean we're in Ag state so we understand that commodity prices go up and go down and the same is true with energy which is why we've worked to really diversify our economy but no question when commodity prices are down both egg and energy suffer and that's the case right now did you think we got to recover I guess I'm asking you for a forecast on the price of oil can you see it getting back to a profitable level at within this year like 40 bucks about can you see it well you know we had a eye on the Energy Committee in the Senate we had a hearing with the Department of Energy and their forecast is to get to about 38 to 40 dollars by the end of this year and then approaching fifty dollars by the end of 2017 you're hoping I take it well I think on that you know with that range it's going to be tough for us now but that will work through this pretty well if in fact that's the case I wonder if you join the debate about with whether Apple should unlock that's iphone that belonged to the San Bernardino terrorists that is the argument of the day and Silicon Valley is lining up behind Apple who say no we're not going to unlock it where do you stand on this well look we've got to come up with a solution that balances both privacy and the ability of law enforcement pursuant to a court order to get information that they need so this is a technology issue we should turn to the technology experts to help us solve it and I believe they can do you think that at this moment Apple is putting its own interests and the interests of its customers ahead of the national interest well I understand the focus on privacy we want to protect person privacy that's very important in our country but at the same time we also have to fight terrorism and we you know people have to feel safe and so that's why I say this is something where we need to look for a technology solution that creates that balance between protecting privacy but also again pursuant to a court order and proper procedure that we're able to work with lon 48 to push the issue but absent that technological fix where do you stand force Apple to unlock it or not well again I think your thought you're talking about an absolute and we need to find that balance I you know to say oh look technology got us into this situation Stewart we need to have technology work with us on a solution that creates that balance and I believe it's there got it Stella joven North Dakota thanks for much for joining us sir always appreciate it radio great to be with you thanks to it

  CONSERVATIVE LAWYER TRIED TO  CONVINCE THEN VICE PRESIDENT  PENCE TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THIS AND  MORE NOW WITH DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. HE IS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND SITS  ON THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATING JANUARY 6, THE  JANUARY 6 INSURRECTION. GOOD EVENING TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING. THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT,  CONGRESSMAN. IF DEMOCRATS CAN'T UNITE AROUND  THESE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THESE  BUDGET BILLS, IS THE PARTY AT  RISK OF LOSING OUT ON BIDEN'S  ENTIRE DOMESTIC AGENDA UNTIL AT  LEAST THE 2022 MIDTERMS? >> LOOK, WE CAN'T ACCEPT  ANYTHING SHORT OF PASSING THESE  VITAL BILLS FOR THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK WE WILL, BECAUSE  IT'S JUST THAT IMPORTANT. THE COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS  THIS INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL  INFRASTRUCTURE AND HUMAN  INFRASTRUCTURE, THIS LONG  OVERDUE INVESTMENT IN OUR  PEOPLE. AND WE'D BE CRAZY NOT TO GET IT  DONE. AND WE'D BE CRAZY IN MY VIEW NOT TO DO IT BIG. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING  ABOUT REFORMS OF A MAGNITUDE NOT UNLIKE THE NEW DEAL. AND YOU DON'T GET THOSE  OPPORTUNITIES VERY OFTEN, MAYBE  ONCE IN A GENERATION. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE WE SIMPLY MUST GET  IT DONE, OR BE WILLING TO SAY  OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO TURN OVER  THE KEYS. WE DON'T WANT TO DRIVE ANYMORE. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHERE I AM. >> SO THE ANSWER IS YOU GET IT  DONE, YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE. BUT IF YOU DON'T, YOU THINK YOU  TURN THE KEYS OVER AT THIS  POINT? YOU WOULD BE TURNING THE KEYS  OVER? >> I'M NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT ANY OUTCOME OTHER THAN SUCCESS HERE. >> YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC,  THOUGH. >> LOOK, I AM BEING REALISTIC. I THINK WE WILL GET THIS DONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL  NUMBER WILL BE. BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE I THINK  WHAT WE WILL GET DONE ON BOTH  PHYSICAL AND HUMAN  INFRASTRUCTURE, ALONG WITH THE  RESCUE MAN, IT WILL BE A MAJOR  NEW INVESTMENT IN THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE, AND ONE THAT WE'LL BE  VERY PROUD OF. SO I'M NOT ADMITTING OF ANY  POSSIBILITY OTHER THAN GETTING  THIS DONE. >> I'VE GOT GET YOUR -- I WANT  TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS NEW BOOK  BY BOB WOODWARD AND ROBERT  COSTA. IT'S CALLED "PERIL." THEIR REPORTING SAYS JOHN  EASTMAN WROTE A MEMO TRIED TO  OVERTHROW THE ELECTION BY  THROWING OUT ELECTORS FROM SEVEN STATES. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THIS  MEMO? >> THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD THEY LOST THE ELECTION. AND THIS MEMO, ALONG WITH OTHER  WORK OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS  DESIGNED TO OVERTURN THE CLEAR  RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. THEY JUST DIDN'T CARE. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR  DEMOCRACY ANYMORE. APPARENTLY ALL THAT MATTERS IS  STAYING IN POWER. SO THEY'LL -- THEY'LL PASS VOTER SUPPRESSION LAWS AROUND THE  COUNTRY. THEY'LL STRIP INDEPENDENT  ELECTION OFFICIALS OF THEIR  POWERS AND GIVE THEM TO PARTISAN BOARDS TO HELP THEM SUCCEED  WHERE THEY FAILED TO OVERTURN  THE LAST ELECTION, AND YES,  THEY'LL WRITE MEMOS SAYING HEY,  HERE IS A WAY WE CAN SUBVERT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IF WE CAN  JUST GET THE VICE PRESIDENT TO  IGNORE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. AND THIS INDEED HOW DEMOCRACIES  COME TO AN END. NOT NECESSARILY BY VIOLENT  REVOLUTION. SOMETIMES IT'S BY THESE QUASI  LEGAL MEANS OF THESE EFFORTS TO  SUBVERT THE PLAIN LETTER OF THE  LAW AND COERCE INDIVIDUALS,  WHETHER IT'S THE VICE PRESIDENT  OR THE SECRETARY OF STATE FROM  GEORGIA OR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS  OR LEGISLATORS IN MICHIGAN OR  PENNSYLVANIA OR ARIZONA, AND WE  CAME SO CLOSE TO LOSING OUR  DEMOCRACY, AND WE'RE CLEARLY NOT OUT OF THE WOODS. >> YOU WERE ON THE SELECT  COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING JANUARY  6. DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM  EASTMAN? >> LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO  IDENTIFY SPECIFIC WITNESSES YET, BUT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO  EVERY EFFORT MADE TO SUBVERT THE ELECTION AND HOW IT LED US TO  THAT VIOLENT INSURRECTION ON THE 6th. SO CERTAINLY THOSE THAT WERE  INVOLVED IN TRYING TO GET THE  VICE PRESIDENT TO IGNORE HIS  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES ARE WELL  WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OUR  INVESTIGATION. >> YEAH. MORE NOW REPORTING ON THE BOOK,  THIS ROBERT COSTA AND BOB  WOODWARD. THEY'RE SAYING IN THEIR BOOK  THAT DAYS BEFORE THE  INSURRECTION, THAT STEVE BANNON  AND TRUMP WERE DISCUSSING,  QUOTE, THIS IS A QUOTE, KILLING  THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY IN THE  CRIB, END QUOTE. AND COSTA DESCRIBED THE MOOD IN  THE WHITE HOUSE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ATTACK. HERE IT IS. >> ON JANUARY 5th, THE EVE OF  THE INSURRECTION AND THE RIOT AT THE CAPITOL, WE HAVE THE SCENE  OF PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONLY  PRESSURING VICE PRESIDENT PENCE  IN THE OVAL OFFICE, BUT THEN  OPENING THE DOOR TO HAVE THE  COLD AIR COME INTO THE OVAL  OFFICE, TALKING TO HIS AIDES,  SAYING CAN YOU HEAR MY  SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE? TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE AS HE  HEARS THEM OUT IN THE STREETS ON A COLD ALMOST FREEZING NIGHT,  HOURS BEFORE THE RALLY THAT  ULTIMATELY LED TO THE RIOT. >> WHAT DOES THAT REVEAL TO YOU? YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO HAVE  HAPPEN? >> CLEARLY, THEY WANTED TO  PRESSURE THE VICE PRESIDENT TO  IGNORE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES AND ESSENTIALLY DECERTIFY THE  ELECTION OR TURN AWAY THE  LEGITIMATE ELECTORS FROM A  PARTICULAR STATE AND THROW US  INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. AND THE PRESIDENT WAS USING  THREATENING MEANS, WHATEVER  MEANS HE COULD. AND THE FOLLOWING DAY, WE SAW,  REALLY, THE ULTIMATE STEP MEANT  TO INTERFERE WITH THE PEACEFUL  TRANSFER OF POWER. THAT WAS A VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE CONGRESS, ON THE CAPITOL. SO THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS  WILLING TO USE ANY MEANS,  INCLUDING THE VIOLENCE WE SAW  JANUARY 6 TO OVERCOME THE WILL  OF THE PEOPLE AND STAY IN POWER. >> SO, LISTEN, YOU WANT THIS NOT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. SO TODAY YOU INTRODUCED YOUR NEW LEGISLATION CALLED THE  PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY ACT. IT PROPOSES WAYS TO PREVENT  PRESIDENTIAL POWER FROM BEING  EXPLOITED. AND WHEN WE SAW HOW EXECUTIVE  NORMS WERE ABUSED UNDER TRUMP,  HOW FAR DOES THIS BILL GO IN  STOPPING THAT FROM HAPPENING  AGAIN? >> WELL, IT'S A BILL VERY MUCH  LIKE THE SWEEPING POST WATERGATE REFORMS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO  ADDRESS THE ABUSES OF THE NIXON  ADMINISTRATION. HERE WE ATTACK THE  POLITICIZATION OF THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT, THE WAY THE FORMER  PRESIDENT USED IT AS HIS PRIVATE LAW FIRM AND USED IT TO GO AFTER HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES. WE PROTECT WHISTLE-BLOWERS. WE PROTECT INSPECTOR GENERALS  FROM BEING FIRED EXCEPT FOR GOOD CAUSE. WE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT A  PRESIDENT WHO COMMITS CRIMES CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE TOLD THE STATUTE OF  LIMITATIONS SO THEY DON'T ESCAPE JUSTICE BY STAYING IN OFFICE. WE GIVE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS  TO THE HATCH ACT SO THAT A  PRESIDENT CAN'T USE THE FEDERAL  WORKFORCE AS HIS CAMPAIGN  MANPOWER. WE ALSO PROVIDE A WAY TO ENFORCE THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE SO THAT  THE PRESIDENT CAN'T ENRICH  THEMSELVES BY HAVING GULF  NATIONS RENT HOTEL ROOMS AND NOT EVEN OCCUPY THEM AS A WAY OF  CURRYING FAVOR, AND ABOUT A  DOZEN OTHER REFORMS THAT WERE  NECESSITATED BY WHAT WE SAW IN  THE LAST FOUR YEARS. SO IT'S A SWEEPING PACKAGE, ONE  OF THE MOST SWEEPING I THINK  REFORM PACKAGES IN HISTORY. BUT CLEARLY NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY GOING FORWARD. >> REPRESENTATIVE SCHIFF, THANK  YOU VERY MUCH. YOU GUYS HAVE YO

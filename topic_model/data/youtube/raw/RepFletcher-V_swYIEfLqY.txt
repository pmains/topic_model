madam speaker i rise in support of the right to contraception act as an original co-sponsor i thank representative manning for her leadership and her co-leads craig jacobs and williams on this important bill which responds to the very real threats to access to reproductive health care and bodily autonomy that we face today we saw this threat in justice thomas's concurring opinion in the dobbs case suggesting the landmark case of griswold versus connecticut which gave married couples the right to use birth control should be revisited and overturned and we see these threats from some in this body and in legislatures across the country we certainly see it in texas we also see that this effort does not represent the desires of the vast majority of people i represent who rely on contraception of all kinds every single day and have for more than 50 years yet we see these efforts to block women from accessing contraception that works for them including iuds once again i am proud to protect the health privacy dignity and autonomy of women and families across this country by voting yes on this bill and i urge my colleagues to do the same thank you and i yield back

Republicans have raised some serious questions about president Trump's proposed steel and aluminum tariffs and now his top economic adviser Gary Cohen has decided to leave the White House apparently in reaction to the president's trade plans to discuss what this all could mean for the country as well as for the administration we welcome now Republican senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson coming today from the capital senator thank you very much for joining us appreciate your doing it good morning first of all start with those basic question what do you think the right answer is and then I think everyone agrees that some countries including China are don't always play fair when it comes to trade but a lot of people are also concerned that we will give back whatever gains we were gonna get in growth from the tax cuts through a trade war what's the right answer well the president said he enjoys conflict markets don't like conflict investors don't like conflict markets like stability and certainty so to investors and so I'm highly concerned with this administration's move that could spark a trade war and you know the president claims that we can win a trade war I'm not sure anybody does there'd be an awful lot of collateral damage so there's no doubt about the fact that you know China has a massive over capacity of steel that is a problem globally but from my standpoint I think they're looking to walk the wrong metric I would much rather export 2.3 trillion dollars from America and tolerated a half a trillion dollar trade deficit than have balanced trade or maybe even a surplus and only export a trillion dollars I I think trading activity is good for the global economy for the American economy for the American worker as well so I'm highly concerned about this administration's steps are taking on tariffs to what extent senator do you have hope that in fact the administration might rethink or really president Trump rethink and really do this in a more tailored or surgical way our colleague Kevin's really right now has been interviewing Wilbur Ross the secretary Commerce and secretary Ross is saying that we're trying to do a surgical approach and particularly is talking about Canada and Mexico and concerns about what might happen with Canada and Mexico who of course are part of NAFTA do you have hopes that actually the president might change his mind on this well when I interviewed Wilbur Ross prior to confirmation that's exactly the approach he was taking is recognizing which we there are trade abuses that need to be addressed and in Chinese is the primary problem with intellectual property theft industrial espionage as well so we need to target that they're over capacity but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater here let's recognize Canada is a valued ally there's no national security risk in us importing certain types of steel from Canada so I'm hoping that this administration tailors this specifically to address the real abusers and hold harmless our allies and our trading partners the the fact that we are the world's largest customer the world's largest market the last time I checked in the private sector suppliers really treat their customers well that's a very effective foreign policy tool we have going for us having reasonably open markets for the rest of the world it's the center addressed that point which is a very powerful point when this first came out these tariffs on steel and aluminum one of the points we made including and frankly to secretary Ross was we don't import much steel or a lunar from China at all it's something like three percent of steel seven percent of aluminum we report far more from Canada from Brazil from Mexico places like that why are we going to war with Canada and Mexico and Brazil when many people agree that China really is the bigger problem let's hope we're not going to war with them well the reasons around this program is to provide advice to the president please don't do this target the real abuses and let's hold harmless and let's strengthen our relationship with our strong allies it's gonna be better for American for American workers for Wisconsin workers I point out the president in Wisconsin we actually have a trade surplus with both Canada and Mexico we need to conclude enough to deal I would love to see us re-engage in terms of TPP I don't want to be having America left out of 40 percent of the world's market place so again I'd take a different attitude hopefully this president will will listen to the markets listen to members of Congress that have real concerns about what he's talking about in terms of trade war so the senator beyond the bully pulpit that you have with your fellow senators and for that matter the Congress how much power direct influence do you have over this process I mean the president wants to go forward under Section two three to the Nationals provision of the Trade Act can you stop him can you change him or basically do you just have a consultative role well first of all the Defense Ministry in United States only uses 3 percent of America's steel capacity so I think Vance a pretty difficult argument to make that this is really national security concern and then our our largest supplier of steel comes from Canada so again a reliable partner but unfortunately Congress's in this dates back literally centuries have given away their constitutional authority to the President on trade I think I think Congress has ceded way too much authority to the president maybe it's time we start to demanding that in passing laws to get that authority back those powers back have we come to that point senator do you think that there's enough sentiment about capital goes who's here a lot particularly as I said from Republicans really concerned about the effects of this on the growth pattern for United States on jobs back here and our economy is there enough sentiment up there actually to take action and take back some of as you call the constitutional authority yeah I'm not quite sure you know unfortunately free trade has not been politically popular was in the last election it probably isn't now I'm hoping the American public takes a look at the markets reaction to this type of trade rhetoric and maybe we can come to our senses here but you know for my standpoint I think we have ceded far too much authority when it comes to trade and tariffs to the president I completely agree we need one negotiator but as in this is the case in trade agreements trade treaties Congress should have a say we should be approving these types of moves not just give the president unilateral authority okay senator thank you very much for your time very very helpful and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin joining us from Capitol Hill

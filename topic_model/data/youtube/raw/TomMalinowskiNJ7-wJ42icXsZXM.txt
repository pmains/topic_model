AND NATO IF THEY GET INVOLVED. JOINING US NOW NEW JERSEY CONGRESSMAN AND MEMBER OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE TONGASS MAN TOM MALINOWSKI. HE WAS ON THE GROUND IN UKRAINE JUST LAST MONTH. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. >> THANK YOU. DAN: A LOT A PEOPLE WAKING UP TODAY REALIZING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION WONDERING WHAT IS THE END GAME. WHAT DOES VLADIMIR PUTIN WANT AND WHY? >> PUTIN WANTS TO DISTINGUISH UKRAINE AS AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY. HE IS THREATENED BY THEIR DEMOCRACY. HE'S THREATENED THAT THEY ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE. HE'S THREATENED BY THE IDEA OF A FREE PEOPLE WHO CAN OVERTHROW A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS WHAT THE UKRAINIANS IT DID A FEW YEARS AGO AND HE IS DETERMINED TO KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO END IT AND I THINK IN THE SHORT RUN HE MAY SUCCEED. IN THE LONG RUN HE WILL FAIL. DAN: THIS IS UNFOLDING FOR THE WORLD TO SEE, EVERY BOMB THAT IS DROPPED CAN BE PUT ON VIDEO, BUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND YET HE'S IS STILL MOVING FORWARD. WE KNOW YOU HAVE CALLED FOR SANCTIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE EARLIER BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID COULD HAVE SLOWED THIS DOWN. DO YOU THINK ANYTHING COULD REALLY STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING AND WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION? >> I THINK WE COULD'VE DONE MORE EARLIER, BUT TO BE HONEST I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE DISSUADE PUTIN FROM DOING THIS CRAZY AND EVIL THING. HE WAS DETERMINED TO DO IT AND SO THE PURPOSE OF SANCTIONS RIGHT NOW IS NOT TO DETER HIM IT'S TO WEAKEN HIM. IT'S TO HURT HIM. IT'S TO UNDERMINE HIS REGIME IN RUSSIA AND WE HAVE TO BE PATIENT WITH THIS. SANCTIONS MOVE SLOWER THAN TANKS. YOU WILL SEE TANKS ROLLING INTO KYIV TODAY, MAYBE TOMORROW. IT'S GOING TO BE DRAMATIC. THE SQUEEZE ON RUSSIA'S ECONOMY WILL TAKE LONGER, BUT IT WILL BE INCREDIBLY CRIPPLING TO THE PUTIN GOVERNMENT AND TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AND THE UKRAINIANS WILL KEEP FIGHTING EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR CAPITAL. THERE WILL BE A GIRL A WAR WITHOUT THEIR COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH TO STAGE THOSE ATTACKS. PUTIN THINKS THAT IF HE CAN DECAPITATE THE GOVERNMENT, IT WILL BE OVER. THAT WILL ONLY BE THE BEGINNING. SO, I THINK HE'S WALKING INTO A TRAP THAT WILL BE VERY BAD FOR HIM IN THE LONG RUN. BIANCA: I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE SANCTIONS MEANT TO BE A DETERRENCE OBVIOUSLY MEANT FOR PUTIN TO BECOME A PARIAH, BUT OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T CARE. DO YOU SEE THE ESCALATION INVOLVING US TROOPS? I KNOW US TROOPS MOVED TOWARDS EUROPEAN ALLIES, DO YOU SEE DIRECT ESCALATION WHERE TROOPS ARE INVOLVED ON THE GROUND? >> THAT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION, BUT NO, I DON'T SEE THAT. VALUE UKRAINIANS EXPLICITLY SAID THEY DON'T WANT AMERICANS FIGHTING FOR THEM. THEY SAID WE WILL FIGHT TO DEFEND OUR OWN COUNTRY. THEY WANT ARMS AND AMMUNITION, INTELLIGENCE AND THEY WANT US TO PUNISH THE RUSSIANS WITH ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, BUT I'M CONFIDENT THESE PEOPLE WILL FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY. WE HAVE MOVED TROOPS TO NATO ALLIES BORDERING UKRAINE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO PUTIN THAT YOU DON'T ATTACK A NATO ALLY OR ELSE YOU WILL BE DIRECTLY CONFRONTING US TROOPS AND PUTIN DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT EITHER, SO I'M CONFIDENT AS DANGEROUS AND AS HORRIBLE AS THIS IS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED IT THAT WAY. WE SHOULDN'T, BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HASN'T REALLY HAPPENED SINCE WORLD WAR II. A GREAT POWER LIKE RUSSIA TRYING TO CHANGE INTERNATIONAL BORDERS BY FORCE, THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN TRYING TO PREVENT IN THE WORLD FOR DECADES AND IS A FIGHT THAT WE ARE IN WITH ALL OF OUR ALLIES ON OUR SIDE. BIANCA: WHAT IS THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AS THIS PLAYS OUT? WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING HERE? >> THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO I I THINK IS GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE THE UKRAINIANS ARE GOING TO RESIST. OF THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO BE FRUSTRATED. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY QUICK VICTORY. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT AND I FEAR THAT'S WHEN THE ATROCITIES BEGAN. I FEAR THAT THAT'S WHEN WE WILL SEE A LOT OF CIVILIANS GETTING KILLED IN REPRISALS AND BOMBINGS AND IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO WATCH. DAN: CONGRESSMAN, WE KNOW THERE ARE REPORTS THAT POTENTIALLY RUSSIA COULD TRY TO MOVE FURTHER THAN THIS POSSIBLY POLAND OR EVEN FURTHER. DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING AND AT THAT POINT WOULD YOU THINK US TROOPS COULD BE INVOLVED? >> RUSSIA HAS NEVER ATTACKED A NATO MEMBER, NEVER THEY DON'T WANT A DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY WOULD ULTIMATELY LOSE THAT. THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT BIDEN WOULD-- WITH FULL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HAS REINFORCED THOSE COUNTRIES AND SENT US TROOPS TO THOSE COUNTRIES TO MAKE CLEAR TO PUTIN THAT IT'S A LINE HE CANNOT AND MUST NOT CROSS, SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT A DETERRENCE WILL WORK IN TERMS OF PROTECTING NATO ALLIES. THIS IS WHY UKRAINE WANTED TO JOIN NATO BECAUSE RUSSIANS HAVE NEVER DARED ATTACKED A NATO COUNTRY SO THAT LINE WILL HOLD. MEANWHILE, PUTIN'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO TERRIBLE THINGS IN UKRAINE, AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP THE UKRAINIANS FIGHT, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO DO THE FIGHTING. BIANCA: A THANK YOU.

Attending the US Service
Academies is a privilege reserved for the best and
brightest young men and women across the country.
That's why I'm proud to host Academy Training Day
at West Virginia University. Middle school
and high school students from across West Virginia
get to connect with academy representatives,
participate in team building exercises,
experience the fitness standards required in the
service academies, and learn about the qualities
it takes to be a successful leader in the
military. At West Point, when we
look for exceptional candidates, we're looking
for someone with great academic ability, great
physical ability, and they have that leadership
potential that we can really grow at West Point. Taking advantage of
leadership opportunities, either in their school or
in their community. Those are a couple of the main
things that I look for with the with the
applicants. I wish I had attended an
event like this one I was going into apply just to
be able to compare and contrast different
academies and understand what you're looking for. I
think it also puts things into perspective when it
comes to just physical fitness and those
requirements needed to get into an academy to get a
congressional nomination. Okay, how am I going to do
on my SAT scores? How am I going to do for
physically, maybe I can't do eight pull ups now. But
you know, if you start practicing, you start
okay, this is my goal. If you're a high school
student interested in attending a US service
academy, I encourage you to apply for a nomination
on my website www.manchin.senate.gov or
call my office at 304-342-5855. Again, thank
you for answering our nation's call to service.

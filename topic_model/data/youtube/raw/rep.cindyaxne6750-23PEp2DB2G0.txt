five minutes Thank You chairman and ranking member and thank you for holding the subcommittee and of course - mr. Smith again it's an was an honor to introduce you and I appreciate the great work you've done we've had plenty of conversations and I thank you for the conversation we had about holding capital to make sure that we could help farmers in need I appreciate that I'm glad you're here today to inform us you know as well as I do it's been a really tough year not just in Iowa but farmers across the Midwest in the country with low commodity prices of course the trade war that was just mentioned we've harmed our export markets devastating weather and flooding has occurred and recently the propane shortage that's preventing farmers in Iowa from drying their harvest so I've heard it time and time again I visit every county every month all 16 whether I'm there or sitting in my office in Des Moines folks are coming and say they just don't know if they're going to be able to hold out much longer so I have serious concerns about the debt that we're seeing farm debt is projected to hit four hundred sixteen billion dollars this year unfortunately the 19 billion dollars of farm debt that Iowans have is the highest in the nation and this level of debt absolutely has consequences the farm Bureau reports that farm bankruptcies rose 24 percent compared to a year ago and a recent study from Iowa State University classifies 44 percent of Iowa farms is financially vulnerable and I'm really grateful that you're here I'm glad for the good work that you do to make sure that the Farm Credit System is safe and sound however you noted in your testimony that the farmers who are at the most grist our farmers who are dealing with major crop losses and especially corn and soybean farmers like yourself and other Iowans those are my constituents of course and I'm concerned about the stress they're facing so a little clarification in your written testimony mr. Smith you stated that the FCA encourages system lenders to work with borrowers to help navigate current financial conditions without jeopardizing long-term viability of borrower or the system institution and I think identifying and working with farmers that are financially stressed is critically important and I'm glad that the FCA is encouraging that can you describe to us though what that assistance looks like I'd like a little more detail Thank You congressman axe axe knee the the loan the actual loan decisions and and the risk that are assuming is up to the individual associations at FCA we can offer guidance and but the actual decision is up to the associations but you recall when there are natural disasters like the flooding and I think we met for the first time last May to talk about the flooding that was the western part of your district and how catastrophic that was to farmers in that area no different from wildfires hurricanes other natural disasters that we've had in other areas of the country and what we can do is through guidelines encourage those in associations and we have as as the regulator we have a lot of influence we can encourage those regulators to be proactive in working with those farmers to come up with a plan and for the best possible solution you've heard of foreclosures being up percentage-wise and in percentages the numbers aren't alarming but the percentage increases our foreclosure should be a last resort I mean it's just a tremendously trying terrible thing for a rural family to go through and so by exerting our influence through these guidelines hopefully those associations will will hang in there and maybe step up efforts outreach finance efforts to those troubled families but mainly encourage the association is to be proactive and working out a plan okay if you have an opportunity to provide us any more information down the road what those associations might be doing specifically I'd really appreciate that next I just want to ask you real quick I recently read an article in The Wall Street Journal that outlined how some farmers in the Midwest are turning to alternative lenders due to mounting financial stress and one such lender has noted their volume has grown over 40% in the last three years while in some cases these loans can provide what is essential lifelines I'm concerned that these farmers are borrowing at unsustainable high interest rates and based on your knowledge and expertise or anyone here have you seen an increase in farmers going outside of traditional banks are the FCS for loans yes unfortunately we have and I described them as maybe payday lenders because of some of the interest rates have been charged over half of prevailing rates right now I feel we've got a good balance the system is about at 41% I think is less than 1% same market shares what the commercial banks are so so we've got good alternatives out there between commercial banks and and the system FSA comes in there may be at a lower level FSA should be the lender of last resort unfortunately isn't always and and these operators are looking to alternative sources as they have no choice it's deeply concerning it's deeply concerning the security interests that these alternative lenders are taking that mites might have an influence impact on long-term lending that the banks in the system might be holding as well so yes and answer your question we're seeing an increase and it is a concern thank you

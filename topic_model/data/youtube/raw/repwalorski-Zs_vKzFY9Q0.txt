lady mr. filarsky to inquire Thank You mr. chairman and thanks to all of you for being here I just want to kind of echo the words I'm excited and very optimistic about what we can do together is a bipartisan team in making sure and addressing things that affect every single American and I am obviously at the helm of a large manufacturing district with a lot of folks that are double income households in this country mr. Biggs that this was already mentioned but I just wanted to ask you a couple of follow-up questions on the fact that employees are more likely to save for retirement if their employer offers a retirement plan can you describe any existing barriers that even per that we could help with that may discourage employers from offering a retirement plan to their employees what's standing in the what stands in the way there are a number of barriers and they're they're particularly salient for small businesses there's a fixed cost to setting up a retirement plan you have to be a plan administrator you have to financial advisor you have to consult lawyers if you're a large firm that's no problem you do it once if you're a small firm that cost is large relative to your employees increasingly today there is a legal liability in the sense there's more lawsuits against 401k providers against them against employers we're offering them that is something which I think would scare in particular small businesses who say I don't want to I don't want to take that risk so those are the real fears I have and it explains why it's a coverage a bigger problem among small employers than then among big firms the vast majority of big firms already offer a plan what about would it help with multiple employer with the MEPS would it actually help addressing address that existing coverage gaps plan was designed to to go at exactly those issues in the sense if it spreads that fixed cost along many small employers it helps them all put their employees in a plan so you know we don't know yet how large the responses will be there is still the legal liability issue sure that's designed to to address exactly that problem mr. Crandall anything you would care to add on that when it comes to you know things that even that we could identify and help with in your position anything that really exists as barriers that may be we haven't covered again I want I want to highlight particularly the safe harbor provision for lifetime income annuities we think that is very very important the fiduciary obligation that exists is very difficult in fact only one very large firm has actually kind of dealt with that so I would I would very much highlight I would highlight that provision and then I just have a follow-up mr. Biggs as you know all workers are saving for retirement by their participation in Social Security different Americans are in different financial circumstances at different points in their lives many young people expect to earn higher amounts as they age and therefore might want to spend more money currently additionally they have savings needs other than retirement such as education purchasing a house starting a family is it necessarily a public policy problem requiring government intervention that beyond Social Security some young people are not saving in retirement accounts this is precisely why they hear a statistic of so and so percent of Americans have not saved anything for retirement it is it's it's a meaningless statistic what textbook economics or financial planning says is low income people if you're in the bottom quarter of the population you get a high replacement rate from Social Security you probably shouldn't save for retirement likewise young people this is textbook stuff they usually don't start saving for retirement until their 30s because their incomes are low they've got college loans to pay off they might want to build up a down payment for a home so the idea that 100 percent of people should be sit here in retirement at 100 at the time is just not corrected thank you thank you mr. Chairman I yield back thank you Miss polarski with that let me recognize the gentleman from

thank you very much secretary becerra thank you for being here uh i want to touch on a few different topics today first i would like to commend the administration for prioritizing vaccine equity and the distribution of vaccines into our underserved communities as a doctor and public health expert vaccinating my constituents in underserved communities i can say firsthand that president biden's federal retail pharmacy program mobile clinics and direct vaccine allocation to fqhcs are effective however we still have a ways to go in reaching a national herd immunity and i'm concerned by reports that vaccine rates are plateauing while around 50 percent of americans still need to be vaccinated and with underserved communities still having low vaccination rates in fact the desert sun newspaper reported this week after analyzing california hhs and census bureau data that vaccine rates are still significantly higher in the white older wealthier zip codes in my district by up to 30 percent compared to poorer younger minority communities while some of that could be because older people were first to get the vaccine older individuals in underserved communities still lagged behind and all ages have been eligible since mid-april secretary becerra since we have reached the plateau and vaccination rates has there been a shift in the administration efforts and methods around reaching the individuals that have not yet been vaccinated to address barriers like time language and transportation restraints congress great to see you and the answer is absolutely yes there have been changes made in fact later this week i will be going to a rural community in california uh where there will be a small vaccination clinic targeting folks who are the most underserved and the most difficult to reach in some of our rural areas thank you i think that's very very critical to partner with local communities and taking the vaccines to the people and i applaud your efforts in doing that so now pivoting to an issue that this committee worked on prior to the pandemic which is surprise billing my republican colleague dr buchan and i worked with several of our colleagues in a bipartisan manner to craft a solution that would first and foremost protect the patient from surprise medical bills and to create a solution that is fair to both providers and insurers which included a baseball style arbitrator independent dispute resolution process that this committee and congress adopted and so i would like to ask you some questions regarding the implementation of the law so first regarding the idr process i urge the administration not to weigh any one factor to be considered by the arbitrator more heavily than the others the legislation signed into law represents a balanced approach that treats providers and insurers equally and does not favor one party over another i'm concerned that if any of the factors are weighed more heavily than the others it will tilt the balance resulting in an unfair system that will unintentionally lead to a benchmark rate which runs counter to congressional intent second it is my understanding that hhs is meeting with stakeholders and requesting their input i appreciate the administration soliciting feedback i strongly urge you to move forward with a proposed rule that includes a full public comment period so that the process is transparent and all stakeholders have an opportunity to comment to provide feedback mr secretary have you made a decision on the rulemaking process and whether it will include public comment congressman thanks for all the questions we're going to make sure that people have an opportunity to know what's going on with these we'll kind of try to move them as quickly as we uh reasonably can what i will tell you is this uh paramount will be making sure that the patient is not doesn't get in the mix of the the any fight that may exist we're not going to weigh any side more than another and we're going to make sure that we launch these committees as quickly as possible that'll help us make these decisions because everything you've said is accurate thank you very much and for my final question i'd like to ask about an issue near and dear to me advance appropriations for the indian health service as you know ihs is severely underfunded and continuously struggles financially which hurts patients access and care so mr secretary can you talk about the benefits of advance appropriations and how it will help the ihs better serve our tribal communities our tribal communities as you know congressmen have been underfunded severely underfunded for too many years president biden has now made a major commitment to restore some of that funding but he's also made the commitment that uh indian country has been asking for for a long time and that is that they be treated when it comes to health weight we treat every other aspect of health care for all other communities and that is that they have predictability in their funding moving forward and that's why the advanced appropriation is so critical and that's our with your help we'll get that done thank you very much mr secretary i yield back my time

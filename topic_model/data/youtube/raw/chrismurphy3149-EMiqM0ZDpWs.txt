imagine coming home from war injured in battle and being told you can't get care from the VA when I got out of the military I was struggling with depression I needed a lot of mental health services I felt as though I was kind of just left out in the dark every veteran deserves care after I talked with vets like Shane I wrote a new law and worked with Republicans to end this unconscionable practice since that bill passed by Senator Murphy it has dramatically changed my life around for the better [Music]

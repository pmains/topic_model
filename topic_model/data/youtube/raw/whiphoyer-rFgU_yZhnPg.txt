welcome back we're following the constantly moving developments today in Capitol Hill is our nation is careening toward a government shutdown tomorrow night basically it's a quarterly event these days leaders on both sides of the aisle have been talking all day trying to figure out how to avoid this so joining me now is one of them he's number two Democrat in the House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland he's in all sorts of gangs on various things so and I know you're involved in a lot of these back-channel negotiations let me start with the basics here are you gonna help Republicans pass their continuing resolution are you gonna help whip votes for them on this or not no we're not Chuck okay we've been kicking the can down the road too often in September all 183 Democrats that voted voted to extend for 90 days the government funding so that we could negotiate and reach agreements that time was wasted we didn't get there agree with Franklin mark Meadows who said it's now all this does is kick the can down the road one more time so the Republicans are in charge they have the majority they have enough votes if they'd want to simply not agree and have agreements with us and they can move on their own and that's what they've chosen to do is there any scenario where you'll help Republicans do this the five day shutdown scenario if they needed votes look we're we're in the place where we have been asking for a hundred and twenty days to get agreement to get agreement on the caps so we know how much money we're going to spend in 2018 we're a third of the way into 2018 we still don't know what the expenditure level is going to be we want to see the chip bill pass with other health extenders as well including the community health centers they're they're a hole and they need to be considered as a whole we want to see a disaster relief pass that's not in there so is there a way yes there is a way to sit down and reach agreements compromise but Paul Ryan has all this year decided to go his own way in a partisan way and fine nothing we can do about that but if you're going to do that you got to do it with your votes what are you going to tell your constituents though many of whom our federal government workers you you're you've a district not far from the Canadians capital a lot of federal federal workers yeah so 30 days what should what's wrong with waiting another 30 days I could argue politically congressman that actually Democrats have more leverage in 30 days the debt ceiling daka's expiration is is suddenly a lot closer and the burden suddenly and we know Republicans can't raise the debt ceiling on their own I'm not going to vote against raising the debt ceiling raising the debt ceiling is extraordinary or not raising it has extraordinary right consequences the Republicans have irresponsibly vote is that on a regular basis I have no intention of voting against that but I want to responsibly move forward frankly you say well you could be better able to get agreement we've been asking for agreements and an agreement we've asked for is the one that Ryan entered into for the last four years and that is equal increases in spending for domestic and none and and defense spending that's what he put forward that's what he agreed to with senator Murray that's all we're asking for if he does that maybe we could move forward if he gives us some ability to make sure the dreamers are safe maybe we can move forward if he does something on the healthcare side with chip and the community health centers and other health extenders maybe we can move forward but there has been no movement on those for 120 days what makes us think that another 16 20 days is going to make a difference frankly we haven't seen the light at the end of the tunnel it's my understanding you were in the meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and chief of staff John Kelly I was give me your version of events there seems to be the president says that John Kelly's words aren't what it was reported what can you what can you tell us about what happened in that meeting well I think the president was wrong in terms of John Kelly's words I think that were reported accurately the president is inclined to deny words that he says much less what anybody else said minutes after they're said so that I think that's simply not credible I think general Kelly came into the meeting I thought it was a positive step for him to take to ask to meet with the Hispanic Caucus go through border security and have and hear from the Hispanic Caucus how important it was to do what 86% of America thinks we ought to do and that is make sure the dreamers stay in the only country that they really know America I think that was positive right there's another specific that had in there according to the Washington Examiner apparently Kelly also told you guys in that meaning that he's willing to sign a deal that doesn't include the family migration issue that basically punts the quote chained the so called chain migration debate to later did you hear that I don't know that he I don't want to say that because I don't remember him saying that specifically I don't think that that's accurate it was made clear to him however that family reunification was an important American principle and that it was not to be negotiated away and what was his reaction to that was that something he was he didn't have much of a reaction other than to say look we think that's an issue that needs to be discussed all right you're in this group of number two's Jessica Karthi dick Durbin John Cornyn let me ask you this why not if the president wants funding for 700 miles more offense in exchange for daca why how is that not like a doable deal just straight up there look we don't think the wall works we don't think it's a good economic investment and as a matter of fact general Kelley did in fact make comments on that where he said it may not be the wall that makes us secure maybe some other things but he clearly made it he made it clear that the president was not talking about 2,000 miles of wall he was talking maybe 700 miles of wall of the response to that of course is let's get a study from the Department of Homeland Security and experts as to what is in fact needed I think I think we certainly can agree to that that would be I think a positive movement way forward so that the price take a good well it may not be but then maybe it's too much for us and as you pointed out the legislative process is compromised so we may have to take something and he may have to take something now the one thing Chuck I want to make a point is I was also at the White House meeting with the president in my view 24 members of the Congress actually 25 and members of Congress said we want to take care of the daca protected individuals 25 there was nobody said no to that so that's not a question of a deal that's a question that the president agreed to that and everybody they were all agreed to it let's agree to it let's put it in paper and pass it and make it happen well I think Lindsey Graham is looking for Tuesday Trump just like you are anyway congressman Steny Hoyer thank you sir I know you're gonna go back to more meetings let us know what happens what happens when two billionaires play a game of musical chairs at the governor's mansion I'm a spider

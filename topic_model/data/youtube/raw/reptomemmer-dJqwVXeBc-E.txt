Republican congressman and whip Tom emmer of Minnesota is joining us now good morning Congressman I guess the first big question is what is Kevin McCarthy going in there expecting to happen during this meeting with President Biden today well it's great to be with you Caitlin I I think first off you correctly set where the parties were probably a week ago where the president saying there would be no negotiation and McCarthy's saying look we've got to be able to talk about reasonable stuff sensible stuff responsible stuff when it comes to what we're going to do with the debt ceiling I think today is a great sign I think today shows you uh when the president is inviting Kevin McCarthy down that the negotiations are beginning and that's a good thing but they're not going to reach in any kind of agreement today you think oh this is a this is going to be a process and and I'm sorry I gave it the no I doubt there's going to be any agreement this is a get to know you I would say meeting where they're going to sit down and talk about uh their Mutual goals uh their concerns I think Kevin McCarthy will reassure the president there will be no default he will reassure the president that Social Security uh in Medicare are off the table that's not going to be discussed but certainly as he I expect he will tell the president as he's told others uh over the last few weeks you can't tell the American people there is no waste in our spending uh government spending that we shouldn't be looking at so I think it'll be a good first meeting Caitlyn where the two uh the two leaders will sit down and have a good conversation which hopefully as we proceed will lead to uh some type of resolution that's in the best interest of the American people if social security and Medicare are off the table as you just said where do Republicans want to cut spending that's going to be part of the dance the uh it's it's you talk about cut spending how about spending reforms I think people are going to have to look at how this budget is built over the next 10-year period and talk about where those efficiencies are where the waste is the things that can be done from a uh a legislative standpoint and with the White House to make sure that the budget that we're doing going forward is responsible it's reasonable uh and it's sensible for the American people so that we're not mortgaging our children grandchildren's future Congressman you've said Republicans will not impact defense spending you said we aren't cutting defense we assured appropriators and asked our house armed services committee that's not what we're do what we're doing are you saying there will be no cuts to defense spending actually I think this has been a discussion amongst all of our members uh the White House tried to come out and say that's what was going to happen again everybody's going to be looking at efficiencies everybody's going to look at bringing these different budgets into the 21st century Caitlyn I everything's on the table in terms of scrutinizing what we're spending on why we're spending it can we spend better can we spend more efficiently I think that's the discussion that's going to start today and it's going to take some time uh with both sides having negotiations as to where we go to make sure at the end of the day this isn't a Republican or Democrat issue this is what's good for this country and future generations of Americans well it sounds like defense spending is on the table then even if there is an agreement that is reached down the road between Kevin McCarthy and President Biden you're the whip are you confident that you can get your divided group of Republicans to vote for that deal first off I want to make it very clear from the Republican side we are going to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the equipment the tools that are necessary for them to accomplish their mission here at home and around the globe that is the primary goal of what Republicans will do with our counterparts in the white house and on the other side of the aisle as far as Republicans in the house we have 222 members Caitlyn the great thing about that is every voice matters and yes I'm very confident that as a team we will work together to make sure that not only are our members representing the people who elected them because that's first that's the primary thing that they have to do but second that they're able to advance the agenda that the American people voted for when they elected a new Republican majority in the U.S House of Representatives last November

Clyburn now democrat from south carolina assistant Democratic leader is well good to see you sir thank you for your time thank you so much for having me Greg let's start with your general reaction to the Supreme Court's decision this morning what was a very disappointing decision it was not a surprising one to me I think that we are beginning to see with each one of these Supreme Court decisions exactly what the answer the president Trump question was before the election when he asked especially the black community what do you have to lose well we find out now exactly what we have to lose and one of them is our good neighbor policy that we've practiced as a country for a long time as you know I grew up in the positive and one of the things I learned was being a neighbor is not defined by church membership or ethnicity it is design by whoever can show compassion for one that is in need and this to me is not a good naval decision on the part of the Supreme Court your colleague congresswoman Maxine Waters continues to face a fair amount of criticism for calling on people to harass Trump administration officials in public democrats congressman they democrats appear to be backed into a corner bit here if you if you speak out too forcefully you're labeled uncivil if you don't you're called spineless how do you go about capturing legitimate opposition what's going to be the strategy for your party heading into the midterms well my opposition to this administration has to do with this policy and some of its practices not its rhetoric I don't pay a whole lot of attention to the president's rhetoric and everybody is free in my opinion to practice their own we have heard president Trump talk about people in very disparaging tones even several weeks ago much now he talked about low IQ Maxine he had some of his supporters that talked about her hairstyle in very derogatory ways now they are speaking to their base Maxine is speaking to her base and so as far as I'm concerned one is no more credible than the other congressman you've never know you're never engaged in name calling and vilifying that's never been your style no it's not as I said to a group of young people this morning I was taught at an early age that the best sign of a good education is good manners and I try to practice a good sign of a good education in what I do whereas I interact with people but my way of doing it is what I think is required and expected by my base supporters and other people do what they think is required by their base of voters I would never say anything or the things that Trump says about people I would never say that even in private I would say so he speaks his base Maxine speaks to her base I'm not going to take ownership of what Trump says or what Maxine water says I'm only gonna be responsible of how I deal with my fellow man and how I express myself in public places President Trump as you know was in our home state last night is in South Carolina not far from your district in fact district the borders yours this is what he said about this is what he said about Democratic Party this has become the party of Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi that's how it is [Applause] is that true congressman are they the face of the Democratic Party this is the party of Jim Clyburn this is the party of Jim Smith and Mandy Norrell they're in South Carolina we have a big tip party and I'm pleased to be a part of it this father is not defined but in one or two people this party is fine about the broad brush of the American people people who are basically good people as elected to the Tocqueville told us years ago the greatness of America is built upon the goodness of Americans and if Americans failed to be good this country will failed to be great who's the leader who is a leader of the Democratic Party though well we have a lot of people and that's a Pelosi is the leader of the House Democrats Sumba is a leader of the Senate Democrats we have other leaders in our party they're all based upon with what entity you miss be speaking of but Schumer's got nothing to do with House Democrats or very little and same thing with Nancy with Senate Democrats we are defined by the roles that we play and we are responsible for our own reactions and interactions with our constituents that's why I'm standing here in front of Will Rogers the party which is not an organized party we're Democrats really quickly the president just mentioned in his back and forth with reporters congressman he talked about Georgetown steel and I know that that your district like a lot of districts it's kind of carved out a little weirdly is that is Georgetown steel in your district no it's not a touchdown Steelers in Georgetown which was in my district until 10 years ago that's how could you Congressman Jim Clyburn congressman always a pleasure sir thank you

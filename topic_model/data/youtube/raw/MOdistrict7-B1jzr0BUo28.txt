colleague from Texas for yielding to me every day federal agencies spent money advertising various programs without mentioning where the funding for these programs or their ads are coming from the Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis famously said sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants the taxpayer transparency Act is about shining the light on how taxpayer dollars are spent by requiring executive branch agencies to disclose that these advertisements are paid for at taxpayer expense simply this bill extends similar requirements already imposed on the house and the Senate to the executive branch it is time for government to start working for the people again by providing more transparency and they're spending executive branch agencies will have to answer to the people Americans have every right to know exactly how their tax dollars are being spent as members of Congress we should all support an open and honest government and this legislation does that by requiring the executive branch agencies to be transparent with spending taxpayer dollars which promote federal programs I urge the house to support this bill and look forward to further action by our colleagues in the Senate I yield back and

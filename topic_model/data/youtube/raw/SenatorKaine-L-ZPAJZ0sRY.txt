WORLD OF WHAT COURAGE LOOKS  LIKE. LET'S BRING IN DEMOCRATIC  SENATOR TIM KAINE OF VIRGINIA. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN  RELATIONS COMMITTEE. I WILL DEFER TO YOU. I'M SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BE  MORE ARTICULATE THAN ME WHEN  TALKING ABOUT HOW PREPOSTEROUS  IT IS THAT A LACKEY OF IRANIAN  STATE MEDIA IS LECTURING THE  CAPTAIN OF THE USA MEN'S SOCCER  TEAM. >> WELL, YEAH, HE COULD LECTURE  THE U.S. TEAM DURING BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS, THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT WENT OUT AND MOWED  DOWN ALL THE PROTESTERS. INSTEAD, MANY OFFICIALS IN THE  U.S. GOVERNMENT, LIKE SENATORS  AND HOUSE MEMBERS, JOINED IN  PEACEFUL PROTESTS. THE DIFFERENCE IS, A SOCIETY  ALLOWS PEACEFUL PROTEST AND  LEARNS FROM IT TO PROGRESS AND  ONE THAT RUTHLESSLY SUPPRESSES  IT. YOU KNOW THIS. WE ARE SEEING IT ALL AROUND THE  WORLD, THESE AUTHORITARIANS THAT THINK THEY CAN JUST DICTATE  TERMS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. IN CHINA, THEY ARE FINDING THEY  CAN'T. IN IRAN, THEY ARE FINDING THEY  CAN'T. AND RUSSIA, PUTIN IS FINDING  THAT HE CAN'T JUST TAKE OVER  PROPERTY IN ATHTHER COUNTRY AND  HAVE IT GO HIS WAY. AUTHORITARIANS ARE LEARNING SOME PAINFUL LESSONS BECAUSE REGULAR  EVERYDAY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO  STAND UP. THAT SHOULD MAKE US ALL FEEL  VERY, VERY PROUD. >> IN LIGHT OF THE PROTESTS IN  CHINA, SO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE  ABOUT MAYBE SOME SORT OF A  RENEWED APPROACH TOWARD A  RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA. HOW DO THESE PROTESTS PLAY INTO  THAT? AND ALSO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. >> WELL, YOU ARE RIGHT, THE  GLOBAL ECONOMY, YOU KNOW,  WOBBLES WHEN CHINA'S UNCERTAINTY IS OUT THERE. NEVERTHELESS, YOU HAVE TO STAND  FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. IF THERE'S AN ECONOMIC COST T  INSTABILITY, BUT IT'S DRIVE B B  PEOPLE STAING UP FOR  THEMSELVES, THEN WE HAVE TO  STAND WITH THEM. THE WAR IN UKRAINE OBVIOUSLY,  RUSSIA'S ILLEGAL INVASION, IS  CREATING ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. BUT WE HAVE TO STAND WITH  UKRAINE'S PRO-DEMOCRATIC FORCES  EVEN WHEN THERE'S ECONOMIC  CHALLENGES. WHAT ABOUT MORE COOPERATION WITH CHINA? THIS IS A TOUGH, TOUGH WORLD, AS YOU KNOW. SO OFTEN, YOU HAVE A NATION  THAT'S AT ONCE A TRADING PARTNER AND A COOPERATOR IN SOME WAYS  AND A COMPETITOR IN OTHERS AND  AN ADVERSARY IN OTHERS. YOU HAVE TO MANAGE ALL THAT AT  ONCE. I HOPE WE MIGHT CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO WORK WITH CHINA ON  THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR  HUMANIRIAN RELIEF. IF WE CAN DO THINGS TOGETHER TO  AVERT HUNGER IN PARTS OF THE  WORLD THAT ARE AFFECTED BY  DROUGHT OR THAT ARE HIT HARD BY  DECLINING FOOD EXPORTS OUT OF  UKRAINE, THEN WE SHOULD TRY TO  DO THAT. IT'S HARD TO BALANCE ALL THOSE  THINGS AT ONCE, I ADMIT. >> SENATOR, GOOD MORNING. WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT GUN  VIOLENCE THAT'S TAKING PLACE  INSIDE YOUR STATE IN THE LAST  COUPLE OF WEEKS. TWO HORRIFIC INCIDENTS WITHIN  THE SPACE OF A COUPLE OF DAYS. THE SIX PEOPLE KILLED IN A  WALMART. BEFORE THAT, THE THREE  UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FOOTBALL  PLAYERS KILLED BY A FORMER  TEAMMATE. THERE IS SOME TALK IN THIS LAME  DUCK SESSION OF ATTEMPTING AT  LEAST AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN ON  AR-STYLE WEAPONS THAT HAVE BEEN  USED IN SO MANYASASS SHOOTINGS. IS THE ANY HOPE? IS IT FOLLY TO TNK THAT CAN GO THROUGH? IF NOT, WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY? >> WILLIE, FIRST, IT'S ALMOST  PTSD. I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS TOO  LONG. I WAS THE MAYOR OF RICHMOND WHEN IT WAS SECOND HIGHEST HOMICIDE  CITY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE BROUGHT IT DOWN. I WAS THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA  WHEN THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT  VIRGINIA TECH. I HATE SEEING THESE HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN IN VIRGINIA AND  ELSEWHERE. I SUPPORT AN ASSAULT WEAPONS  BAN. IUPUPPORT SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD EVEN BE MORE EFFECTIVE,  WHICH IS A BAN ON HIGH-CAPACITY  MAGAZINES. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THE  VOTES RIGHT NOW IN THE SENATE  FOR . I HOPE WE WILL PUT IT UP FOR A  VOTE. LET'S HAVE PEOPLE DECLARE WHERE  THEY ARE ON THIS. HERE IS WHAT I'M SORT OF FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW. IN THE SHOOTINGS AT VIRGINIA AND IN COLORADO SPRINGS, AND IN  CHESAPEAKE, IN EACH INSTANCE,  THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS THAT  LIKELY WERE MISSED. PEOPLE SAW THINGS BUT THEY  WEREN'T SURE HOW TO RESPOND TO  THEM. SO OFTEN IN SHOOTINGS LEE THIS, THAT IS A FACTOR. I THINK WE MAYBE NEE TO DIG  INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND  EQUIP EMPLOYERS BUT EVERYDAY  CITIZENS, TO TRY TO HELP  SOMEBODY IF YOU SEE THEM SORT OF GOING OFF THE RAILS. VIRGINIA AND COLORADO HAVE  EXTREME RISK PROTECTION ORDER,  RED FLAG LAWS. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THEY ARE  BEING IMPLEMENTED IN AN  INCONSISTENT WAY DEPENDING UPON  WHICH COUNTY SOMEBODY LIVES IN. IF A COLORADO SHERIFF SAYS I'M A SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY, IT  DOESN'T GET ENFORCED. THE NEXT COUNTY OVER, IT DOES. WE DID A LITTLE OF THAT WORK IN  THE GUN BILL THAT WE PASSED IN  CONGRESS A FEW MONTHS AGO. WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THESE LS  AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CONSISTENTLY  ENFORCED. >> DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TIM KAINE  OF VIRGINIA,

[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman bill Foxtrot I'd like to welcome you to the latest edition up to the point the political landscape in Washington has changed with new faces filing into the Capitol a new president occupying the White House and new challenges to Congress to tackle the atmosphere in Washington is changing we're looking to the future leaders uncertain of what the next few years will bring but certain that for my guests it will bring opportunities to contribute in major ways Josh Scott himer we're honored to have you here he's a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and the newest member of New Jersey's congressional delegation congratulations Josh again thanks Phil district five fifth District of New Jersey which is a neighboring district through my district the ninth district represents parts of Burton County including Hackensack and Paramus as well as the large swaths of Sussex and Warren and even northern Passaic County before being elected Josh spend time with Microsoft and Ford so it understands the private sector very very well and with the Federal Communications Commission you were there for two years josh has also authored a few books including ripples of hope great American Civil Rights speeches I have not read it I must confess but I will but we only sold one copy so it's okay so thank you for being here today thanks for having me bill Josh how you doing you've been here for six seven months but you look better than the president of the United States who's been here six or seven one so uh what do you attribute the fact that you look so optimistic and jolly this morning was I'm sitting well first I'm sitting with you my favorite people in Washington thank you and you know as a quick aside I just want to say that you know part of what's made my experience so far so great is is actually having good people to mentor me and what I've realized how important that is because you know getting settled in it's a steep learning learning curve in the beginning there's a lot to know a lot of procedures on the House floor yeah and making sure that you always keep an eye on the most important thing was back home in your constituents and taking care of folks and fighting for the people you represent and you know that that's been something that I've been very lucky to have a great mentor he's sitting a few inches from me and to remind me about what's most important all the time and also had this place operates so when I died when I got here when I got was elected in 1996 and she's like twenty-eight thousand years ago when I got here uh the first thing that I came into my mind and I was consumed adjusted I want your reaction to this and compare it to your first impressions yeah it's one thing to look at it's another thing when you're in there you know was that I'm glad I was the mayor of my city of Paterson New Jersey it groomed me it kept my feet on the ground boots on the ground and I was ready for war well if if need be when you're a mayor you got to be ready for anything you can't hide around that under any desk and I'm glad I had that past experience also in the state legislature in Jersey you didn't have that kind of experience but do you do you see that that's important or you substituted something else in your experience a couple things I think it had a real impact on me one working for President Clinton when I worked in government understand the importance of actually working together right and being willing to work across the aisle to move the ball forward right what president always taught us was you know don't worry you know there are a lot of great ideas out there don't worry if they're yours I'm just worried if they're good and then everyone will get credit and I thought that was a very important I think that was one of great strength and then they and by the way always stand up wait that means you got to stand off your principles when you believe in but there are times where you're not going to get everything you want and that's okay because it's more important to move forward and the second thing you know in business you also just those similar principles I've sat around a lot of tables I did a lot of you know we're either buying a company or looking at starting a new product and you start really far apart with everyone around the table you're not necessarily on the same page but you got to work it and be willing to you're gonna get 80% of what you want you're not always gonna get the full loaf and both those experiences taught me a lot in terms of what I what I'm hoping to bring in Washington now and and the other thing that I find really surprising and I'm sure you probably found this too is people if you make the effort people actually get along really well your colleagues on both sides of the aisle are there's plenty of good people but it takes effort right you're not just give you if you're just sitting you're simply donation for you right right but I mean right if you got a developer let relationships really matter right right and I know you have a lot of relate in 1996 and 98 Gingrich said a few times in so many different words mr. president you were irrelevant yeah and mr. cotton and Congress folks on the other side you're irrelevant he had to eat those words he had to make a deal with the President of the United States he had to reach out to the President of the United States and to Democrats in the very people he brought to office in 1994 with the very people that turned on Newt Gingrich his own flesh and blood turned on him the Democrats didn't chase defeating Gingrich out then Republicans chased him out right and I remember I was on the floor the last day he gave his speech and they turned on him for many reasons justified not justified and he gave them a tongue lashing and I'll never forget that day and when he walked out of that speech I happen to me in the hall but there was only nine or ten people on the floor at the time I walked out he could never remember my name so he called me mayor you know what's a mayor hey Mary I said you know what these are the very people you ain't you just gave it one of the these kinds of things what did you learn from Clinton besides what you just said I mean I learned there's so many things I learned I mean learn the importance of he better than anybody got that all politics is local right and and you know he will believe it was you know except that I completely believe what and what do you mean by that I mean that I know what I'm yeah I mean that at the end of the day you have a job here you're a representative and you have to write you and that that's a very specific job you're hired for versus other jobs in government and means you no one else represents this group of people who you know that in your communities and it's their points of view that you have to bring to Washington and that means that by the way it's not always going to align with everybody else who's in your party right and that's a very that's a really important distinction right cuz there's issues that matter I was thinking last night I was there were amendments that we were voting on late last night against transportation remember right and I'm thinking how these other members of Congress introducing legislation that are gonna hurt railroads and country and trains that get back and forth and Amtrak and thinking that I would never like how could you do that right and so I go pull up the the members map and I'm looking at their hometown and their area okay they have no trains they don't care you're right that's right that's a huge competent but but I'm saying to myself how could you even think about that for us when I know it's so important very it's essential when I was elected to the United States through the New Jersey Legislature I made a promise to myself and the staff that came on board that we're gonna find out about the forms of South Jersey and looked at me and I said what is this guy crazy I said if I'm expecting them to know the problems of transit in North Jersey exactly and how it affects our lives how it affects the economy I have affects me going to work you know if I want them to understand that not very different Josh than a Montana rancher knowing about New Jersey trend not not not different really in in in in the overall picture here right then I want them to know about what I'm doing what my folks are doing and what my folks are into because I may be able to influence vote somewhere down the line right I went to the Congress the same way and I know that you are too you have a vast district it's a big area bigger a whole part of North North Bergen yes okay then you go swing over to Sussex County I mean you know yeah it's my more much more rural the open world of West Virginia almost for crying out a little place beautiful Warren County in between same thing beautiful beautiful northern County yeah so you gone from the hustle and bustle of Hackensack yes and you're going right into the I mean vastly different issues right right I mean a few issues that are the same I don't care where you go people tell me their taxes are too high I'm not where I go it's expensive to live in New Jersey they want to make things more affordable right they're worried about their housing part you know how surprised doesn t able to sell their homes to worry about jobs they'll get a job right mean things that we all deal with right and and that's that's consistent and here these folks out in the western part of your district who have very different kinds of needs yes then the folks in Hackensack yes or Paramus okay but there are some common things as you as you've talked about and the further you get away from the hustle and bustle of our bigger towns the more you get to folks who don't want the government involved in anything the further you stay away from me the better off I'm going to be the better off my community gonna be until hurricane Harvey hits and then we want the government right how do you bridge that gap I think it's a great question I math I think there are clearly roles for the government important roles for the governor to play and take something that you spend an enormous amount of time on firefighting right and first responders law enforcement making sure that our communities are safe protected against right criminals against terrorists making sure that we we we keep that right what's great about our towns whether you're in Warren County or you're in Patterson wherever you are what's great about our towns is that they're beautiful places and they're great schools and you've got to keep them and the and keeping you know making sure that Paramus and Hackettstown are safe is critical and why it's a reason why people want to be there right and and so that it's interesting so when you to your point when people bring up government in the role of government I always say well you want to make sure that streets are paved right because that's really important you gotta get around yeah we want that so that's a very important function of government you want to get to work on time you want to make sure that our commuters say if your schools are good those are all world that our water is clean to drink right those are all places where government I hope we all want clean water right you think but by the way that takes but meantime a lot of our schools there's you know and there's LED in the water right and and I got young kids like I worry a lot about that and so do a lot of parents I'm shocked by the number of people who came to this Congress in the last particular since 2010 that really minimized the role of government now I know the less government the better government but the fact is that the government is part of our lives the point is we control the government in a democracy much more so than we do in a dictatorship how to keep that balance is you know important sometimes we go too far this way ever got too far the other way which is you know the natural beast but the point is that we try to control it within democratic principles yeah I think it's that's exactly right I think it's smart sensible government right appropriate government and and that's how I look at it right there places where I'm I believe in the private sector I believe that the market drives our country the market people work in the private sector small businesses bigger businesses that's where people in our country work right and and that's very important that we have a prosperous private sector but also you also you have to Bala to make sure that there are there's good government to and so I believe in the kind of the middle I think ending on the pendulum swings one way or the other too far we should get it back so the extremes of both parties I generally believe you're a bit dubious about well no I just believe as my dad always said to me is it I've got all good things in moderation yeah and I think that's right I think all the confusion oh that was my dad came after Confucius Oh buddy was but it's true right I mean they say what have you changed your mind about in terms of the government should not be involved in this why are we even talking about this has anything like that happened since you got it in seven months and no but I think I had a perception this gets back to where we started I know what you think about this but that it was much more contentious within the issues are contentious that the it's much more contentious within that that it was much more than just within the people we're gonna do I don't actually find that I find that people are much are willing to engage with different points of view are willing they're willing to engage the question is how do we do more and I'm sure you have plenty of thoughts on this because you've been around longer I had how do we get people more settings for people to actually talk to each other because I think we could find more common ground if we if we actually had more sensible conversations that weren't just us screaming or people screaming on television at each other or sending out Nastia grams you know how do you get people to to cooperate and because you think about it the caucuses are separate right you have your meetings they're separate meetings besides orientation is a freshman there's not much time where you're actually together unless you go on a coding delegation overseas somewhere to Afghanistan or Iraq together where the words for its bipartisan otherwise there's not Allison Israel on a bipartisan trip yeah but but otherwise there aren't a lot of venues for and unless unless you join something I joined we should have a universal caucus once in a while don't you think they're low how do you what have you so have you seen that change over time or it's always been this way I think with when I came in you know Genrich was the speaker and I you know and I knew I knew about what had happened four years previous five years previous and he took a long time to get to that position he studied he studied the Turks and the generals and how they got to where they were doing you know what they were doing use those tactics and you know the the Gingrich revolution I happened but there there was a real divisive miss that I would say was worse than than it even is now was worse in public or on the fly within the colleagues both in both and I would say that Gingrich that's why they turned on him I think there were I think that we're looking at hey we got the majorities you know we got Clinton where we want him he's always gonna be all by himself like they thought they had President Obama right and they went after him what vengeance and yet they had to reach out to him to get a budget passed and we had three years of balanced budget we haven't done that and done that for 33 years before that and we haven't done it since that's quite obvious we can't even put a budget together at this point right and I don't think it's because of our device of this so much I think this is the leftover from the Gingrich realm I think we're gonna go into an age of an age of cooperation within the next ten years that's what I believe that's what that's where we're heading you joined a group within the Congress the problem solvers I think that's a pretty cool thing I wasn't impressed by the name but that's unimportant and you guys have been sitting down and talking about health care one of the things we've been talking about yes and you think you've reached over and the Democrats Republicans who go to these meetings I know many of them you know good people charlie den pennsylvania to me he's a Republican that could be thinking about money for president he has a disposition that was a good guy person good at heart that doesn't mean have to agree with him on everything but that's not what we're talking about now and I've seen what you come up with what's your Excuse a quick capsule of what's happened in this experience the problem solvers I know you want to change the name I got it so the the caucus is it's 43 members of Congress roughly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans we meet most weeks that were in Washington in fact we got a meeting tomorrow morning and we are be interested to get their take on what just happened the deal there yesterday yeah Trump that John a a president made with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer that would be in with the other guys in room to get the response man I wouldn't wish that was a bug in that right now all listen to that stuff yeah I don't think Republican leadership's too happy right now I don't think so either I've talked to them no but I mean that's the question well will the president start to reach out to Democrats more on some of these issues like tax reform like infrastructure which is you know agree is critical the Gateway project another how about that which is right this is very very important to get that going and we've spent a lot so we've hooked on Tax Forum infrastructure and we we picked up healthcare we weren't ever gonna touch healthcare it's it has been the third rail this entire I've been completely partisan one-sided throughout this Congress and as you know for four years now seven years it's been the Republican trying to kill the ACA and and then and we were looked at in his last month's how bad it got there was no reach out outreach at all a lot of us ceilings by the way of the Congress were precipitated by those fights over health care of course I mean they didn't do anything I bring up the example back at eight that 12 years ago yeah when we passed a plan D for prescription drugs and I voted no I told my seniors I was gonna vote no how you're gonna vote no because this is gonna help us nice and there's a partier between the $2,200 and $5,200 were you're having paying premiums are not getting any benefits the doughnut hole and I said which by the way would have been blown back open on what they passed through Congress that's correct right I mean part of what part of what we've what we feared and what we've been so bad for New Jersey was you know I talked about if if the House bill would would cost an average of every family in New Jersey because of what the dollars lost to the state that's $4,000 tax and create family in the state of New Jersey seniors kicked out of the nursing homes no right to stabilize in the marketplace so what we what we said was well we're not gonna settle the problem said we're not gonna do a whole bill for health care but what you have is an immediate problem right now the market the individual marketplace is falling apart because the administration has deciding month by month whether or not to make these these payments they're called cost-sharing payment signs of anxiety yeah yes because months well what happens is viewer an insurance company and you're trying to provide coverage and you don't know if you're gonna get this cost cost-sharing help for those who are the you know the patients with the most health care issues to help you help you with those people you don't get that premiums up 15 to 20 percent new jersey riding across the country exhaust mine so right let me ask you this question on you do you think you can save the ACA by bringing about some cooperation with folks or not in your party I think well yeah I think that this is just a slow strangulation of the ACA and going to accomplish what the Republicans have tried to do what the president's tried to do to repeal it and put a new bill in well the the bill that they it's a great question the bill that they pass in the house is untenable completely and we saw that with John McCain in the Senate realizing that there's no you can't do this it's it's not like draconian but it's you're just gonna wipe all these people out who deserve coverage people pre-existing conditions right you you and other Americans who rely on this so the question is can if you don't pass legislation my fear is that its death by a thousand cuts right they'll just try to they'll just try to not make these payments of the state's premiums will go up 15 20 percent as they are the choices will disappear in the individual marketplace and then on top of that which is as I'm free to agree on top of that they're they've said we're not gonna actually inform and educate people anymore about their choices right we're cutting off all those programs so you can actually my fear is you kill it without even having to pass legislation what we've proposed in a bipartisan way we passed this 43 members of Congress passed this together and said hold on what if we actually we got to we got we can't let this go we can't let this fall apart let's stabilize it let's actually make these payments let's make these payments that we have to make let's do reinsurance this game's decided that yeah no no so so we in the house this week there are hearings in the Senate Lamar Alexander and patty Murray bipartisan hearings in khong in the Senate over there on this piece that we proposed very similar governor's Hagen looper and Kasich also have proposed with I think seven other governor's a very similar plan to deal with stabilizing the marketplace getting things back under control getting premiums down for people right this is one area bill where I actually think we can make some progress and if we do it's a home run come back over to us I don't know I don't know if it happens but you have to try and that's my feeling overall you got a try right and I'm glad you've got a feeling in an attitude that you know this is not gonna be a one-shot deal that you're gonna do everything you can to perpetuate this to move this on not only to healthcare but to other issues but healthcare being primary of course right now yes we have two colors as if if we don't do something they it will my fear is it will die and they will and millions of Americans including so many people in New Jersey that people will represent will be without coverage without health care right and that that is unacceptable both of us you uh took over for defeated the gentleman who had been a congressman here for several years several terms and I remember the first thing that you and I talked about when you were running for office I really didn't know you early on I think I was seeing your office I remember yeah I see their phones your phones kept ringing there were three phones and all I said I said to you I I hope that you will understand as I came to understand and maybe that's because I was a mayor I don't know I had something there was that your constituents come first servicing them because we think all the action is down in Washington DC and we forget many times our constituents they have social security problems yeah they have veterans and veterans problems they have old age problems you know that there are problems when you get older like myself we got problems and the fact of the matter is to your congressman he or she may be down in Washington thinking about all these grandiose and esoteric plans for the saving of the world and you can't even save your own neighborhood correct and and I think you understand that I watched you are you've been into the districts that folks are not used to seeing the congressman even the person who lived there wasn't around your into Warren County Sussex County Northern Bergen County top top of the state county and I think that goes a long ways may not be romantic and it may not be sexy because the sexy thing is having your front page picture and you know that you're at this issue when you're with that issue you say you know just gonna save the world issue but people have problems I are you so I never forget worker I know I will never forget we've got caseworkers I'll never forget this you said you've said many things that are very wise that I've adopted one you said to me it's like you said make sure you read every local paper because what matters is what goes on locally in every town we've been to all 79 towns already in my first six by the first six months all 79 towns in my district a lot of towns to cover but cuz we want and we set up tables everywhere so you got a social security issue you got a veteran issue I frankly you got a pothole like I do potholes right you got a problem you got on your street call me I'll call the mayor too and say hey can we do something about this let me help good let me help out because you said to me that's at the end of the day that's what we can do that's the most hands-on and effective and what people that's how people relate to government it's not just that you know we've got to worry about protecting people which is critical which is why you do so much also with for law enforcement and first responders but at the end of the day we got to also make sure that all the things that are on their mind that we look out for them hey Josh I really appreciate the a come on today we had no break okay no commercial because this is important for people to hear we wish you the best of luck thanks doc

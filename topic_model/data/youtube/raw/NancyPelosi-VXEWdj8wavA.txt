good morning today is world aids day as I'm sure you are aware and throughout the world people are reflecting upon the progress that has been made in the fight against aids and of course a commitment to doing much more to make it history instead of part of our future and today for me it's a SS San Franciscan in particular I particularly want to acknowledge that this is the 20th anniversary of the aids memorial grove in San Francisco if you haven't been there you should go it's a site of remembrance well it's a place that many of us and many people from around the world have come to weed the garden to create a grove to to cry to remember and to look to the future the source of comfort to families I've who lost their loved ones to hiv/aids it's a place of community where we've had events with pink umbrellas and red ribbons and you name it to to call attention to all that needs to be done in the future but also to remember those we have lost when I first came to Congress my first day I was sworn in they told me you don't make any speeches and the speaker said where the gentlelady from California was to address the house but I was told I wasn't supposed to speak and if I did not to speak long so the one thought that I conveyed was that I was here to fight hiv/aids of our city had taken a big big bite of that wormy Apple and on the plus side been the source of many community-based suggestions that we turn into legislation in terms of care prevention and research other things followed through it housing opportunities for people with hiv/aids again but much of the care prevention and treatment of care prevention research capturing the Ryan White Care Act community-based solutions are very pleased to work with President Bush on PEPFAR which has saved many many lives throughout the world and I was very very pleased with President Obama's statement this morning the new target of helping 6 million people around the world get the treatment by the end of 2013 it's a goal something we have to strive for I'm also glad that he talked this morning about increasing the funding Ryan White Care by sitting dollars and the adap the AIDS drug program by 35 million dollars one really important point to make now is that emphasis more appropriately as in not only prevention which is very important but early intervention and two decades ago our office was instrumental in saying that people with HIV should be eligible for Medicaid not just until it became full-blown AIDS so now now and that was important in our country throughout the world that's the focus now to sustain the quality of life of people until there's a cure and hopefully that will be soon so it's an emotional day it's a day where public policy has made a difference where Democrats and Republicans have an opportunity to work together with many in the out on the outside LeBron 0 for one who has made a tremendous difference raising the visibility of not only the challenge but some solutions to it

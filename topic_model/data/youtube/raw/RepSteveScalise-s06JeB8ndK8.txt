new report shows the bind administration is spending 60 million dollars a week to house unaccompanied minors that will be 300 per child per day well alex hogan rejoins us she's at the border you went along with the border patrol and i think you came across some unaccompanied children tell us what happened that's right so as we went along with border patrol it was the late hours of the night into the early hours of this morning and we got to speak with border patrol as well as migrants well some of the agents say that they've seen this difference between policy and perception that migrants tell them they believe the biden administration will let them into the country and they're sending that message back to others that they know in their home countries but this is a dangerous journey and border patrol agents have recently found bodies of people who have not made it they've also found children unaccompanied children some as young as two or three years old we had not too far from here we found a young boy that died of exposure from heat exhaustion eight years old and he had a little pokemon built on and you see that and you relate to your own kids house republican whip steve scalise led a delegation of 10 members to the southern border for this tour the group hearing the harrowing stories from border patrol of interactions with a cartel recent rescues and the resources needed scalise sharing his message calling for the biden administration to reinstate former president trump's policies that would require migrants remain in mexico while seeking asylum so again we did speak with many of the migrants last night some of whom were surprised but relieved that they finally had made it meanwhile right now we will be joining that delegation with the texas department of public safety on a boat tour to get the perception of what they are seeing in this immigration challenge last month alone 172 thousand people were stopped trying to cross the border that was up 71 percent from february of this year stewart alex hogan thank you very much indeed uh for the benefit of our viewers i'm going to repeat that number there were more than 172 000 apprehensions on the southern border in the month of march up 71 just from february let's bring in the sheriff of pineal county arizona mark lam border crossings are up the blind administration blames trump what do you say to that i say that's ridiculous i can't believe that they would blame president trump i mean they did their best they could to undermine him for four years and now they want to blame him the fact is the numbers don't support that the numbers show that during president trump's administration we saw a decrease in the amount of people trying to cross this country with the exception of 2019 when that migration of people came up and they were thwarted that could have been much worse had it not been for president trump's policies so the fact of the matter is it's just not true so my message is stop blaming president trump and do your job that's what i don't want to hear the blame game nor does america we want you to do your job sheriff your county is what 50 or 60 miles north of the actual border i suspect that you see a lot of the migrants coming through your county would you say that you're being overwhelmed oh absolutely we're being overwhelmed the people that come into my county they're running from us in pursuits uh they're bailing out into the deserts and into communities we just had one yesterday where they bailed out jumped in over the fences into some communities and the people that come in here are dressed in camouflage clothes they're wearing a carpet shoes like this to mask themselves uh so that we can't find their tracks and so that we can't hear them they've got camouflage backpacks full of drugs like methamphetamines and fentanyl they're littering my desert with these kind of things i don't like that where's the sierra club now to talk about what they're doing to our deserts the fact of the matter is we have got a major problem it is a crisis it is extending 60 70 miles into our border and it doesn't stop there stuart the problem is is this is going throughout america which is why we as sheriffs issued a letter to president biden yesterday that was done by sheriff tom hodgson out of bristol county massachusetts saying that we need them to to honor their oath to protect the people look i've expressed a very strong opinion this morning i'm saying that the democrats do not want to stop the flow because they see these migrants as future democrat voters now look i'm taking that's an extreme opinion you with me yes or no i'm no i'm with you and i think that they their their rhetoric and their talk even before the election was very undermining to the rule of law and law enforcement and this is just another effort to undermine the rule of law they are willfully not enforcing immigration law now we don't get that opportunity you know we have a job and that's our job is to go enforce the law what they need to do is stop being lazy if you want to change immigration law go to congress go to senate make those changes until then you we're going to continue to enforce the law we as sheriffs we're being overwhelmed but you know what we're holding the line we're going to continue to do what we can i'm rallying sheriffs from across the country uh through protect america now and you can check that out at protectamericanow.com and we want to make sure that the people know that the sheriffs are still on their side and fighting this for them sheriff lamb again thanks for joining us sir we will see you again thank you yes sir

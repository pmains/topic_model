joining me now to discuss that and more is the highest-ranking woman in American politics Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi it's always a treat to talk to you thank you so much good morning to leader Pelosi I have to get your comments on these attacks on a member of your caucus Frederica Wilson including this morning what is going on here why what is what do you think of it well as you know the president is the deflector in chief we would like to talk about what he's doing to the middle class yes in terms of his tax bill he wants to deflect the conversation from that let me say though on this Sunday morning how sad we are about the four young men who lost their lives in Niger Brian black Dustin right of course the David Johnson and Jeremiah Johnson and our thoughts and prayers go to their families and let me say about Fredrika Frederica is just a wonderful person so for the attack to be on anyone and appropriately is wrong but Fredrika has had this five thousand models robot excellent role models of excellence of which the sergeant Lee David Johnson was one she was close to him as he was growing up since the kidnapping of the girls by Boko Haram every Wednesday she has a stressed in red or holding red signs photographic we're not forgetting our girls she's really dedicated and devoted to young people and for them to mischaracterize her is really so sad it sad and and it it really they went beyond the subject whether there was one thing about the David Johnson that was so sad enough but then to mischaracterize her speech at the dedication of an FBI building when they had it all wrong so let me just give the general the benefit of the doubt that somebody in the White House is grossly misinforming him about who congresswoman Frederica Wilson is do you think of it Jon Keller should apologize to congresswoman Wilson but I think that he he has to admit that what he did was and correct in terms of the speech that he's careful mischaracterized he's lost his son my heart goes out to him he's a patriot I don't I but I just think he was either misinformed or accepted something without checking about Fredrika that was so wrong so he has to set the record straight yeah I mean what he said he was stunned by what she said indicating he was in the room I mean the the pictures that we've seen these sons that will put out the video it doesn't show the crowd long enough for us to tell whether he was actually in the room but he made it sound as if he heard this with his own ears so it's not as if he was told something about it he at least characterized it as something he'd heard for himself do you whether he was actually at this event I don't know but you know what I think is important is that we let these young men rest in peace and we find out the circumstances have been and nausea what is the scope of our involvement there yeah do we need an authorization of the use of military force what is the geography of it what is the scope of it what is the timing of it we need to I know that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Defense Committee or having a look into the data they would describe it as a an investigation but like the Congress people on both sides of the aisle want to know the facts and let's talk about that for a moment because the Nazaire issue you know and and congresswoman Wilson has made this point too that what we want to know is what happened to our our troops there you would be one of the eight principal leaders in the House and Senate that would get these briefings ostensively from the White House about it John McCain Senator McCain has indicated he doesn't feel Congress is getting enough information in a timely manner from the White House about what went wrong in that operation do you feel that you're being properly informed by the White House well we haven't been so far but the notice has been served okay so to see what they did they do yeah it is ironic that you know with Benghazi your colleagues on the other side of the aisle the Trey Gowdy's of the world made great hay out of that for years used it as a political football head more than you know dozens and dozens of hearings do you see the prospect of hearings coming from the Republican side of the house on the air well I would think that they would do it within scope of the Committees of jurisdiction the Armed Services Committee the Foreign Affairs Committee which does have jurisdiction over the scope of our authorization of use of force yeah I don't see any need for that's for them to go into what they did in Benghazi because that was politically motivated this should not be yeah so we're talking about sort of this idea of women and whether women are being held sacred we know that right now your colleagues on the other side of the aisle are making a full-scale attempt to do things like defund Planned Parenthood ease and it helps to take away air a memo was recently circulated coming from the White House showing that they had a plan that involves really rolling back women's liberties in terms of reproductive rights how concerned that should women be that this stuff could actually pass the Congress and be signed into law well if this is about respect it's about respect for women women's judgement about the size and timing of their family respect for women in the workplace equal pay for equal work respect for women in the affordable care act no longer being a woman was a pre-existing medical condition the list goes on and on in terms of the obvious disrespect and won't even go into things that aren't about policy but are about behavior and this you know I really one thing one advantage we have now is that they're very clear about their agenda for years they were a little more subtle about it but now it's very clear it isn't even about the full reproductive rights rights for women it's about family planning contraception birth control they're there they don't want to fund that and they're going to say they've said to women with the president's recent executive order it's up to your employer to decide if you can afford the interception that means please so I think women that I always said they had a lot at stake in the election and a lot to lose with the election Donald Trump and Republicans to Congress and let's hope that women will speak up look the March the March it served notice women are watching women are showing up women marched women are running for office yeah we have to win well that is Matt no no I this morning I pulled up the National Journal and pulled of this article which talks about the fears that the House Republican caucus has about a potential wave election in 2008 the cook Political Report has ranked a lot of these House races and shown that you know Democrats only need to turn over a net 24 seats heard about you coming back as Speaker our Democrats really organized and prepared to create the momentum to have a wave election and actually take back the house yes we are we have a great chairman then I do hunk from New Mexico and he has commands the respect of our colleagues with his plan for mobilization I do the EMAs the mobilization the messaging the money but nothing more important than the candidates right and one year I always say tell me where you are one year before the election because that is whether the door is open for us a wave or not yeah and if you're president if the Republican president under 50% the door is open this pres well under 40% let's say stays under 50 but it what matters is where he isn't now because now is when people decide whether they're going to run for office and this is when we get the a-team and they don't this is when you see their retirements because of members of Congress who formerly just had an easy run if it will now have a tougher one and they know there's the prospect of serving in the minority so you will see a number of retirements on their side so we know how to do this we know that no six where did six when we had them the the the message operation that congressional Democrats Harry Reid and I will do it now we have the control in between it was all president yeah all president so let's talk about the potential for that if let's say Democrats were to retake the house there is still a contingent on the left side of the Democratic Party and if I Ronnie because you are of course also a liberal a member of the party that would like to see you out stood as leader if the Democrats were to retake the house do you do do you foresee a challenge to your leadership well the I do respect I disagree with your characterization I have overwhelming support of my caucus there's some people there who disagree with me and that's okay but I would not say that it's a challenge from yeah because I am on the way you are but with anything that they use the fact that I'm progressive in the ads against me they'll talk about the fact that I'm from San Francisco and I'm a San Francisco liberal and the rest of that so that's not what it is it's about other people's ambition which is a good thing yeah but you know what I gotta fight the tax bill I've got to fight the assault on the Affordable Care Act's lutely I've got it pass the dollar bill I'm not worried about my it's not about me yes about what policy means in the lives of people so Tom Steyer is a big supporter of yours also from California I want to play you what he said to me about a week ago on this very show take listen he's brought us to the brink of nuclear war obstructed justice at the FBI an indirect violation of the Constitution has taken money from foreign governments and threatened to shut down news organizations that report the truth if that isn't a case for impeaching and removing a dangerous president then what is our government become join us tell you a member of Congress that they have a moral responsibility to stop doing what's political and start doing what's right sorry but that Reading Is Fundamental it's not on the interview that we did last week that's actually an ad that's a good Tom Styer is funded running saying that Donald Trump should be impeached if you become Speaker of the House next January or January of 2019 2019 will you push for the impeachment of this president you know I've served a long time on the into ethical in the Congress as one of my dudes that I pay hit to the to the caucus and it's only about the facts and the law if he's broken the law you would think there would be a bipartisan move to do that but because we don't like his policy and we don't like his attitude and well don't let me go into all the things we don't like about the president at one a Sunday morning that's it you know if people are the facts that's why I would like us to have an independent okay we have a an investigation within the Justice Department with an investigation within the Congress we should have an outside investigation as to what as to what happened if Robert Miller comes back with a report saying that there is evidence of collusion between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia do you believe he should be a peach well it first of all what what does mother where does mother take that or but his his burden of proof is different than what it would be in the Congress of the United States and people should know that that yeah he says maybe he could brute spoke to a criminal investigation some of the people is investigating what we're doing is saying that what the measure of behavior the Constitution of the United States highest crimes and misdemeanors but in any case we've got to fight this this tax bill is Armageddon this is it this hurts the middle class it is an opportunity cost for our investments in our on our budget right we're for a better deal better jobs better pay a better future and we must reject the Republican tax plan that's our task at hand leader Pelosi I'll have to have you come back and we'll just talk taxes because I know it's very important this tax bill is something else if we will have you back thank you so much I'm always a much the opportunity

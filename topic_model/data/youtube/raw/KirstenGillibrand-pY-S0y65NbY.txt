if every one of you spends the next four weeks speaking out using social media to be heard tweeting at Mitch McConnell saying Mitch call the vote Mitch call the vote he could call us back into Congress today we could pass universal background checks today we could ban assault weapons we could ban large magazines we could have a federal anti-trafficking law today so it's your voices that matter so keep speaking up do not be silent just keep demanding it I promise you your voices matter it's the only time it's ever worked in our entire history it's when regular people like you demand it [Applause]

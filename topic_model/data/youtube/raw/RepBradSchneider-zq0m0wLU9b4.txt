you know we should be here today celebrating the SBIC program we should be honoring those small business entrepreneurs who take an idea and develop a business model seek to get the capital to take that model to market look to hire people to create the jobs that draw our economies and having spent my career as a consultant working with family businesses that clients and investments you all make in I understand the values these businesses bring and I understand the power that a well-functioning SBIC program could actually provide in these communities and the fact that we're falling short is a misuse of taxpayer money because we're not living up to the potential but it's also hurting the growth of our economy and mr. Palmer I want to turn to you first I hear your frustration I share your frustration two questions is this how new is this phenomenon you're explaining or describing and what would it be the things that could most quickly change it and turn it in the other direction excellent questions one and all thank you very much there's there's always gonna be frustration with regulations that's normal there's normal there's a normal level that's that's a reasonable level then you try to push and minimize but that's it this really has been for two and a half years been a mess it started with day one of the political appointee taking over the program I'll mention that he ran the program at the end of the Bush administration when I was in the Bush administration to non-overlapping but you know it was disaster then but the clock ran out because he was only there for about 13 months and it took a look at the hearings from 2009 you see that documented there was no reason for then it took years to undo the damage of that it will take some time here to I think you need a change of management I don't think you need a change of focus from the administration because they do care about small business I don't think needed change in Congress they care about small business they just need to be allowed to work I think they need to hire some key people that they've been not allowed to hire in key management positions that they have money for but I think you just need someone who's willing to let the staff do their job and do the regulation that they need and we can disagree on different things at times but we're not trying to get someone to do their job great thank you I miss pin time I turn to you you're on your fourth fund yes sir you've been investing I think you said 108 investments focus in the ten 100 million dollar segment of the market how critical to the growth of the communities you're investing the companies you're investing in to the communities that these operate in is speed of this access to capital the ability to process to review a proposal process that quickly and get the capital of these companies quickly how important is speed in that very we are on our fourth fund it's a four hundred million dollar fund it is over 80% invested we need a fifth fund great thank you and mr. Parvaiz is you look at it and you come at it from a academic standpoint I know your CPA I'm a son of a CPA so I have some appreciation by osmosis but know these companies are looking they need people they need funds they need the ability to do that to grow we can help that by investing in workforce development we can help that by investing in programs like the SBIC program that is a public-private partnership what do you see is the impacts what do you see is the opportunity yeah well I think there's a real opportunity in the early stage investment side of things one of the reasons why this capital penetrates a smaller segments of the marketplace is because of this public-private partnership the leverage has created and so I think this sort of a model would work fairly well with younger companies that create a you know significant number of jobs I also think that you know as you look at that's the dispersion of capital around the country there's some areas where the number of businesses per capital event is significantly higher than others and that suggests some additional opportunities to deploy capital to grow jobs create a healthier economies and engage more of a diversity inclusion opportunity as well thank you and I'm running out of time but mr. Rogers I don't leave you out family RV you described as a growing business going into new markets I know from experience that many of the RV dealers across our country our family-owned businesses started out with a similar story to your company how many people do you now today today just over 300 okay starting from two people selling RVs on their lot that's bad that's the kind of example of companies that we are looking to invest in and whether it's an RV business or a new technology business a service business or a manufacturing business we have the ability to grow our economy small businesses drive our economy they create the new jobs they strengthen our communities madam chairman thank you for having this hearing thanks again to the witnesses for being here we got to get this right thank you the gentleman yields back I just have one more quick

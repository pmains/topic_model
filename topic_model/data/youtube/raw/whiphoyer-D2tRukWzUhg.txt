Thank You mr. Speaker I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend so without objection mr. speaker last week on the East front of the Capitol on the lawn I met with a group of dreamers outside the Capitol dreamers of course refer to young Americans who were brought here as children without proper documentation but who have grown up in our communities studied in our schools and are American in every way but on paper the dreamers I met with mr. speaker were fasting fasting to protest the president's destructive decision to end the daca program that allowed them to register to live and work in the only country they consider to be theirs and they were fasting to encourage us in this house to take action to remedy their situation by enacting a permanent fix as President Trump has suggested one of the young dreamers Mr Speaker I met was a young man named Diego he's 28 born in Mexico he came here as a young child and was raised in Arkansas he didn't make a decision to come here he was brought here by his parents thanks to daca he was able to get a job a driver's license pay taxes to support the country he loves Diego is now a graduate of the University of Arkansas and a public policy fellow with a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute how stupid it would be to send him to some other country that he does not know I also met Karen from Florida age 22 she also was brought here from Mexico at a very young age now she attends college and owns a small business there was Fernanda from Alabama is she's 23 and graduated a four-year university with honors thanks to the scholarships she could apply for once registered under daca how stupid it would be to say to her leave there's Brandon age 19 he told me that he was a young he has a younger sister who was born here he of course does not want to be separated from her as a result of being deported what kind of a judgement it is that we would divide a sister and a brother particularly a brother who's made such a positive impact on his community mr. speaker this issue is about real people real people there are Americans and in spirit because they grew up here they love this country and they contribute to building our communities and nations every day let's not forget that that's why so many thousands of businesses and major business groups in America have said 'keep daca in place that's why the president said fix this and I'll sign the bill that's why so many churches and communities and educators and medical personnel have said keep these folks here they're making a positive difference for America Mr Speaker I urge the speaker the majority leader to bring a bill to this floor that will do what President Trump says we ought to do and put daca in legislation pass the dreamers Act pass the DREAM Act we're gonna have an opportunity to do that the end of this month next month and hopefully we'll get that done let's pass this bipartisan bicameral DREAM Act without delay so that Diego Karen Fernanda Brandon and so many thousands more who see America as their country who are making a positive contribution to the can stay here they know what no other home that America and they want to be a part of building this country's future mr. speaker immigrants have always made that contribution it is immigrants who built this country my father came here at the age of 32 in 1934 he came from Denmark so I'm the son of an immigrant born here in America he served in World War two and became a citizen through his service in World War two I rarely quote rush limbaugh he said we're not going to send these kids home 84% of the American people in that neighborhood believed that we ought not to send these kids home that that's bad policy let's listen let's act let's make the lives of these young people more secure and more productive for America and I yield back the

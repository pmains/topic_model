that's something for our government to answer I think it's clear the Biden administration's China virus mandates are not about science it's all about power joining me now is Kansas Senator Dr Roger Marshall uh Mr Marshall thank you for being here on the Salcedo show the fifth circuit U.S court of appeals is upholding their block of Biden's vaccine mandate this is one of many legal challenges this mandate is facing now you sign on to an effort to overturn the ruling and you pledged not to vote for any government funding until this whole thing is nullified what is your sense of the Senate is every Republican on board and opposing Biden's unconstitutional moves here I think that they're all on board stopping this unconstitutional mandate and like like the court said there uh they're treating this uh problem with the sledgehammer and that their the Biden law is fatally flawed that was their language not mine so I I think that we all realize that this is an unconstitutional overreach uh this is a slap in the face of people that were Heroes now we're calling them zeros uh this is a slap in the face of the people that ran to the sound of the battle the nurses the doctors the police officers the ambulance people that ran when there was problems they ran to that virus and took risk on the cells now they're immune to it and now they're being told they have to quit their job it's Un-American these are real people with real jobs and what our Amendment will do is it'll stop you any type of federal dollars from being used for the unlawful Biden mandate now what do you think about left-wingers across this country like for example out in California uh the Pretty Boy Governor out there is mandating that children get vaccinated ages five to well age ages five to eleven if they want to go to school and as you just heard from Dr Benjamin Carson there the statistics don't meet that that push in other words they're not following the science there's something else at play here and shouldn't vaccines be only science driven senator you're right this is another example of using a sledgehammer to try to solve a problem uh one size doesn't fit all that's why we we value the sanctity of a doctor-patient relationship doctor uh Benjamin Ben is right you know he's nailed this once again Dr Carson did that one size doesn't fit all look my parents have had the vaccine uh they've had the booster now they have a different wrist profile than my grandchildren do so I think we have to always weigh the benefits and the risk of any type of treatment we're prescribing versus the potential complications or problems from the virus and I think that that's going to have to be a decision between bad patients and and their doctor right and I would just warn this government don't poke Mama Bear uh if the federal government tries to get between a mama and her kids I I think that they're really asking for trouble and and really would side with the parents right to sit down and have this discussion with their doctor and ask them why they think that their child should have the vaccine or not you know if they if they have an underlying cancer they're being treated for maybe they should get the vaccine or if they're obese maybe they should get the vaccine but an otherwise healthy child I think we have to sit there and agree with Dr Carson and say uh what what are the risk of this virus well it's less than the common flu uh then why are we mandating a vaccine we don't mandate a vaccine for the common flu why are we doing one for this virus yeah you know I remember the good old days Senator when Health officials in the federal government when responsible government was with us they would say consult your medical physician you know your your family doctor before making these types of decisions they don't do that anymore they're they're in the mandating business now we don't have responsible government here's Biden advisor Brian deese telling George Stephanopoulos that we can't address runaway inflation until we address the China virus listen so what can Americans expect in the short term is inflation going to get worse before it gets better is there anything President Biden can do in the short term or focused on how to address this in the short term and the medium term Church in the short term number one we have to finish the job on covid getting those shots out for 5 to 11 year olds is going to provide a lot of comfort to American families Senator what does one have to do with the other well forcing five-year-olds to take this vaccine fix Biden's failing economy yo Chris this is how ass backwards this this uh White House thinks right can you think of anything uh more bizarre to say right then actually the opposite is going to happen the Biden vaccine mandates are going to drive up inflation 20 30 of workers out there are going to quit their jobs over this vaccine mandate exacerbated and already critical labor shortage situation that's going to cause more supply chain problems and thus more inflation um I I don't get it all where they're going with on this and and by the way unless they start acknowledging natural immunity uh no one's going to respect the CDC or respect the White House well no this is again just how ridiculous uh this White House thinks through problems uh you would think that they want inflation they're acting like they want inflation yeah it sounds like it to me uh you know one of the talking heads over there at msnbs Stephanie rule is uh is taking fire for suggesting that Americans shouldn't be complaining about the higher cost of food out there Residential Heating costs as you know are expected to Surge at least 30 percent across the board here and Biden claims he can't address skyrocketing Energy prices at home or at the pump but you beg to differ you put out a list here recently you want to give them a little bit of a primer since his this Administration seems clueless on how to do it yeah right so inflation is of course a social injustice uh and there's a the greatest example is the price of gasoline at the pump if you think about the policies this white house has implemented from day one shutting down the Keystone Pipeline where now I'm importing more oil from Russia than from Alaska they've shut down drilling on on federal grounds and here's the one that's no one talking about and that's financing of oil and gas operations so because of ESG regulations banks are now afraid to loan money to the oil and gas industry as well so again go back to basic supply and demand we're going to be lowering the supply of oil and therefore driving up the cost of gasoline this is not rocket science but what your listeners need to know they want the price of gasoline to go up they want this crisis they can never drive the cost of operating an electric car down to the price of operating a gasoline-powered car so they want to drive the cost of gasoline up and then use this for their uh for their Green New Deal socialistic plans as well so so this is another crisis created by the president they know how to solve it but they don't want to Senator Roger Marshall appreciate the visit sir as always here on the South Seattle show we'll talk again soon

BUILDING. KELLY DID NOT ENTER  THE CAPITAL, THOUGH HE DID  CLIMB THE STAIRS.  >> JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS  THIS, CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER. GOOD MORNING. CAN  YOU TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF  CRIMINALITY? DO YOU SEE THINGS  HEADING THAT WAY FOR A FORMER  PRESIDENT TRUMP?  >> LOOK, WHAT WE PUT OUT IS  WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE  SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY, A FAILED  COUP. WE CANNOT SAY YES OR NO.  THIS IS CRIMINAL OR THIS  ISN'T. THAT IS FOR  SPECIFICALLY DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE. THAT'S NOT OUR  CHARGE. BUT I THINK WE CAN PUT  OUT SOME PRETTY SOLID  EVIDENCE. YOU SAW THE TOP  WINDS OF THOSE YESTERDAY WILL  DELVE MORE INTO THAT OVER THE  WEEK AND NOT TO MENTION, YOU  KNOW, MORE PEOPLE COULD BE  FLUSHED OUT OF THIS. WE'RE NOT  CLOSING OUR INVESTIGATION YET.  >> AND I THINK AND ATTORNEY  GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND'S  WATCH THIS FIGURE OUT IF THAT  REACHES THEIR THRESHOLD, BUT  CERTAINLY.  >> AS AMERICANS THIS CAN'T BE  THIS CANNOT BE HOW WE DO  TRANSFERS OF POWER.  >> YEAH, OBVIOUSLY IT WAS  MOVED INTO PRIME TIME AND A  LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED OR DID  NOT WATCH TO THE PEOPLE THAT  MAY BE SHOULD HAVE WATCHED.  NOT WATCH. I MEAN, HOW DO YOU  THINK IT REACHES THE PERSON  WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS  AN INSURRECTION?  >> YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK, I'M NOT  GOING INTO THIS WITH ANY  BELIEF THAT WE'RE GOING TO  TURN EVERYBODY'S MINDS BECAUSE  I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT  HAVE BEEN SO ABUSED BY  PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY'VE BEEN  SO LIKE TO HE'S TAKEN THEIR  TRUST AND HE'S TORN AND USED  IT FOR HIS OWN POLITICAL ENDS,  THAT THERE'S PROBABLY ANY  FACTS YOU CAN PUT IN FRONT OF  THEM. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN  CONVINCED THAT DONALD TRUMP  IS, YOU KNOW, SHORT OF THE  SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. AND  SO I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN  CONVINCE THOSE IMMEDIATELY  RIGHT NOW WE WILL CONVINCE  SOME PEOPLE THAT MAYBE DIDN'T  KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING  ON OR MAYBE, YOU KNOW, BEING  REMINDED OF THE VIOLENCE OF  THAT DAY. BUT THE ONE THING  I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT IN THE  LONG TERM BECAUSE KNOWING THAT  THE HISTORY BOOKS WILL REFLECT  ACCURATELY THAT DAY BECAUSE AS  OF TODAY, THE TRUTH, THE  NARRATIVE THAT YOU SAW  YESTERDAY, IS IT MORE WITH  THINGS LIKE IT WAS THE FBI  WHERE IT WAS IN OR IT WAS A  TOURIST VISIT, WHICH AFTER YOU  SAW THOSE VIDEOS YESTERDAY WAS  EVEN MORE LAUGHABLE THAN WHEN  HE SAID.  >> I WOULD IMAGINE ONE OF YOUR  OBJECTIVES IS TO MAKE SURE  THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.  WHAT MEASURES HAVE YOU THOUGHT  OF COULD MAKE SURE THAT THIS  DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?  >> YOU KNOW, IT'S A GREAT  QUESTION. I THINK THAT IS THE  MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN  DO. THE BIGGEST THING IS  NOTHING EXCHANGE. THIS IS THIS  COULD HAVE BEEN A DRY RUN FOR  A FUTURE US. SO WE AS  AMERICANS HAVE GOTTEN IT. I  THINK THERE'S CHANGES TO THE  LEFT OR PAT NEXT REESES. BUT  REALLY WHAT IT GETS DOWN TO  THE VERY BASIC PEOPLE HAVE TO  BAYS OR WE SWEAR AN OATH TO DO  THE RIGHT THING. LET'S SAY WE  PASSED A LAW IN CONGRESS WOULD  SAY THE PRESIDENT VETOES IT.  WE OVERRIDE THE PRESIDENT,  THEN HAS TO STILL IMPLEMENT  THAT LAW. IF THE PRESIDENT  MAKES A DECISION NOT TO DO  THAT, THERE'S NOTHING CONGRESS  CAN DO. WE'RE NOT THE CAPITOL  POLICE TO ENFORCE IT. IT'S THE  PRESIDENT MAKING THE DECISIONS  WERE BASED OF. AND SO WE HAVE  THAT COMEBACK THAT JUST WHEN  THAT BREAKS DOWN AS IT DID  AFTER THE ELECTION ON JANUARY,  $0.16. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM IS  THE BIG THING. IT'S A PEOPLE  IS TO MAKE YOURSELF THE TRUTH.  YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF TO  VOTING FOR CANDIDATES THAT ARE  COMMITTED TO THEIR OWN  INTERESTS.  >> WELL, SPEAKING OF  CANDIDATES, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS  NOT SAID IF HE WILL RUN AGAIN.  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY AND AND WHAT  ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE?  >> WHAT MY PLANS ARE, YOU  KNOW, FINISH OF SOUTHWELL TAKE  A LITTLE BIT OF A BREATHER,  BUT STAY INVOLVED. THE COUNTRY  FIRST IS GROWING REALLY FAST.  ME HAD SOME GOOD WINS AGAINST  SOME OF THE INSURRECTIONISTS,  THE CRAZIES, PARTY THAT WOULD  LIE TO PEOPLE IN TERMS OF  TRUMP'S TO YES, 3 YEARS AGO OR  2 YEARS AGO TO NEVER EXPECTED  RUN NOW EXPECT MAYBE HE WILL.  BUT I CERTAINLY THINK IF  AMERICA WANTS A CHAOTIC FUTURE  VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I WOULD  SAY TO MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS  AT THIS POINT WITHOUT MAKING  ENDORSEMENTS VOTE FOR ANYBODY.  BU

I just got back late last night from DC uh Senator hickenwood burnai uh went over to the Pentagon actually uh for lunch with the Secretary of Defense to talk about the well to tell them that we're not going to let them steal space command from Colorado uh by the way you ever have the opportunity to be Secretary of Defense I would recommend that you get a very nice again thank you for the introduction um we were last together four months ago with Steamboat I tell you that it's been my experience that nobody has ever wanted me to come back within four months before I was getting to talk to them before so so I appreciate the implementation even work for that I don't just want to start by thanking everybody in this room career leadership on Western water water issues as Travis said money can't solve everything it helps but it is meaningless without the leadership of the people in this room I've lost count a number of times over the years that I've heard of the people in this room not just pristine but often Christine for guidance and expertise that I can't thank you enough it's meant the world to me particularly as I've just heard about the agriculture committee from the day that I got to the Senate I know that the people in this room and then the people that you come after forgotten more about walking around with ever but you don't have to be a water expert you know that we're in a five dollar crisis in the in the West in the Rocky Mountain West the West has the business drives over 100 years that's when vikings were moroing throughout Europe from one end to the other and even beyond that and and in 2023 these conditions have created a profound challenges for Colorado and for the Rocky Mount Pleasant last several we saw parts of the real graduation drive for the first time in the 40 years Nebraska is saying hey white bill in the canal the bird crested water into the Southwest running Department [Music] reality and here is the devil as everybody in this room knows the water outing it out of paper is never that is natural water in the river of the compact allocated 16.5 million acre feet of water I had the chance in the last couple weeks 2010 days in the Middle East with Mark Kelly from Arizona we have a lot of water station it's about the the estimate that it off from the very beginning and we know the average was close to 12 days of his acting responsible always taking this lesson is 7.5 million sure the lower Mason has taken far more year in Europe 2020 the entire reservation used only 3.5 million acre feet less than a half we actually cut values by a millimeter feet over the previous year and at the same time the lower base increased inches by 600 hours acre putting them well over their allocation while we were trying to do it right and as you know they're doing that by draining like power like me to their lowest levels it's filled those reservoirs 50 years ago that is easily up there to our farmers and to our ranchers to view like Harrison trip to peach farm and Northport valleys trying to keep his Orchard alive with a lot less water by the union tribe which has had to dramatically cut back farming because there is no water if I can go on every example was a reminder that we can't accept this status symbol we have to define a new vision for the river to ask the seven state to continue their negotiation we have to reach a decision because if enough was the Bureau of the Department of material to impose one instead and that means everyone in the basement has to make our choice what the river provides which is what we've always done we have always done because attracting the tribe system precision on this landscape if I know the information and we'll have to see if the Lord means if they've been said is willingness because even if we do everything particularly possible it still won't be enough without real changes to the war base and then we'll make a material difference over the long term you know I'm not overly optimistic it's right we shouldn't be probably finish about this breaching and agreement that won't be easy and everybody knows that because but everybody here in this room of the people that you present represented have a central role to play the months ahead the entire base is going to look to all of you for leadership and for examples of how to do more with less the example is like Paul crochet who I I know is here today I just saw outside of branches in Grand County with the experimented with human crops that he could use up to 30 percent less water to overhead and Improvement food they had a conventional foreign [Music] the important to the travel Choice leaders like America and Aurora where they just passed restrictions of new golf courses their developments reforms it'd be too much water these are these are stories like this all across our state in our it's our job to go and share them with the countries the people in this room May understand the Western Water Crisis I know you do but I can assure you no one else does most Americans have no understanding about how important this river is how it worked what it mean instead of 40 million people in this space and what the implications of the survival are not just for the west but for the entire United States of America we have to tell them we have to tell and it's not enough to keep talking to each other but we need everybody here to reach out and talk to the national public talk to them and members talk to the administration go on the music and our team stands ready to help we're compared to do everything in our power to draw attention to this crisis back in Washington I know my staff Rosie was here yesterday talking about the department and I think in the short term we have an opportunity with the upcoming foreign but to make new investments in conservation foreign traffic amazing girl so if you have ideas and you've got a concerns or you've got a criticisms about how the farm bill works or how they could work better we want to hear the but over the long term we need the federal government to backstop whatever the states decide with the Bureau of Reclamation I don't want to television yeah but if we can come to a consensus federal government is going to have to help backstop that consensus the four billion dollars that we secured in the inflation reduction Act is a good start but it's only a down payment and this year is a historic opportunity to build on that product 2023 may be the most important year for Western water since the Colorado River compact came together a century ago the choices we make this year can take the Basin for the next hundred years I guarantee you we don't have this choice get old shape with the basement for the next 100 years and we have the opportunity to lead I think and to tell the story the future of the Colorado River dive face on fear about the future or bitterness over the past but on creativity collaboration and a commitment to Leading the basement and better shade that we that I know I know more is up to that challenge and I want you to know that I'm going to be with you every single step away thanks for having me this morning [Applause] foreign [Applause]

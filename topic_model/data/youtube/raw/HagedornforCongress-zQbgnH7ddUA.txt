I was proud of our campaign we ran a great campaign and we went against an incumbent and nobody gave us we came that close to beat the mood kept working we've been out there working the last year moving this election forward as my good friend Gil booth Nick the former congressman who supports me in this campaign says you know Jim you would have won that race for sure if you were running against Hillary Clinton - but you were going up against an interesting company who had a lot of advantages and the advantages of incumbency are very profound but once walls is out of this race and we were 61 votes short each of the counties who doesn't think we can't make that up with the incumbent out and on our campaign where it is as strong as it is now you know my competitor I love you Carla you're wonderful lady but I think you've overcompensated just a little bit tonight I wrote I started writing down every time you mentioned president Trump I got down here for nine and you know 30 minutes of talking that's pretty good I like the president - maybe one of the reasons he didn't do so well over there homestead County is because three weeks before the election when they asked us do we support Donald Trump for president I said absolutely the stakes are that huh we're going to lose this country if Donald Trump doesn't win an election well my competitor says she couldn't even commit to voting for me there's a little bit of a difference there but all I've heard tonight is how she supports the president it would have been helpful if is supported before the election - you don't have that problem with me I'm consistent conservative across the board the fact of the matter is this if Donald Trump had won an election we would have lost the country Hillary when it flooded the Supreme Court with radicals who would have taken away our right to keep and bear arms and everything else and validated everything we believed in this is a critical time for our country the voters of this nation for the third time in a century have given the Republicans the House the Senate and the White House and if we squandered like we did that us about a decade ago we're going to be out in our opportunity to give this nation another 20 or 30 years of life just the way Ronald Reagan and the Republicans did it in the 1980s we'll go out the door we cannot lose and with me you have somebody who gets it somebody who will fight for it somebody who believes it and somebody who every day of the work of the week will fight for our conservative agenda i apprec-- your time thank you for being here thank you for everything you've done I ask for your support just a moderator thank you first district thank you Freeborn County Thank You senator Nelson thank you nice to be here

quickly turn into 10 min so but I kind of along that along that line do you recall making this statement our positions and the judgment about risk mediation steps are my personal responsibility that is according to Bloomberg regarding in october twenty five conference call regarding these quarterly losses in the debt downgrade you you then saw sixty-seven percent loss in value there do you recall making that statement i recall something of that that nature made okay well that was the that was the quote in the article and i'm just curious I we all get here you've sat in on this side of the microphone I'm sure you wishing you weren't sitting on that side of the microphone today but are you on hands-on kind of guy detail kind of guy in markets and clients activities I think most people would but in general in life I mean is that me is that because I know I'm here and I like asking questions I like knowing about what's going on I me are you control freak type or are you that okay well we'll look things kind of play out and see what happens the things that I understand and have expertise in I'm very hands-on okay well it seems to me that that the things that you have done in life you've maybe had to strike a balance I know I do I have to know some details I have to know about details on legislation do I know about every detail about every piece of legislation probably not but I got people that follow that and I have to go get it when a constituent asks I mean that's fair right i mean we're not i don't think we're expecting you to know everything that every single employee is possibly doing during the day but i think what my friend from New York is getting at is when you've got some major issues like this it would seem that that responsibility lies in your office I mean that's what you said on october 25 i can tell you having some personal experience with the attorneys and real estate brokers i'm a former realtor myself when you start commingling funds and when you start pulling funds that don't belong to you to go do things no matter how valiant no matter how beneficial to you personally or the firm or whatever else people lose their law licenses people lose their brokerage licenses I think that's why you're seeing such frustration anger hostility at this my phone started blowing up November 1 and in the late in October thirty-first by people who I had no idea in my district who who I couldn't even fathom had some sort of connection into MF Global but they did and through predominantly that agricultural community and it just seems to me that when you're when you were claiming that not to know details about some major major issues that have been brought up here it just doesn't ring true it just doesn't ring like it's heartfelt in mr. a blow I know both of you were employed by the global holdings I'm assuming that this isn't the only asset that Global Holdings had I know you have operations in Canada and Hong Kong and England and number of places around the world correct is that yes sir all right and are they all much like this structure a separate entity operating in these other countries each country has its own regulatory structure each country has its own finance structure and there is cooperation across the global and you communicate on a regular basis with those other fantasy sir okay and that that seems to maybe get at and I know my time is almost up here but it seems i think that's some of the concern as we're seeing this this money get passed around the fiduciary element feels like it's lost now it might be there legally technically but i can tell you as someone who had a fiduciary responsibility as a Realtor and a developer and having those dollars come in this certainly doesn't feel or look like you were caring for those other people's money the way that you should have and certainly we're expected to one last question I did you have personal dollars yourself in those segregated fund accounts I did not you did not so this was not any our own money you were just out with everybody else's money it was it was other clients I didn't have a futures account didn't trade for my own account thought it would be a conflict to be an active trader for my own purposes why was leading a company but you certainly were active in trading personally correct noting to know I have a I bought shares in MF Global which I think I've reported my written state yes but but you weren't involved in the day-to-day choosing where things are going to be going there were things that I traded through we set up a very complex compliance structure extra supervision to make sure that when I executed a trade first of all I didn't write a ticket but somebody else did that they were both observed and and those procedures were followed well I know my time is up but Governor Corzine you've got thousands of hard-working people around this country that feel cheated and frankly it's hard not to it disagree with them thank you I thank you gentlemen I

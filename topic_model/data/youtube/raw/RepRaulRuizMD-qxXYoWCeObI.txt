thank you chairman and thank you for letting me speak at today's economic opportunity subcommittee legislative hearing i'm here to talk about my bill the health care for homeless veterans act well i was extremely encouraged early this year to see that the numbers of veterans experiencing shelter homelessness decreased across the country by 10 percent in the latest point in time count there is more to do to care for our veterans experiencing homelessness in my district veterans homelessness is still a prevalent issue in riverside county for example the number of veterans living on the street in emergency shelters or transitional housing has been increasing since 2018. between 2019 and 2022 riverside county saw a 5 increase in veterans living on the street and this is heartbreaking we must do more to ensure that veterans who have served and sacrificed for our nation do not wind up without a place live when they come home right now the va has several programs to assist veterans who are homeless they provide payments to organizations who temporarily house veterans provide grants to veterans on the cusp of homelessness and help with support services for those in the hud-vash program these programs serve all veteran populations regardless of discharge status including veterans within other than honorable discharge however one program that aims to connect homeless veterans with health care services in their communities exclude those veterans within other than honorable discharge those veterans are turned away at the door if they go to the va seeking health care resources in their community this also means that these veterans are unable to attend outreach events aimed to provide resources to homeless and at-risk veterans such as the va's stand down event in which va staff and volunteers provide food clothing and health screenings my bill would close this gap and allow the va to connect these veterans with health care resources in their communities my bill would also grant them access to attend outreach events such as the stand down programs to get help by expanding eligibility to this group of veterans we would be providing care for some of our most vulnerable veterans those who in many cases need our help the most i'm grateful that the national coalition for homeless veterans and the national alliance to end homelessness have endorsed the bill and i encourage my colleagues on the committee to do so as well my question miss hetrick do you believe that expanding the va's healthcare outreach services to other than honorable discharge veterans would take resources away from the honorable discharged veterans i don't believe that that would take services away from honorably discharged veterans we feel that all veterans um should receive uh this type of assistance as we stated in our um our testimony we are supportive of this legislation thank you so much and uh miss monet can you please elaborate on how the health care for homeless veterans act would increase access to va's outreach programs that connect veterans with other than honorable discharges to health care in their communities absolutely so the healthcare for homeless veterans program is truly one of the unsung heroes within va's toolbox of resources for veterans experiencing homelessness they offer health care they run the drop-in centers they fund stand-downs that's also the program that really looks at coordinated entry and matching veterans to the right housing program that meets their needs so when you think about the fact that veterans with certain discharges discharge statuses are not allowed to participate in the very basics like here's how you get connected to programs it sort of feels like we're just leaving them outside the door and they've got to figure out how to find the side door in or another way or maybe somebody else will outreach to them if they're lucky but in certain communities veterans with other than honorable discharges make up the majority of the people experiencing um unsheltered homelessness because there's not a lot of outreach capacity beyond what the va can offer with the healthcare for homeless veterans program and that's just not acceptable so i do appreciate your leadership in introducing this bill and ensuring that all veterans can access as many programs as possible thank you uh and uh can you describe some of the barriers that these veterans experiencing homelessness face by not having access absolutely i mean i think outreach is one of the um the really big things right if you don't know what's out there to help you how can you access services and support right and so when you think about the fact that va's got all of these really great programs but if nobody is coming to you and telling you about them or maybe you don't know that they exist and you're out there talking to folks that maybe you're not connecting with i mean it really is the difference between cities having unsheltered encampments of people outside with no support and having people moving inside and accessing all of the benefits that our partners at va and hud can offer so thank you so much for your work thank you all for the great work that you all do i really appreciate that uh you're making a big difference so with that i yield back my time

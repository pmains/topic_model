every veteran i meet has a story about their transition out of the military whether it was three years ago or three decades ago veterans can still recall their experience of navigating that adjustment to civilian life i watched it up close with my own husband when he left the military after 30 years in the army newly separated veterans encounter changes in job status lifestyle housing health care it's a period of enormous change i hear all the time from veterans across the district about the lack of clear communication about the benefits they are entitled to and the resources available to them as veterans so many veterans just don't know the hundreds of programs they qualify for so that's why i'm introducing the solid start act my bill is specifically aimed at our veterans who are transitioning in their first year out of service it requires the va to reach out three times in the first year after separating from the military to tell the veteran about their benefits and make sure they actually know what they qualify for from health care to housing to employment as well as resources specific for women's veterans information on state and local resources including our va health care centers and our veteran service organizations it shouldn't be up to the veterans to navigate the bureaucratics at the va at this same moment they're trying to adjust to civilian life the va should be proactively reaching out and making it as easy as possible to understand and access the benefits and services available to our veterans it's up to us to honor our veterans not just with words but with action that's what we're trying to do with this bill

good morning representative Berra tell us how many hours have you been at the Capitol and what has been taking place throughout the night you know we were there you know probably 14 16 hours yet speaker Ryan kind of snuck in and pushed through the adjournment but but we're not going to give up right and you know every doctor I've seen firsthand the tragedy yeah violence and gunshot depth and I can't bring those lives back I can't bring the 49 sons and daughters that we lost in Orlando back but what we can do is try to prevent the next tragedy and all we're asking is let's have a conversation and legislation to prevent the snack tragedy what do you hope happens within the next couple of hours you know I think what we're doing is if the majority in the House and speaker Ryan is not willing to act then it is going to take the public rising up saying and that's enough yeah let's prevent the next step let's save that next son or daughter I don't yeah I don't want to see another mother losing their child and that's what this is about you know to the Senate's credit yeah they voted down from these bills but Senator Collins a Republican firm name is working with Democrats trying to find a compromise solution that both parties could accept that's all we're asking speak arrives if you don't sneak out of washington d speak let's have a conversation let's have the faith that's how democracy works all right congressman Bera thank you very much we appreciate Utah your time and probably will check in with you again is you guys are not giving up you'll still be there right this will continue hey we're here yeah we want to get this conversation going okay thank you again another big

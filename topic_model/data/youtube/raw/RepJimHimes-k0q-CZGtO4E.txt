joining me now congressman jim heintz Democrat from Connecticut congressman you called I understand for Eric Shinseki to resign why do you want to see him go well Chris it wasn't a decision that i arrived at lightly general Shinseki is a good man who has served his country his whole life wounded in Vietnam but he has presided over an organization now which as you pointed out just a moment ago in Phoenix left 1,700 veterans behind now that's bad enough and god only knows what happened to those veterans as you point out the allegations of deaths and whatnot are unconfirmed nonetheless 1700 and senior people in Phoenix were promoted because of the falsification of those records got bonuses even worse the report shows or suggest that there are allegations of sexual misconduct of bullying of inappropriate hires and here was the kicker for me the kicker for me was the word systemic if this was one group about actors Rennicks that would be one thing but this apparently may be permeated the permeating the organization and general Tsin seki look the military culture is pretty clear when something goes this badly wrong it is the commander's responsibility it's not gonna solve everything to have in step aside but it is the right thing to do okay that that may be the case um and and I in some ways I reserve personally I reserve judgment because I feel like I don't know what the underlying problem is yet let's say Shinseki comes out tomorrow and resins eight thirty in the morning he's scheduled to give a talk let's say he resigns what's the day to plan of attack here I mean what is the date I still don't understand what the problem is that has led apparently to 42 different facilities cooking the books because they could not meet the demand yeah I'm look there's deep underlying problems here the VA has been under enormous pressure for a very long time to fix these incredible wait lists that have you know anybody wait Shinseki gets a lot of credit you know those wait lists are because he said we're going to serve these red veterans well and not just these veterans Iraq in Afghanistan but you know Agent Orange in Vietnam ETS we're going to deal with that so he gets a lot of credit for that but they've been under a huge amount of pressure which does not excuse a culture and what we're talking about Chris and this is why should sucky is important is a culture what do the senior people do under duress do they you know double their workload and work extra hard and get this done or do they do unfortunately what it looks like they've done it's cook the books and here's the question it seems to me was it possible for the in these places where it looks like we had this this systemic manipulation of the data do we have a situation people were just clocking in and clocking out every day and saying up I'll pledge the data instead of working or do we have the situation which people were working past the breaking point and still unable to make the benchmark that it from Washington to make sure these wait times happen if that is the case if the latter is the case it seems there's a hole bigger problem to deal with them then Eric Shinseki yeah you're right and look this is this is not a new problem the allegations of fraud the possibility of sexual misconduct of bullying up that comes out of the inspector general's report but we've known for years about these backlogs and let me draw a parallel because because you're right it's not just about changed at the top it is also about improving systems it's about changing culture it's about making providing the resources now as you know you know while this president has been president resources for the VA have gone up by eighty percent is that enough I I you know maybe it's not maybe it is but that's something for us to decide the parallel I would draw here Chris is think about healthcare gov absolute disaster as a technical matter the president brings in Jeff designs and in short order not fast enough for my taste but in short order those systems are changed that's the kind of change agent yeah that changes technology that changes culture that we need here that's I think I said I think that's a reasonable recommendation it just seems to me that even if the resources have gone up it the more you look at this and more you read the reports of the whistleblowers I was just reading about the doctor down in Jackson Mississippi it does sound like there's just a basic bedrock mismatch between what is being asked to the VA on the service end and what it has the capacity to do at the current moment and I just feel like we can all talk about Eric Shinseki but when that storm passes or doesn't then there's a real problem to solve you're absolutely and look one of the bottom lines here think about it from a doctor's perspective doctors who are paid by the VA on salary unlike doctors outside of the VA are paid you know somewhere between a half to two-thirds of what doctors in the private sector are paid for doing in some cases much more challenging work now this comes back to us it really does it again you know we here we are I've been here for five years and the constant mantra has been cut the budgets cut the budgets cut the budgets guess what yep that has implications yeah I I do hope that Congress stays on this after the storm passes Congressman Jim Heintz thank you yeah thank you

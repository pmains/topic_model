Thank You mr. speaker today I rise in strong support of HR 829 my legislation to honor the life and legacy of Army Specialist Thomas J Woolworth by renaming in his name the post office in his hometown of mastic New York specialist Thomas Woolworth always possessed a strong sense of duty to his country having participated in an Junior ROTC program at William Floyd high school where I once graduated as well but it was in our nation's darkest hour that seventeen-year-old specialist Woolworth was driven to enlist during his junior year of high school specialist Woolworths more witness to the unimaginable horror of September 11th with Ground Zero just under 100 miles from his high school but instead of cowering in the face of terror he shipped off to basic training that summer and actually finished high school while serving in the Army Reserve as a member of 1st battalion 8th Infantry Regiment 3rd Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division based out of Fort Carson Colorado Woolworths was deployed to Iraq in 2005 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom it was only three months into his deployment on February 22nd 2006 the 21 year-old specialist Woolworths along with two of his fellow soldiers were killed in action when an explosive device detonated near his Bradley Fighting Vehicle while on a routine morning patrol near balad Iraq I wish there were more people who possessed such a profound sense of patriotism even fewer answer the call at just the age of 17 who sacrificed their entire lives and their feet entire future to serve in the US military specialist Woolworths was the best of who we are he is the embodiment of what makes this country the greatest in the world the willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice serving this most exceptional nation the willingness to lay down one's life for his neighbors first community but most courageously for those Americans he never knew before serving in Congress I was in New York State Sunday introduced a bill that it also became law this specialist Thomas J Woolworth military dignity Act to ban protests that military burials in my home State it's my greatest honor to stand here on the House floor today to speak about this new legislation honor of Thomas specialist Woolworths is survived by his loving parents Elaine and Terry Woolworths and his sister Kari and there are no words to describe the amputee emptiness this loss left in their hearts and in the heart of our entire community but before I close I'd like to read a few words from the Woolworth family which really drive home why this straightforward legislation will have such a profound impact the Woolworth family said quote Tommy died so that his fellow Americans could live a better life his deep rooted sense of patriotism drove him to enlist in the aftermath of September 11th and he would have been so proud of his sacrifice on behalf of our entire nation to have his name and legacy displayed in the heart of the community he loved the community he laid his life down for will never bring him home but will ensure his memory and sacrifice live on in the hearts of those who call Long Island home I urge my colleagues to support this legislation I thank both who have spoken in its favor today and I yield back

mr secretary thank you so much for joining us for your past uh service to our country and your current service and your leadership uh would you like to take a minute of time to respond to any questions you didn't have a chance to respond to uh thank you for the opportunity um i look forward to your questions all right thanks uh a number of us had the uh the privilege of traveling to the uh northern triangle countries honduras guatemala salva repeatedly in bipartisan groups i hope to to be part of one of those later this year and look forward to some of the members of this committee joining joining me at that at that time we're reminded in scripture that when i was a stranger in your land did you welcome me i reminded in a florist decision which actually reflects and mirrors i think very much the the message in matthew 25 uh that said only i think matthew 25 is a moral obligation that we have to the least of these including people are trying to escape violence and crime and corruption lack of opportunity which we're implicit in we're implicit in by virtue of our addiction to illegal drugs that are trafficked through these countries we're implicit in their their misery and the question is what are we going to do about it and i would suggest that what we do about it is walk and chew gum at the same time we've got some charts here that indicate what's been going on uh at cbp in terms of how long we're holding uh kids and and so forth uh let's see average number of hours children in cbb custody why was it in march 28th 103 hours what was that on may the 11th 26 hours in cbc bp custody that's a that's reduction of 80 percent that's improvement do i have another chart number of children in cbp custody on march 28th 5760 children were in cbp custody almost 6 000. may 10th what is that two days ago we had 455 children in cbp custody as a reduction of 92 percent that's that's that's an improvement that's a market improvement and i just want to say to you but but particularly the folks at cbp the department of health and human services whose workers making this possible this progress project could work if we want to do something about these of these charts we've been shown by our colleagues with this the most recent surge we can do something about that my friends we can do something about that three primary reasons why people are coming out of these countries to try to get up here number one lack of opportunity and hope number two crime and violence number three corruption we created something called the alliance for prosperity a number of years ago the idea that we would put money into fighting those three ills crime and corruption crime and violence corruption lack of economic opportunity and the idea was that we would provide some money and return each of these countries would provide money a lot more than we're going to provide number two we're going to try to leverage money from other countries to help out in these three areas to leverage money from ngos to work and focus on these three areas uh the most recent trip i took was down to the borders with a codel about a month ago and uh we saw some indication that this kind of progress could be realized i just want to take my hat off to cbp folks folks and men and women are down on the board are doing this work every day and i just want to take my hand off to the folks from hhs who are taking the handoff and trying to do do difficult work important work but in compliance with flores let me ask um ask mr uh mr chairman how important is it and then i'm gonna have to be very brief in your responses we have not had a u.s ambassador in honduras for four years four years no confirmed u.s ambassador honduras for four years we've not had any we don't have a u.s confirmed ambassador in el salvador right now we have a pretty good ambassador i think i've talked to him just this past week highly regarded i think he's doing a good job but if we want to do something about changing these numbers why don't we why don't we confirm why don't we get some from this new administration they've had their had a chance to get their feet wet now we need them we need them to nominate career career ambassadors and we need to hold speedy hearings vet them and vote them up or down i think that one of the best things we can do is put in place career ambassadors with senate confirmation senate support as much as anything we need to make sure that they're surrounded by terrific staff in the embassies in honduras guatemala and salvador they need to be the counterbalance for all the the thugs and the crooks and the criminals down there that are that are using drug money that we provide to continue to screw up that those countries that's the first thing we can do second thing we can do and i think let me just here's my question i actually am going to ask a question the the ability for whether young people or not so young people to us apply for asylum within their own countries at our embassies at our consulates is that something that we're doing a satisfactory job in doing and if not is there something that we on our side need to do to make that possible thank you very much senator carper we're very focused uh on that as i articulated at the very outset in my opening remarks we have a three-prong approach to address the root causes to build legal pathways and to advocate for with the hope that congress will pass immigration reform and with respect to that second prong i think that's what your question goes to the building of legal pathways if we can in fact adjudicate claims in the countries of origin or in truly safe places then we will spare children of the perilous journey north why is it important why is a why is it important for the congress to take up and actually debate and pass comprehensive immigration reform why is that important in this debate today i think we um we all agree the one thing that um there is unanimity about is the fact that our current uh system is absolutely broken and we um we can provide uh fixes through the legislation that has been proposed and is pending let me say to my colleagues i'm not surprised but disappointed with the tenor of this uh uh this uh hearing today there's a problem here that needs to be addressed there's a bunch of problems that need to be addressed and our pointing fingers at one another in one administration the other that ain't going to solve the problems there are some things we can do and need to do and if we'll follow up and work together across the aisle and within this new administration we can make great progress we can turn this out during us around it and i want to do that and i want to do with all of you thank you

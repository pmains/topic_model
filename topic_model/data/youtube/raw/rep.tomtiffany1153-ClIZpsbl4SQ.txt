good morning representative tiffany thanks thanks for coming on [Applause] hey you guys uh can you hear me okay this is congressman tiffany yeah yeah we got you can you hear us sorry i got a little bit of patchiness on my end okay so i heard a little bit of what congressman stauber had to say in um second all of that that the world is coming together to denounce what russia has done i think we need to make sure that we're fortifying uh the neighbors to the ukraine and russia especially those that are in nato and make sure that this does not go beyond what is happening in the ukraine allow those countries to be able to defend themselves but i think the point i would hone in on is exactly what congressman stauber was talking about weakness leads to war and that started on january 20th of 2021 when president biden said we're going to shut down the keystone pipeline and that was the signal to the world that america was no longer going to be energy independent look at what happened we actually ended up funding russia's war machine we uh crude oil went from fifty dollars a barrel to ninety dollars a barrel what are the two things that russia exports oil and gas we have actually funded him as a result of that and it's made america weaker and weakness leads to war and i would just add one other thing you guys real quick and that is as we talk about weakness leads to war it was revealed a couple days ago that our government said to president zielinski of the ukraine that you should leave your country you should set up a government in exile in other words you should run and that is exactly what we did in afghanistan in august president biden said we're gonna put our tail between our legs and we're gonna run from afghanistan that was the clearest signal besides us no longer being energy independent that america was not going to be strong on the world stage and it emboldened pureness like vladimir putin to take advantage of the situation and uh to the credit of president zielinski and freedom loving people everywhere in the world he said no i don't need a ride i need you to rise up and help us in the ukraine yeah that was uh that was kind of a big moment that felt very symbolic to me you know i i was disappointed and angry and and maybe i shouldn't have been maybe that was a knee-jerk response but i was disappointed and angry when i saw that the united states had offered you know help to get to evacuate afghanistan i i thought that sent that sent a message of weakness and and i do i do agree with your line i like your line that weakness leads to war and and i would also add on to it that dependence leads to weakness and that's what we're getting from the byte administration is we're just getting more and more dependents even in the face of of what we're witnessing in in ukraine and with russia and knowing that it is the the energy money that is that is fueling and that is that is paying for all of this war coming out of russia we're still making moves to to to be less energy independent still looking to for foreign sources of oil as the bind administration looks to explore green options i don't want to explore green options i want energy independence here in the united states uh we got our representative tiffany back on the line and representative stauber uh just a few minutes left here i want to give you a chance to get a couple of last words in before we move on well i think that we had mentioned it just a moment ago we have to get back to energy and mining dominance yes we have to secure our energy we have to make sure that that we have affordable and reliable energy in the united states we also have to talk about critical minerals critical minerals are extremely important the eighth district of minnesota is the only congressional district out of 435 that can strategically help with their national security the most and that's with the mining of critical minerals in the duluth conflicts which is the biggest copper nickel find in north america this administration uh as a candidate biden said we're going to mine these minerals domestically after he got elected he now has said no we're going to purchase these minerals from four nations these adversarial nations don't have our best interests on her we as americans have never uh uh put our destiny in any other nation's hands and we're doing that with critical minerals we have the critical minerals here we have to have the will to mine those uh critical minerals in the united states with the best environmental standards and the best labor standards we have a congressman pete stopper and congressman tom tiffany on the phone with us uh joe biden and first lady jill biden are still expected to appear in twin ports later this week on a wednesday to discuss the bipartisan infrastructure law um talk a little bit about this representative tom tiffany we will start with you first expectations of uh potentially still biden coming on on wednesday and uh and what his intent is yeah so first of all you guys um we're going to welcome him to superior wisconsin i think any president regardless of party should be welcome to i'm going to welcome them to the 7th congressional district in wisconsin and i'm anxious to hear what the president has to say my understanding is that the initial stuff he's going to talk about is doing some cleanup um on the st louis river in the uh twin ports which is a good thing and uh it builds on the successes of the trump administration because congressman stauber and i were there two years ago when the trump administration came in and allowed five million dollars to be spent with uw superior to study how we can better treat ballast water how we can deal with that problem in the great lakes a good thing they also announced that they're going to spend 15 million dollars cleaning up howard's bay up there in the twin in the twin ports which is a good thing and my understanding is president biden's going to talk about additional issue initiatives like that that's good but he really i'm anxious to hear if he's also going to talk about are we going to upgrade pipelines we have a major pipeline project up in ashland county far northern wisconsin that reroutes the enbridge pipeline line five and that's a really important project for our energy independence in america i want to know if he's going to talk about that i want to know if he's going to talk about the pipeline over in the mackinac straits that governor whitmer from michigan has said she's going to shut down in defiance of a treaty that we have with canada once again that's going to make us more dependent on foreign oil i hope he's going to talk about that there's the refinery rebuild in superior is almost done i'm wondering if he's going to talk about that and talk about what a great success that is because i would point out one little fact that's been spreading around america here over the last couple weeks we are actually importing more russian oil in 2021 than we were in years previous we have become more dependent on russia for our oil now as a result of the actions of the biden administration representative stauber i'll give you the the last word here well i just want to follow up with congressman tiffany talked about i want to i want you all to know that every single day the united states of america pays the country of russia 22 million dollars for 595 000 barrels of oil per day that is unacceptable that's where this administration i think they must understand uh that we need a clean reliable and affordable energy and this administration they say one thing but watch their actions when you when you hear the president speak um watch more so his actions and he has really devastated the energy sector and the mining sector uh in in america and so what we need to do is we we have to show the american people the difference between what we believe in as energy and mining dominance to secure strategically secure nation and not uh not put the destiny of of our country in the palm of any other nation's hands we have to uh be energy and mining dominance and that's exactly what uh i want uh president uh biden to to say when he comes to the twin ports in addition uh to uh as tom said the energy independence in addition talk about uh the inflation the outrageous spending that's happening in our nation's capital we're at seven and a half percent inflation the highest in 40 plus years and it's going to go higher uh that's unacceptable and our goal is to make sure that that that president biden his administration understand the devastation that they have put upon middle class in blue collar america representative stauber and representative tiffany thank you guys so much for coming on the program keep up the good work and we'll have you both on again real soon okay thanks guys

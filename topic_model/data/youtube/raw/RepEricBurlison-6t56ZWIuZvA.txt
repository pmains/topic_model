hi I'm Eric Burleson and this is a couple report from februari 11 this week our focus was on house concurrent resolution 34 and 35 sponsored by Republican Budget Chairman Alan Dyson and Chris Democrat kiss Chris Kelly from the columbia area this is a bipartisan effort from Missouri legislature to send and urge the Senate message to Congress in Washington urged them to begin to balance their federal budget as we do in the state of Missouri it has become increasingly more apparent that in order to stabilize the economy and get get our economy turned around what people genuinely need is reduce taxes and a stable economic environment the stimulus money has failed all the stimulus efforts have essentially sent money and since then one-time money in and it's and it may have done some small increases but they weren't permanent and they haven't turned businesses around which is what we truly need in the state jobs are important but the big job engine in the state and around the country is small businesses but since the bailout dollars have been received we have lost an additional 60 2,600 jobs and the unemployment rate right now sits around nine with six percent so that's why with so with the stimulus money continuing to be spent we just keep mounting on more and more debt to our federal debt which now sits at 12 trillion dollars and which amounts to tens of thousands of dollars per man woman child the United States and hundreds of thousands of dollars in obligations for every taxpayer in the United States this has got to stop and so that's why the the resolution that we sent could completely change the environment in Washington and completely change America by forcing those people the politicians in Washington to do exactly what myself and my colleagues are committed to do every day in Missouri and that is balanced our state budget hopefully we can convince the federal level politicians to do the same and balance their budget I appreciate your comments and please keep the comments rolling this weekend is Valentine's Day weekend and I plan to take my wife to the Landers theater to watch The King and I I hope he'll do the same but please send me all in the comments and suggestions and have a great Valentine's Day weekend

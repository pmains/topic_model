thank you madam chair secretary Perry welcome back to the committee when you were nominated for Secretary of Energy we we had a frank and serious conversation about my grave concerns about siting nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain since that time you visited the site and thank you for the courtesy you called me ahead of time to let me know you're going there but since that trip you went from touting the importance of state sovereignty to a full-throated support for depositing the nation's waste in Nevada against the will of my state undermining States right to defend its communities against dangerous nuclear-waste what has prompted such a change in your viewpoint senator I've all due respect disagree with your analysis of my position nothing's really changed I think it is wise for us to have a very open conversation with this country about the moral obligation that we have as a people there is statutory requirements for us to to move this waste there are multiple options about where that waste could go as I yesterday there is no plan in place to to put that in a particular place at this particular point in time but I think we need to be looking at all of our options and having a you know an open and a productive conversation about how our I I don't think it's it's wise for us to continue to leave high-level waste you know spent rods in pools not unlike what they had at Fukushima and particularly that over in California is in the Ring of Fire I mean it's geologically you could have an event that is not unlike what they had in Fukushima secretary Perry appreciate and I've got I received your comments but let's talk about Yucca Mountain I don't disagree we need a long-term plan but what but the concern that I have and many in our state have is is specifically when it comes to get them out because I will tell you your assessor secretary moniz and the do II they were steadfast in the position that you come out and program is unworkable and in fact the department concurred with a recommendation from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's nuclear future that a phased adaptive consent-based siting process is the best approach to gain the public trust and confidence needed to cite nuclear waste facilities and let me just say this you've previously stated that you want to have a good working relationship with as many governors as you can and I can tell you as you well know that Governor Sandoval is incredibly concerned about not only your a talk and discussion on Yucca Mountain but doubling down on talk about interim storage at the Nevada national security site and in fact let me just say this Western Governors Association which includes your predecessor in Texas recently passed a policy resolution would stage that a nuclear waste issues facility should not be located within the boundaries of any western state or US flag island without the written consent of that governor or territory that is all that Nevada is asking for is consent-based siting which your predecessor the secretary moniz and the blue-ribbon panel have agreed that's what should occur that's what we're asking to do so why is that such a difficult concept why is that something that you think should not occur and in fact this Yucca Mountain process should go forward and interim storage which is a whole new conversation that we hadn't heard before at the Nevada National Security said I'm confused let me help with the last issue that you brought up senators as I can and I was making reference to an article that was by Nevada State Senator that he pitched that out as an idea it did I think about a May 14 27 teen article that I picked up that was what I create that and I will tell you that that's not something that we're going to support this okay the syndra I'm not any first aid in but what we're looking for is at least some sort of commitment that you're looking for at least the science to prove that it's safe I mean even your deputy secretary Dan Goulet he recently commented when he was in here in his nomination hearing that if the science is not there that we would not support the project so if you can't get behind consent-based siting which is what all states should be we should be looking at for all states and and individuals there then at least look at the science and commit that if the science isn't there and it's not workable and then we should not store nuclear waste or spent nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain you commit to that sure finger I can and and I think it's important for us to do two things pay attention to the science and also to the rural law thank you I appreciate that

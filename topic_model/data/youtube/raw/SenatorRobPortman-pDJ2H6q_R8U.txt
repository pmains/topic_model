I come to the floor for the 27th consecutive week since the invasion of Ukraine to give another update to the American people on the brutal illegal and totally unprovoked attacked by Russia on its neighbor Ukraine this is at a time when Brave Ukrainian Freedom Fighters continue to successfully fend off the third largest army in the world what Russia thought was going to be a week-long invasion successfully occupying Ukraine is now past the nine month mark Against All Odds Ukraine has not only survived but they've pushed back a much larger Russian army more than half of the land that Russia occupied in Ukraine remember they were all up here in the area of Kiev and all down here more than half of the land has been liberated already here in the Northeast part of Ukraine near the uh near harkeeth in this province the hercu oblast the Ukrainian forces continue to make progress pushing back against the Russian forces it's been slow uh combination of things one is it's mud season it's very difficult for them to get through uh the mud with their armored vehicles but second is the Russian forces who were pushed back from here in September have now dug in along this line so it's it's slower going but they continue to fight they are continuing with the momentum that started when they took over harkeeth further south near Bak moot and bakmut is in this area and I was actually in Bak moot back in 2018 at the so-called line of contact there is uh very intense fighting going on this is where you've had months and months of fierce combat lots of artillery it's turned this area the bakmud area where I was into a battlefield reminiscent of what you might have seen during World War II uh just total Destruction as you can see from this photograph this is the buckmut area today there you have the Russian forces mostly the Wagner Group which is a mercenary group making steady but very slow progress Ukraine has made them pay dearly for every meter but that's again kind of in that central part of eastern Ukraine in the south of Ukraine near here song they've also made good progress you can see here in the blue where Ukrainian forces uh in the fall earlier this fall we're able to liberate parts of occupied Ukraine this is an interesting area I think it's relatively quiet right now we had a briefing today about that but I don't think it's going to stay quiet for long this is an area to watch there are already reports of Ukrainian raids actually on a small peninsula there this is a little closer look at this Ukrainian raids have now been made on this peninsula which goes out into the Black Sea also we know that Ukrainian forces have crossed the river here the nepro river and Planet Ukrainian flags on the other side of the river letting the Russians know they are not safe in this region this is Ukraine they've also started to evacuate facilitate evacuation of some of the Ukrainian civilians from this side the occupied side of the river all this indicates to me that the ukrainians are continuing to send a clear signal to the Russians that they are not done in terms of liberating this part of Ukraine this winter unfortunately while the nation of Ukraine has survived this war so far not all ukrainians have these gains on the battlefield I talked about have come at a tremendous cost casualty reports have been hard to come by but we know that tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have been killed during this liberation but it's not just the men and women in uniform that are taking the brunt of Vladimir Putin's aggression since the first day of this war it's innocent ukrainians themselves who have been dying they've been intentionally targeted by Russian forces how many cities and Villages have now become infamous for the war crimes committed by Russia buca and European cities where I was visiting several weeks ago think of four-year-old Lisa Lisa we had her photograph up here on the floor she was killed in Venetia in July think of two-day-old Sergey who was killed two weeks ago two days old a newborn at a maternity hospital in villanizak the United Nation reports that at least 6 500 civilians have been killed in this senseless Russian war then adds that quote the actual figures are considerably higher we just don't know what they are this is because we know so little about the horrors which are occurring Behind Enemy Lines so when you think about it although we know more about the casualties big map we know more about the casualties that have occurred in the interior of Ukraine what we don't know is how many casualties are occurring and war crimes and deaths are occurring in this Russian occupied area the red area what we do know is that so many of the atrocities in this war are only brought to light months after they occur they happen in silence and then they are discovered when these territories are liberated by Ukrainian forces that's the Bittersweet pattern of this war you have the Russians occupying a territory committing heinous war crimes atrocities and then the area is liberated and we discover these horrific crimes and Russia's crimes aren't just limited to the territory it occupies Russian forces are losing on the battlefield as we talked about not making the progress they want and they're sort of taking their frustration out on the rest of Ukraine this is with cruise missiles in drones bombing all of these other parts of Ukraine they continue to strike non-combatants whole new wave of attacks occurred yesterday as an example mostly on Ukrainian infrastructure energy infrastructure but also on just civilian targets they've destroyed neighborhood schools hospitals as this photo shows they've really targeted civilian infrastructure this is again some of the energy infrastructure that they have targeted when I was in cave with Senator Coons about three weeks ago we were there several days after one of the power plants had been attacked actually the the national utility and these were targeted attacks on the infrastructure but also ukrainians civilians and workers were killed it's not just collateral damage these are targeted attacks on civilians targeted and cruel Russia's goal of course is to try to force a whole new wave of civilians to flee from their homes and head West this massive displacement of course would further devastate Ukraine's economy which is already expected to contract about 35 percent this year we've seen this time and time again since the war has started they can't defeat Ukraine on the battlefield so they strike behind the battlefield to try to destroy Ukraine as a whole the actions by the Kremlin to destroy these civilian areas and kill innocent ukrainians are also of course meant to dampen the Ukrainian resolve but what I've seen on my trips to Ukraine and my trips to the region is that every time that there is a Russian atrocity the resolve of the Ukrainian people doesn't weaken it gets stronger and for good reason and the Ukrainian military certainly isn't backing down in their Fierce defense of their Homeland in fact the Ukrainian military spokesman recently said that if Ukraine intends that Ukraine intends to continue if not accelerate it's counter-offensive this winter in these areas we talked about in particular here and here so stay tuned because I think the ukrainians are not done yet this winter in many places along the front line although the winner is bitterly cold for the Infantry the ground is also frozen solid which makes mechanize Warfare possible again additionally on Monday and again today there were explosions reported at military bases in Russia these are military bases hundreds of miles behind the front lines so this is in Russian territory there are military bases that are experiencing explosions these bases happen to house the tu-95 bombers which have regularly Taken part in Russia's deadly cruise missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians according to the British Ministry of Defense these explosions constitute as they say quote some of the most strategically significant failures of Russian Force protection since the Russians invasion of Ukraine end quote Ukraine is The Shield defending freedom in the west When I visit Ukraine in August in November I heard from so many ukrainians who see themselves that way they are holding Russia at Bay essentially for the rest of the world for years think about it Russia has threatened Europe and other regions with military action we've all witnessed their attack on the country of Georgia and their brutal tactics in Syria and chechnya in 2014 and then again of course in February of this year Ukraine became Russia's next Target and if Ukraine Falls Russia has promised other dominoes will fall in Eastern and Central Europe they have said openly they want to recreate the Soviet Union or the Russian Empire which would include so many countries in the region the brave Soldiers of Ukraine men and women in uniform are holding back the forces of Russian tyranny and we should honor their sacrifice and their bravery fortunately they're not in this fight alone over 50 countries from around the world have stepped up to help Ukraine defend itself Ukraine's freedom freedom fighters have been trained and equipped not just by the United States but by dozens of other countries that believe in Freedom ukrainians are well aware of this and they are eternally grateful I hear the strategies but every time I am with ukrainians yesterday I met with a bunch of Ukrainian parliamentarians from nirada here in Washington but when I've been in Ukraine I've heard it also when I spoke with president zielinski and Kiev in August and again in November the first thing he said to me was thank you to the American people the aid from the United States and our allies does not go unnoticed or unappreciated Ukrainian soldiers are bearing the brunt of Russia's Wrath but because of the significant assistance provided by the West president zielinski speaks about this war against Russian aggression as a joint battle and that we should continue to strive together towards our joint victory ukrainians are well aware of the need to provide transparency to taxpayers here in the United States as to how this Aid is being used I think that's very important during both of my visits to Keith this year I spoke with our diplomats at the U.S embassy about how they are ensuring proper oversight and accountability for military aid I've also met twice with 101st Airborne in Poland the principal unit responsible for delivery of U.S and allied military assistance they've gone into great detail about how they are tracking and monitoring U.S military assistance through so-called end-use monitoring to ensure military equipment actually ends up in the right hands one thing interesting to me confirmed again today is that we have sent these highmars which are these rocket launching systems to Ukraine that have been particularly effective and that at least at this point we've sent about 20 of them not a single one not a single one has been attacked and destroyed or has gotten into the wrong hands we also believe from what we know unbelievably that with all the weapons we are sending to Ukraine we don't have any instances that are documented of these weapons getting into the wrong hands plenty of Russian weapons of continued to ukrainian's hands I will tell you that including lots of armored vehicles that they have left behind so no one is advocating that this Congress or U.S taxpayers give Ukraine a blank check this age is generously provided by taxpayers so it's got to be accountable to taxpayers Ukraine knows that again and has gone to Great Lengths to provide transparency even in this time of War these resources fund not only Ukraine's military they back the government and help maintain and repair civilian infrastructure Ukraine's economy has been hit so hard by this conflict and without help from its allies the government there would be unable to provide many basic services to its citizens the Europeans Japanese and others of course have stepped up here as they should this is particularly important this winter as Russia attacks Ukraine's energy infrastructure to plunge the country into cold Darkness the humanitarian aid from the U.S and dozens of other countries has ensured that innocent men women and children are able to survive the cold Ukrainian winter amidst these heinous Russian war crimes our economic aid along with that of the European Union and dozens of other countries has supported Ukraine's government so the critical services to its citizens can continue with regard to the economic assistance by the way the Ukraine budget support goes through the World Bank from the United States because in addition to our own oversight the bank adds a second layer of oversight and accountability including issuing periodic reports and audits to both parties economic assistance is further monitored by a u.said contractor the U.S accounting firm Deloitte they monitor all expenses which is a good thing in my view we also need to ensure that our our constituents that what we are providing to Ukraine is actually working it's making a difference and it certainly is when Ukraine took back to the city of herzol here which was the first and only provincial capital taken by Russia the key element to their success I'm told was the military equipment provided by the United States and others but primarily the United States and that was the high Mars launchers we talked about a moment ago these missile launchers were very effective at tearing down the Russian infrastructure that was providing the supplies to Russia so the weapons the food and so on by wearing down the Russian forces and forcing them to abandon the city the America the American weapons were very effective in debilitating Russia's ability to command and resupply its forces and the air defense system survived by the United States and our allies have helped Ukraine shoot down hundreds of missiles and drones launched by Russia that would otherwise have killed innocent civilians I do continue to believe that we can and should do more by the way particularly with regard to military assistance I continue to urge the Biden Administration to provide Ukraine with more of the weapons that the ukrainians themselves have said they actually want and need and can use this would include fourth generation advanced fighter jets not the latest and greatest but things like f-16s that that we're not using that they could use that other countries have that we could allow them to provide to Ukraine Abram's tanks that other countries have that they're willing to provide long-range missiles if we're serious about helping Ukraine continue to win as opposed to the possibility that this could just result in a stalemate we should provide these weapons so that they can respond to the very real Russian threat let me pose this question to my colleagues who are skeptical about assistance if we had not LED our allies in supporting Ukraine during this fight for survival what would have happened what would have happened if we allowed this authoritarian regime to dominate and subjugate its neighbors by Force of Arms Ukraine would have become an occupied state many more refugees by the millions would have fled to Europe to the United States and elsewhere and even if the threat by Vladimir Putin to occupy all these other independent countries in the neighborhood were that were once part of the Soviet Union had not yet become a reality the U.S would have mobilized thousands of troops and massive amounts of weapons at the borders of these NATO allies at a tremendous cost to the American taxpayer I think we have to think about that think about what the alternative would have been it also would have resulted of course in the rules-based international order that we've had in place for almost 80 years since World War II crumbling in Ukraine what would have happened then what message would aggressive adversaries like China and Iran take from that the road would have become a much more dangerous and vulnerable place let's be honest countries would have armed up this is why it is so important that we continue to support Ukraine our enemies and our adversaries alike are watching very carefully we can't pull back now not during this critical time we cannot falter it in addition to working with our allies to help Ukraine win on the battlefield we've got to continue to tighten the global sanctions and Export controls on Russia I believe it is only that combination success on the battlefield and making the Russian economy feel the pain that it's going to be successful in getting Russia to the peace table export controls already are blocking supplies including semiconductors needed to create military equipment in Russia so that's having an effect sanctions must include better success at stopping the energy receipts to Russia that are fueling the war machine I mentioned what's happening to the Ukrainian economy the Russian economy has also gone down but not nearly as much as the Ukrainian economy why largely because the economy depends on the energy receipts that are still coming in from Russia selling its oil and gas around the world this week there was some progress on that front back in June the European Union decided to end all seaborne Russian oil imports by December 5th that was Monday and the EU did indeed follow through on this promise I applaud the European Union for taking that step however in June the EU also committed to end financing and insurance services for all vessels carrying Russian oil even to non-european countries this would be devastating to Russia oil exports since Europe dominates a large chunk of the maritime Services Market financing and insurance without financing insurance from Europe these ships would never Embark and Russian oil sales would plummet unfortunately in this case the EU did not follow through on this promise made in June instead on Friday the EU the United States other G7 countries and Australia agreed what is being called agreed to what is being called a price cap scheme under this framework participating countries will continue to provide financing insurance for vessels selling Russian oil but only below a certain cost per barrel so instead of ending these sales of Seabourn Russian oil exports we are enabling them at a lower price what's more is the Washington Post reports the price cap which was agreed to at 60 dollars per barrel is and I quote The Washington Post well below Russia's cost of production and close to where its oil is currently trading meaning it may not have much of a direct impact end quote that's my concern about it I understand that there's another argument that the Russian oil price would perhaps be even higher at lower volumes if they didn't have these ships but I think the first plan made in June would have been much more effective at helping to tighten these sanctions analysts by the way say the capital have little immediate impact on oil revenues that Moscow is currently earning in fact Russia itself said on Monday the cap is not going to hurt the financing of its special military operation as they call it in Ukraine this deadly and unprovoked War the price cap is quote an unhappy compromise that will do very little to cut Russia's Royal oil revenue from current levels said Ben Cahill an energy security expert at the center for strategic International Studies here in Washington I would ask the suffering people of Ukraine what they think about it Ukraine Poland and the Baltic states who have consistently been right about the threat of Russian aggression suggested a price cap of just thirty dollars a barrel if they were going to do a price cap so half of the sixty dollars that the EU the G7 the U.S and Australia ended up at the one we agreed to again was twice as high on a more positive note at a meeting in Romania last week the NATO Secretary General reaffirmed that NATO's door to membership remains open to Ukraine this has been NATO's official policy for Ukraine by the way since 2008. but it was important that the alliance reaffirmed that commitment last week in the context of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine I encourage NATO to begin the steps to welcome Ukraine in the future despite all the atrocities and hardships now we've talked about tonight I believe that Ukraine will eventually Prevail in this conflict and survive as a country and that Ukraine will someday join NATO and the European Union to add the most important security guarantees they could get no amount of Russian missiles can stop that by the way because the people of Ukraine will always have something that Russia does not freedom and faith faith is what our founding fathers had so many years ago when they set out on a risky journey to chart America's own destiny faith that freedom would work faith is what the Ukrainian people grasped onto as they embarked on their own revolution of dignity in 2014 abandoning a corrupt russian-backed regime and choosing Freedom democracy and free markets Ukraine chose to stand with us with the European Union and the United States and other free Nations faith is what gave the people of Ukraine the strength and resolve at the beginning of Russia's overwhelming invasion in February faith that as a country they would survive and as a people they would come out the other end of this conflict when the odds were so stacked against them more unified than ever Against All Odds again that faith has been Justified time and time again during this bloody war now once again it's time for us to join our allies in Keeping the Faith Faith In The Proven Ukrainian bravery and perseverance and faith faith that freedom will win out over tyranny if we stay the course thank you and I yield the floor

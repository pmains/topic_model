Mr.. Chairman I too support all these measures that are before us, but I'd like to speak specifically about H resolution 401. Thank you for supporting that. This is the resolution that urges nations to outlaw the dog and cat meat trade. I've been a co-sponsor of this legislation and worked in Congress to end this practice. In the dog and cat meat trade, in the use of dog leather and end other Undue harm that are abuse that comes to these animals. Roughly 30 million dogs and 10 million cats annually are the victims of the meat trade in Asia. The extreme cruelty that these animals suffer is abhorrent, and we shouldn't turn a blind eye to these practices, which run in conflict to our own animal cruelty laws. In American culture we cherish dogs and cats as more than just random animals. They can serve as therapy animals, search-and-rescue assistance, police dogs that aid with drug and bomb searches, they serve with airport security, they are companions, and their cherished family pets. This resolution enjoys bipartisan support, and we must continue to work in a bipartisan manner to better protect animals both in other countries and here at home in the United States, so I look forward to passing this resolution to signify our commitment to combatting animal cruelty, and I yield back. Thank you.

all right senator order um dropped what it's great to see I want to thank you for all your service I also as someone who senator corker and others have spent years trying to learn the housing finance business it is extraordinarily complicated and complex I support a lot of the things you've done around affordability and access I think it's very important I support particularly and one of the things we think we've learned particularly the multifamily side how successful the program has been on multifamily didn't cause the crisis in the first place and we need to continue that good work but one of the things we've granted you is Congress and because we've failed to put in place a legislative solution we've granted you as FHFA director during conservatorship enormous enormous power and I think you've generally done a very good job what I wonder though and I just got some questions I'd like to run through and hopefully we can get brief answers because I've got a couple of follow-ups your tenure ends in January of 2019 and I would argue at editorially that the Trump administration has not been necessarily favorable towards a lot of the expanded access and other issues in Trump administration elections have consequences they're going to appoint a new director in 2019 and some of those forces who say they're for progressive causes who've been advocates of the status quo I I really do wonder what what they will say come January when a new directors put in place and let me just go through some of the I believe some of the powers that your replacement will have particularly if these entities remain in conservatorship you know wouldn't the next FHFA director have the authority to lower loan limits within statutory limits their statutory requirements related yes would would he or she had the authority to and in some argue that as conservator we could disregard the loan limits companies could even be but I don't I don't agree with that but a future director my future director might would he or she has the authority to tighten minimum credit requirements yes would he or she had the authority to raise the overall G fee and increase the loan level price adjustments yes whether he or she have the authority to reduce GSC's offerings of certain loan types yes and in an area that you've leaned in and I think appropriately would he or she have the authority to move GSEs to fully based risk pricing while at the same time rolling back affordability goals and duties cervicals yes so all of the work that you've been able to move forward by leaving these entities and can save that conservatorship a new director particularly appointed by this administration could roll back all that progress into it administrative Lea without any input from Congress is that not correct I think that is right obviously it would have could some of those decisions could have consequences for the economy and I would assume that those consequences would be taken into account because this is a substantial part of the economy so whatever whatever decisions get made I hope they get made in a right but we're hoping based upon maybe a new enlightened presidential appointee I'm not sure I would put I would make a large wager on a appointee that would follow your direction in the agency I also you know some of the more recent actions that some of us have been talking about it actually I think some of the proposals we've been talking about would have dramatically increased the amount of resources going to low and moderate income homeowners and I think hopefully will be a a guidepost on a going-forward basis I just don't understand some of the folks who seem to be caught up with status quo thinking that status quo was going to be maintained and that your progressive leadership is going to be replaced by this administration's appointee come January when that personal people at Ford last couple of seconds here wouldn't the the new director also have the ability to put the entities through receivership and what would be the effects of putting these entities through receivership the authority is there the impact of doing that would be to erase without some legislation that did otherwise would be to erase the the government backing and so that would certainly be a consequence of that I just leave mr. chairman that that there was a lot of folks who have been reluctant to fully engage and you have fully engaged and I appreciate your work with our office but a lot of folks you've been reluctant to fully engage on what a legislative solution would be that would still make sure we have that kind of access and affordability and my great fear is having indicated all the powers that a director has under conservatorship that come next year at this point in time there may be a lot of folks saying gosh we've missed a really great opportunity Thank You mr. chairman thank you

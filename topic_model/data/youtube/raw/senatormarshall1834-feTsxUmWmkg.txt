thank you chairman and welcome mr boudreau i think i want to start by talking about 30 30. and of course i wish i had more details but i just want to make sure that we're on the same page do you recognize that private property is protected by the constitution and is a really a foundation of every right we have and as we put that into into context here um i'm just very concerned about private property being seized or being taken out of production i wish you could tell me what 30 30 means and the direction that you would take the department if given the opportunity but i think the real question that i think you could answer is the economic impact of taking productive farm or grazing land out of production so kansas is only about three percent of the land is in in parks so to speak the other 97 is in private hands and production what do you think the economic impact would be of taking 30 percent of the farmland out of production to to rule america and to this to this nation yeah thank you very much obviously i'm not part of the administration yet um but if confirmed look forward to becoming involved in uh the 30 by 30 conservation initiative my understanding and i think secretary holland has been very clear that um 30 by 30 is meant to be an inclusive approach to comprehensive conservation which includes where you know you have willing private parties participation from private landowners in conservation we've seen great examples of that um you know earlier you know speaking with senator king about the katahdin woods and waters national monument that was a donation by the quimby family to the federal government to uh establish a a national monument for the purpose of conservation that was voluntary that is you know a private landowner thinking through what she thought was best for uh for that land and so um with i fully respect private property and the rights of landowners over their private property and where a landowner wants to be used that land for conservation i think there should be avenues by which to do that certainly i'm in favor of voluntary conservation too but i just want you to hopefully acknowledge the economic impact of even what you described i'm not sure what that land was in but even permanent easements of land that was being used for cattle grazing or was being used for agriculture turning it into a voluntary easement certainly hurts the local economy and the idea of taking 30 percent of kansas farmland and pasture land out of production would literally ruin in the kansas economy

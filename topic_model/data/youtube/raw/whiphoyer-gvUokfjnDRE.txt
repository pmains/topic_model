the chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland mr. Hoyer for five minutes the gentleman is recognized five minutes Mr Speaker I was here when Democrats and Republicans came together to enact bipartisan tax reform in 1986 we paid for our tax overhaul and never once asked future generations to foot the bill President Trump said in July that tax reform is and I quote going to be easy I'll admit that to someone like him who is new to government who may not understand fully how Congress works that what we achieved in 1986 may in hindsight appear to have been easy it wasn't it was difficult because it required compromise it was difficult because it required trust and it was difficult because it required both parties to make tough choices and share the burden of taking responsibility along with the benefit of claiming victory somewhere along the way mr. speaker it seems that many in the Republican party lost sight of this truth first on health care and now on taxes they've decided that would be far easier not to work with Democrats at all so they've chosen a partisan path were the only ones with whom they have compromised are themselves it's going to be easy they said and the result we now expect on this floor a bill so dangerous and so reprehensible to the taxpayers of this country that nearly every major organization representing taxpayers small businesses workers farmers seniors Home Builders Realtors teachers and I could go on oppose this bill there are more serious problems with the Republican tax bill than time to address them on this floor so I want to highlight the three that make it so utterly dangerous to our economy and to the middle class first most of the benefits of the tax cuts Republicans are proposing will benefit only those at the very top 1% the 99% left behind according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy centers latest analysis under the Republican plan 47 percent of the tax cuts will benefit that top 1% just 1.2 million households making more than $900,000 a year let me repeat the top 1% will get nearly half of all the tax all the tax cuts in this bill and 50% for the 99% second the Republican plan raises taxes on 36 million middle-class families that's not what the speaker said him is gonna do he said to get everybody a tax cut that was not true and is not true 36 million middle-class American households will see their taxes go up over the next 10 years as a result of this Republican plan and third Republican plan will explode the debt by more than 1.7 trillion dollars over the next decade this bill is the granddaddy of all debt creators this being that those tax cuts more than half of which benefit only the top one and a half percent will be paid for by a huge tax increase on our children and on our grandchildren the late senator Russell long of Louisiana like to satan' old ditty about who gets stuck with a pain of tax increase he said don't tax if you don't tax me tax that fellow behind the tree meaning of course that none of the voters want a tax increase so if you raise taxes make sure it's someone else who's out of sight and out of mind in this case sadly mr. speaker that fellow behind the tree is a child this is a tax increase on all those children it's a child who can't vote and doesn't have a voice in this debate the Republican plan asked members to pile 1.7 trillion or more of debt on to our children and grandchildren and put the fiscal sustainability of our country at further risk and when confronted with this fact we hear only the same arguments we heard in 2001 and 2003 before the last major Republican effort to cut taxes precipitated the worst recession in our memory and a period of severe budget tightening that led to disinvestment in our country under the threat of sequestration and that argument flawed and false is that these tax cuts will grow the economy so much that the ensuing growth will magically erase all the deficits we know their plan will accrue so easy mr. speaker so easy the cuts will simply pay for themselves we're told we've been told that before of course the cycle repeats Republican promises that tax cuts will pay for themselves followed by massive deficits a hundred and eighty nine percent increase in the deficit under Ronald Reagan followed by Republicans insisting that we respond with austere cuts to investments in our people and in opportunity so easily they forget but middle-class Americans will not forget who is responsible when their taxes go up when their tax increases pay for tax cuts for the top one percent and when in the years ahead more and more investments need to be cut to pay the interest on the debt under which this plan will bury the children and grandchildren of America and all because my colleagues across the aisle wanted to skip out on doing what they knew would be hard just as they did when former Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave camp introduced his comprehensive tax form that was responsibly paid for that's Dave Camp Republican state of Michigan he's retired now but he offered a responsible bill and it was not even considered by his committee he asked his colleagues to do something hard of course but they dismissed it dismissed it out of hand because it would have required hashing out a difficult compromise but easy is no synonym for successful President Kennedy told us that we do these things we choose these things that is tackling our greatest challenges not because they are easy but because they are hard so I asked my Republican friends no I urged them set aside this dangerous reckless possible bill instead let's choose the hard path that involves hard choices and trust and all those things that made tax reform successful in 1986 which are the missing elements in this flawed bill mr. speaker Democrats are ready to sit down with you and work on this challenge together it won't be easy that's a promise but if we do it together if we do it in a way that doesn't balloon the debt or raise taxes on the middle class we have a chance to do it right let's take that chance

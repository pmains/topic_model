welcome back to State of the Union I'm Dana Bash president Trump's racist attacks this week on four Democratic Congress women came as he is already campaigning for a reelection bid which begs the question is this controversy helping President Trump with those kings key swing state voters well joining me now is a senator from one of those swing states that president Trump won in 2016 Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee thank you so much for joining me this morning senator I have to start by asking you about president Trump's tweet just this morning continuing his attacks on those progressive congresswoman here's what he tweeted in part I don't believe the for Congress women are capable of loving our country do you agree with the president that they are not capable of loving the United States good morning Donna you know I would say in general the whole America love it or leave it is not a new sentiment you know back in the 60s that wasn't considered racist I just find it very unfortunate that so many parts of our public debate right now are getting neatly stuck inside a racial framework when what I would like to see is us moving toward that colorblind society I was hoping when President Obama was elected you'd really go a long way toward healing the racial divide so we can concentrate on these enormous challenges facing this nation where we really could embrace dr. King's a sentiment that let's judge people on the basis of the content of their character and the color of their skin so I would like to see everybody I'd like to see everybody reduce the rhetoric and let's start dealing with these enormous challenges facing this nation in good-faith effort you know Donna I truly believe that Americans by and large all have the same goal in mind we all want a safe prosperous and secure America let's concentrate in those shared goals and let's start tackling some of these problems fair point but when the president of the United States tweets first last week send them back which for people like you and me maybe it doesn't hit a hit a you know accord and and strike a nerve but for people of color it does because many of them have heard that you know in their communities in a very negative way still even in 2019 so given that and today's that they are capable of loving this country how was the president doing practicing what you just preached okay now I understand people you know not like he to hear that and again I would like to see everybody tone down the rhetoric and start concentrating on the big problem so what I refers we start talking about these enormous challenges you've been down on the border you understand the overwhelming nature that crisis let's start focusing on that which by the way I'm doing you know you had Cory Booker on yeah I'm a co-sponsor with him on the fair chance at you know we voted in the first step act I mean those are things that the president Trump champions so let's concentrate on the problems and let's start looking at some some non-partisans to lose I have I have a lot of questions about issues but I just feel like because this is the President of the United States the leader of your party who won your state with votes from your constituents I just it's an incumbent I think upon me and maybe you to be more clear do you disavow his statements last week and this morning or not and then we're gonna move on yeah well again the President did not like the chant I didn't like the chant and Israelis would do that what about his tweet this morning saying they're not capable of loving the country I mean that's his opinion I don't agree with it okay all right so let's move on to talk about some of the big issues including international issues Iran seized two British tankers British taker ships rather this morning in the Strait of Hormuz on and this on Friday this happened they're still holding one of those ships captive now and this comes as the US according to CNN reporting is looking at possibly being more hawkish and toned towards Iran so you chaired the Homeland Security Committee you sit on the Foreign Relations Committee is the US headed closer to war with Iran I hope not but let's face it Iran has been a malign influence the largest state-sponsored terror since its founding back in in the late seventies you go down the list of the Beirut bombing or the IEDs they supply in the Iraq war their involvement in Syria and Yemen that is why we were so opposed to the Iranian agreement because it pushed it allowed hundreds of more than hundred billion dollars of of money to flow into the economy in the military of the largest state sponsor of terror and by the way as you see as they've increased their enrichment of uranium it did nothing to stop their nuclear weapon program so again I think Iran is playing a very very dangerous game it makes no sense that they'd go after the UK I think they were trying to divide the u.s. from from our friends and allies they're just uniting us in and hopefully standing up to Iran once and for all demanding they never have a nuclear weapon and to end their missile their ballistic missile technology and their malign and a sponsor of terrorism around the region around the world let's talk about the border u.s. homeland security chair I know you have been working very hard to come up with a bipartisan solution to the crisis there the humanitarian crisis and and the whole crisis overall currently are you any closer to that as you're talking to your Democratic colleagues behind the scenes I think we took a good step but it's just a baby step in signing a letter support for Operation safe return where we rapidly and more accurately determine those families that clearly don't have even a credible fear claim and safely and I underline safely return those individuals back to the safe zones of Central America now again it's it's it's a first step but but Danny you you understand the overwhelming nature of the problem essentially that chart and your jaw dropped I mean since since 2014 that was the humanitarian crisis here and President Obama declared it humanitarian crisis 120,000 unaccompanied children but primarily people coming as a family unit end of this country illegally we've had 1 million 148,000 unaccompanied children and family members enter this country illegally been apprehended and they've been dispersed all over America it's overwhelmed our our adjudicators system we've only removed about 12,000 of that of the bumpa 820,000 family members that's about one and half percent so it that creates a huge incentive for more people there's a survey done in Guatemala a third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States that's about five point eight million people depopulating Guatemala and Central America that's not good for Central America it's not good for so there are so many components to this issue this problem the the destroyed public institutions because the drug cartels because of our insatiable demand for drugs I mean the fact that we create these huge incentives and pull factors we have a weapon system so we have so I'm trying to work with my prank guys to fix it ok so there's a multi-tiered multi-layered very complex problem which has been going on and is reached new heights in recent months but to figure that out you have to have people who are willing to take a political hit from their own party and talk to people on the other side of the aisle is that gonna happen well I had three Democrats join in the letter and that was doug jones and and joe Manchin and and Kirsten cinnamon really kind of loved that effort but I was really working very closely with my ranking member Gary Peters Tom Carper called me wanted to be constructive so I think there is goodwill in the Senate to try and fix this problem but all the components I mean what do you do with the 8 million people in this country undocumented that are in the workforce you know you have the dreamers yet what do you do with the 1.1 1.1 1.2 million people have come in since 2012 daca as a fat part of the family in that nobody's talking about you know what do we do with those individuals so this is an enormous challenging what do you do to help create development in Central America so people don't feel that they want to move to America basically economic migrants which is not a valise island claim so again we could spend this entire program and barely scratch the surface of all the complexity of this problem but we have to start from my standpoint reduce that flow of people come in this country exploiting our broken Asylum system focus on that while we've certainly try and help the Central America well you gave viewers I think the glimmer of hope that they're at is actually a conversation being had between conservatives like you and some maybe some moderate Democrats and even some more liberals to try to get beyond the politics and fix the crisis thank you so much senator appreciate it every day thank

thank you mr chairman as a lead republican on the worker and family support subcommittee i do believe it's important for parents to have the ability to stay home after their child was born or adopted and i think we have to make sure that parents in our workforce can balance the competing demands of work and raising their families and i am grateful that we're actually having this hearing today because i think we can do this i think can be bipartisan i think it can be bicameral and i think we can actually get together and do something productive for the american people which is what they want so i am all in on being a part of shaping this and looking for solutions i do support policies that will help all working parents succeed in their in their careers and thrive at home as we've seen so far in this hearing both sides agree on the importance of paid family leave it works it has been shown to reduce preventable deaths of new mothers and babies and it makes families and communities stronger obviously what we've been talking about for the last couple hours we're disagreeing on on the concept of what does this actually look like and how do we pay for it the idea of a new one-size-fits-all top-down federal government program we've seen over and over that these big government programs seldom live up to their lofty promises and don't help everyone in fact they often end up hurting those they're supposed to help the family act that we're discussing today would increase payroll taxes which will have a disproportionate income on low-income americans and small business higher taxes and inflexible government mandates i don't think are the way to go forward we should be working together on a path forward toward a shared goal of expanding access to paid family leave so ms gregor let me just start by asking you according to the center on budget and policy priorities payroll taxes as we all know are regressive low and moderate income taxpayers pay more of their incomes in payroll tax than high income people on average would you say that the family act would institute a regressive tax on low-income individuals and small businesses to subsidize high-income earners in large corporations the tax under the family act is the same as the social security tax so yes that's regressive and what i fear from this is we're trying to help low-income earners but we don't want to do that in a way that makes lower-income earners pay for middle and upper income earners to take paid family leave and when we talk about the tax cuts and jobs act the one thing that i thought and i was grateful to mr keller for bringing up this issue but when we worked on this issue of tax reform keeping families in mind and keeping the bond between employer and employee right smack dab up in front we looked at the concept of a universal savings account and i'm sitting here for the first two hours today literally thinking to myself this is such a great starting point because what we were talking about and what we could honestly do is take that as a starting point a universal savings account that any employee and every employee can put in a bank take it out for whatever reason not even having to give a reason just be able to withdraw that money when they need it and i'm sitting here thinking to myself big federal plans take all the individual a lot of it away and you do get trapped in the you know written 30-day plan having somebody you know go through the rules and regs that were set up but but i'd rather and i think the folks in my district would rather be in charge of their future have direct direct control over it make their own decisions take care of those times when they actually need to pull that money from an account and i'm also interested in um ms levine i'm i'm all about modeling and and i love to hear the plan that you have in washington but it doesn't even start till january of next year correct it's still a model and waiting for the startup so we what one has to do is first build up the collections so we're in premium collection mode and in fact our beta with our employers started last week on april 30th it's going quite well thank you right and uh and so we then will be able to start paying out benefits starting january 1st of 2020. gotcha but to actually have that aggregate data that we say here's what washington did and here's how it worked absolutely we really can't get that until probably the end of next year what we're doing is building in what i call heart monitors to really be able to track that very closely which also does require investing in the systems that allow you to track that information so absolutely right and to be able to invest in outreach so that we can increase awareness among both employers and and workers so that people know to utilize and i want your plan to work but i'm just saying it really rolls january 1st of next year correct okay and then um ms gregor just really quickly um the concept of being a small business being able to pool and do something like that can you add any um intel on that yeah i mean that would be another great way is to expand what we've done with association health plans and allow small employers to pool together and i could see this working well through a short-term disability insurance policy and so that's something that would certainly increase access thank you very much i yield back mr chairman

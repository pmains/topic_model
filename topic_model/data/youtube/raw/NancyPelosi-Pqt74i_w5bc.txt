listen madam Speaker I think this bill goes to the farthest extreme in trying to take women down not just a peg but take them in shackles to some cave somewhere 25 years ago this body passed em Tala a bill that basically said anyone that shows up at an emergency room would access health care no questions asked now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to amend that law and basically say oh except for a woman who is in need of an abortion or except for a woman who's bleed who happens to be pregnant or except for a woman who is miscarrying basically what this bill would do is say that any Hospital could decline to provide services to one class of people in this country and that one class of people are pregnant women now let me tell you something my story is pretty well known now but I was pregnant I was miscarrying I was bleeding if I had to go from one hospital to the next trying to find one emergency room that would take me in who knows if I would even be here today and what the my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are attempting to do is misogynist it is absolutely misogynist the time has come for us to stop taking up this issue over and over again this year and do something that the American people really care about they want jobs they want to be able to hold on to their homes they want some mortgage relief and what do we do we stand here on the floor and create yet another opportunity for women to be cast in shackles I yield back to my colleague thank you so much for that compelling love story how

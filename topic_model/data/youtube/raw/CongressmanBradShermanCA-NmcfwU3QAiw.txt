. AND THE AMENDMENT IS AGREED TO. FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA SEEK RECOGNITION?   DESK. THE CHAIR: THE CLERK WILL  DESIGNATE THE AMENDMENT. THE CLERK: AMENDMENT NUMBER 88  PRINTED IN THE CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD OFFERED BY MR. SHERMAN OF CALIFORNIA. THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN IS  RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. SHERMAN: AMERICAN GAS PRICES ARE TOO HIGH. THE PRESSURE IS ON THIS CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS DONE  SOMETHING ABOUT IT BY RELEASING  OIL AT A STRATEGIC TIME FROM THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE. AND GAS PRICES ARE DOWN FROM  THEIR PEAK. BUT AMERICANS WANT MORE. BUT THEY WANT REAL ACTION. AND INSTEAD, THEY GET WHAT IS  NOTHING MORE THAN A TWO-DAY  FRAUD ON THIS HOUSE FLOOR. A BILL THAT WOULD DO ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING TO REDUCE OIL PRICES OR  GAS PRICES. AND YET, BY SPENDING TWO DAYS ON THIS FLOOR, BY MAKING THIS THE  BILL OF THE WEEK, WE FOOL THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO THINKING  THAT CONGRESS IS DOING  SOMETHING. NOW, HOW UTTERLY MEANINGLESS IS  THIS BILL? IT WOULD DO NOTHING TO INCREASE  OIL PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED  STATES. IT CALLS NOT ONLY FOR A PLAN TO  BE CREATED, NOT NECESSARILY  IMPLEMENTED. IT IMPLIES IT WOULD DO  SOMETHING. A SPIKE IN OIL -- AND FINALLY,  EVEN IF MORE OIL IS PRODUCED IN  THE UNITED STATES, IT WILL BE  EXPORTED AND WILL LOWER THE  WORLD PRICE PERHAPS BY A PENNY. THIS IS A MESSAGING BILL. ITS MESSAGE IS TO ATTACK  PRESIDENT BIDEN, SOMEONE THAT  HAS DONE SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY  REDUCE GAS PRICES. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL  DOES. IT CALLS FOR A PLAN. WELL, IF THE ADMINISTRATION  WANTS TO GIVE US A PLAN, THEY'D  GIVE US A PLAN. WASHINGTON IS FILLED WITH PLANS. THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE HAS A PLAN. EVERYBODY'S GOT A PLAN. SO WE DRAFT ANOTHER PLAN. WHAT DOES THAT DO? NOW, IT FORCES THE  ADMINISTRATION TO WRITE A PLAN  ABOUT LEASING MORE LAND FOR OIL  DRILLING. THEY'RE FREE TO LIST PARCELS  WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S NO OIL AND NOBODY WANTS TO BID. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO DO A PLAN, THAT'S THE PLAN THEY'LL GIVE US. LET'S SAY THEY GIVE US A PLAN  THAT THE MAJORITY SEEMS TO WANT. THEY CAN WRITE THE PLAN. A COMPANY WITH A LETTER  EXPLAINING THAT THEY THINK IT  WON'T REDUCE OIL PRICES, THAT  IT'S BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT,  AND, THEREFORE, THEY'RE NOT  GOING TO IMPLEMENT IT. SO NOW WE HAVE A PLAN THAT'S  SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY WANT AND A  LETTER SAYING WHY IT WON'T BE  IMPLEMENTED. THIS IS WHAT WE OFFER THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE? IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILL  THAT REQUIRES A PLAN, WE OUGHT  TO ADOPT THIS AMENDMENT THAT  OFFERS THE ADMINISTRATION A  CHANCE TO CREATE A DIFFERENT  KIND OF PLAN. A PLAN TO PROHIBIT OR LIMIT  EXPORTS. THE ILLUSTRATION OF HOW  IMPORTANT THIS IS CAN BE SEEN  JUST NORTH OF OUR BORDER. CANADA PRODUCES TWICE AS MUCH  OIL AS THEY CONSUME, AND THEIR  CONSUMERS ARE PAYING $2 GALLON  MORE THAN WE'RE PAYING. SO PRODUCING MORE OIL INSIDE  YOUR COUNTRY DOESN'T SEEM TO  LOWER OIL PRICES FOR THOSE  LIVING TO THE NORTH OF THE  UNITED STATES. WHY? BECAUSE THE OIL IS SIMPLY  EXPORTED AT THE WORLD PRICE. NOW, THAT GUARANTEES IF WE  ACTUALLY PRODUCED MORE IN THE  OIL UNITED STATES AND EXPORTED  IT, MORE PROFITS FOR OIL  COMPANIES BUT NO REDUCTION IN  THE PRICE. INSTEAD, IF WE HAD A PLAN TO  LIMIT OR LOWER EXPORTS, WE'LL  LOWER THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS. AND I BELIEVE IN MANY CASES WE  WOULD LOWER THE PRICE OF OIL  PAID FOR BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TO COME TO THIS FLOOR WITH A  BILL REQUIRING A PLAN IN  ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS OF  PLANS THAT EXIST, THEY WANT TO  CREATE A PLAN FOR THE  ADMINISTRATION THAT DOESN'T WANT TO CREATE. ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO  CREATE A PLAN THEY DON'T LIKE. ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO  CREATE A PLAN THEY WOULD LIKE  AND REFUSE TO IMPLEMENT IT. AND TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING TO  LOWER THE PRICE OF GASOLINE. WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE MORE OIL  IN THIS COUNTRY IN 2023 THAN ANY OTHER YEAR IN OUR HISTORY. SO THIS IS A MESSAGE BILL THAT'S SENDING A FALSE MESSAGE. WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE MORE OIL  IN 2023 THAN ANY OTHER YEAR. BUT EVEN IF WE DID LEASE MORE  LAND AND EVEN IF THEY DID DRILL  ON IT, THAT IS A RESPONSE THAT  MIGHT AFFECT US IN 2025. WHY DON'T WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL LOWER GAS PRICES NOW? SO YOU KNOW, IF WE WANT TO  ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS OF  TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING OR THAT WE WOULD DO SOMETHING BUT IT'S THE  OTHER PARTY'S FAULT, THEN, FOR  GOD'S SAKE, BRING FORWARD A BILL THAT IF ENACTED -- WHICH OF  COURSE WON'T HAPPEN -- BUT IF  ENACTED WOULD ACTUALLY DO  SOMETHING. THIS BILL WILL NOT INCREASE OIL  PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES  AND IF EXPORTE

cognition general is recognized for five minutes for 20 years I've been in this room fighting for XM Bank when it wasn't controversial and what it was this is not only an excellent amendment it is a highly Germaine amendment the purpose of this bill and I speak as its manager here in this room is to let the people and of Iran know that among other things if they stop their support for terrorism this Congress will allow them to get the benefits of Exim Bank and as i said earlier even not in reference to this amendment nothing would bring me more joy than going to the floor and pass and and passing a bill recognizing that Iran had stopped its support for terrorism and would be entitled to a host of commercial benefits from the United States including an especially XM Bank the goal of this bill cannot be met if there is no XM Bank or if the Exim Bank is immobilized this amendment is not just Jermaine it's critical to meet the purpose of the bill in addition this is a bill that deals with decision making at Exim Bank this is an amendment that deals with decision making at XM Bank so it is it is germane more importantly it is critical as the gentleman points out the bill is a nullity as long as the XM Bank is immobilized and so preventing it from being immobilized improving its decision-making process is at the very core of the bill let alone germane to it and I would hope that we would get a ruling that reflects the purpose of the bill

i just i just think it's really important that someone points out that how offensive it is to to be told that in mocking tones that we should be talking about living in fear of pencil pushers or however it is that mr gates just described that that wasn't you know you know what you know we live in fear and in america today kids live in fear of going to school you know why they live in fear of going to school because murderers with ar-15s can come in and gun them down you know how i know that because it happens all the time you know who else lives in fear real fear in america people who go to concerts in churches and synagogues people who go out to dinner people who walk down the street people who go to a parade on the 4th of july the day on which we celebrate our independence and i think also it's a good time just to recall again and we i don't know that we've done this today but when we talk about the declaration of independence declaration of independence of course so important on the 4th of july we also recognize what's in the declaration of independence and that includes those unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i don't know anyone's pointed out today that unalienable just as a i think it's important to be clear unalienable means unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor unable to be taken away the the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is an unalienable right that no one should take away if we have any obligation as the united states congress it is to work to ensure that those unalienable rights are not taken away as they have been time and time and time again by mass shooters with assault weapons which is why we're here today i just thought it was worth pointing that out that's that's what people legitimately live in fear of all across our country every day of the year and yield back gentlemen what purpose does mr gates seek recognition move strike last word gentleman is recognized so if people are in fear of their unalienable rights being taken away we ought to encourage the restoration and vindication of those rights if people are in fear in our churches and in synagogues then this congress should have the responsibility to abolish gun-free zones that make our schools soft targets we should allow for sentinel programs like we have in the state of florida where i think 48 of our 67 counties have adopted measures to allow highly trained individuals to carry firearms into schools and in fact my colleague from florida from broward county his own county has entered that very program so the answer there wasn't taking guns away from law by it was it was highlighting the opportunity to have a good guy with a gun in a position to be able to have well the gentleman wants a few other points to make and that i'd be glad to also i don't know that like the argument that mr deutch makes is responsive to the massey amendment like if his argument is well we have to preserve the unalienable rights of life like please walk me through the scenario where the department of education and the department of agriculture being armed to the teeth is necessary to protect our rights i tell you what mr deutch i'll yield to you for the sake of explaining to me how an armed department of education protects those important rights we all care about so much well i appreciate your yielding time um the time that i asked for you to yield is for you to answer the question of whether whether the people who who died in parkland died because of a gun-free zone whether the people who went to the parade in highland park on the 4th of july died because of gun-free zone whether the people who went to pulse the people who went to a concert that killed them or was it the assault weapon your own school board believes that getting rid of that entity is a gun-free zone and allowing people to have guns mr gates because you can't no that is the answer and by the way it's not the answer i arrived at it's the answer that in deep blue broward county your own school board arose at so you all get to washington and you have this fervor to take people's guns away but the reality is even in your own community your arguments are being rejected and you have no answer for the massive amendment which would which would in turn how about you claim time when it's on your side but the massey amendment says we don't want the department of education to be able to have more arms than the people of our country law abiding gun owners right worked in uvalde it was the cops who didn't go to work and didn't respond to that so you so you can offer the missives all you want but when we actually wait and see the facts bear out and we see the way governments respond to them we actually see these arguments being consistently rejected i'll yield to you the the facts the facts mr gates the facts are that time and time and time again people are gunned down by assault weapons that's what the facts are they're not gunned down by gun-free zones i'll tell you what mr deutch a lot of people in indiana that has ever walked into a school and slaughtered one of the very the very rifle that was used in indiana to ensure that more people weren't gunned down you abandoned this legislation so that is an example that we don't have to look like far in the past for it's a recent example of the weapons you're trying to ban being used to save and preserve life the argument keeps shifting because there is no good response mr gates to this to the suggestions you just don't like listening to this county that is responding to arming up teachers and volunteers mr gates on a on a day on a day you take the time back one at a time on a day i'll yield to mr deutsch on a day that the families of 17 loved ones sit in a broward county courthouse as they will do day after day after day recounting what happened to their loved ones who were slaughtered by a shooter with an ar-15 the very idea that you're suggesting that broward county has somehow concluded that it was not the man who is on trial for using that ar-15 to gun them down who is responsible but it is okay i'll reclaim my timeline because no one's making that argument the argument isn't who's responsible of course the shooter is responsible by the way you're trying to make law-abiding gun owners responsible you're trying to make the gun itself responsible so we can all agree that the shooter is responsible in this case the question is what is the path forward i would suggest the path forward is not the sicilini bill that would make the gun that was used in indiana to stop the killer and to save lives illegal but the path made forward may be what your own school board members have adopted which is allowing more guns in the hands of responsible people to see my school board members mr gates did not vote to put ar-15s in there don't suggest it you're wrong it is wrong for you to suggest and that's why it's the law there now and on this day in particular time of the gentleman has expired

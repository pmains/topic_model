inside the capitol during the january 6th attack video footage reviewed by cnn shows a close ally of a sitting member of congress in the pro-trump mob that stormed the building anthony aguero a conservative live streamer and associate and close ally of republican congresswoman marjorie taylor greene is seen here he's highlighted in this video green is no stranger to conspiracy theories helped push donald trump's lie of a stolen election and massive voter fraud as we well know but what we're looking at is the first video confirmation that her close ally was inside the capitol that very day just yesterday house lawmakers focused in on the role of domestic extremism in the united states right now i want to play for you what chairwoman congresswoman eliza slotkin said the single greatest threat to our country right now is the threat of domestic terrorism and the tensions and polarization between us the congresswoman joining me now thanks so much for being here the single greatest threat to our security right now um the fbi director really agrees with you he has made clear he's made this clear about domestic extremism as well and the question is a big one which is what can be done about it right now sure well first of all i mean the the most important thing is we need to be resourced to tackle the threat you know and i i'm someone who was a cia officer and pentagon official that that basically decided to go into national security because of 9 11. and we did the same process after 9 11. were we resourced to deal with a foreign terrorism threat did we have enough analysts officers money you know the whole thing law did we have the right law on the books and i think that's a version of what's going on right now and it's very very clear that across the government the federal government there's just not that same focus on domestic terrorism for obvious reasons right civil liberties civil rights we have to be very very careful people have a right to freedom of speech but i think one of the things that that we can do is a make sure we're resourced and then b hold people accountable actually use the law in the books to charge people with terrorism related charges with anti-militia religion related charges that hasn't been the case that often and we talked yesterday about how to increase that given the level of threat can you get this right you talked about a lot of you know what was done post 911 right can you get this right without a 911 style commission i honestly haven't heard anything about that anymore yeah one of the things i'm most frustrated about right now i'll be honest is that we have not been able to come to agreement on the scope of a 911 style commission we all know we need to have it we all know we need to understand what happened that day the failures what led to that um that horrible event and i i will tell you i'm frustrated with both democratic and republican leaders who can't see our way through this to say this is what the country needs um i'm what's up is it is it just sadly just annoying politics of i mean is it just like the makeup of how many democrats and republicans are going to be on this thing so my understanding and i'm not in the room for these negotiations is it's two things it's one that um uh speaker pelosi has sought a larger number of democrats and republicans um and number two that the republicans on the other side are asking that the report look at not just what happened that day but groups like antifa and folks who frankly no intelligence agency say had anything to do with the attack on the capital so it's both scope and numbers and i think the 911 commission should just be our guide equal numbers of democrats and republicans but responsible individuals who believe in the facts of the case and you look at what led up to it and not extraneous groups that weren't related to that day i i have to say that is entirely reasonable and again why people are so frustrated with congress all the time because if you want to get it right and you should because people try to attack all of you on that day learn from it and move on it's this is one of those things that makes people's blood boil at the same time i also have to ask you about k files reporting off the top that just your reaction and to hearing that a close ally of a sitting member of congress yes a close member of congress who gravitates towards conspiracy loves conspiracy loves conspiracy theories and has pushed conspiracy theories no question but the fact that a close ally of a sitting member of congress was among the people rioting on capitol hill and the fact that marjory taylor greene has not responded has not stood up to talk about this yeah i'll be really honest this is a law enforcement matter this is not i mean we can talk about it and we can go back and forth in the media but frankly if allies of members of congress were involved in that attack and then god forbid if they were brought on tours if they perform surveillance if they engage in those things that is a law enforcement matter and i know that the district attorney i'm sorry the the attorney general of the district of columbia is looking at that right now it gives me chills when you think about the fact that they might be giving them tours it still does even though we've been talking about it now for for for months um can i change directions with you because voting rights are under attack across the country and we just are seeing now that michigan is now joining this national push republicans in michigan to restrict voter access republican lawmakers they have just filed 40 bills yesterday in the state senate and the republicans say there it's about voter integrity and the same things that we've heard from republicans in other key states that you know democrats made big gains in in 2020. what do you call this effort that's happening in your state i mean i think what's going on across the country and now michigan unfortunately is this kind of cut and paste from states that are attempting to restrict access to voting and the bills are very very similar this is not creative thinking on behalf of the michigan republicans this is cutting and pacing from what other states are doing um and it you know i think for me when i look at these bills people have lost their way if they're feeling about how to win and and how important it is to win for their side involves making it harder to vote for people they have lost their way as a group as a lawmaker and luckily we have uh our governor here who i'm sure would veto any bills that passed through uh the legislature but i do think uh you know based on my background you sort of uh hope for the best but plan for the worst and if these laws are being enacted in parts of the country you know and disenfranchising people and they survive through the court system we need to make sure that there's voter education and voter registration plans i literally think of like freedom summer you know from the 60s where young people went to these communities to educate voters and make sure that they could still access the vote i think we're going to need to plan on that on the hope you know the unfortunate possibility that some of these laws pass hope for the best plan for the worst there's your mantra for the state of american politics right now congresswoman thank you for coming in thank you coming up for us lies and disinformation that were allowed to spread like wildfire on social media helped

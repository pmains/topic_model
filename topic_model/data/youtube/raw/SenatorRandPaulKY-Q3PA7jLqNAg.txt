thank you Mr chairman I'd like to begin by apologizing for the juvenile diatribe from the ranking member science is about having an open mind science is about disputation debate evidence and it's discussed and the contention and the back and forth is how we determine what the truth is but if you close your mind completely to this and are not willing to listen I think that's how science dies that's when we say well the government consensus or the scientific consensus is this well that's that's the closing of the scientific mind and that's a recipe for a disaster science is also not about ad hominem and attacks so by attacking this panel without listening to it leaving in a huff and having no questions shows a small-mindedness a close-mindedness and really it should be everything that we should avoid I'm not here to be an advocate for one treatment over the other and I will ask some tough questions to the panel but I'm open-minded enough to listen to their side and see and try to determine whether or not it's a good treatment or bad but to immediately close our mind I think it's a bad way of looking at this I had a good friend die yesterday from this so I'm not one who's saying this isn't a deadly disease um she lived a couple doors down and we're sad Kelly and I are both sad about what happened um about six months ago we had a friend who died in their 30s not from the disease but from lack of a stress EKG she died from a terminal arrhythmia in her 30s with two young children but her stress EKG was canceled because uh the government decided that we shouldn't do it it was an elective procedure it was delayed and she died from a terminal arrhythmia so people do also die from the decisions that people make the most important thing is is no one person is right the panelists are not all right and people should question them and go back and forth and we try to figure out the truth from that but it's a mistake to say that one person should have all the power to determine what we should do and we place too much confidence in government doctors such as Dr fauci Dr Corey mentioned that he mentioned in June about steroids I mentioned it in March when Dr fauci came into my Committee hearing my first thought about the final pathway here with covet in the end stages is it's not too dissimilar from other final Pathways of adult respiratory distress syndrome I had a friend who's a surgeon who got the strep eating flesh from operating on somebody who had it and a blood splatter he got it the chance of losing your limbs is like 50 to 70 percent it's like a 50 chance of losing all your limbs it's a devastating disease but one of the final common Pathways like covet is your blood vessels leak fluid into your lungs it's a sort of a toxic shock kind of syndrome uh they treated him with high dose steroids and so I raised my hand to Dr fauci and said do you think steroids might have a role in this and he sort of dismissed me and said that the studies were showing that it probably wouldn't work but I would think most people would argue now that one of the most significant developments in the acute care of the covid patient has been the steroids actually and trying to get them the steroids before they've gotten into the the full ards syndrome um some are even getting it at a very early stage in in the disease but that came from people asking questions being skeptical and not letting one doctor such as Dr falci say oh that's not right young man go sit in the corner we need to have an open mind I'm not saying I'm always right I'm about AI standard I'm not an expert included but I try to ask the important questions one of the questions that I'd like to ask and I think this is the difficulty of proving the situation on either Ivermectin or Hydro hydroxychloride hydroxychloroquine is that because so many people get better you know the control group might be 99 of the people get better then you give hydroxychloroquine to this same group and you might get 99.5 per it's going to be a difficult thing to actually prove in trials that you get a benefit it sounds like in some of the sicker patients where you had a mortality um you know where you had a 25 mortality down to 15 that does sound significant now you're getting into the sicker patients with the outpatient studies one of the critiques is that so many people get better naturally how are you proving that it is statistically significant and what comes to mind mind is sort of like when we wanted to prove that aspirin taking an aspirin a day was good to prevent heart attacks it took like 10 years and 10 000 you know people in the study because it was it was just hard to show the differences whether an aspen worked or not I think the same thing is true with either hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin in an outpatient setting is that because so many people get better on their own the converse is when you're really sick because almost because it's hard to get to to treat people who are very sick it's hard to prove that anything works when people are very sick but I guess what I'd like to do is open it for the panel one by one to explain how we answer the critique that most of these paper people are getting better anyway so how you've proven that your treatment works in a group of people who didn't go to the hospital so that you're selecting out actually for the people who may well then you know did you prevent them from getting seriously sick or have you select it out as your patient pool because they're outpatient tending to be people are going to get better why don't we uh we'll start with those who are here we'll start with Dr Oscar and then we'll go to Dr Corey and let me quick interject because we have such low participation take whatever time you you have for whatever questions you have doctor thank you very much senator Paul and I appreciate your your introduction I'm not here as a politician here as a treater I'll be very practical and I'll defer to Dr Corey from his experience as an intensivist my clinical approach to patients are that they have symptoms that I treat them early and I typically restratify patients getting uh LDH levels lymphocyte counts and other other blood panels whenever possible I when I've used hydroxychloroquine I've and and oftentimes cybermectin I've had patients go to the hospital if I didn't have an EKG or another good assessment and I've always clinically evaluated the patients I've treated but I re-stratify them uh you you may or may not know a husband and wife couple that I know Dr John Senator Johnson knows who I treated the wife and not the husband because I didn't deem the husband to be sick enough to Warrant treatment although perfectly safe to but his wife was much sicker so I think this has to be to some degree left in a discussion of the clinicians in terms of the data I provided the clerk of this committee Miss Kilbride uh PDFs of numerous clinical trials on many of these drugs not limited but including hydroxychloroquine Ivermectin vitamin D zinc and a few other medications and those trials are there but the fact that we've had third world countries Second World countries that have been more Innovative and have outperformed us in terms of survival I think is something that warrants uh questioning and it's one has to wonder if our bloated research academic bureaucracy has been excuse me has been more of a hindrance than a help during this Health Care crisis but I'll turn this to whomever I hope that's satisfactory Dr Corey senator Paul I appreciate your question and it's it's critical the the the the content of your question which is how can we tell when something's working when many patients get better and there's only one answer to that and we know what that is and it's one of the the central tenets of science which is you need a control group you need to have a group that is comparable to those that you treat and then you compare them to those that you don't treat what I am trying to message today is in our manuscript we now have 11 randomized controlled trials every one of those controlled trials show that in the Ivermectin treated group lives are saved there's less need for hospitalization there's less transmission less case counts it is a fundamentally and powerfully effective therapy against covet 19. we need the NIH to review these data we have the data let me say the amount of patients and those randomized controlled trials the 11 trials total nearly 4 000 with over half treated with Ivermectin let's remind ourselves that the treatment of covid-19 fundamentally changed after the recovery trial was announced in June that was a trial of 6 000 patients two thousand were treated with steroids and it showed the dramatic and life-saving properties of corticosteroids almost overnight the treatment of covid-19 changed as a result of that trial that was the recovery trial I am presenting a paper today with more patients treated with Ivermectin with larger magnitudes of benefit than the recovery trial I will maintain Ivermectin should be the standard of care of this disease based on these data it's not my opinion it's the data we have the data if you give anyone else a placebo based on the data that's in our manuscript I I believe that would be malpractice and you would lead to the to the heightened risk of death no more Placebo is needed so the 11 studies are inpatient or inpatient and outpatient they they vary so the randomized controlled trials it I I almost can't describe what this data shows people need to read the manuscript we have four randomized controlled trials in prophylaxis each and every one highly statistically significant patients or people even citizens healthy citizens on Ivermectin do not get cold and you're comparing it to Placebo in these studies you're considering yes yes so in in the prophylaxis studies alone which is four they took covid-19 patients who tested positive for covet 19. they identified their household members they gave them Ivermectin so they had a whole group of household contacts of covid-19 patients who took Ivermectin the other households they didn't give Ivermectin every single randomized controlled trial shows that in the households that were on Ivermectin drastically reduced rates of transmission the they did not the households did not get sick you can protect people from this disease with Ivermectin that's just the prophylaxis trials the outpatient trials for the outcome tested was how many people were positive positive were positive or how many people got symptoms and they were drastically statistically significant these are and from multiple centers and countries around the world that's just the prophylaxis we also have trials on early outpatient as well as Hospital the most dramatic is the hospital each almost every single one we have four large randomized controlled trials in the hospital all statistically significant reductions mortality Dr Ryder has a large observational control trial from uh Broward County and he's here on the panel today in his trial he also showed the same the patients who got Ivermectin died at far less rates and opponents of using ivermectum have they responded to these critique these has there been a generalized argument that they make or it's been silenced so the opponents again I want to call attention to the NIH and their recommendation I don't say that they're an opponent they made their last recommendation on Ivermectin on August 27th which is either 10 years ago or four months ago I don't know which August 27th this was their recommendation we recommend against the use of ivermectin outside of clinical trials that recommendation was based on expert opinion only there was no data to recommend or recommend against it was an expert opinion well I'll be happy to join with the chairman in sending a letter to try to get an evaluation if we could go to the same question if we've got Tom Newman uh why don't we go to the rest of the panel and ask the same question the the problem sort of from my perspective still being how do you determine an outcome of something that when you do nothing the vast majority of outpatients actually get better also start with Dr Ryder thank you for allowing me to speak so to clarify something people talk about asymptomatic patients but I have kind of stopped using that nomenclature I call them pre-symptomatic patients we do not know offhand which one of these asymptomatic patients are going to develop severe disease and become symptomatic that is problem number one problem number two when I put in my written testimony and also during my early testimony I talk about the early intervention and treatment to decrease viral shedding and viral Transmission in the home setting and that is currently believed to be the largest numbers of people getting infected or getting infected in the home setting so that means a 20 to 30 year old may do fine but now comes Christmas there is a family meeting and that asymptomatic individual now infects other family members including their 70 80 90 year old grandma and now we have a real problem what we do know about Ivermectin is that it literally destroys the virus in most people within 48 hours so hence you take somebody who is asymptomatic but a carrier with the risk of transmission and you essentially stop that right in their tracks so you don't have an issue about that person now contaminating other people down the line or you significantly decrease that risk so that is really even a very different spin on that question that was asked no to continue as far as the data your rights Senator it will be difficult my team currently has a study in place we have the protocols written ready to go the only limiting factor was to get funding I've tried everywhere getting the funding is extremely difficult what we need to do is a large study a large randomized control study to confirm the findings to prove to the naysayers you know what here is your golden standard now the study that I did was a observational study but it was propensity matched that is the highest standard for a non-randomized control trial and even there it shows tremendous benefit you spoke about the reduction in the overall mortality from 25 down to 15. well if you look at the overall mortality in people with severe lung involvement that went from 81 percent down to 39 percent that is in that is even a more dramatic decrease in even these more severe individuals it is a safe drug a track record that is phenomenal 3.7 billion doses administered so I think we need to do those studies with the help of the NIH CDC or any one of those Regulatory Agencies a study like that could be implemented within 30 days within another 30 days from that we could have collected all the data within another two three weeks from that we should be able to have answers if things are moved forward through the Regulatory Agencies we couldn't have our answers before the strategy even worsens Dr Balboni great thank you and thank you senator Paul for the question I think uh I'll speak uh to the trials that we're running for private peer reviewer broad spectrum antiviral targeting um uh RNA dependent RNA polymerase we're running currently two large placebo-controlled randomized phase three trials in the outpatient setting early treatment and close exposure propyl axis in addition there are two phase twos one at Stanford in the outpatient setting and and in long-term care as well there are observational studies with with thousands of data points um and hundreds of smaller trials having been run in many countries around the world we need to develop hybrid trial methodologies to combine all of these traditional rcts and observational study designs to gather real world evidence um for for The Regulators if we don't cool all of these data we're going to see covid-19 in our rear view mirror we're going to quickly forget about it and all of these potential treatments are going to fall by the wayside so I agree with you we need to gather the data will be large populations but we have to make that commitment the only way we can make these these these studies work is a true public-private partnership single companies as we've heard don't have the ability or the incentive to run these trials that the peer reviewer by the way is off patent we're doing that we're doing this at risk as a Consortium there's very little support for this kind of work and as soon as it falls away we've got to be beholden to our shareholders and our boards in the meantime as a physician I'm trying to do the right thing for patients um we need the assistance we need government help this has to be a whole of government approach and a commitment to going Beyond this immediate problem which is pressing and in our bases but to to do the right thing over the Long Haul to gather the data to uh to silence uh to silence the the criticisms of of these kinds of studies multiple small studies won't work as you correctly point out um so this is what we need um gather the data bundle it together and and make this available for future outbreaks and the last thing I'll say is that as part of our trials um it is true that if we were to look only at mortality data these trials would be unacceptably large and would take too long to run we have been working with The Regulators to look at time to resolution of symptoms similar to what was done with also tamavir or Tamiflu we believe that that is a a stepwise approach um but it but it's taking uh too long uh to to do this we don't have a whole of government approach um to this problem and so I so I asked the committee those present and those who have decided not to ask questions to just please internalize this message we need a whole government approach similar to what was done with vaccines to gather the data to do exactly what you said which is uh get to these large populations to show a difference so next Doctor Orient I see Senator Hall only on the computer so we're going to check to see whether he wants to ask questions but Dr Orient you want to answer that question senator Paul that's an excellent question that certainly applies to all types of research I would say if you have a really sick patient in the sense you have a controlled uh historical control in that patient if the patient is going downhill and you do something and the patient gets better then that that is evidence that maybe you did something right on the other hand if you have a patient who's doing pretty well and you do something and the patient suddenly gets worse then you have to be worried that you might have caused that problem if you have a patient a bunch of patients who are healthy and they're going to do well no matter what then then I guess you really need to have a large study and it will select with Ivermectin they they have done that they're they're of course many confounding variables and and then they're the ethical questions if you have something that's going to protect your grandma if it works and and doing nothing is going to put your grandma at risk then then it are you engaging in some kind of human sacrifice to to use a placebo at what point does that become the thing some people have even suggested that maybe the RCT is outdated and we should be looking at other statistical approaches like Bayesian analysis so that we can get good data without running into this ethical ethical dilemma and and deal with with the need maybe to have combination therapies and to deal with confounding variables Dr bhattacharya thank you senator Paul for that question I mean I think the the gist of your question is is right that this when you have an outcome that's relatively rare uh yeah you what you need is very very large samples in order to test uh whether the the the the and a control group to test whether the treatment actually works um you can get some indication with observational studies uh there are the difficulties that the treatment is not randomly assigned um but there are statistical methods to to address that uh and the the great advantage of observational studies is that with these statistical methods correcting for this sort of a selection bias and treatment you actually can get very large samples relatively inexpensively so there's a procedure here I think we we could follow uh I mean we could we could use uh data sets like the Medicare claims data uh other other claims data sets and other other readily available large-scale data sets to to check for for uh in sort of well-designed observational settings uh relational studies to see if uh there's some promising you know some promise to the kinds of treatments that people are thinking about and you can do this for many many many treatments in principle um uh you know lots of people with different ideas can check and then use that to inform what where the large trial should be run I mean I think that's that's one procedure that there are others one potentially could follow but the the the the the the the key thing I want to get across is this is that it is possible if you just choose to do it um and then the incentives to do this have have not been great and as as a result we have much less information that we probably should have about the effectiveness of various uh treatments uh that you know they've been proposed that we should that we should have had by this time uh in part also I think that's been driven by this group think that you mentioned that uh that has decided that there's only a small set of things that are going to work even before any of the evidence has been evaluated um I think all of that is to be regretted I think we have to we have to uh go back to our the principles we know about how sound science works we have to we have to look at you have to do control groups you have to do uh studies but you have to have the incentives to run those studies in the right or else they're not going to get done

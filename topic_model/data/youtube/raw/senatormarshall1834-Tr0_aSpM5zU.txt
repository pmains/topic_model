crisis at the southern border president biden sending fema to assist with handling of migrant children at the border this is the number of children and teens currently held in facilities seeing a nearly 60 percent increase year over year yesterday on sunday morning futures maria spoke with texas governor greg abbott on the concerns of what is happening in his state it's the biden open border policies that are inviting even more illegal immigration and actually have created this humanitarian crisis more importantly though maria is this challenge and that is the border patrol officers told me that the biden administration policies they are enriching and they are empowering the drug cartels in mexico who make money off of the people that they assist in smuggling them into the state of texas the cartels make money off of these migrants that you and your viewers see on tv well my next guest traveled to the border this weekend joining me now kansas senator and senate small business and agricultural committee member roger marshall senator good morning good morning cheryl thanks for having me on so thank you for being here wall street journal wrote an op-ed last night it's called the biden border mess i want to read you what i think was a very telling line out of this editorial they say migrants respond to incentives and the surge in border crossings is a direct response to biden policies and rhetoric your response you know absolutely cheryl that's exactly what i saw yesterday uh look i'm a physician i've done mission work all over the world and i know a humanitarian crisis when i see it and president biden's policies policies of an open border amnesty uh you know come to our country right now and we'll help we'll help you and look we want to be compassionate but this is backfired we have the humanitarian crisis we we have a health care crisis and we have a national security crisis as well but the policies of president biden have made it more lucrative for the cartel to transport to smuggle people into the country than they do than they did may on drug so in a just a short 30 30-mile helicopter ride yesterday 30 miles of the border we saw over 200 uh individuals trying to get across the border uh and that's that's just taking all the resources away from our border patrol so we can no longer you know track down the the drug trafficking so we are overwhelmed at the border right now this is all because of president biden's new policies to be clear here i mean these migrants are victims because you know these are cartels and smugglers and sometimes drug runners that are that are taking them across the border and they're charging them sometimes thousands of dollars so first off you've got the victims a lot of the children that we're talking about and then also you've got a lot of these we're finding out now of course we are that a lot of these migraines are testing positive for covid you're right it's it's very uh disheartening the healthcare crisis here so they're saying 5 to 25 of the folks crossing the border are are testing positive for coven and by the way for every person we're catching there's probably two others that are crossing the border and then after we we have them register we all send them to some type of a congregate living setting so they're all together so if you don't have the virus yet you soon will and of course it's not just covenant i was at the border three or four years ago we were worried about tuberculosis and hepatitis and scabies all communicable diseases and that's that's still there as well but it just doesn't make any sense this is the hypocrisy the hypocrisy that president biden's administration only wants us to have three people to gather together on the fourth of july and have a hot dog meanwhile we're letting probably thousands certainly at least hundreds of people cross the border every day with the virus and very likely a virus that's a little bit different than the virus we've seen here in this country so it is absolute hypocrisy but it's interesting that you brought this up because especially with the issue of covet you had dr anthony fauci warning against lifting restrictions here he's worried about new variants new cases and then you've got vaccine efforts you know at least we're getting that going you've got nearly 70 million americans at least have gotten a dose i've seen numbers that say 100 million you're a doctor so what is your outlook on that well look we are approaching herd immunity that if our president and our governors do our job we'll have herd immunity in april or may but then we're going to be reintroducing the virus this is going to be double or triple or quadruple the number of people that they're saying are crossing the border is an underestimate they're saying the little 30 mile stretch that i looked at yesterday 2 000 people are crossing that border illegally every day and there's probably another 4 000 they're not catching so i think by by may there'll be more cases of the virus crossing the border every day than new infections in the state of texas so this is horrible it's a bad thing it is it's hypocritical well we certainly do appreciate you coming on and i'm glad you went down to the border to see for yourself what so many of us including maria that host the show have seen with her own eyes and that it is a crisis maybe they'll come out this week and finally say that uh but the administration will senator roger marshall thank you for being here senator

for the record for those that are here i look forward to today's testimony on how we can provide protect state recognized water rights and all of the many industries and uses that rely on them and how we can better prepare for drought conditions to avoid needless expenditures of taxpayer dollars and with that i'm happy to yield to the ranking member the gentlelady from california mr napolitano for five minutes thank you mr chairman and good afternoon to everybody today's hearing focuses on the two bills that address important water issues in the west h.r 3176 the reauthorization of the drought relief act and h.r 3189 the water rights protection act and thank you to our witnesses for being with us even in the presence of this government shutdown i am proud to co-sponsor hr 3176 legislation sponsored by my colleague ranking member peter defazio which provides reclamation with the authority and flexibility to get water to entities tribes who need it during drought times drug caused the u.s economy between six to eight billion dollars annually with 2012 drought costs possibly exceeding 35 billion dollars in 2013 almost 50 percent of our country is in moderate to severe drought we will hear more of the effects of the drought in the west from the western states water council witness and may i add that many of the entities that are trying to figure out how to cope with the drought are not able to do it alone we will also hear testimony that the federal government should not help the states during times of drought that the federal government should not help god help california home to the five most productive agricultural counties in the nation and the eighth largest economy with water water issues the argument is california's problems are not the nation's problems i beg to differ that it's not that simple what affects california affects the rest of the nation that is why we are the united states of america h.r 3189 offered by representative tipton is legislation that seeks to address an issue between forest service and the ski areas in his region the ski areas are concerned about the forest service interim directive that requires the transfer their water rights to the federal government the forest service is concerned about their ability to manage the land if the ski resource were to sell their rights legislation is so broadly written that it could apply to many actions on federal lands not just the ski resource so we must be careful how unintended consequences may affect some other folks it is responsibility this committee to ensure proposed legislation receives the proper vetting we did not receive agency testimony because of the shutdown we don't have all the answers to the questions we have asked to the of the administration again because of the shutdown yet this hearing is moving forward and it will be the only and i repeat the only opportunity for stakeholders to weigh in before markup we're missing key information but without the administration's position on these bills and our ability to question uh them directly this is not the best way to do business nor is it the best way to ensure that the legislation we pass serves the best interest of our taxpayers and our american public the best way we can help our communities with their water challenges to reopen the federal government and we must focus on bringing government up back to work so employees of not only the u.s geological survey but other critical agencies can work and be participants and comment on our issues because of the government shutdown only 43 and i repeat only 43 people out of 8623 usgs employees that's less than half of one percent are at work we must bring back 3311 of the 5077 reclamation employees that have been furloughed and are waiting to go back to work for our country next year is expected to be a very dry water year and we need them all back in their jobs to help plan for our future and to help our nation's not only ag economy but the rest of our nation it is ironic though that it takes the absence of these employees to value their presence they are essential to this country and to the legislative process and we need them back at work as we consider these important pieces of legislation we must first prioritize reopening government we must vote on a clean resolution continuing resolution with no add-ons and i mean none clean open the federal government put people back to work let us work for our citizens because that's what they sent us here to do and mr chairman i'd like to for the record uh put three letters of support from the family farm alliance from the association of california water agencies and from the western states water council associated western government association without objection and uh my last plea is that uh i would respectfully request anybody to move any of these bills until uh government is open and we can hear from the agency that is supposed to be here thank you mr chair and i yield back thank you before we proceed the chair would ask unanimous consent that mr bishop of utah and mr ahmaday of nevada be allowed to sit up with the subcommittee and participate in the hearing hearing no objection so ordered uh it is customary for us to recognize any other members who wish to make opening statements and the chair is now pleased to recognize mr tipton of colorado for five minutes thank you chairman klintock for convening today's hearing and thank you for your support and engagement working with me on this critical issue i'd also like to thank mr bishop mr amade ms loomis mr gosar mr simpson mr kaufman mr pulis who've all joined

good evening as we consider President Biden's State of the Union Address I think we should consider what we expect from the federal government and how the president and his administration are not meeting those expectations at all there are solid reasons why more than 40 percent of Americans say they are worse off today than when President Biden took office and why more than 70 percent of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track despite the president's telling I believe the concerns felt by many mississippians and their fellow Americans are rooted in whether we feel secure and our homes and our communities and our futures and as a nation let's consider do we feel secure when we see our strong military subjected to political correctness as our adversaries grow in Bolding enough to float a spy balloon across the country the wheat feels secure when we're forced to ask tyrants in Iran Venezuela and Elsewhere for all while our strategic petroleum Reserve is sapped and American energy production is restricted do we feel secure when we see U.S border security fail resulting in more than 4.6 million illegal border crossings in just two years and record levels of fentanyl Crossing across the border and into our communities do we feel secure when we see law enforcement diminish why violent crime rates escalate from coast to coast as we deal with our everyday lives do we feel secure as inflation fueled by runaway federal spending wipes out wage gains for 22 straight months stretching our paychecks and eroding our savings given all that the president surely understands why so many Americans don't feel secure at the start of his term two years ago President Biden promised to unite American people a noble goal in order to achieve that I believe it's imperative that he adjusts his Outlook abandon his my way or the highway governing style and truly work with us to turn the country around and restore a sense of security that we expect as citizens of this great nation thank you and God bless America

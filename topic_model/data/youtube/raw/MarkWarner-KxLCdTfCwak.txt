once again having our daily updates day seven of the Senate and Pietschmann trial today I'm joined with my great friend and fellow Virginian senator Tim Kaine and what we thought we'd do today is try to answer some of your questions about the impeachment process so Tim I'm glad to be here with mark and I just want to thank all of you for submitting questions we solicited questions from Virginians and many of you have weighed in so let's just jump right in the first question comes from Reed and Culpepper what evidence is there that the president asked Ukraine to invest to investigate the Biden's for political gain so I would say and then Mark will take it the evidence is the transcript of the July 20 close call that maybe this that maybe the best piece of evidence because it comes right from the president but we have more evidence than that we also have the basically admission of Mick Mulvaney on television in October that of course the president Trump wanted to be an investigation in the Biden's and that's why he was conditioning withholding of aid we have other testimony by other administration witnesses ambassador Sandlin Colonel Benjamin and others who were participants either talked to President Trump were on the call who believed that was what was being done and now we have the explosive revelation from John Bolton and a forthcoming manuscript that he believes that President Trump was directly linking the threat to withold congressionally mandated aid that would hurt an ally with the Biden investigation that's why we need to hear from John Bolton and I'll just add to what Tim said you know one of the things he's not heard from the president's lawyers is why would a dozen either Trump appointees or career Foreign Service officials all put their whole careers on the line if they didn't think one that the call was inappropriate and then too they have lots of evidence both before the call and after the call that the president at the end of the day was withholding the aide with holding the White House meeting basically to try to investigate the Biden's or for that matter you know reconstruct this whole crazy theory that somehow it was Ukraine not Russia that intervened in our elections in 2016 I've not heard any rebuttal on that now I want to get another question from if we could roll back a little bit I wanna make sure I know who is being asked by Eric in Manassas who says do you dialogue with your Republican colleagues are they listening or is the whole thing already decided well Eric I spent a lot of time with my Republican colleagues usually most dinners after I get my food to go down and eat with some Republican colleagues and I think they're uncomfortable many of them support the president still but clearly with this evidence that John Bolton has we'd all pretty silly at 60 days from now when his book comes out there's terribly relevant information and we didn't get a chance didn't get a chance to see it so I do believe many of my colleagues have taken that oath seriously and I think they're struggling through this I think the real test of your question Eric is a vote we're probably going to have some time on Friday or Saturday about whether we do witnesses and documents because we've all pledged to do impartial justice and I you know I've had cases everywhere from the traffic division the Richmond General District Court to the US Supreme Court there's no court in the land where you don't have witnesses or documents and so the case I'm making or my Republican colleagues is at least a court an impeachment trial of the president it√≠d States with the same level of dignity that you would a traffic case in the ritual General District or at least at least happened at that level and it's kind of hard for them to respond let me now go to Lynn she wrote in on the Facebook page why can't why can't you call witnesses like John Bolton McMahon vanie and Mike Pompeo well we tried on the on the basically the first day of the trial day one was motions and we made a motion for Bolton and Mulvaney and two other witnesses not Mike Pompeo the Republicans voted against it this is all done by motion so we moved to subpoena for witnesses the Republicans uniformly shut us down we needed two one votes we couldn't get it we made a motion to get documents from six key agencies that are directly relevant they voted them down so we can make a motion but under the rules we can't get that motion accepted unless you can get 51 votes so we need some Republicans to honor their oaths to do impartial justice you just follow up with Tim said what's amazing to me is that you've got mr. Mulvaney is the president's chief of staff you've got the Secretary of State you've got these other senior political appointees they still all work for this president all we're saying is come in take an oath swear and then tell the truth what I don't get is if if these guys could come in and clear the president if they will take that oath and swear to it why wouldn't they come forward unless they are concerned that you know they might not be able to take that oath --n tell that kind of a story so something i think i didn't all of us deserve to hear let me go to another question Jared from Hampton Roads asks what documents and witnesses do you think would be acceptable well we've went through some of that the witnesses already that we've called upon we've also put a whole list out on documents because many of the witnesses who've already come forward they also have additional notes or additional memos they put forward obviously there's a number of these individuals like mr. Bolton like mr. Mulvaney that they've got coincidental documents as well why shouldn't we get a chance to look at those on the witness and document question here's a critical fact absolutely critical fact why did President Trump withhold the aid from Ukraine Congress had mandated it he made a decision to withhold it and then two months later he lifted it that the question of why is maybe the most critical fact before us the White House is asserting that well he was concerned about general corruption and he was concerned about birdie sharing with European partners in their support the White House has documents that would prove whether or not that was true they've gathered the documents together that would show why they made the decision but they haven't given them to us and there are two witnesses John Bolton Mick Mulvaney who have both said they know the answer to the so that is critical because if the president had a legitimate motive that's one thing now here's a reason why you question the legitimacy of the motive when they withheld aid they were obligated by something called the impoundment Control like to notify Congress they chose not to why not they didn't want us to understand the scheme they withheld it then the whistleblower came forward complaining about the scheme they were obligated to turn that whistleblower complaint over to Congress they chose not to so when they've shown they're willing to break two different laws to keep Congress from understanding the Ukranian scheme or even knowing they were doing it that tells me that they don't want us to see the witnesses and documents but that's why witnesses and documents are so important they answer the toughest questions in the case Viki asked me a question on the Facebook page what a Republican saying about the revelation from John Bolton's book so on the good side you've got Republicans like Mick Mulvaney I mean like Mitt Romney saying we need to hear from Bolton and you have witnesses Republicans like Lindsey Graham and James Lankford saying well at a minimum we should you know take a look at the book itself at the manuscript and of course they're right we should but that's not sufficient because the manuscript isn't under oath John Bolton needs to be under oath second the White House Council has twice said on the floor of the Senate last two days during their presentation the greatest engine for the discovery of truth is cross-examination and you know what I did a lot of cross-examination there right Bolton needs to be examined and cross-examined by both sides I don't personally I mean I don't think any of us would question the fact that you know sometimes folks in vaults don't tell or they just tell their version of the truth as opposed to taking an oath and swearing I think we'd get a much a more fulsome answer and a lot to hear that directly from mr. Bolton and one of the things that's also a little interesting is it you know John Bolton is somebody who I honestly have not agreed with on most policy items over his close to 30 plus years in public service but no one has ever questioned John Bolton's Republican credentials his conservative credentials the fact that he believed he went back to serving with President Reagan he's been a major conservative figure for 30 plus years I think it's pretty amazing that you've got some of the supporters of the president even turning on John Bolton because it appears in his book and the fact that he's offered to testify he's anxious to willing and willing to come forward and tell the truth our last question is from Dave in Falmouth and he says you know are you gonna vote guilty just because the president is republican they've absolutely no I took a oath to be impartial I've not reached any final conclusion I want to hear from the president's lawyers today I gave him all my attention yesterday I want to make sure we get a chance to ask our questions as well and then I've got something that's gonna be one of the most challenging decisions since I've been a senator I don't take at all for granted or lightly that impeaching the president removing him or her from office is an extraordinarily serious responsibility I will take it that way I'm not gonna make my final conclusion until we get through all this process and all I all I simply hope is that all my colleagues Democrats and Republicans do the same and I'll say the same to the way mark just answer that question Dave really an impeachment vote during an impeachment trial is really you got to make three determinations number one what are the facts many of the facts are uncontested but there are some key factual questions like what why did President Trump withhold a aid that can only be answered with witnesses and document so that's the first thing then second do the facts once they're all out on the table do they equal the charge abuse of power obstruction of Congress but then there's a third question and this is the hard one for everybody the third question is okay if they do equal the charge is the charge at a high enough level high crime and misdemeanor to warrant removal from office you can't be a low bar it's got to be a high bar and you know I disagreed with some of professor Dershowitz 'iz presentation last night especially when he said we don't even need to see the bolt in evidence well don't tell me what evidence I need to see but he didn't make something important said you should apply it on that third question is it a high enough crime to want removal from office you got a you got a applied the is the shoe on the other foot argument you got to say if the if the same facts if the president were a Democrat would I reach the same conclusion and I think we all have to grapple with all those three issues and then ask ourselves would we come to the same determination whether the president was democratic or republican and that's what we're trying to do and I simply add again that one of the things that we're going to be doing in this process is setting a precedent for future presidents and in that notion of shoe on the other foot do we want future presidents Democrats or Republicans if we reach the conclusion that the President did withhold and change American foreign policy to try to benefit himself politically do we really want that to be the new standard going forward not reaching any decision yet that's what we'll be going through I can tell you this much yet I will be back tomorrow and the next day and the next day to try to continue to bring you updates really do appreciate everybody submitting questions and stay tuned a few more long long days and funders absolutely thanks so much thank you you

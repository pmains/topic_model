the secret service scandal that rocked the agency this month might not have been the result of a one-time occurrence perhaps that's according to the washington post this morning which reported today a 2009 instance of agents engaging in late night parting at strip clubs in buenos aires argentina homeland security secretary janet napolitano faced tough questions by the senate judiciary committee today on a story that's not likely to go away soon senator richard blumenthal is a democrat for connecticut he sits on that committee david nakamura is the reporter for the washington post who broke today's story i have to start with the reporter then senator i want you to pick up on the significance of it politically let me ask you david is it a fact or not do we know that there was going to prostitutes was that part of the secret service mo before cartagena or not we don't know about prostitutes so we did hear a story from one of the current agent who said on in in the 2009 trip you just mentioned that uh president clinton was on that not when clinton was there but that there was parting after hours and they included uh visits to the strip clubs and that they're making it's not in the same league come on it's not in the same league it's not in the same league but this agent did say that they heard about contact by agents with uh prostitutes on that trip and that there might have been photos involved and that's the only other case that you've heard about only so there's no notion this is a so it's not a common practice it's still the uh the as the president said reference let's hear the president right now then when senator broome will thought to respond the president because he's still treating this as a few bad apples or as he put it rather well a few knuckleheads let's watch the president's description of what he knows so far senator secret service these guys are incredible they protect me they protect michelle they protect our girls they protect our officials all around the world a couple of knuckleheads shouldn't detract from uh you know what they do but what these guys were thinking i don't know that's why they're not there anymore wow senator what do you make of this is this still a couple of knuckleheads an isolated case or is there any any hint here of a pattern of abuse well first of all the president's right they are incredible by and large and there may have been two there may have been 12 we think there were 12 and they certainly were knuckleheads whether there are more really has to be the topic of this investigation and the secretary janet napolitano said very clearly that they are looking into whether there may have been other incidents how pervasive this practice may have been and whether in fact any information was compromised or threatened to be compromised so i think they're moving swiftly and effectively very aggressively in an investigation that has to be thorough fair and effective they're aware of the need for a really tough investigation here well this has been going on now for a couple weeks this uh this press coverage of this the press inquiry and to some extent the action by your committee and the committee in the house led by peter king from what you know now is this a systemic problem the question of whether it's systemic depends in part on what the rules were and in my view rules that permit secret service agents to go abroad have women to their rooms whether they're married or unmarried whether the women are paid or not are rules that need to be strengthened and clarified if in fact they were unclear so i think looking forward there needs to be some very serious review and revisiting of this system to determine whether there are systematic defects and flaws but by and large let's remember anybody who's had any contact with the secret service and i've had a fair amount over the years in the course of being the state attorney general in connecticut knows that they are professional and tough and their integrity is pretty much unquestionable overall and there are bound to be a few bad apples let me go back to david nakamura where's the reporting going tonight what were you going to read in the paper tomorrow in the washington post well i think chris uh our next step is our story is what i think what people want to know about which is the director of this agency mark sullivan he's a 29-year veteran he's been in charge since the bush administration in 2006 and the question is you know the secret service there's been rumors about partying on the road wheels up parties after the president leaves this one that happened you know two weeks ago before the president even got there uh you had counter snipers involved to shoot you know high-powered rifles so the question is who is mark sullivan he has not come out publicly right now and spoken on this uh you'll recall he was in charge of this agency in the last embarrassment in 2009 uh when two white house gate crashes the salah he's got into the party with the president uninvited uh he was able to sort of emerge from that fairly unscathed and apologize to on capitol hill for that but right now he has not spoken publicly since this event and so we're going to do our best to sort of explain to readers who he is tomorrow people seem to like him let me go back to senator blumenthal people seem to like mark sullivan i'm getting a sense from people at your level on the congress and around the administration he's respected a lot that he has a lot of credit in the bank starting this a lot of capital there he's a career guy he's regarded as a straight shooter and he was very smart in contacting the key congressmen right away waking them up literally at 5 00 a.m in the morning and then calling back again so i think he has been forthright i think everyone hopes that this investigation will be quick and aggressive it has to be tough and leave no stone unturned follow the evidence wherever it leads well as bobby kennedy once said you hang a lantern on your problem it's very smart to let the people know anyway thank you senator richard blumenthal for joining us for the senate judiciary committee and david nakamura of the washington post

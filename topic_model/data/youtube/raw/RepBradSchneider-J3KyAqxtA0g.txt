I'm wonder where this goes from here let's find out joining me right now Democratic congressman Brad Schneider he's of Illinois he helped lead the recent move in the House of Representatives to condemn the BDS movement that to leave an Omar support that is wrapped up in all of this congressman thank you for being here Kate thanks for having me you you called the Prime Minister's decision and with the government's decision to block both of these members of Congress short-sighted and wrong that was I mean that was like a hot second ago and now now we have these twists and turns now you're looking at something of a reversal but with restrictions on to leave and she's now refusing to go under those circumstances as Oran laid out what's your reaction this morning well I think the decision that congresswoman Ann Talib is making is a personal decision so I'll leave that to her and her family but I did say yesterday that the decision the Prime Minister's decision to deny entry to both congresswoman to leave and Omar was wrong and short-sighted because they're missing that the broader point is as members of Congress when we have the opportunity to go to Israel or to any country is an opportunity to see and learn I've been to Israel more times than I can count I've never returned from any of those trips without having more questions coming home that I started with going there and so I think this was a missed opportunity a wrong decision and it's a challenge to the strong bipartisan support for Israel we've seen in Congress just last month I led the effort as you mentioned we had 398 members of Congress vote to support the u.s. is a relationship commit to Israel's security and condemn the BDS movement you don't agree with the leave well and Omar quite frankly on the issue of Israel really basically at all but would you recommend that she go through with the visit after Israel is telling her that essentially she can't speak out well there I mean would you agree to the conditions like this if circumstances were different again I think that's a personal decision I know for me personally I would want to see my grandmother but that's for her to make her own decision with her family like I said I going into the they're looking to enter you know a democratic government a democratic country in the Middle East that's it's it's it's a is rail is a democracy and they're looking to go there do you think that do you think it's okay the Israeli government put restrictions on their speech of a u.s. of a US member of Congress no and I said this yesterday I think that they should be allowed to enter Israel to tour Israel again I just came back last week from Israel we visited not just Jerusalem but we went to Ramallah we spoke with President Abbas we spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu we also spoke with the leader of the Opposition Bennigan's we went to the Gaza border we visited Lebanon borders a Syria border we spoke with Palestinians and Israelis we saw Israel in many of its facets and I think it's important to go to any situation and see as much of the picture as possible but I also think it's important and this is just my style is to try to build bridges for long before I got to Congress the the effort to try to bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians to work towards ultimately the possibility of a two-state solution the reason BDS I believe is anti-semitic is because it denies the Jewish aspiration for a homeland of their own but the Palestinians have a similar aspiration the path to peace I believe is through negotiations between the two parties in the role the United States should be playing is to help create the forum for those parties to come together and the strengths that Israel finds in many ways it's because of the support they get bipartisan support in the United States Congress and this is why I'm so critical of our president president Trump trying to use Israel as a wedge issue trying to break away support among Democrats I don't think we'll be successful but I think we're on fortunately situation I want to ask you about the president's involvement here but first I don't know another way of asking this is who is more wrong here Israel's position in this or refused to leave and now refusing to go under I don't yeah I think that's the wrong frame I think congresswoman sleeves positions on Israel are wrong I have said that I've talked to her about it I think she has a narrative but I don't think she's looked at the broader like I said I believe path the pieces for two states for two peoples I'm committed to that and work towards it that's why that resolution last month was so important but I've also said that I believe the decision by Prime Minister Netanyahu not to let them in was both wrong and short-sighted and what I hope is we can find a path and the Israel government will change its position I think would be good for all of my colleagues to visit Israel to see the situation from all sides and understand why Israel such an important ally ally for security as we fight Hamas and Hizballah an ally for economics and the more you see the more you learn the more you know that's a that is a great point let me read you how the New York Times put it in terms of the president's president Trump's role here this morning by enlisting a foreign power to take action against two American citizens let alone elected members of Congress mr. Trump crossed a line that other presidents have not in effect exporting his partisan battles beyond the country's borders what do you think the real impact of the president's role here the president's words both publicly and privately well I think so much of what this president is doing is crossing lines and having a negative impact especially on the global stage I say all the time that the world is a better place in America is more secure when we lean in when we lead I think the president's view is the opposite to that trying to pull us away the I grew up at a time where there was a philosophy that our politics ended at the nation shore and when we were overseas we spoke as one nation one country and that has an interest in the world the president's interests are different I think it's unfortunate that he interjected himself into the situation with this visit into the politics in Israel and I pray and we'll continue to work that this president's unable to try to create a partisan divide on support for Israel United States Congress there are not a lot of issues where we can get 398 members to speak out in unison in one voice that's very true congressman Schneider thank you for coming in thank

prices at the pump of course continue to climb with no relief in sight today the president's secretary of energy actually paid a visit to a strategic petroleum reserve right here in louisiana she was there to announce the president's plan which isn't popular with a lot of folks here in louisiana here's our christopher's auto the price of gas across the country has hit a record-breaking average of four dollars and sixty cents per gallon today the president's secretary of energy jennifer granholm visited a strategic petroleum plant in plaquemine to talk about why gas prices continue to climb number of things that are happening around the globe obviously the russian invasion of ukraine russia has been a major exporter of oil putting the blame largely on russia for the price hikes she announced her and the president's plan to lower the cost at the pump and the president has decided that it's he's going to use the biggest tool that we have in our arsenal which is the strategic petroleum reserve to release one million barrels per day for the next six months so that we can help to do our part to stabilize the the mismatch between supply and demand globally congressman garrett graves was the only republican in the mix among governor john bel edwards and congressman troy carter he says he was there today to tell the secretary himself that he believes the administration's energy policies are reckless you either leave the reserves more depleted than when you found them or you come back later and buy more oil well so they're going to come back and buy more oil and by doing so we it's very difficult to predict what energy markets are going to look like in several months when they plan on doing it but right now i expect gas especially diesel prices to continue climbing congressman graves says he believes the administration either does not understand energy policy or is intentionally trying to force people to switch over to electric vehicles what we're seeing right now it appears so incoherent so irrational that it's got to be intentionally designed but secretary grantham says that's not accurate that is absolutely false the price is on the global market as you heard me tell you what the price per gallon that people across the world are paying we do want to see a movement toward electrification of transportation but we know that people aren't in a position many people are not in a position to buy an electric vehicle today the white house plans to begin tapping into the reserves soon but no telling how quickly you'll notice a difference next time you go to fill up your tank in baton rouge i'm chris rosado

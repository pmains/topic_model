[Music] this is congressman paul gosar reporting the gosar minute here in washington d.c this week yuma county sheriff leon wilmot and supervisor jonathan lyons shared with me pictures of the latest rush of thousands of illegal aliens who crossed the border illegally last weekend in yuma photos showing lines and lines of criminals walking into our country mountains of litter and rubbish strewn everywhere it's evident by these disturbing photos that the crisis along the southern border is getting worse by the day all because of joe biden's open border policies that are an open invitation to criminals drug cartels and human smugglers to cross into our country unchecked this is the crisis that joe biden doesn't want you to see but a picture is worth a thousand words the crisis has reached a new level thousands of law breakers are staging and getting ready to cross and these are only the ones we're apprehending what about the godaways that's probably one out of every two yuma sector border patrol facilities are over capacity what is taking place in yuma is unconscionable joe biden is destroying america this has been congressman paul gosar with the gosar minute

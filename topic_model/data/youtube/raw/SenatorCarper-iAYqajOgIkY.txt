to remind this of my colleagues I said this to mr. Vega yesterday we're no Versailles committee and and we do oversight over the whole federal government that's a responsibilities committee and they the only way we can be effective doing our job is to make sure that folks like you if you're confirmed are forthcoming and not asking for privilege and not declining to provide information eventually we're gonna have an election who knows who's gonna win next time who's going to be in the majority was gonna be the administration but this this is one that could come back to bite folks on both sides of the aisle and III know mark chairman cares a lot about oversight and let's make sure that we this committee gets the information that they need and I said to mr. a yesterday I said one of our concerns when you have a nominee who's not being especially forthcoming and cites privileged like nineteen times which i think is more than anybody ever the idea will that person will that nominee of confirmed be any more forthcoming once they are confirmed in a position that's a matter of grave concern for me i think it should be for all of us so

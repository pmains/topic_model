hi I'm Congressman Jim McGovern and I'm grateful to represent the people of Massachusetts second congressional district in Congress our country is still reeling from mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton our hearts break for the victims for their families and everyone who has been impacted by this violence we'll learn more about these horrific acts in the days and weeks to come but here's what we already know thoughts and prayers are not enough it's time for action America is the only developed country in the world where massacres like these happen on a regular basis it seems like any time a family member leaves home we're left to wonder if we'll ever see them again whether it's at a movie theater a concert their elementary school their church or their synagogue no plant no place seems safe it has to stop now President Trump and Republicans can blame video games or mental illness all they want other countries play video games and deal with mental illness but only here in America have mass shootings become the new normal I wish they would just tell the truth this is about guns you know in many states it's easier to get a gun that it is to register to vote and weapons of war can be bought in virtually the blink of an eye without a background check this isn't by accident the gun lobby has spent millions bankrolling their allies in Congress so they can slash any kind of sensible gun safety laws look I wish this issue wasn't political that Democrats and Republicans in Congress could all agree but the overwhelming majority of Americans that want tougher gun laws but you deserve to know the truth it has been five months since the Democratic House passed a pair of a common-sense bills that would simply close a loophole and ensure comprehensive background checks on gun sales and transfers five months and what has the Republican Senate done under Mitch McConnell no hearings no debates no votes nothing Mitch McConnell ought to call the Senate back into session right now and pass the gun safety bills which have been sitting on his desk for five months but instead he'd rather keep taking the NI raised blood money in exchange for his silence all the while Republicans wait for another tweet for the president to distract the American people and change the topic well I've got news for Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate the American people have been down this road before what's different now is that this House Majority is not bought and paid for by the gun lobby Mitch McConnell may take pride in the Senate being called a legislative graveyard but mothers are burying their kids and babies are growing up without their parents and the days of an action are over while Republicans refuse to do any work at all to end gun violence they seem to be working overtime to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act right now a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration is working its way through the courts if it's successful the entire Affordable Care Act could be struck down but think about that if President Trump gets his way 2.3 million young people would be kicked off their parents plans insurance companies would be allowed to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes and asthma and insurance CEOs would be able to use your premiums to pay for their bonuses instead of your health care it would be catastrophic that's why I'm day one of our new majority we voted to throw the full legal weight of the House of Representatives against this lawsuit House Democrats have also passed and sent to the Senate strong bills to strengthen protections for people with pre-existing conditions even further and we've passed five bills that confront big farmers unfair practices that keep drug prices high and prevent lower-cost generic versions of drugs from getting to the market you know for most people this is just common sense stuff I've held over a dozen town halls over the last year and I hear the same stories over and over again seniors who can't afford their medications so they split pills or skip a dose altogether doctors and nurses who are worried about what will happen if can't provide their patients with the care that they need people with pre-existing conditions like cancer and heart disease and high blood pressure who have no idea what they would do if they were denied or dropped by their insurance when they need it most as members of Congress we weren't elected just to hear people's problems we were sent here to solve them well Mitch McConnell the Republican Senate continued to sit on their hands I am proud that House Democrats are taking action on behalf of the American people from combating gun violence to protecting people with pre-existing conditions to lowering the cost of prescription drugs we will continue working for the people to deliver a safer healthier future for all Americans

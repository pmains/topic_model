  PROTECTIONS OF THE PRESIDENCY  WHICH HE DOES NOT HAVE RIGHT  NOW. JOINING US NOW, A MEMBER OF THE  SELECT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING  THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK ON THE  CAPITOL. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN, ADAM  SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA. HE LED YESTERDAY'S HEARING AND  WALTER ISAACSON HAS THE FIRST  QUESTION. WALTER? >> THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU, MIKA. LOTS OF TIMES HEARINGS LIKE THIS HAVE CERTAIN PURPOSES. I WAS TALKING TO SARA LONGWELL,  A REPUBLICAN FOCUS GROUP LEADER  AND SHE SAID IT'S REALLY MOVED  THE LEADER ESPECIALLY PRO-TRUMP  REPUBLICANS NO LONGER WANT HIM  TO RUN AND SOMETIMES IT'S A  CRIMINAL REFERRAL, BUT LET'S  LEAVE THAT ASIDE. WHAT TYPE OF LEGISLATION DO YOU  THINK MIGHT COME OUT OF THIS  HEARING OR SHOULD COME OUT? >> WELL, AND TO ADDRESS YOUR  POINT, ONE OF THE THINGS I  THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET ACROSS YESTERDAY WAS WE TALK ABOUT THE ATTACK ON OUR  DEMOCRACY. THAT'S KIND OF AN INTANGIBLE  IDEA FOR MOST AMERICANS. WE WANT TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON  WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE BECAUSE IT IS AN ATTACK ON INDIVIDUALS  CARREYING OUT THEIR ROLES IN A  DEMOCRACY. IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL COME OUT  OF ALL OF THIS LEGISLATIVELY,  LOOK, THERE ARE REFORMS THAT  WE'RE LOOKING AT. THERE'S AN ELECTORAL COUNT ACT  AND A CENTURIES OLD AND DEEPLY  AMBIGUOUS AND IT TURNED ON AN  INTERPRETATION OF THIS, WE WOULD BE IN A REAL CONSTITUTIONAL  CRISIS AND THERE ARE OTHER  REFORMS, AS WELL, THAT WE'RE  LOOKING AT, BUT AT THE END OF  THE DAY, MY TAKEAWAY, FRANKLY,  TWO IMPEACHMENTS AND  INSURRECTION, IF WE DON'T HAVE  PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WILLING TO  GIVE MEANING TO THE OATH OF  OFFICE LIKE PUBLIC SERVANTS DID  YESTERDAY, NONE OF IT WORKS. YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST DRAFTED  LAWS AND THE BEST PROCEDURES AND PEOPLE ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO  UNDERMINE THEM IF THEIR OATH  DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AND IF  THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT  THE TRUTH AND SO A KEY PART OF  THESE HEAR SUGGESTS TO GET THE  TRUTH OUT AND TO EXPOSE THE  DANGER WE'RE FACING. >> CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, ELISE  JORDAN HERE. NEWS BROKE THAT THERE IS EVEN  MORE DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE OF  DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY  GIVING INTERVIEWS AND HEARING  WHAT THEY ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT  THE ELECTION AND WHAT THEY  THOUGHT AT THE TIME AND THEIR  STRATEGY. CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THOSE --  THAT FOOTAGE AND WHAT DO YOU  KNOW? >> WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GO  INTO EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE  OBTAINING, BUT THE REALITY IS WE ARE OBTAINING NEW INFORMATION  EVERY DAY AND SOME OF IT  INVOLVES VIDEO FOOTAGE. SOME OF IT INVOLVES PEOPLE WHO  ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND  WE WILL BE DISPLAYING SOME OF  THIS NEW INFORMATION TO THE  PUBLIC PERHAPS IN THE NEAR  FUTURE AND THIS HAS BEEN THE  CHALLENGE WITH THE HEARINGS THAT AS WE PREPARE FOR ONE, WE GET  INFORMATION AND WE WANT TO  INCORPORATE IT AND IT'S A  CONTINUING STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE  WANT TO GET THIS OUT AND WE WANT TO GET IT OUT QUICKLY, BUT WE  ALSO WANT TO GET IT OUT IN THE  WAY THE PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND,  BUT YES, WE'RE GETTING NEW  INFORMATION AND WE WILL BE  PROVIDING THAT TO THE PUBLIC.  >> IT WAS STRIKING YESTERDAY AT  THE END OF THE HEARING THAT  CONGRESSWOMAN CHENEY MAKES A  DIRECT APPEAL TO PAT CIPOLLONE  TO BE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO BE  A PART OF THESE HEARINGS. CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE AS TO  WHERE THINGS STAND WITH HIM? WILL WE BE HEARING FROM HIM? WILL HE BE TESTIFYING FROM THE  COMMITTEE? YOUR COLLEAGUE MADE IT SOUND  LIKE HE WAS VERY CENTRAL TO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.  >> HE HAD HIS VIEW ON THE PHONY  ELECTOR'S SCHEME AND THERE'S  NOTHING QUITE LIKE HEARING IT  FROM SOME OF THE PRINCIPALS. AS YOU'VE SEEN, WHEN WE'VE TAKEN THE STEP OF SUBPOENAING PEOPLE  HOLDING THEM TO CRIMINAL  CONTEMPT WE HAVE ABOUT A 50/50  CHANCE TO GET THE DEPARTMENT OF  JUST TOYS GET THEM TO PROSECUTE. WE HAVE TO USE MORAL ASSUATION  AT TIMES AND GET THEM TO  DEMONSTRATE WHAT PATRIOTISM  LOOKS LIKE AND WE WOULD  ENCOURAGE HIM TO DO THE SAME AND OUR VICE CHAIR MADE A PERSONAL  APPEAL TO THAT, WHETHER OR NOT  WE'RE SUCCESSFUL AND IF NOT,  WHAT STEPS WE MIGHT TAKE AND  WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH. >> CONGRESSMAN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCHEDULE OF THE HEARING. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE  HEARINGS MAY BE DELAYED A BIT AS WE MOVE FORWARD, MAYBE SPACED  OUT A BIT MORE WHICH CERTAINLY  MAKES SENSE AND THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT TO DIGEST AFTER EACH ONE OF  THESE HEARINGS. SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE  STRATEGY IN JUST AS FAR AS  GETTING ALL OF THE INFORMATION  IN FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SPACING IT OUT IN A WAY THAT TOO MUCH ISN'T THROWN OUT THERE ALL  AT ONCE? >> SURE, AND YOU KNOW, AS YOU  MIGHT IMAGINE, WE HAVE A  MOUNTAIN OF INFORMATION AND WE  HAVE TO PICK WHAT IS MOST  IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE AND HOW CAN WE SHOW IT IN A WAY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE AND  ENGAGING FOR PEOPLE AND HOW DO  YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO GET NEW INFORMATION? WE HAVE A VERY TALENTED STAFF,  BUT IT'S NOT AN INFINITE  RESOURCE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO  PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER AND  FIGURE OUT, WHAT'S THE SCHEDULE  THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE OF THE INFORMATION WE'RE GETTING? IT'S A FLUID PROCESS, BUT I  THINK WE'RE DOING AS GOOD A JOB  AS WE CAN DO. THIS IS MY THIRD MAJOR  INVESTIGATIONS. I WISH I'D HAD THESE KIND OF  RESOURCES FOR THE OTHER TWO AND  A STAFF LIKE THIS DEDICATED TO  THE TASK AND FRANKLY, WORKING  WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE,  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS UNITED IN OURP PURPOSE AND AS YOU CAN  SEE FROM FORMER PRESIDENT  TRUMP'S CONGRESS UPSET WITH  McKARTHSY FOR DOING WHAT TRUMP  WANTED HIM TO DO WAS REJECT THE  COMMITTEE AND REJECT  PARTICIPATION. IT'S BEEN HELPFUL WHERE  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE  WORKING TOGETHER AND WANT TO  HEAR WHAT THE WITNESSES HAVE TO  SAY AND NOT WHAT EACH OTH

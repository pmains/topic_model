so I'm at Dan a good friend's home my childhood friend she introduced us and we were friends first for quite a while and my parents were stationed out in California at the time and they had a fabulous backyard and so we would have barbecues and Dan all of our friends have come over and Dan would be there and he would hang out with my dad and he actually became good friends with my dad first and we dad really liked him so after that barbecue that Dan hung out with my dad he ended up asking me out later that week he asked me on our first date and he was quite the gentleman which I loved about him and he picked me up and took it took us to a nice dinner and halfway through dinner I think is when I knew that he was the guy for me so that's how it started he was very smart got a good with my dad first yeah um dan is very thoughtful he every birthday I've ever had has been wonderful he thinks about it he plans surprised even whether it's a big birthday party or one year he he had a friend of a friend of a friend who knew someone that was on Dancing with the Stars and I loved the show I voted every week and Dan came to me about a week before my birthday and said I have plans make sure you were a cocktail dress and be ready to go out to like a nice dinner I thought okay we get in the car to go to dinner two hours later were in LA and he said surprise and we were there for the show and it was incredible and that's every year my birthday has always been very special whether he's stateside or deployed he always put so much effort into it to making it a special day for me and he really he takes the time to do something that he knows it specialty media works hard at getting either he have one year he had friends flying from the East Coast for a surprise party he's just done wonderful things like that for as long as I've known him and always very secret about it so I never know what's coming which is great so no matter where Dan was in the world he always he cares about what's going on at home he cares he thinks about he is a planner and logistics and everything you need so when Dan was in Iraq and I was stateside I had a phone we're on the phone I was really excited because I was going on this all-girls rock climbing trip and Dan was really supportive the SML these questions and it was a great conversation about it and about an hour and a half after we hung up the phone there someone was at my front door and I opened the door and it was one of Dan's buddies who wasn't deployed and he said hey Tara Dan called he said you're going on a kipping slash rock climbing trip and he's really worried you don't have the right gear so he sent me out to get it and here you go and all the gear was right there so even from the other side of the world dan was looking out for me and making sure that I was properly equipped to go on this trip and I thought that was incredibly kind and sweet and also someone that I want to be in charge of things that I'd want to be looking out for me because he thinks about all those things all the details he doesn't just hear about a trip and say that's fun and hang up the phone he makes sure that I was going to be safe and that I had everything I needed and I think that's an incredible quality and someone to look out for other people even when they can't be there themselves to do the job they'll figure out a way to get it done and that's Dan being on the campaign has been an incredible experience because one of the best parts about campaigning is that I'm with Dan all the time when he was in the military he would spend months on the other side of the world or in training and we had a wonderful life together but it was a life where you had to be independent and you didn't get to see the person you loved every day and with campaigning I see Dan every day and we go places together we drive everywhere we do things together and there are times we have to split because there are multiple things at the same time and that's okay but the majority of the time we're on the campaign trail together I really have loved that another thing that's been great is meeting people the amount of people that we've met because of the campaign I would never met these people without going to all these places and having meeting creats and knocking on doors and that's been one of my favorite things and hearing from them what they care about they want to see change what they need help with and knowing that if we can make it through this campaign and be elected that we can help with those things we can make those changes and better their lives and that's exciting and something I'd be very proud to help them do okay so in 2012 Dan was on deployment in Afghanistan and it was a long deployment it was nine months so at the end at the very end of month six going to the beginning of month seven I received a phone call at six ten in the morning and it was the phone call saying that Dan had been involved in an incident and that she was currently in surgery and that was you know life life changed then I was told that who alright so it was six time in the morning and I was told that Dan was in surgery that he had been involved in an incident that he was still alive but they didn't have a lot information and that they knew that the right side of his head had been damaged I was told that they a friend of ours who was not currently deployed had volunteered to be my Keiko officer and that he was on his way to the house and was going to be with me through whatever was going so I was told that a friend of ours who was not on deployment had volunteered to be my Keiko officer and was on his way to the house and that he would be there to go through everything with me at the time I knew that it was early in the morning because my alarm for work hadn't gone off yet but I think I immediately went into self-preservation mode because I started to get ready for work I wouldn't be going to work that day but I think the routine of it was what I needed while I waited for the kickoff so to get to the house my house was immediately filled with friends and other spouses other wives and the our buddies who were not deployed at the time and they really took care of everything dan was in a medically induced coma at the time and on a breathing tube and he wasn't stable enough to be flown at Afghanistan

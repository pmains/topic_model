here with reaction louisiana senator john kennedy senator i just handed to you because this to me is basic simple louisiana common sense son i think it is i don't know why this is sean but if i make it to heaven i'm going to ask but there are some people in this world that just aren't fit to be part of our society they're not sick they're not mixed up they're not confused it's not a question of whether their mama or daddy loved them enough they're they're just anti-social in terms of public safety they're just bad and we we i thought as a society had agreed that that's why we need law enforcement is to get them off the streets and to protect the law-abiding citizens from them that was a universal truth apparently no longer not all but many of my democratic colleagues have done it about um now the the uh the bad guys are the are the cops uh i hear it every day the cops are are guilty until proven innocent and they're all a bunch of racists apparently even the african-american police officers i just don't get it and and president biden bless his heart he can run around like a fox on fire and say not me i never said that i'm not a part of it wrong he was he has said it look at the uh the democratic platform the written democratic platform on which he ran he wrote it they talked about reimagining the police and the president has supported every single one of our major democratic mayors in every major democratic city they not only talked about defunding the police they did it and what was the result it was very predictable crime has gone through the roof and it can be reversed but uh if the president asked me my opinion he hasn't but if he did i would say mr president you need to stand up in front of god and country and say all this defund the police stuff has got to stop and and tell your your supporters these democratic mayors to to lift the police out don't put them down all right senator we always appreciate you being with us

republicans have been pretty intransigent about any kind of tax hikes but democrats feel there's room to do so which side will give in joining me now for claimants money maker we are pleased to welcome delaware senator tom carper welcome sir we appreciate you being here hi liz we have david stockman who of course was the budget director for president reagan sitting on the set yesterday and he said you have to add some type of tax hikes in certain regards but he's not a decider at this point you and your republican brethren and the rest of the democrats are the ones are we going to see a massive impasse over this or do you see some bit of wiggle room here well ironically david stockman when he was budget director in 1982 was part of a negotiation when ronald reagan was our president to i think to raise taxes by several hundred billions of dollars in order to try to close the the the deficit gap then uh the last guy who actually led a successful negotiations for deficit reduction in washington was erskine bowles and he did it in 1997 at the behalf he was then chief of staff to uh president clinton as you'll recall and they came up with the depths reduction deal to actually balance the budget not once not twice not three times but four years in in a row and it was a combination of spending cuts across the board entitlement programs defense domestic and revenues about roughly 50 50. and the erskine bulls and as you know alan simpson have led a similar negotiation last year and they recommended to us that we reduced the deficit by about 4 trillion over ten years three dollars on the spending side one dollar in revenue side not by raising rates but by limiting some of the tax breaks the tax expenditures which total 15 trillion dollars over the next 10 years if we just trim those by 10 that would be 1.5 trillion dollars which is about a third of what we need for a serious deficit reduction plan so do you think in a way that the the opportunity will rise by saying we won't do tax hikes we'll just eliminate tax breaks would some republicans that you've spoken with go for that well some would some would what uh what i hear from most of my republican brothers are not interested in raising rates and uh what uh but i think everybody knows in 15 trillion dollars worth of tax expenses tax breaks tax deductions and so forth tax credits there's got to be some some that are less worthy than others tax expenditures are really another way to spend money out of the treasury we call them tax expenditures as opposed to spending but they're really spending by another name and again after out of 15 trillion dollars in tax expenditures we need to find about 10 percent we don't have to raise rates but if we look hard down that list and find a combination that doesn't really uh help us encourage people to do companies to do r d does it encourage investment in the infrastructure does it encourage the development of our workforce okay now you know the defense issue we now start to hear people on both sides finally say that there is room to cut defense spending certainly you of course were a naval hero you were a captain did three tours in vietnam how do you feel about cutting defense well i don't know that i was a naval hero i love being in the navy and i love doing it for you you're a hero it's good enough for us you're nice to say that if if you look you know gao the government accountability office gives us a whole like a shopping list of places that we can save money one of the places that they recommend is is major weapon systems costs overruns last year it was 402 billion dollars 402 billion dollars there's any number of ways places we can save money the the department of defense does not fully report their improper payments government-wide is about 125 billion there's probably another 10 or 20 or 30 billion right there alone for the department of defense what we need to do is to change our culture from a culture of spendthrift to a culture of thrift we need to look in every nook and cranny of the federal government defense programs defense spending isn't that what is not what simpson balls did and it's not what simpson bowles did and everybody said it's great everything should be on the table but then nobody stepped up to the plate to just say implement it uh well actually i hope the president will step up to the plate it's his commission he appointed the the two chairs and the president needs to be the adult in a room and come and say look democrats we're going to have to consider something on entitlements opinion at this point the president i i think the president can do more and my hope is that he will as we get closer to july 4th july 5th july 6 my hope is that he will it's close listen

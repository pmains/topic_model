well hi everybody I'm Tom Carper United States Senator for Delaware and I'm here to remind you that there are only two days two days left to sign up for health care plan for 2019 I know we're all busy during the holiday season but the best gift that we might be able to give to a loved one is to make sure that they have the coverage they need to stay healthy in the new year if you or someone you know needs health care don't wait go to healthcare.gov or choose health de comm if you live in Delaware to find a health insurance plan that works for you I believe they're not eight out of ten people looking for health insurance on the marketplace or the exchanges qualify for financial assistance that's eight out of ten you might be one of those eight so most people can find health insurance plans for less than $100 each month so with only two days left there's no time to waste go to healthcare.gov or choose health decom before this Saturday ends December 15th go out there get covered god bless my Christmas happy new year

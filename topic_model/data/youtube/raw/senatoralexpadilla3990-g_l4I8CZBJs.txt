thank you madam chair i think in a similar spirit i will uh resist the temptation to engage or escalate partisan rhetoric in this hearing out of respect for the topic at hand out of respect for the professionalism of the witnesses that are before us and out of respect frankly for the american people everybody observing this hearing uh mr wilcox i've heard you say a couple of times now not leading up with the question yet uh the the catchphrase i've heard far too often here where we just want to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat uh sounds good it's a great soundbite and it's not your fault but i've heard it far too often in this committee as a pretext frankly from some of my colleagues who look i agree we should be making easier vote and harder to cheat if you look at the policies if you look at data we've gotten the harder cheap part down because voter fraud in america is exceedingly rare what i get frustrated by is my colleagues forget about the first part the easier to vote part because there are proven practices that are secure but can afford eligible voters more opportunities to conveniently register stay registered and actually cast their ballot have their ballot counted so it's not directed at you but just sort of a level set for anybody observing this conversation because i agree you've all touched on it election security and ballot access should not be mutually exclusive they should not be mutually exclusive i don't think they are and as the former secretary of state of california proud that the california model i think is exhibit and how we can do it do it right every voter in america deserves the same protections the same options for participating in our democracy now there's a a lot to unpack in the hearing here today i appreciate the concerns that been raised about poll workers recruitment retention training safety but i'm not going to ask a question about that we've we've talked about that we'll continue to talk about that vote by mail an expansion to vote by mail including the the security uh steps in ensuring the integrity of vote by mail like signature verification opportunities to cure i won't get into detail because we have in previous hearings and we'll continue to have the conversation even the value and merit of ballot drop boxes is an additional option for voters to return their ballot the merits of in-person early voting opportunities that can be done securely and afford additional options for voters to participate i will have a second question on election disinformation but i want to talk about just security for a second not cyber security not staff training not voting systems and the guidelines and security standards for voting systems that we should continue to elevate uh and not just the merit of paper ballots but a different angle on the supply chain question that has been raised specifically about paper now a voter watching at home may say wait a minute can't you just go to the office depot or the local printer and pick up some reams of paper and print ballots not voter information guides not specifically paper as it pertains to printing of ballots let me direct it to ms patrick and one of the secretaries if you want to check me afterwards some of the technical requirements that people should be aware of in terms of printing of ballots that voters should be aware of to reinforce their faith in the process including certification of ballot printers thank you senator and it's a joy to testify before you again um i would say that one of the things to remember is that the sophistication of our tabulation equipment is very high and because of that we need a high quality of paper because we need to make sure that it's it's pristine paper it doesn't have filaments it doesn't have other things that can capture the light and um in some way misrepresent a voter's mark as an errant mark what have you so you can't just go down to staples or um office depot and use any sort of paper you have to have a specific type of paper that is of high quality and that is always and traditionally been obtained here in north america from the north american mills so that's part of the tension is that it's a very unique paper product it's a high quality paper product and in this time when the mills have turned their processing over to corrugation it's becoming more and more difficult to obtain yesterday at the national postal forum many of the providers were telling me that even though they have you know 26 000 pound rolls that will blow through in about an hour and a half or two hours in their processing plants so it is a it is a great need and uh as a former secretary of state i invite people to search their state's website and see the public information on what the criteria is for the quality of paper the certification process who those certified printers are uh and to make themselves less vulnerable to misinformation like we're looking for bamboo filaments here uh and i'll just leave it at that i think that that is critical and again for voters to know it's not just about how clear the print job is to circle the fill in the bubble or draw an arrow or something like that but the technology on the back end used to accurately count their ballot i know my time is up uh so a question uh an ongoing conversation on disinformation uh for all the concerns that have been raised i think there's a unique additional challenge of combating let alone trying to prevent disinformation and its impact on voters who prefer a language other than english of which there are many not just in california but across the country either the secretaries can you speak for a minute just on concerns or recommendations on how to battle disinformation for linguistically diverse voters sure i can take that thank you for that question um so in pennsylvania you know we of course follow section 203 of the voting rights act and actually this is the first election where philadelphia will provide voting materials in in chinese so we have been working at the department of state to support philadelphia county also statewide to make sure that all of our voter education information is translated into chinese that we are reaching voters where they are that we're partnering with stakeholder groups but we also go above and beyond just the languages that we're required to provide language assistance in and you know try to to also provide it to the most common spoken languages within the commonwealth so there is still more work to be done but we're definitely on the right track to make sure that we are providing education information in every language possible thank you to secretary chapman and before turning back over to the chair just to acknowledge my experience as secretary of state in california was the best way to battle the bad information that's out there is to try to get ahead of it with accurate information we know the misinformation this information doesn't just exist on social media but is predominantly on social media and from other hearings and other committees that we've had in congress uh the safety matters in place by social media platforms uh helpful certainly not enough and that's in english and languages other than english leaves a hell of a lot more to be desired so we have a work cut out for us thank you mr chair

26 past the hour joining us now from Capitol Hill member of the Senate Intelligence Committee independent senator angus King of Maine Jeremy back take the first question for the senator too quick one senator did Jared Kushner provide documents to the committee before you interviewed him where the documents from the White House and the Trump Organization and second is did he claim that he did not know that the Russian government was trying to interfere in the 2016 election or did he say I just had no idea about that there's a premise in your question that I'm afraid I have to correct he was interviewed by the staff of the committee on Monday not by the committee itself and I haven't between the being on the floor with health care for the last two days I haven't really had a chance to sit down and look at the transcript so I'm afraid I can't illuminate any of that he this is a was a preliminary interview by the staff and that's the way we're conducting this the staff is talking to witnesses I think we're up to 25 or 30 witnesses at this point and then we'll go back review the transcripts and then take it from there it's a more efficient process and will enable us to get better questions frankly in the end so I really can't Energy stopping in Hebrews time you know I honestly don't know because I haven't sat down we had a meeting yesterday but it was on the intelligence budget so I haven't sat down and looked at what he what he brought I don't think he did but we'll find out in the next couple of days Jeremy Peters the senator good morning listening to you some of your Democratic colleagues described their utter disbelief at the way that Donald Trump has treated Jeff Sessions lately you would think that the Jeff Sessions was considered by them to be some kind of Lion of the Senate when in fact we know that nothing could be further from the truth given how rough his confirmation process is going here but I'd like to just hear you talk generally about the law here and and and what role the Attorney General is supposed to play visa vie the Justice Department and the President of the United States and what maybe Donald Trump doesn't quite understand about that well I think the first thing to understand is that when you take the oath in this country you you're oh--this to the Constitution you don't say I I promise to be loyal and support the United States to the Constitution the United States that's number one and number two the the Justice Department regulations which predate Jeff Sessions are Donald Trump section two subsection C talks specifically about the situation that Jeff Sessions found himself in it says a Justice Department employee not only Attorney General but all the way down to anybody in the department cannot participate in an investigation of a campaign in which they were active and certainly everybody knows Jeff Sessions was active in the Trump campaign he had no choice but to recuse himself and I don't really understand why the president keeps going after him on this Rudolph Giuliani two days ago said Jeff sessions made the right decision he had no he had to make that decision to recuse himself it was the right thing to do under the law and the regulations as they exist the problem is what we're seeing and sort of feeling is that getting rid of Jeff Sessions is a step toward getting rid of Bob Muller I think that seems to be the ultimate goal here and that would be very damaging to the country to the interests of the country and getting to the bottom of this and to the president particularly if he had doesn't have anything to hide but she keeps saying yeah and they then send their filth on from the Washington Post so you raise a good point about lower and I think it's important a number we've seen in recent weeks a breakdown of norms not only in the presidency but in the Senate itself and so it I have to ask if the President does do something as Extreme as fire Bob Muller how confident are you a that the Senate handle house can get to the bottom what actually happened with Russian meddling and B how confident are you that your Republican colleagues are actually in a whole president to account well I think that's a very good question but I believe and I you know I'm always hope springs eternal but I believe if he did fire Bob Muller you would see a special prosecutor statute go through both houses by veto-proof majorities and we be and we'd end up with Bob Muller in charge of a new investigation with new authorities I would hope that would happen because this would be to fire Mahler in the middle of this would be a just a breach of of the work of the Congress of the people of the laws and of the Constitution it just we no man is above the law no person is above the law including the presidents and so that would be one solution the other is for our us to redouble our efforts in the intelligence committees to try to get through this but we have a different role our role is fact-finding what happened in 2016 how do we prevent it from happening in the future Muller's role the FBI role is where their laws broken and and those are not entirely the same so we need that FBI investigation tchau senator King Joe Scarborough here wanted to ask you what your thoughts were yesterday seeing John McCain go back on to the House floor deliver the type of speech that he delivered which I'm sure it's probably extraordinarily popular those sentiments in your home state of Maine and also his call and is repeated call for the United States Senate to return to regular order and take up a health care bill that's going to impact all Americans and one-sixth of our economy by starting in the committee and doing it in a way the Constitution intended what a radical idea with hearings and witnesses and information and contrary views and amendments I mean it was a startling concept no of course he was absolutely right and Joe one of the you know how this place works one of the special things about that moment yesterday was all the senators were in their seats and heard John McCain speech normally what passes for debate around here is going down and making a brilliant 5 minute speech and then but there's nobody there to hear it there's nobody on the floor yesterday everybody heard it and it was exactly the right message and and he knows of which he speaks because two weeks ago in the Armed Services Committee we went through regular order we had a markup we had two hundred and seventy something amendments we compromised some we took some by unanimous consent but we had roll call votes and here's that here's what I thought and I was sort of taking notes at the time there wasn't a single party line vote in the Armed Services Committee on an ax men and then we passed the bill out unanimously that's the way the process is supposed to work and McCain knows it can work that way all right senator angus King thank you so much for being on the show this morning Jeremy bash thank you as well and coming up

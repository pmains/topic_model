uh thank you again mr chairman uh i think we all have to remember what our goal is here and that is that we want to clean up our sites as expeditiously as possible uh and not put more further impediments in the way with it so if i can turn to uh miss matthews on it with some questions uh i so my my first question would be are there provisions in this bill we've talked to talk are they going to continue the pace that the epa was implementing under president trump or are they likely to slow down the cleanup process and do less i think that they have some potential to slow down the cleanup process and to divert resources to something that's not that isn't part of the cleanup process so what i hear some of my other panelists talk about is that things need to happen and that there are impacts from climate change and then so the sites need to the the response actions at those sites need to address that but having those financial assurance provisions is not doing that it's going to put this massive program in place that that will make tons of money will be spent on it and resources at epa will be will need to monitor it and not just one time but annually it's a big program there's a lot of work to be done for super fund let's do the work all right i think and you just touched on one thing that ms gooden said that they don't have insurance on the thing i and for those of us that are that have come from the business world understand that all of these petrol petrochemical companies or all industries that are producing these uh have liability insurance so uh she i think she just misrepresented uh over the insurance provision with it uh so and and further in my opening statement i talked about at the pace we're on we're talking about we could be as much as a hundred years before we clean up the existing sites and then we're going to be as others have said we're going to be adding more to this in the future so my question back to matthews again is how what would you recommend how can we improve the existing program to escalate this cleanup but without adding more bureaucracy more big government what's your solution to that like i said in my statement the superfund program is now very mature we have 40 years of experience and there are definitely lessons learned where we can start to to make some progress at streamlining some of the issues the rifs the remedial investigation feasibility study guidance dates back to the 1990s certainly we know how to do things better one of the initiatives that the that the superfund task force looked at under the last administration was at adaptive management adaptive management is something that makes a lot of sense at a superfund site especially these complex superfund sites that are are certainly lagging and remaining on the on the list for a long time in general there are opportunities to streamline and to make decisions one very successful program in the record corrective action area is a record it's called wrecker first it's where the parties get together the the all the stakeholders including the government and discuss what's the ncaa vision how are we going to get there open up lines of communication where where decisions are being dragged out elevate the issues there are opportunities to speed this process up so it appears that instead of prioritizing the sites that we have now that was being done under the trump administration this legislation it obviously intends to add more sites to the superfund list it could possibly not for but possibly could be a problem in the future so shouldn't we be focusing on the problems we now have instead of the hypotheticals uh is this another example of making perfect the enemy of good i think it's diverting the resources that we have and that that we need to make progress so to be focusing on on operating facilities that are already subject to pervasive regulation and that are addressing these issues to layer that with another with the financial assurance layer is not necessary okay in the in the just few seconds i have left you've heard the testimony from the other people uh in their positions is there something you'd want to clarify or correct overstate their statements well i i guess just that financial assurance isn't necessary for these companies to operate responsibly they are operating responsibly under their this current regulatory regime thank you uh mr chairman my time has expired so i yield back the gentleman yields

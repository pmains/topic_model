I will now recognize the ranking member mr. Larkin for an open statement representable our thank you mister Thank You chairman Davis I appreciate you holding this hearing today on child care and the corona crisis I share your interest in this topic and I believe child care is key to making America's recovery even stronger I want to thank all the witnesses for taking the time to join us as well millions of Americans want to return to work and in order to do so they must be able to rely on child care providers to keep their children safe and healthy throughout the work day even before this crisis we knew there were challenges to ensuring Americans had access to affordable high-quality child care the pandemic has only exacerbated those concerns with the childcare industry hit hard by this crisis many providers which largely operate on breakeven margins could remain closed making even harder for families to find childcare Republicans and Democrats have consistently worked together to address these issues in the last five years Congress has doubled funding for the child care and Development Block Grant and included billions of dollars in much-needed support to providers and essential workers in the cares Act with States safely reopening child care providers now face many new challenges these include restrictions on group and class sizes social distancing guidelines and other health and safety protocols that are necessary to prevent the spread of koban 19 these new requirements and ongoing concerns the pandemic presents are making a hard for providers to recover and maintain a trading business yesterday I had the privilege of talking to for child care center directors of my district in Indiana child care was deemed an essential service all the providers I talked to have gone above and beyond to keep their businesses afloat and serve their children and teachers are in a safe environment one provider said she spent $20,000 to stock her two centers with facemasks cleaning materials and individual sets of learning materials for children another provider needed to put in a new hand-washing sink another was high during a cleaning service to take some of the burden off of her own staff they talked about the need to hire quality teachers so they can have smaller class sizes and consumer education so parents can feel comfortable bringing their kids back in my district the manufacturing industry relies heavily on these providers and it's a battle every day to keep their doors open thankfully these and many other child care providers in Indiana are receiving extra support through grant awards from Early Learning Indiana as part of its quote-unquote come back stronger campaign well which was lost launched in early May with the support of a 15 million dollar grant from the Lilly Endowment since then early Indiana was awarded a 155 early education providers more than 2 million dollars for health and safety related expenses and hiring teachers from the beginning of this crisis Indiana acted to prioritize working families by using funds from the cares Act to provide rapid response grants directly to child care providers I have tremendous respect for the state and local leaders who stepped up and worked hard to help these impacted by the pandemic I'm thrilled to have dr. Sullivan with us here today don't talk about those initiatives traditionally in these discussions the needs of child care centers take center stage but I also want to highlight small home-based providers many family child care homes played an important role throughout this crisis by remaining open to provide child care for essential workers particularly those working non-traditional hours family childcare arrangements are often more affordable and provide flexibility for working parents many parents prefer family childcare because it offers smaller scale mixed age care that allows for close and lasting bonds with a caregiver as we continue to deal with this public health emergency we should ensure the availability of child care settings it serves small groups of children which can be a reassuring option for parents concerned about kovat 19 exposure these family child care providers also have just that small business that our economic recovery will depend on I hope we can work together to find ways to support and strengthen childcare for working families if a large portion of our nation's providers are forced to permanently shut down parents and all industries will be unable to go back to work significantly slowing our own economic recovery childcare is exactly the type of smart investment we should be prioritizing as we safely reopen and rebuild America's economy I look forward to our discussion mr. chairman with that I yield back

this is taught business and politics with Brody Brock pull up to the program he was elected to congress in 2014 I'm talking about 4th District Congressman Bruce Westerman he has returned recently from a trade trip to Taiwan what was on the agenda perhaps more importantly what was on the menu I joined now by congressman Westerman thank you very much for being here appreciate you thanks for we great to be here with you what was on the menu as a matter of fact I'm not sure it tasted good and I came back and no no adverse effects so all's well all right let's talk a little bit about Taiwan and why you were there it's the sixth leading export market for Arkansas what are some things that you see Arkansas has opportunities to do in a greater way with Taiwan yeah it's a six leading export market for Arkansas it's the 10th largest export market for the United States just moved ahead of India on that list so if you look at it I was trying to compare it to the size of the fourth congressional district in the land mass on the islands actually smaller than the fourth congressional district but there's 23 million people that live there where you live in one of the largest land mass districts in the u.s. right with 750,000 people so that gives you an idea of the the density of the population you know Taipei's a very large city and they use a lot of a lot of us goods they like Arkansas poultry they eat a lot of pork there but they sometimes have a hard time getting the pork that they want and they like Arkansas poultry they use a lot of not near enough wood products they said they'd like to get some more charcoal and they recognize the benefits of wood frame construction in an earthquake zones which obviously they had a pretty devastating earthquake there a couple weeks ago and they would like to get a lot of our natural gas as possible so you know if we had a way to get our vast amounts of natural gas liquefied and sent over there they basically said they would take all the liquefied natural gas we could send us out of everything you just talked about their what's the most realistic for something quickly happening to they'll change the landscape the poultry trade there is already very well established and you know they they get some wood products there to the people about the fourth district it's the largest poultry producing district in the country and we've got a lot of timber we're about eighty six percent for stood so you know personally from the fourth district perspective I'd like to see them take more poultry and more wood products we'd like to see them take more rice in there but they grow a lot of their own Roth's so probably not as is going to market for rice and other AG products but I think there's real opportunity there and you know if you look at Taiwan they are a thriving democracy in that region officially the republic of china interesting when I got there last Sunday morning early attended church there they're very proud of their freedom of religion their position on human rights and they pride themselves on being a a strong democratic voice there so you don't have a Cato one China policy which has been a pretty big subject of debate over that's the official stance to the US government since the embassy was moved to Beijing but I think we need a strong voice there with with what Taiwan represents and what they stand for and they are such a strong trade partner with us this I know Taiwan is not part of the TPP the trans-pacific partnership or the trans-pacific trade pact but does does that play into the equation somehow you basically supported fast-tracking that measure but you're in a wait-and-see mode right now for the TPA which gives you authority to to look at the TPP from the trans-pacific partnership there's a real desire in that region of the world to form stronger trade agreements with the United States you know i'm i'm reading the document I've got the TPP on my desk it's 800 pages without the appendix which is another couple thousand pages so it's not light reading it's not sorry and I tried to take it a chapter at his home and highlight it and put questions where I have questions but a lot of the trade with that part of the world we what we import from there but the overriding goal of a trade deal would be to open up more markets for our products to go overseas I don't see anything really happening on TPP this year it's such a controversial issue the thing about TPA as it extends the fast tracking for four or five years so under a new administration we could possibly go in and and rework the deal at TPP you hear people call it Obama trade and it's just kind of toxic issue right now but in the long run we need more markets for us goods and that part of asia's of place where they would like to have more us goods and have stronger trade relationships with the u.s. so

. >> RYAN, THANKS VERY GREAT REPORTING AS ALWAYS. RYAN RILEY, JUSTICE REPORTER FOR NBC NEWS DIGITAL. JOINED NOW BY THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ROGER -- ILLINOIS, SERVES ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU, GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING, ALI. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS? ALL THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON? THEY'RE SORT OF TWO THINGS HAPPENING. THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS AND CASES THAT ARE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CRONIES. AND THERE IS THIS WILD TO THE DEFENSE IS COMING UP FROM DONALD TRUMP. ONE INCLUDES TARGETING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE FBI. THERE'S THIS OTHER STRANGE ONE WITH SOMEONE TO DROP WITCHES MOTION ABOUT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT WHICH DOESN'T IMPERATIVE IN VIOLATED IN THE EXECUTION OF THAT WARRANT IN THAT SEARCH IN MAR-A-LAGO. >> THAT'S RIGHT, ALI. I THINK THAT THE CLOSER THAT THE FBI IN THE DOJ GET TO DONALD TRUMP, I THINK THE LOUDER SOCIAL MEDIA PROTESTS ARE. IN THE MORE VITRIOL THERE IS IN HIS RHETORIC. AS SOMEONE MENTIONED BEFORE, HE DOES HAVE THIS MEGAPHONE WHERE WHILE THE ORDINARY PERSON SPEWING THAT RHETORIC MAY NOT HAVE AN IMPACT, DONALD TRUMP CERTAINLY DOES. I WAS JUST -- I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THAT GRAPHIC THERE, THAT PICTURE THAT YOU SHOWED OF THE FBI FIELD OFFICE IN CINCINNATI. UNDERNEATH THE ADDRESS ITSELF, IT SAID RONALD REAGAN DRIVE. AND I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT THE ONE OF RONALD REAGAN BUT DONALD TRUMP. AND AT THIS POINT, THAT RHETORIC IS SO HOT, IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO VIOLENCE. JUST LIKE IT DID WITH THE FBI OFFICE IN CINCINNATI. >> YOU ARE ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE AND THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS FOR YEARS ABOUT WHAT'S CLASSIFIED AND WHY IT SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AND THE PROCESS FOR CLASSIFYING THINGS. DIFFICULTY IN DECLASSIFYING THINGS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED. DOES THAT PLAY INTO THE PROCESS? DONALD TRUMP SO THERE WAS A STANDING ORDER IN WHICH EVERYTHING TO LET THE WHITE HOUSE WENT TO MAR-A-LAGO WAS DECLASSIFIED. THERE'S REPORTING FROM LOTS OF LOTS OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO SAY THEY KNEW NOTHING OF SUCH STANDING ORDER. AND EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE, DECLASSIFICATION DOES HAVE TO HAVE A PROCESS INVOLVED. BECAUSE THERE ARE AGENCIES ACROSS OF DOCUMENTS. THEY WOULD ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT DECIDED THIS WAS DECLASSIFIED WHILE HE WOULD'VE HAD A RIGHT TO DO SO, THERE IS A PROCESS INVOLVED. SO GIVE ME A SENSE OF THIS WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION AND WEATHER HOW RELIGION THAT IS THIS CONVERSATION? >> FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WITH REGARD TO THE THREE LAWS THAT WERE ACTUALLY INVOKED IN THE WARRANT. NONE OF THEM DEPEND ON WHETHER THE DOCUMENTS ISSUED WERE CLASSIFIED OR NOT. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT DOES GO HOWEVER TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAD LIKE A TOP SECRET SPECIALIZED COMPARTMENTAL -- COMPARTMENTALIZE INFORMATION. -- SHOWS YOU THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE MOST GRAVE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT NEEDED -- AND I THINK THIS, WITH REGARD TO THE STANDING ORDER. IT NEVER EXISTED. A THING 18 FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAID THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH STANDING ORDER. IN FACT THERE, WASN'T EVEN A PROCESS FOR DECLASSIFICATION USE BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO DECLASSIFY A BINDER OF MATERIALS RELATED TO CROSSFIRE HURRICANE, THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN CONSPIRACY WITH THE RUSSIANS. IT ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH A PROCESS, ALI, WHERE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS WENT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO ARRIVE AT A -- WOOD TYPES OF INFORMATION SHOULD BE DECLASSIFIED AND SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC AND WHAT SHOULD NOT BE. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN SEIZED WITH THE STUFF THAT WAS BEING LOOKED AT. WE DON'T KNOW IN THE MEDIA. IT'S POSSIBLE BY VIRTUE OF THE NATURE OF THE DOCUMENTS, WE MAY NOT KNOW IF THEIR NATIONAL SECURITY DOCUMENTS OR NUCLEAR DOCUMENTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON BOTH COMMITTEES THAT YOU'RE ON, INTEL AND OVERSIGHT, SENT A LETTER TO AVRIL HAINES, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. ASKING FOR CLARITY ON WHAT? WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FROM THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED IN MAR-A-LAGO? >> BASICALLY, WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS REGARDLESS OF HOW THOSE DOCUMENTS GOT TO MAR-A-LAGO, REGARDLESS OF ALL THE TRAUMA AND ANY OTHER SHENANIGANS AT PLAY HERE. WHAT WAS IN THOSE DOCUMENTS? WHAT COULD'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO ADVERSARIES? WHAT DAMAGE COULD'VE BEEN DONE TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GUARD OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED? I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NATURE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS AT MAR-A-LAGO. GIVEN THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE RISK THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDING DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS THIS INFORMATION COULD'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO PEOPLE -- OUR ADVERSARIES WHO NEVER SHOULD'VE HAD THAT INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.

when dr. King first came to Cleveland there was a boycott a seal test milk I've never forget as long as I live and my mother took me there that was my first experience with seeing people who were activists people who were willing to die for something they believed in it changed my whole outlook on life theotis has agreed to talk with us it really was his calling to be that voice to say to people we can make a difference if we work together I grew up in a neighborhood initially where a lot of kids didn't get out I was one of the ones that got out and I carry the hopes and dreams of all of those people with me every day I believe that someone has to be a voice for people who have no voice and because i do have a loud voice I like to use it forty-four percent of all the young people I represent live in poverty forty-four percent twenty-nine percent of all the people I represent live in poverty but education is number one because I really do believe education is the great equalizer I think that it is significant that we start early enough in a child's life to give them a fighting chance number two it's just giving people the basic things that everybody wants make sure they have a roof over their heads make sure that kids aren't hungry because kids that go to school hungry don't do well only about ten percent of low-income children are getting summer meals where and one of the reasons that I'm on the Agriculture Committee is because under agriculture comes food stamps WIC child nutrition people keep saying why is a girl from Cleveland on agriculture that's why because I can make a difference by making sure that we feed hungry children you know violence is an epidemic I want for young people that help me help them I want them to tell me what can we do as elected officials as adults what can we do to make their lives better I don't know the answer and I also want them to help me with legislation because if we don't change where we're going I don't know that these young people will ever see a different kind of future I just want to see if I can help them get through it injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere justices economic justice justice is civil justice just as his educational justice if we are silent when we see injustice somewhere eventually it will come to where we are injustice is like a disease and it just spreads I find myself fighting for the same things he was fighting for 50 years ago I'd like to focus on three issues that have I think I learned that everybody can serve I think that really is his legacy that you have to be involved that you have to be committed to something bigger than yourself and also understand that everybody can't do a great thing but everybody can do little things in a great way so we need to let people know that you do your little part I do my little part and we can make things better I'm just a very small piece of this huge huge puzzle and I just want to make sure that my piece is in place when the puzzle is done you you

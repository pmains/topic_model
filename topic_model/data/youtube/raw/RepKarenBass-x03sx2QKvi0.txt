Thank You mr. chair I rise in strong support of HR 8 the bipartisan background checks Act of 2019 which will extend the current federal background check requirement to unlicensed sellers of guns it is about time that Congress takes this issue seriously and I'm pleased that this bipartisan bill has been brought to the House floor with the urgency this issue deserves in recent years our nation has experienced an increase in mass shootings and our nation is appropriately horrified however mass shootings are just one symptom of our gun violence epidemic the daily toll of shootings occurs in communities across our country on our streets in our schools and even in our houses of worship as the Yala Eastman testified before the Judiciary Committee earlier this month one year after the terrible shooting that took the lives of 17 students and staff and injured 17 others at her high school in parkland Florida minority communities bear the heaviest brunt of gun violence in this country and the impact of our young people is simply unacceptable every day 47 children and teens are shot in this country eight of these young people died and 39 are shot and survived citizens across this country such as Diane lattaker who also testified before the committee are taking it upon themselves to organize and engage in community-based efforts to reduce gun violence and assist the young people it affects but we in Congress must match their courage and commitment with action of our own I support HR 8 because it will reduce gun violence by narrowing the avenues for criminals and others prohibited persons from obtaining guns certainly there is no single change to our gun laws that will prevent every shooting but enacting measures that will help prevent some of them is clearly the right thing to do that is why I support this bill and I ask my colleagues to do the same I yield back the balance of my time

louisiana congressman the house minority whip republican steve scalise how you doing sir good morning to you heavy topic here appreciate you coming in for it andy mccarthy was writing earlier today derrick chauvin may be guilty but biden and waters made sure this will drag on an appeal i don't know if that's true or not but i think we do know what happened last june when tim scott on the senate side tried to get a reform bill done and ironically democrats in the senate used the filibuster to stop it are things different that's right well bill good to be with you and if you look senator tim scott put a lot of work into coming up with a bill that really focuses on the root of the problem how how do you go after the culture in some of these departments like minneapolis where you've had these bad cops and yesterday a dirty cop was put in jail and that's the way justice is supposed to work but my my colleague in the house pete starboard was a was a cop a good cop in minnesota and he worked with tim scott on that bill and and i would like to see president biden fulfill his promise of unity by working with republicans you don't approach an issue this sensitive like police reform in a hyper partisan way where you're just going after all cops you know using the the folks that want to defund police to write that bill where they take away qualified immunity which undermines the work of good cops so i would hope that president biden would reach out to senator tim scott and pete starbuck who was a good cop and understands what you need to do and i would use this example too by the way bill mark moria was mayor of new orleans when we had real problems with the new orleans police department mark's the head of the national urban league today but he cleaned up a dirty system there was a culture where there were a lot of dirty cops at that time and he confronted it and he fixed it and he cleaned up the new orleans police department so you know you've got to focus on going in and fixing the problems but don't undermine the important work that good police officers do every day putting their lives on the line to keep our communities safe we should point out that the jury did his job uh that three-nothing verdict that was handed down yesterday but part of the idea that tim scott was pushing was encourage the end of police chokeholds make lynching a crime and increase disclosure requirements on the use of force democrats don't think that goes far enough do you well again you look at what the democrats have proposed and it's things like taking away qualified communities that is defunding police in a different way you talk to good cops all across the country they say if they're exposed in that kind of way they won't they won't stay in law enforcement you won't be able to recruit good police officers so you know for the left that just wants to defund the police i don't hear a lot of them saying that they don't want police to protect them uh and so i think we've got to be very careful that we don't undermine what good police do every day in our communities when you're going i'm thinking about the atmosphere you guys are working in today in washington as well and um i i'll just play a clip from yesterday val demings a democrat from florida jim jordan a republican from ohio i mean this exchange was sharp watch this it's interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it is politically convenient to do so law enforcement officers risked their lives every day they deserve better and the american people deserve i have the floor mr jordan did i strike a nerve the general law enforcement is generally better than to be utilized as pawns generally you and your colleagues gentlelady was ashamed generally of yourself that was just a sample of that she's got a law enforcement background by the way in florida she was saying that republicans don't want to dive into what happened on january 6th and jim jordan was saying the democrats don't want to dive into what happened last summer with all the riding in american cities can you move this ball forward yeah we need to and and for her to suggest that it's politically convenient to support law enforcement you know how difficult it is right now uh to support law enforcement against some on the radical left who want to defund police they've made it clear that's part of their agenda i think that's a radical agenda and so we've got to come together and there's a way to come together again you can look at senator tim scott's bill with pete stauber who's a police officer in minnesota who knows the things that need to be done to help improve what is broken in law enforcement and it's it's not all of our cops across the country they do great work uh and so you don't want to undermine good cops in their bill the democrat only bill like getting rid of qualified immunity would actually undermine good policing i would hope that they don't go down that road work with republicans who know something about this too and we could come together president biden needs to take leadership he has to follow through on the promise that he's yet to fulfill yet to work and unify this country work with everybody republicans and democrats sir i've got a lot more but thank you for your time i'm out of time now as i told your colleague uh democrat debbie dingle last hour please tell your colleagues in washington we don't all hate each other and as you work i know we don't as you work through this just remember the goodness of america and the goodness of americans we've come too far we've got to tone it down and sit and work together through this this is a bipartisan problem that needs to be solved in a bipartisan way america is counting on us to do it we've got to rise to this occasion thank you sir steve scalise republican from louisiana thank you thanks bill

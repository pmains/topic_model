alright joining me now a democratic congressman brad Sherman of California he is a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Financial Services Committee inning is also a supporter of Hillary Clinton congressman thank you for coming on good to be with you so we just heard what Donald Trump said that Isis is laughing at us over the weekend he tweeted crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign interventions unleashed Isis in Syria Iraq and Libya she is reckless and dangerous just today dozens of people died in the region you're a Clinton supporter how do you respond to Trump's attacks I think that Donald Trump offers criticism but doesn't offer new policy he implies that it instead claims that if he's elected president he'll sweep away Isis right away so I asked him to come bring his secret plan for eliminating Isis quickly to the Foreign Affairs Committee so that we could hear it in confidential session we've got no response and that's because has no plan his only plan is say something outrageous into an end up setting and then walk it back his statement that he would ban all Muslims every single Muslim from crossing the US border is going to be a terrible burden on him if he becomes president united states now I know he's tried to walk it back but when you say that American servicemen who are serving us abroad can't come back to their homes because of their religion when you say that we cannot meet with Prime Minister's and kings and Generals from the Arab world who are our allies because we won't let them land at our airports that is not only insulting it's practically ridiculous and in your view how is that retic rhetoric impacting us relations with foreign countries well right now he's not president and I don't think the world believes he's going to become president so I think he's a modest embarrassment to those of us conducting foreign policy around the world especially our diplomats but I I shudder to think what would happen if he became president and he had to head to go on an apology tour for saying to every one of a half billion Muslims around the world that they can't enter the United States even if they are with us as allies fighting our enemies but you can't ignore the fact that he certainly tapped into something with millions of people who support him we're now seeing Republican rank-and-file coalescing around him meantime on the Democratic side it's a different story bernie sanders continues his fight he's come out saying that he is supporting the opponent of debbie Wasserman Schultz and that there are issues within the DNC leadership how much does that division within the Democratic Party concern you in terms of Hillary Clinton parties go through this until the very last primary that is contested all the terrible things that the Republican candidates said about each other and now about a week or so after the last Republican opponent throws in the towel Donald Trump is getting a bounce in the polls because while eating may not have United all Republican elites and certainly not a lot of foreign policy experts he's uniting Republican voters that same bump will be available to Hillary Clinton when the race is over the race isn't over until there's a concession and I don't expect that to happen until the middle of June so we have another few weeks where this race is going to be contested Bernie has every right to contest it and that's what he's decided to do both Trump and Clinton have record high unfavorable ratings in these latest polls that came out Clinton responded to this and said that basically these polls so far me nothing is far out five months out from the general election is she ride to resist something that she needs to worry about right now this is like the first inning of a tide baseball game there's a long way to go and I think that the fact that Trump has gone up a little bit is that bump that he gets because his opponents threw in the towel you look at how much Americans respected and approved of Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State you realized that when she's actually engaged in public service we have a tremendous respect for for Hillary Clinton it's just now when she's subject as she has been at various time since 1992 to this huge barrage of negatives it does have an effect so I would expect that the Trump campaign will be ugly it was ugly against his fellow Republicans and I suspect that it will drive up both his negatives and turn negatives even higher than they are now but the Trump campaign is a name Wow all right Democratic congressman bread term in California thank you

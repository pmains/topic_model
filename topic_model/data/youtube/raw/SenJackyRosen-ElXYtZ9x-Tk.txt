  TONIGHT. THE WHITE HOUSE IS BLASTING  PROPOSED ABORTION FEDERAL  LEGISLATION FOR ME.   REPUBLICAN SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.  >>THAT BILL WOULD BAN ABORTIONS  NATIONWIDE AFTER 15 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY WITH EXCEPTIONS FOR  RAPE.  INCEST AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER, WHITE HOUSE, PRESS SECRETARY CORINNE. JOHN PIERRE DESCRIBES IT AS   QUOTE WILDLY OUT OF STEP WITH  WHAT AMERICANS BELIEVE BUT SENATOR GRAHAM SAYS IT PUTS THE  US MORE IN LINE WITH EUROPE. >>THE SENATOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD KEEP IN PLACE THE MOST EXTREME THE MOST EXTREME STATE LEVEL ABORTION BANS THAT BAN ALL ABORTIONS FOR HEALTH.  >>RAPE OR INCEST, THAT'S JUST   WHAT HIS BILL WOULD DO.  >>IF WE ADOPTED. >>MY BILL, ARVILLE.  >>WE WOULD BE IN THE MAINSTREAM  A MOST EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD. I THINK THERE 47 OF THE 50 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE A BAN  ON ABORTION FROM 12-15 WEEKS.  >>GRAHAM ARGUES THAT 15 WEEKS   THE FETUS IS DEVELOPED ENOUGH  TO FILL PAINT. THE PARTIAL BAN OFFERS REPUBLICANS A MORE MAINSTREAM  STANCE ON ABORTION RATHER THAN A FULL WENT. EVEN THOUGH SOME FAR RIGHT REPUBLICANS AND VOTERS SAY THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE BANNED COMPLETELY.   IT COMES JUST MONTHS AHEAD OF  THE MID TERM ELECTIONS WHERE ABORTION IS EXPECTED TO BE A KEY ISSUE FOR VOTERS.  DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS REACHING  ARE REACTING TO REPUBLICANS  PROPOSING THIS LEGISLATION.  IT WOULD OVERRIDE NEVADA'S LAW PROTECTING ABORTION RIGHTS IN  OUR STATE US SENATOR FROM   NEVADA JACKY ROSEN SAID SHE  OPPOSED IT.

mr. Chairman I am proud to bring my bill HR 5 11 for the flood insurance reform priorities Act of 2010 to the floor today and I stand in strong support of his passage moreover I'm proud that this bill has the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle having passed out of the Financial Services Committee in April on voice vote mr. chairman this bill is essential the Flood Insurance Program provides valuable protection for approximately five point five million homeowners but unfortunately the lack of a long-term authorization has placed the program at risk the program has lapsed three times now since the beginning of this year but for two days in march for 18 days in april and again from june first to july second when president obama signed my bill to provide for a short-term extension of the program through the end of sep tember of this year these lapses meant that FEMA was not able to write new policies renew expiring policies or increased coverage limits these delays also meant that each day 1,200 home buyers who wanted to purchase homes located in floodplains were unable to close on their homes given the current crisis in the housing market this instability in the flood insurance program is hampering that markets recovery and must be addressed mr. chairman and drafting the spell I also wanted to address the challenges posed to communities by the imposition of new flood maps I saw these challenges firsthand in my home city of Los Angeles earlier this year I was able to assist homeowners in the park Mesa Heights area of Los Angeles who had been mistakenly placed in a blood clean in this case FEMA acted quickly to respond to new data and correct the mistake however there are thousands of homeowners nationwide who now find themselves in flood zones and subject to mandatory purchase requirements HR 5 11 for the flood insurance reform priorities Act of 2010 would restore stability to the Flood Insurance Program by reauthorizing the program for five years it would also address the impact of new flood maps by delaying the mandatory purchases a purchase requirement for five years and then phasing in actual rates for another five years the bill also makes other improvements to the program by phasing in actual rates from pre firm properties raising maximum coverage limits providing notice to renters about contents insurance and establishing a flood insurance advocate similar to the taxpayer advocate at the Internal Revenue Service mr. chairman we must reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program and past the reforms included in HR 5 11 for this country is reeling from major floods in Tennessee Arkansas and Oklahoma and we are now officially in hurricane season with South Texas still recovering from Hurricane Alex I urge my colleagues to stand with me and support this important extension in closing I would like to recognize the many members on both sides of the aisle who have approached me with their concerns about flood insurance program I'm further gratified that through this bill were able to address many of those concerns I remain committed to working with members on

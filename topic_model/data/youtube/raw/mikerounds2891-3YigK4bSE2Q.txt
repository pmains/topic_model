today the official decision was signed making the western south dakota base the future home of the b-21 raider bomber this designation not only means that ellsworth will be the first base to host the b-21 raider but it will host the formal training unit and the first operational squadron joining us now is senator mike rounds to talk about this big announcement for the ellsworth air force base and south dakota thanks for joining us senator thanks appreciate the opportunity and this is a great day a day to say congratulations not just the south dakota but uh ellsworth air force base boxer rapid city western south dakota those folks out there have worked really hard to showcase ellsworth and the entire community making it a welcoming place for these air men and women as they come in to to do their duty and to have the b21 stealth bomber now identified formally as being located at ellsworth air force base is a very very special occasion what is this announcement going to mean for the whole black hills rapid city area well to begin with they'll start with some minimal amounts of construction there will be what they call a low observable hangover will be put on the on ellsworth itself but you're going to find contractors coming in that work on the b21 as it is further developed you're going to find people that work on the weapons systems that are going to come in and live there in the box elder rapid city area you'll find probably 750 more air men and women that'll be coming in along with their families so you're going to see an influx in the number of personnel that are there you're going to see an influx in uh inactivity at the base itself as the training squadron is established here first and um we'll see a lot more families kids uh and activity in the area now why was ellsworth picked for the b-21 bomber it was picked because of the environmental impact statement showing it to be the best place to house this particular weapon system number one we're close to uh uh wide open air spaces it's called the powder river basin air space where they can do some really high altitude training second of all there were facilities that were already there that we can take advantage of at ellsworth and the part that a lot of people don't realize is the air force looks for places where they're welcome and in this particular case western south dakota is known for welcoming these young men and women who come in and spend time there a lot of them decide that they want to retire there in the black hills of south dakota so it's a combination of things they look at whether or not the natural resources are there in the area whether or not we've protected the outskirts of the base appropriately over a period of years and my compliments once again to the folks out in the rapid city and box holder area as they've continued to put in more separation there so that you know in case you ever did have some kind of an incident or anything people wouldn't get hurt on the ground but all of those things add in to the reasoning for establishing uh ellsworth as being the first home for the b-21 raider bomber some big news thank you so much for joining us senator appreciate it

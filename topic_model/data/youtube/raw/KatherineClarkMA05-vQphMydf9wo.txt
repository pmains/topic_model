we know that people of color in the u.s are suffering and dying from covid19 at a far higher rate than their counterparts and there's lots of reasons for that but one of them is the long-standing injustices and inequities in our approach to environmental regulation can you tell us what what does this issue mean for families in your district and how do you see environmental justice during this time of the pandemic playing out for folks across the country environmental justice or the lack thereof is a huge problem especially as you mentioned right now because of coven 19. no so pollution harms people's health and we know if you've covered um and you have a pre-existing condition like a respiratory issue that you have greater harm and are a greater risk so this pollution that's coming from our air into our communities is harming our health as a result there really is a straight line between instances of environmental injustice and unhealthier communities particularly in low-income communities and communities of color who really are on the front lines so i'll just give you an example of my district we're almost 90 latino african-american right surrounded by three freeways a port of los angeles just drilling in the backyards you see kids walk around with inhalers around their necks at some of the local parks when when parks were more open right that is the direct connection of environmental injustice in the cares act when we were trying to put in money to keep small businesses afloat during the pandemic the trump administration actually put in a bailout for fossil fuel companies um can you talk a little bit about what it means to have an administration and a president that is denying climate change denying that it is a major driver not only of um creating weather patterns and agricultural problems but also as an economic issue what does it mean to have a climate change denier as a president well what it means it means the wrong values on how we're spending our dollars right the cares act and the money for the cares act was really intended for people it's intended for small businesses incentive to help those that are in need it shouldn't be easier for fossil fuel corporations to get 19 relief dollars then pers then for example small businesses and minority owned businesses so this administration is taking advantage of a pandemic to bail out the fossil fuel industry and we really can't let that happen when you talk to people on the ground they're hurting the american people need money in their pockets our small businesses need money in their pockets so president trump's refusal to come back climate change and his alliance with the fossil fuel industry is a huge barrier in our fight against climate change all of these issues like so many in this pandemic are inequalities disparities we knew about and yet they are you know being brought into stark relief with this pandemic and it's one of the reasons i you know wanted to talk to you about the moving forward act and all the things that it did in that bill and there is a direct connection between our infrastructure and climate and addressing environmental justice yet it's been three months since we passed it and the senate has still not taken it up what do you think we can do on the federal level to promote a green stimulus as the path forward from this economic crisis that has been the fallout from the pandemic we can't miss this opportunity to invest in a green recovery is how i like to say that addresses jobs and public health crisis and the climate crisis that we face so i am a big supporter and a fan of a green stimulus of at least two trillion dollars with investments every year to move our country toward 100 clean energy reduce carbon emissions and that would really transform our economy and our country for a better um a better planet really and making sure we're addressing the environment and injustices so as we really rebuild infrastructure one of the rare things that we see is an agreement on infrastructure we need to work towards a clean energy future now one of the things in the moving of ford act that i was proud to to get in is a effort to green the nation's ports across the country when we looked at the legislation there wasn't really anything specific to ports and we know that about percent of americans live within three miles of a port and i represent the port of los angeles we have the port of l.a um right next to the port of long beach as well and so in this hill statistic yeah it's huge it's a huge impact um and so the bill what it does it makes an effort to green ports to help relieve some of that air pollution by investing in zero emissions technology right we see often investments in low emissions but we got to move towards zero admissions the moving forward act is that one starting piece that we need um but there's just so much work to do and i'm looking forward to to being able to have that chance to do that

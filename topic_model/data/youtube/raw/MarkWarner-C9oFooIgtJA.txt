I'm Senator Mark Warner from Virginia this is congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois I want to start by thanking the congressman for his leadership on this issue we were briefed by the Air Force this afternoon and while we made some headway there are still a number of questions that remain three major goals that I have one is to make sure that there is a safe spot for pilots and flight surgeons to come forward without fear of retribution to relay their experiences the two pilots that are initially came forward is now grown to over nine and we're continuing to hear from other folks along the way second is to make sure that the Air Force has all the assets its needs from nasa navy other assets to find out the cause of this problem and the deeper we dig the more uncertain i am that were that we found the root cause yet and third is that those particularly the two pilots that have came forward already one which now has a letter of reprimand hanging over his head that there's no retribution and again we've got to get that resolved well and I thank the senator also for his leadership on this issue it's a very serious situation for the future of our country about the senator and I believe in this aircraft we believe it is essential to the National Defense of the United States we have grave concerns because it took two brave pilots really to make a decision that a lot of people aren't willing to make to come forward and say hey look we have concerns we love this aircraft but it needs fixed and and thankfully for the two pilots they did so we have a lot of questions that still need answered we are very confident that the Air Force will work with us to get those questions answered we sure hope so and just as importantly we want to make sure that the pilots understand that they can talk about their concerns they don't have to worry about retribution and I think a great first step to that would be to see the pending action against Captain Josh Wilson be terminated and he be allowed to not fly or fly based on his decision I think we've got their attention and I think the full force of the air force and now NASA Navy and others will help us get to the bottom of this

mr. chairman before I begin my questions I would first like to express my dismay at the title given to this hearing Planned Parenthood exposed examining the horrific abortion practices of the nation's largest abortion provider the title alone is enough to call this hearing a farce it is wrong and should be beneath this committee to state its conclusion without a shred of evidence and before we receive even a word of testimony perhaps the majority's conclusion explains why not a single representative from Planned Parenthood is here to testify about its practices may also explain why the chairman has chosen to ignore the request from ranking members Conyers and Cummings to suspend these one-sided investigations until they include the so-called Center for medical progress which made the videos about which we have heard today of course if we really wanted to hear about the practices of Planned Parenthood we could have hours of testimony and the compassionate comprehensive and affordable healthcare services they provide women and families but the majority is not interested in hearing that testimony if you clear away the partisan rhetoric it appears the chairman is called this hearing to examine how Planned Parenthood participates in fetal tissue donation which Congress made legal with almost unanimous bipartisan support in 1993 in the years since fetal tissue and cells have been used to make groundbreaking medical discoveries if you want to find the cure for diabetes for stroke upper hundreds of other life-threatening illnesses fetal tissues and cells are a necessary part of the research tool kit and a moral part the laws surrounding fetal tissue donation are simple and clear Planned Parenthood is consistently and clearly demonstrated that the affiliates who participate in fetal tissue research which represent about 1% of all 700 Planned Parenthood health centers in just two states comply with these laws just as they comply with thousands of other federal state and local laws and regulations every single day that should be the conclusion of this hearing but instead before any inquiry this committee has already declared Planned Parenthood guilty and chosen to capitalize on the sensational unsubstantiated smears made in a series of unethical possibly illegal videos the goal here is clear to smear Planned Parenthood Senator Joseph McCarthy would be proud of this committee today sadly this is not the first time Congress has been drawn into this charade every time it follows the same pattern extremists tried to entrap plan parenthood into unethical or illegal conduct and then make sensationalist accusations but in no time at all the claims are debunked and the investigations find no wrongdoing this pattern is being repeated here today mr. Bob I would like to walk you through some of that history with you were you aware mr. Bob that in 2012 anti-abortion groups released videos claiming to show Planned Parenthood was conducting sex-selective abortions no you're under oath mr. Bob I know what's of my valium congressman so you're not aware of that I was not aware of that then your unremarkably ignorant for someone in the field and it was not true mr. Bob were you aware in 2011 that anti-abortion groups released videos claiming to show planned parenthood condoned sex trafficking and statutory rape no you're still under oath and following the release of those videos Republicans in Congress tried to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and nearly shut down the government you aware that don't remember that they were connected in that way okay but you remember that the two things occurred you know the older I get the highest Murray remember the day of trying to ask your question caller yes or no do you remember or not I don't know what your question is do you remember that following the release of those videos Republicans in Congress tried to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and nearly shut down the government I've answered that question okay but of course planned pet and your answer was that the two fact the two things that they Congress tried to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and that government was nearly shut down you didn't you don't remember they were connected that's in that way thank you but of course Planned Parenthood already reported the actors claiming to be sex traffickers to the FBI so once again not true the list goes on in 2010 videos falsely claimed women were pressured into abortion not true 2009 false claims about clinics avoiding parental consent not true 2002 false claims about statutory rape not true and for real sense of deja vu in two thousand videos were released claiming Planned Parenthood is participating illegal tissue sales but of course when the man who made those videos came before Congress he totally recanted his testimony and an FBI investigation did not lead to any charges against Planned Parenthood again not true mr. Babu you of that hearing I don't recall it okay what is true is that the people who made these videos are liars in a long line of liars it is true that if you had a shred of real evidence that Planned Parenthood is breaking the law you would have taken it to a state or a federal prosecutor right away but you didn't mr. chairman if you had even a bit of real real confidence in the men who made these videos you would have brought him here to testify before this committee but you didn't and you don't have that confidence the fact is this is all a farce designed to shame women for exercising their constitutional right to an abortion to scare abortion providers into ending their services and to eliminate options for women to access health services this is all based on lies knowingly based on lies I hope the majority comes to its senses and realizes they've fallen into the same sad pattern of lies and lies that we have seen for more than a decade I yield back my time

texas democrats who fled their state to abolitionist frederick douglass and others roll tape they took bold courageous action in line with the legacy of everyone from frederick douglass to the legacy that includes all those women who marched down pennsylvania avenue for women's right to vote to all of those folks who shed their blood on the edmund pettus bridge to make sure that we would in 1965 pass the voting rights act and now we have in 2021 the texas legislature wesley hunt joins us now he's the gentleman on the right-hand side of your screen he's running for congress in texas he is a republican wesley welcome to the program i just want to ask you what do you say to the vice president and her comparison that she's making there you know democrats getting on a private plane and flying from texas to d.c and comparing that to the struggles of frederick douglass who was republican by the way is absolutely ridiculous and bombastic in my opinion and right now they are fighting what would make a free and fair election and insinuating that people of color cannot get an id and figure out when to vote just like everybody else is absolutely ridiculous again we just want a free and fair election but i'm a military guy and i spent some time in iraq and i took an oath to defend this country against all enemies both foreign and domestic and i liken being in the state house something to that a sense of service and a sense of duty to our community i couldn't imagine telling my commander no i'm not going to do a mission just just because he or she told me to do it because i didn't like it these people are awol and this should be voted out immediately as a black man what's it like standing as a republican candidate in this atmosphere today well i think we are actually the party of equality we are the party of liberty we are the party that wants to make sure that everybody has the rights that have been given to us based on the blood that's been shed for this country for generations and we are actually a part of that progress and as a black man i'm actually really proud to be a republican and stand for what will be a free and fair election and the laws that allow everyone's vote to count equally and you know it when you step into that booth we are the party that supports that what what do other people in the black community say to you i mean do they call your names because what you're doing is i mean you're leaving the party which most black people are supposed to back back you're a republican not a democrat what did they say to you face to face they asked it to you you know it depends actually um the black community is not monolithic we have we come from different backgrounds different views and quite frankly i get a lot of support from a lot of black people and even though they may not necessarily agree with my political leanings they do understand that the notion of having no black people that are republicans and a two-party system is ridiculous we need black representation on all sides of the aisle and yes i i do have some people that make some snarky remarks but at the end of the day we're in this together democrat or or republican i'm a person that fought for this country that fought for our freedoms and quite frankly the color of one's skin is less important i am more interested in their character yeah well said sir well said anytime you want to come back on this program sir you are invited here and now okay and we hope to do see i do want to see you happy to do it thank you so much see you soon god bless you all right now

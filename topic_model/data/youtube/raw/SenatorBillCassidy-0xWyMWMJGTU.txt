yep and eight days after the midterms its official Republicans gaining control of the house Democrats still in charge of the Senate at least looks like 50 49 could be 50 50 but that would bring vice president Harris back into the mix what kind of uh climate will businesses face over the next two years both on regulations and taxes joining us now to talk about that Louisiana GOP Senator Bill Cassidy so Senator it's great to have you on and by definition uh we're trying to figure out what we can do about inflation not to Fed but uh Congress the Senate uh the White House and it is it's intractable it's very difficult do you think by definition with a split Congress that that will help inflation because there won't be any more spending or do you not tie inflation uh to some of the spending we've seen for the past couple of years yeah clearly inflation has been related to the spending not just things like the American relief plan 1.9 trillion dollars pumped into the economy but what it was spent upon for example extending unemployment benefits for those who chose not to work therefore creating artificially a Manpower shortage in the workforce constraining the ability to provide services but I do see I I tend to be optimistic and I think the American people want to see something positive happen over the next two years Republicans will shut down wasteful spending that's good that's positive I also think divided government gives the opportunity to work on things like Social Security and Medicare both of which are going and solve it will contribute dramatically to our to our nation's debt and deficit if we can address that that would be positive that works best in divided government where people can't demagogue it we've seen uh in both houses uh some of the more conservative members in in the Senate and in the house we saw a little bit of a kerfuffle with uh Senator Scott and uh Senator leader McConnell and and obviously he looks like he's going to Prevail the freedom caucus in the house uh making some Rumblings do you expect uh debt ceiling problems do you expect uh the the the more I don't want to characterize them as as uh extreme but but just say people that have not liked the the spending that we've seen do you think they'll go nuclear go scorched Earth on things like that in terms of debt ceilings in any spending well a couple things the debt ceiling will ultimately be raised we know that from history Democrats may choose to do it in this kind of lame dog session but keep in mind that lane that that debt ceiling negotiations have brought about some of the most important deficit reduction activity that we've seen the budget control act as one example which Mitch McConnell negotiated so so it'll it'll get the debt ceiling is going to be raised whether I vote for it or not it's going to be raised that's just history but it also can be a catalyst for kind of a let's what let's get our our fiscal house somewhat in order so I don't view that as negative I view that as a positive do you uh at this point Cersei any actual legislation or just the lack of legislation is uh it is going to be maybe what the economy ordered is there anything we can do proactively what about energy anything that that Republicans uh just controlling the house can do about energy I think there is a possibility of a grand bargain on energy um right now for example I'm concerned that our environmental regulations which I strongly support almost all of them are basically lowering the cost of production in China and India and Asia elsewhere and therefore incenting companies to move operations I can give anecdotes that prove that point is there legislation that both sides can agree upon that would basically level a playing field hey if you want to move to China that's fine but you're not going to benefit by by bringing your goods back here taking advantage of their lower cost of production because they ignore environmental regulations I'd like to think both sides can come together on that and frankly I've been speaking with both sides I think there's an appetite for that Senator um we're you saw the developments of the week it's uh thrust FTX and Sam bankman freed into the uh into the news there's this perception that he was the second biggest uh fundraiser for the Democrats but you he he contributed to you as well and I'm sure there were other Republicans uh that that he contributed uh to but are you the the exception to the rule or were how did that happen and what are you are you going to do anything you're going to give it back or give it go somewhere else with it how are you going to handle that you know I was talking to my wife about that this morning and I think what other other folks have been doing have been contributing the funds that they receive from this gentleman to charity uh I'll probably give it to the Salvation Army here in Louisiana they've got incredible programs for the homeless uh incredible programs for for those who uh are are broken if you will a drug addiction Etc trying to restore them to wholeness it's a great charity let's take something which is obviously a terrible negative but do something positive with it Senator did did you ever meet with him speak with him you know we're at a table together once I remember seeing them but I can't really say we conversed it was a larger group of people has your view about crypto changed what did he have any influence over it and I I will say and I remember I was going back to look because when El Salvador adopted Bitcoin you came out with some pretty harsh words about all this and and suggested effectively that the United States should be be worried about trying to combat money laundering and and preserve the role of the the dollar yeah so I so I'm not going to say this entirely taints crypto uh Bitcoin is a separate category of crypto than what this gentleman uh uh was using I can imagine that Bitcoin might be the last person standing and I and I know this not from my own base of knowledge but from speaking to those who are knowledgeable Cynthia Lamas the senator from Wyoming is an expert on all this and so and so so I think there's a future for it the markets will decide but clearly clearly uh folks have gone into this kind of with eyes wide eyes closely shut ignoring some fundamentals beneath it and that's not the way you should enter into any business transaction you uh when asked about 2024 uh Senator you say we need a candidate that looks to the Future and that's kind of like code or or that just means someone besides uh former president Trump am I reading that right yeah well I mean it speaks for itself right if all you're doing is speaking about two years past um you're not speaking about the future and the American people want an agenda which meets their needs the American people want their leaders to speak about them and not about themselves uh so so the fact that you see that as code I think kind of makes it clear that there are some candidates for whom they're not talking about the future and then then they're only talking about themselves I'm about the future I'm about speaking to the constituent I think that's where successful candidates will be must be some hand-wringing in in the back rooms of of uh maybe you haven't it will start if it hasn't yet but you're going to need the people that love uh former president Trump uh Republicans are going to need them do you foresee uh the president former president finally at some point if it were to go what the way that you're forecasting you see him finally being part of the solution rather than part of the problem when he plays spoiler if if it looks like some another candidate is going to get the nomination you know anyone that thinks that they can predict what former president Trump is going to do uh you know don't talk to them uh uh but regarding those those American voters that are concerned about you know that like President Trump if you look about it their concerns are are how is their life going to be better they are fearful that a life which has brought Prosperity now brings prosperity to others but not to them I don't think former president Trump is the only person that can speak to that and I also think that if Congress and Republicans are positive in putting forward an agenda which speaks to their needs then then Republicans have a chance to win in 2024 and do very well that's our goal that's our challenge that's what I'm trying to do what are their needs speak to them and then we'll see who they decide to vote for why does everyone want to be governor of Louisiana so much it's a great state brother you should come down here and I'll take you to New Orleans first but many other places as well can we have a crawfish I love those little the the white ass thing so have you had oh my gosh we have crawfish we can have alligator we can have anything you want nothing better than Louisiana cookie have you done that suck the brains out on the end oh well it's not the brains but you do suck the head it's got the fat in there with all the juice oh if you've never slept the head of a coffee in there might be have some uh be able to hear some good music I think uh down that I haven't been I need to do that um a good luck uh Senator and so much to talk about that we hope to have you back and and talk more at some point in the future what's going on funny isn't it with politics a lot it seems like there's always a lot going on thanks yeah it's a game of Kings Game of Thrones right when

my name is niala Payton I work at UPMC Presbyterian pathology department I'm a mother of three boys my oldest actually has a skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa and as of now Humera is like the only medication that relieves some of his pain and humor is very expensive and if it wasn't for Astra Zeneca we would actually have to pay a hefty copay it's it's a struggle just trying to make ends meet I should not be put in this position my fellow co-workers we should not be put in this position I just what change change for the better because right now with our current president I feel more burdened than I've felt in a long time presidential hopeful Gillibrand actually listened to my story a lot of us we can't afford health insurance let alone our mortgage or rent or even our bills and the fact that somebody's actually out there willing to take a stand to help us be able to afford prescriptions emergency room visits going to visit our doctors and specialists or anybody else that we need to see it makes me feel good and puts a little light under my thoughts of actually voting for her come November 2020

in fact during the senate debate i talked about those arguments i responded to them and the senate voted on the constitutional issue senate formally rejected a constitutional point of order claiming the individual responsibility requirement was unconstitutional it's not as though it was not considered we voted on it we voted the act was constitutional and the act was neither novel nor unprecedented i believe it just it rested on what's been a century's work of building on our safety net in this country this was debated for over a year for most of the year countless hearings countless debates on and off the floor and millions of americans now have access to health care today because of the affordable care act but i would hope that the independent judiciary will act as an independent judiciary and will be as mindful as justice cardozo was when they upheld 75 years ago the constitutionality of social security he wrote whether wisdom or unwisdom resides and the scheme of benefits set forth is not for us to say the answer to such inquiries must come from congress not the courts i agree with that i hope the court will follow those wise examples

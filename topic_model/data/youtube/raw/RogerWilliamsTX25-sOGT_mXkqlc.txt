madam Speaker on Tuesday Israel's Prime Minister will make a direct appeal to the American people his pleas will not be made in front of cameras at a press conference they will not be made from his home country 6,000 miles away tomorrow morning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will stand right here right behind me at this podium to address this Congress the Prime Minister will speak before us to directly petition Congress and the American people because sadly he has like so many lost faith in the bellies of our commander-in-chief the Prime Minister has lost faith and an administration whose foreign policy is summarized by the president's guiding advice don't do stupid stuff he no longer trust this American president whose aids slander his name yes he is skeptical about the State Department's trust above all else Posse with Iran whose leaders have publicly proclaimed their desire for Israel to be wiped off the map he regrets the presence inability to outright condemn Hamas a US designated terrorist organization without blaming Israel in the same sentence mr. Netanyahu has rightly questioned America's once unwavering commitment to his homeland Israel Israel our partner our ally but most importantly our friend mr. speaker madam Speaker we have responsibility no we have a commitment to watch over and protect our greatest advocate in the Middle East to my colleagues in this body that do not believe in the United States moral obligation to watch over Israel I remind them about the United States Strategic obligation Israel's interests are closely aligned with ours Israel benefits from a secure America just as America benefits and having a secure stable and trustworthy ally in a very volatile dangerous region despite my personal beliefs that America has a moral obligation to ensure Israel's peace and prosperity I cannot disregard the obvious strategic benefits our relationship has brought us the Obama administration inability to realize is too full bond between the United States and Israel illustrates how out of touch they really are mr. prime minister I welcome you to the chamber of the United States House of Representatives mr. president you and your supporters who refused to meet with our friend I must remind you of your foreign policy advice simply you said don't do stupid stuff In God We Trust

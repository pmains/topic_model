for my colleagues who opposed the deal very strongly and now indicating that we should uphold it because it's not perfect I was here witnessing all of the statements the testimony about why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were opposing the Iran nuclear deal and they were not opposing it because it's not perfect they were opposing it because it's deeply flawed mr. Smith earlier asked you mr. Sullivan how much money went to terrorism and you responded that the bulk goes to domestic purposes I would offer that when you provide a hundred 150 billion dollars worth of sanctions relief and we ask you a very specific question of how much goes to terrorism we're not asking for aware you know 60 percent or whatever the other number is a bulk of gets defined as is going to domestic purposes the question was is how much is going to terrorism and the the question was one that was worthy of an answer and standing here and calling for it improved serious strategy to combat Iranian aggression I would offer that if if you sir and the Obama administration was that serious about combatting Iranian aggression we should not have been providing 150 billion dollars of sanctions relief to the Iranians to be able to conduct all of their bad activities their bad activities by the way this is a deal we're talking about we never even asked for a signature put that aside when 10 of our Navy sailors are held hostage they are embarrassed when they are released secretary Kerry says thank you and he says it's because of the Iran deal that just went so smoothly with Iran financing terror overthrowing foreign governments illegally test-firing continent intercontinental ballistic missiles chanting death to America calling Israel the lil Satan America the Great Satan I would say that it was the wrong answer for us to be propping up the wrong regime with a jackpot of sanctions relief and that we should be doing our part as Congress and as United States as as the leaders of the free world leading in fixing this and turning this into a reasonable deal not one that's very one-sided and one where we got ridiculously played at the table

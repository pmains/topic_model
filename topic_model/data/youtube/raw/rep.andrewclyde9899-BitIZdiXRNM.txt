you know I believe the total lack of oversight into Ukraine funding is actually very dangerously deliberate and I say that you know we had an oversight hearing excuse me an oversight briefing this morning and we talked about evidence well you know I think this might be a little bit of evidence right here too back in July I offered an amendment to the ndaa to establish An Inspector General for Ukrainian military aid to oversee the billions of taxpayer dollars that are being sent to Ukraine by this government in defense of Ukraine's sovereignty you know I I wish that amount of money would have gone to our Southern Border in defense of our sovereignty but that wasn't the case it went to Ukraine's Southern it went to Ukraine's border but this is what it was this amendment right here in to the ndaa it was voted down in the rules committee by the Democrats they don't want An Inspector General there's billions of dollars going to Ukraine and no Inspector General it's a slap in the face to the American people for Washington to continue to squander billions on protecting the sovereignty of foreign borders while intentionally not defending ours you know with the troubling Revelations and legitimate questions that have emerged regarding Ukraine funding with FTX it's essential that we provide the American people with the transparency that they deserve and prioritize the well-being of our constitutional republic and not someone else's you know I'm proud to join congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green in this Ukraine funding inquiry in the pursuit of answers accountability and justice for the American people

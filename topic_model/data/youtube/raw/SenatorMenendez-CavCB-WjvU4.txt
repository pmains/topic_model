well uh let me pick off where Senator Blumenthal ended you heard from three New Yorkers to start the program this is not about New York and it is not about Connecticut not about New Jersey it's not about Florida it is about the United States of America it is 3.12 million United States citizens who get treated differently than if they were on the mainland of the United States and that is unacceptable it is unacceptable and it is on America Puerto Ricans put on the uniform of the United States and have served in every conflict in its history the most decorated military unitos actually got a congressional gold medal but a gold medal means nothing if you don't treat your fellow citizens in a way that is dignity and respect so I'm glad that we have many colleagues of the Senate now at one time I felt rather lonely advocating for Puerto Rico I was considered Puerto Rico Senator I remember in 2000 uh five years ago uh I had a codel a bipartisan codel to go see Mario and unfortunately the Trump Administration canceled my military plan to go thinking that somehow I wouldn't go I got myself on a relief flight and I showed up in Puerto Rico and I still have the images today I keep them on my phone hundreds of images of communities devastated the bridge is washed out of homes destroyed it reminds me every day so while this was supposed to be a commemoration it actually is another call to action but this time in addition to supporting and I am organizing an effort to support and send a clear message to the administration for a major disaster declaration when the governor of Puerto Rico submits it to support it and make it happen right away I believe the Biden Administration will do that it is already shown its willingness to support Puerto Ricans our fellow U.S citizens in tangible ways not with paper towels but in tangible ways but it needs its support and it needs it now but here's what it also needs it needs Congress to exercise its oversight and its effort to ensure that doesn't matter that you appropriate disaster money if it doesn't end up going to the people of Puerto Rico if it doesn't create an energy grid that is resilient so that whenever the next hurricane or natural disaster comes the lights stay on the lights stay on so I'm all for I have been the biggest champion I was against uh you know the oversight board I led a mini filibuster on the senate floor against it I didn't think it was right but I got to be honest with you the federal government has to get its act together and the government of Puerto Rico has to exercise efforts over those energy entities to ensure relief for the Puerto Rican people this is an all hands on deck and no finger pointing and get the job done yes so I will close by saying this bataya I said be honest be honest is habla harassment [Applause]

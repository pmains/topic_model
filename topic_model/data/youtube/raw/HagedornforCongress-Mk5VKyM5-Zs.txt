this is Radio works director of news and information Justine wet track today I'm talking to Jim Hagedorn I haven't seen him for a while but he is running for Minnesota's first district and we're very excited to have him back in the studio thanks for visiting us Jim well Justine it's a pleasure to be here it's kind of fun because I haven't seen you for a while so we're playing a little bit of catch-up but the race that you are in this year is a little bit different so tell us about how you feel things are going right now well many people might remember that in the last election in 2016 I was the Republican candidate who came very close to defeating congressman Tim Walz we had forty nine point six percent of the vote in this district we kept working congressman Walz is out running for governor so now our seat is open and it's the best pickup opportunity in the nation for the Republican Party so we're very excited about our opportunity particularly since we spent most of 2017 working hard across the district we were at your turkey Days parade here we really enjoyed that went to the County Fair those types of things and we went out and raised some early money and we have great backing of Republican officials the national state and local level we're really proud of the endorsement that we received from your State Senator Bill Weber so that's an example of how we've been working and trying to bring the party along to make sure we take back this seat for the Republicans now last time we talked it was it was kind of during the last race but there's been a lot of changes in some of the things that are happening in the world you know everyone's talking about gun to control again the the opioid crisis has come up so there's there's been quite a few different changes what are some of the things that you are thinking are the biggest issues right now well I think you're right there has been a big directional change in our nation and that occurred when Donald Trump was elected president so the policies of Barack Obama were put on the shelf and we're gonna move into what we'd say I'd say her right direction and I think a big change that's occurred in the last years that the economy seems to be moving upward that there's a sense of optimism out there not just with business folks but consumers as well they they enjoy this many people are looking at this tax reform that was passed as something that is spur during growth and jobs and higher wages so that's exciting and I think we're seeing real growth in the economy there are there are issues out there from time to time that surface the opioid crisis is a big deal obviously that that moves into a whole host of issues all the way from mental health to what do we do about the drug trade and things of that nature the gun control the Second Amendment issues I you know I'm very strong Second Amendment supporter and I and I do believe that we should take steps to make sure the background checks are updated and things of that nature but I'm one of those that doesn't believe that more laws on the books is necessary going to solve things that we have a lot of laws on the books now and there unfortunately our evil people that do premeditated acts and what we need to do is enforce the laws and make sure that law-abiding citizens have the right to keep and bear arms and the self protection and everything else to use firearms in a lawful fashion so that's kind of where I am on that issue I know you've been doing a lot of visiting all around the state you tend to do that quite often especially in the the first congressional district and so you are in Worthington this week to talk to some of our city leaders what are the kinds of things that you think you're going to end up talking to them about well what we've been doing is I've been going across the first district and and this is a pretty big district you know it's kind of the i-90 district all the way from South Dakota to Wisconsin and then Iowa up about 80 miles and we've been going into key communities like Worthington today Austin last week Stewartville the week before and we've been trying to meet with city and county leaders to find out how the economy is doing what types of things they may have projects moving forward how if I were elected to Congress how I could be helpful down the road to your community it's just trying to get on the ground not in a political way not in a campaign way but just to to meet people and to learn more about what's happening the folks we talked to so far across the district will tell you the same thing that in the areas of law enforcement social welfare other things that that illegal drug use is is a big problem and that mental illness is a big problem and at that that consumes upwards of seventy five percent of their time and resources so on top of that we're reconfirming that this is an egg-based district that agriculture is very important to communities just like Worthington to folks here in nobles County and so I'm someone for instance that wants to be on the Agriculture Committee and do everything possible to sustain agriculture and our rural way of life I grew up on a farm over by Truman my dad and grandfather great-grandfather all southern Minnesota farmers so I have a deep appreciation for what goes on there with agriculture are you hearing much discussion about problems with day care yeah that is that is a problem that comes up or something a challenge that needs to be addressed housing day care things of that nature it's important because if people for instance in Worthington I'm sure you're always trying to lure in companies lure in people that can create and have some good jobs here high-paying jobs they need a place to stay they need their sometimes they need people to help take care of their kids that can be a very expensive thing so I I know that the federal government they've addressed that in some ways looking at that but yeah that is those are major issues yeah it's one that's been talking about a lot around here lately all right is there anything else that you wanted to add or talk about today well just I think this election coming up in 2018 in November is a very critical election we're either going to decide whether or not you know there are four or five people running on the Democratic side they're running very far to the left and they're out there trying to they say they want to resist the president they want to replace an impeach President Trump and take us back to those Obama policies and then some of open border single-payer you know late term abortion things of that nature I'm on the other side I want to be a conservative reinforcements in the US House to partner with our president to keep moving our country and what I'd say is this right direction to keep us safe to make our economy prosperous to protect our god-given rights the right to life the right to keep and bear arms the right to religious freedom and then do everything possible to sustain agriculture and our rural way of life so it's a it's a clear contrast election I think we're on the side of the voters I think ours conservative solutions reflect the views and values of the people here in nobles County and the Worthington Aryan I'd ask for their support all right again we've been talking to Jim Hagedorn who is running for the 1st congressional district we're happy to have you here today and hope that we can visit with you again before the election it's always a pleasure thank you for your time

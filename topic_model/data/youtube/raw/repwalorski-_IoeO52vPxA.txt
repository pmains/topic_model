  FOR TWO MINUTES. MRS. WALORSKI: THANK YOU,  GENTLEMAN, FOR YIELDING. I RISE TODAY ONCE AGAIN TO STAND FOR LIFE AND TO PREVENT AMERICAN TAXPAYERS FROM PAYING FOR  ABORTION SERVICES OVERSEAS.  AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER BE FORCED TO FUND ABORTIONS AGAINST THEIR  CONSCIENCE, PERIOD.  I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE HYDE   AMENDMENT WHICH PROHIBITS  TAXPAYER FUNDING FROM PAYING FOR ABORTIONS DOMESTICALLY.  YESTERDAY I PROUDLY SPOKE IN   SUPPORT OF THIS KEY PROLIFE  PROTECTION WHICH THE DEMOCRATS   STRIPPED FROM THESE  APPROPRIATION PACKAGES.  NOW DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO  FORCE AMERICANS TO FOOT THE BILL FOR ABORTIONS ABROAD.  FOR DECADES, THE HELMS AMENDMENT HAS PROHIBITED ABORTION SERVICES FROM BEING INCLUDED IN OUR   NATION'S FOREIGN AID.  DRIVEN BY A RADICAL AGENDA,  DEMOCRATS AND THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION HAVE REMOVED THIS LONG-STANDING, COMMONSENSE   PROHIBITION FROM THE STATE AND   FOREIGN OPERATIONS BILL ON THE   FLOOR TODAY. TO MAKE IT CLEAR, CONGRESSIONAL  DEMOCRATS AND THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION ARE TRYING TO   FORCE THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER TO   FUND ABORTIONS IN FOREIGN  NATIONS. THE FACTS ARE ON OUR SIDE. 77% OF AMERICANS OPPOSE USING  TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR THIS  PURPOSE. IT IS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING BUT   NOT SURPRISING THAT DEMOCRATS  ARE CONTINUING TO ATTACK OUR   PRO-LIFE VALUES AND AMERICANS'   FUNDAMENTAL CONSCIENCE RIGHTS. TAXPAYERS IN INDIANA AND AROUND  THE COUNTRY SHOULD NEVER, THEY   SHOULD NEVER BE FORCED TO  BANKROLL ABORTION SERVICES HERE  AND AT HOME. AND WE MOST CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO BANKROLL ABORTIONS  ABROAD.  THIS IS

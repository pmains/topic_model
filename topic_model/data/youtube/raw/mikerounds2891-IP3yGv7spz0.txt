and now we go from the White House to Capitol Hill because in just a few hours senators are going to get a classified briefing on those objects that have been shot down in recent days among them is Republican senator Mike rounds of South Dakota who serves on both the intelligence and armed services committees good morning Senator and thank you for joining us on this I want to get to your questions on that briefing in a moment but first I'd like to get your reaction to the breaking news that Nikki Haley is entering the fold for the 2024 Republican nomination for president what do you think former governors can do a great job as President Ronald Reagan was a former Governor I think Nikki is very very capable as well would you support Nikki Haley over former president Trump well I would just simply say that I think we're going to have other people entering the race as well I'm looking forward to Tim Scott also taking a look at I'm hoping that he will also announce I think there'll be a number of individuals that the American public will be able to choose from and uh based upon that I think we've got a real good opportunity of taking back the White House I'm looking forward to that race as well but in the meantime we're also concerned about the Senate races coming up and we look forward to actually winning back the United States Senate as well it will get to those uh those Maurices of course as well with you but first you'd like back to get back to this briefing that you're going to be going to behind closed doors in just a few hours from now we just heard from John Kirby what he told Don about the information that they have but are you satisfied with what you've heard from the administration so far you know all of us want to get the information as quickly as we can what I do appreciate that the Admiral is doing is he's being very careful to provide information that he can back up and so I I appreciate that I I would love to get more information more quickly I'd really like to find the information or at least the data that they've got on the items that they've already recovered I know they're going through that I think we'll find out more once we recover some more of the debris so at this stage of the game I think we've all got a pretty good understanding of what it may be but we don't know the details and so if they want to stick to the program of we've taken them out we know where they're at we're going to give you the details as soon as we get them then I'm I'm prepared to accept that because that's the best data we can get but in the meantime uh you know look we're still concerned about the fact that it took a while to actually be able to change the arrays on the radar that suggests that we've got some weaknesses there that we're going to go to work on and you know I think when the military says that they need to make improvements in the radar and that they need some additional capabilities that's something that we as as Congress can and do something about it and it means improving and upgrading the radar systems we've gotten allowing for them to not only pick up the high traveling or the fast traveling items but the slow traveling items as well and even if they're small and and uh you know maybe we've missed them in the past Senator you said you think you have a pretty good idea of what they may be what is that well I think look the bottom line is is that we know that the first one was a balloon and I think now they've indicated the second one was also some sort of a balloon or a metal metallic type of substance that's what's been reported and I think that's consistent with uh what it appears to be I'm not going to get into the details of what they've given us already but I I think once they get this debris I think they're going to be able to come back and share a little bit more about it what we do know is they've been traveling at really low speeds and uh that suggests that this is something that they may have been doing for a while and they're using it to collect data on us yeah and the US is shooting them down with fighter jets and with missiles we've actually learned that the first missile that they launched at the one that was near Lake Huron in Michigan that missile actually missed and they had to fire a second one that took down that object do you have concerns about the U.S using fighter jets and missiles to shoot down objects over U.S airspace I think we should always have concerns anytime that we have to engage using our military equipment to take down items that are out there I I do think it's appropriate that right now with as much attention as being you know as is being provided that we do take a strong approach to this and that when we find out about them that we do take them out I I also suspect that they have gone through Great Links to make sure that when they do make one of those attacks on one of these items that that they take precautions to protect the American people as well I I believe that and I also think that there are safeguards put into place so that if they do have a missing you know look these uh these missiles are designed for taking out a little bit larger piece of equipment uh with a little bit more metal on it probably and a little bit more of a heat signature and so forth so the fact that one had had missed uh I think that's something they had hoped they would not do but most certainly something I think that they knew was a possibility okay and Senator I want to ask you about something that you said here on CNN on Sunday about social security to my colleague Jake Tapper who said I kind of look at Social Security the way I look at the Department of Defense and our defense spending we're never not going to not fund defense but at the same time we every single year look at how we can make it better are you suggesting that Social Security should be funded on a year-by-year basis not so much that we funded on a year-by-year basis but that we try to make improvements on a year-to-year basis and look the reality is we've got an ongoing funding source right now for Social Security but when you put it on the back burner and you don't look at it and you don't try to make improvements in it and you simply say oh we did it once we don't have to look at it again that's when things start to get out of hand look the bottom line Republicans and Democrats alike I think would agree that we've got about 11 years until Social Security uh to the point where they can't pay all the benefits that that people have earned that they have worked hard for and that they have committed to so I think part of our job is this to manage that and to get in and to make sure that long term people can always count on Social Security being there and if you're not prepared to actually manage it then I think you you risk the possibility of not paying attention to it and things get out of hand and that's what we don't want and I think we're wrong when we when we tell people we shouldn't talk about it it's kind of like you know if you talk about it somebody's going to accuse you of trying to destroy it and that's not the case we were sent here to try to make it better and to make sure that it stays there for a long period of time and what specifically do you mean by improvements because that is going to be something that people are going to be curious about what exactly Republicans would like to see done differently I I would share with you first of all we know that if we don't do anything that we're going to see benefits that right now could be decreased by 24 in in about 11 years and if we know that now based on the Actuarial uh determinations that have already been made then shouldn't we be talking about now what we're going to do to improve in that and we think that there are proposals out there that can protect the benefits for those individuals that are retired now and that those that are coming up but that we can also uh take a look at new funding capabilities uh new ways of managing the process itself Social Security itself to where we might even be able to make it so that it can last more than 75 years uh without making major changes again and I just think that that's something that we should as responsible people be talking about let's make sure that the American people can always count on it and that they're not being threatened and that they don't look down the line and say gee if they don't do something in the next couple of years I may be I may see a reduction of my benefits that is what we're trying to avoid and you can't you can't do that if you're not prepared to stand side by side Republicans and Democrats alike and say let's see what we can do to fix the issues that are there make it better and give some stability to Social Security long term all right Senator Mike Brown's three very important topics thank you for joining us this morning thank you

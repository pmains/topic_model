joining us now one of two republicans on the panel congressman adam kinzinger of illinois congressman thanks so much for joining us your colleague congresswoman zoe lofgren also a committee member says the committee tomorrow will be quote connecting the dots between extremist groups and people in government do those dots connect right up to the former president trump well hey wolf good to be with you and i'll have to save all that thunder for tomorrow of course and as we lay out the case in front of people um you know to show them just how close how bad january 6 was i think even more importantly than that day is what led to it and you know what has been done since to change it the answer is really not much and so i think it'll be an impactful hearing tomorrow and and we'll just let the facts speak for themselves as we've been doing all along and quite honestly if you look at all the hearings up to this point it's been republicans mostly republicans appointed by president trump making that case on our behalf well speaking of that we expect to hear excerpts tomorrow from former white house council pats of polonies taped what more than seven hour interview that you guys did with him the other day will he shed light specifically on trump's action or inaction during the january sixth attack well again on on tomorrow i'll have to leave those details to during the actual hearing tomorrow but as it's been reported we've had we had quite a bit of time with pat sipoloni he was cooperative he did nothing to contradict any of our prior witnesses and in fact has helped to uh bold embolden uh some of the facts we've already gotten to be a second and third source to those so uh we continue to get wolf this is the thing it's it's yeah big names like pat sipoloni and and things but we continue to get more information every day this just you know more and more people come forward either they've been kind of guilted into or they've had a trip of conscience where they've said maybe i need to tell the truth here or maybe they realized there was a part of what something that happened that they think is important that maybe they didn't prior so this investigation continues on cnn has learned that the the select committee your committee won't be holding another hearing on thursday there had been reports that they were planning on doing that as well uh that it supposedly had been under consideration why the delay yeah so it's gonna be next week now and uh because we just keep getting more and more information you know with obviously the meeting with pat sipoloni the the discussion and the stuff that comes in every day we just have figured that it's probably better to do this next week with more of that information presented before the american people and we're going to specifically be talking about on top of other things what was the president doing during the hundred and eighty seven minutes the capital was under attack and you know i'll tell you a quick spoiler alert not much and uh so the american people need to see exactly what a man who swore to protect and defend the constitution all branches of the government was doing during that time and so yeah it would be nice to do it thursday but we figured it's probably better to do it next week so we can incorporate more information for people so you just need a little bit more time to prepare uh what will be the thrust the major theme of the of the hearing next thursday or next week i should say yeah so again it's gonna be and some of it will be wrapping up what we've learned so far but uh it it'll be looking at the actual attack where was the president during that time we've had little bits of previews on that people saying that you know he was in the oval office and television was on etc we're going to have more details of that backed up by more facts as always and a lot of these facts in fact most will be put forward by again republican appointees trump appointees and then i think specifically looking at what is the president's actions during that time or lack of action how did that contribute to accelerating violence so uh this is important to put out in front of people and look i mean all we want this isn't about politics to me this is about how do we have accountability for an attempted coup on the us government because we can never have that again that's just we can never have that again you know whoever takes power one day or the next that's all fleeting it's temporary i've been in congress 12 years we've been under different presidents different leaderships in congress all the time that changes what doesn't change is when the very fabric of the constitution is violated unless we have accountability and that's what we need can you tell us what day next week this hearing will take place and if you already decided who the witnesses will be uh yes i mean all that's been decided i don't want to get in front of the committee if they haven't announced the date yet but it'll be like i said it'll be next week and and the witnesses will be announced with that but i'm looking forward to it i have a role in it and it'll be interesting to put that in front of the american people again they can look at that with an open mind and make their own decision i don't see how you can take these facts though and come to any other conclusion but you know donald trump created a chance to overthrow an election and that violated everything that we hold dear in this constitution we will look forward to the hearing tomorrow and then the hearing next week as well congressman adam kinzinger thanks so much for joining us we really appreciate it you bet we'll see ya

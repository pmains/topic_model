well it's been one week since the obamacare exchange open for business so how is it going high demand and technical glitches overwhelmed the online health care system early in the day how many have signed up thus far fully enrolled I can't tell you because I don't know she didn't or couldn't answer that question economists say there's absolutely no evidence that part time work is going up in fact it's going down fallout from the health care law that have forced a number of companies to make big adjustments in the future you can see a situation where you would be forced to have more people part-time individuals have tax credits coming their way have financial help for the first time and the market that we are now running right is available for them the average family of four will actually see an increase in annual health care hospital of more than seven thousand dollars over the next eight years sarah lindsey graham joins us hey nice to see you sir oh this is awesome is that I of you at seven o'clock oh we are so happy to be alive at 7pm I came and tell you but the beautiful new studio by the way it is it is fancy anyway business how is Obamacare doing not very well according to people who are trying to utilize it you should get an intern somebody in their 20s and their project should be get online until you get signed up and see how long it would take them and and I think it take them a long time but the story is about the glitches in the system but the real story should be about the system the problem is that people are going to be laid off under 30 hours more and more employers are going to choose to make their employees part-time because they don't have to comply with a mandate and more and more companies are going to drop coverage and just put you in these exchanges go see to be cheaper for the company to pay the fine that's the real story three things the president promised you he promised you you'll be no more costly than a cell phone bill that would be as easy as signing up for amazon and if you liked your health care that you had already you wouldn't lose it he's 0 for 3 well you know it's sort of interesting that's HHS Secretary Sebelius couldn't answer the basic question she went to well she went on The Daily Show and I actually have a theory why she went on The Daily Show thing in the haight friendly no no no because it'll be Jon Jon Stewart can Grilli it isn't it isn't so much that but she in order for this program to have a chance to succeed they have to have young people paying into it because they don't have huge medical bills and they but they have very little incentive to pay into it because it's cheaper to pay the penalty yes so I think they're trolling free for young young guys they're getting people they want young people to sign up and pay into the system that aren't currently paying into the health care system the Biggest Loser and all this whole deal is going to be young people because it's going to dramatically increase their health care costs so what happens to I mean it's like yeah I hear I hear many people say I get all the email i get from viewers the viewers tend to write when they're unhappy about something but they're very unhappy with their telling me that the prices are going up i'm not getting when running to me saying you know this is terrific but it just may be because of the nature right way that that is funny you mentioned it i haven't had one person called me to say senator graham you were wrong about obamacare your criticism of the program was off base as a matter of fact all of us who opposed it from the very beginning predicted that the private sector would drop coverage because it's going to cost too much it rather pay the fines and keep insurance at the company level and a lot of people going to go to part-time employment cuz it's just so much cheaper for the company they got a bottom line to meet I haven't had one person call me and say your criticisms were wrong and here's why who's getting rich off this who's making money oh I don't know who's going to make money but I know who's who's losing is making money means that you know is it are the insurance companies making more money are the medical providers I don't think they are a lot of media well I think employers who are offering health care to their employees will wind up saving money by dropping the coverage on their employees so they're the ones they're going to make money well it's not the money they'll make its the money they would have lose by keeping you on and in the system it's going to be too costly for most employers to keep you covered on the plan you have at work today and a lot of people are going to go to part-time employment because the company can't afford to keep you full time so you either lose your health care totally or you go to park unemployment that's happening all over the country how does this end Democrats eventually are going to get tired of defending this and before the 2014 election if we don't screw it up as Republicans Democrats are going to come to a guy like me or others and say let's see if we can delay this thing and redo it I Republicans screwed it up as you say I think we're getting in the way of the story you know shutting down the government to defund Obamacare was a tactical choice didn't make a whole lot of sense to me I didn't think the president would sign a bill defunding Obamacare at the end of the day the idea of letting this thing kind of collapse of its own weight and be ready to fix it in a bipartisan fashion is the best strategy but it's not just about signing up for the program is how the program works you might get people to sign up but you're not going to change the dynamic of losing the health care you enjoy today or going to part-time employment that won't be fixed by a computer senator nice to see you thank you sir

well i spent quite a bit yesterday and this morning with secretary mnuchin and the chief of staff most importantly from our point of view with the chairman of the appropriating committee chairman shelby and senator alexander talking about the appropriating part of the bill basically we're for back to school back to work back to child care and back to better health that all takes more testing more therapeutics vaccines that are only developed as quickly as we can develop them but properly and fairly and equitably delivered um i think today the white house is announcing or at least nih is announcing that of the 15 15 200 nursing homes in the country uh the first 638 are getting self-contained testing equipment today where they can do test and verify those tests right there at the facility within the next five or six weeks twenty five hundred of those fifteen thousand nursing homes will have that kind of equipment uh and hopefully in the not too distant future all fifteen thousand two hundred of them will have equipment on site where nursing home patients can be tested as can everybody that comes into that facility as a worker or a visitor and it's also going to be an important part of going back to school going back to work going back to school going back to campus living all those things require tests at work that are easily taken that are quickly responded to frankly the president's right when he says a test that you don't know the result of for five or six or seven days doesn't really do nearly as much good as a test that you would know the result of in 15 or 20 minutes and know how that impacts your life and everybody you're going to be associating with and so we're focusing on back to school back to work back to child care back to better health in the appropriating part of this bill we're putting together

  IT.  >>> AND NOW TURNING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAXES AND THE DEMOCRATS  FIGHT TO SEE SIX YEARS WORTH OF  HIS PERSONAL AND BUSINESS  RETURNS, PROMPTING THE WHITE  HOUSE SPOK -- THE SPOKESPERSON  TO QUESTION THE COMPETENCY OF  CONGRESS.  >> DON'T THINK CONGRESS, THIS  GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE SMART ENOUGH TO LOOK THROUGH THE  THOUSAND OF PAGES THAT I WOULD  ASSUME THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  TAXES WILL BE. MY GUESS IS MOST OF THEM DON'T  DO THEIR OWN TAXES AND I  CERTAINLY DON'T TRUST THEM TO  LOOK THROUGH THE DECADES OF  SUCCESS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS  AND DETERMINE ANYTHING. HE SPILLED OUT HUNDREDS OF PAGES IN A FOO-- IN A FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE.  >> THE COMMENTS MAY COME AS A  SURPRISE TO NEARLY ONE DOZEN  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY ACCOUNTANTS. THEY ARE TRAINED IN DOING JUST  THAT. LOOKING AND MAKING AND PREPARING TAX RETURNS. THREE OF THOSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ON THE SCREEN ARE DEMOCRATS AND  THE REST ARE REPUBLICANS AND ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS IS SITTING NEXT TO ME AS YOU SEE. HE IS BRAD SHERMAN AND YOU ARE  NOT ONLY A CPA BUT ALSO HAVE A  LAW DEGREE AND YOU USED TO AUDIT BIG BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT. SO WITH THAT SETUP, LET ME ASK  YOU, ARE YOU SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THE PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS? >> I'M SURPRISED TO SEE SAES  SARAH SANDERS TALKING ABOUT  INTELLIGENCE. IF SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS AN  IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC, SHE  PROBABLY WOULD HAVE CHOSEN  ANOTHER EMPLOYER. BUT ALL OF MY FELLOW MEMBERS OF  THE CPA AND ACCOUNTANT CAUCUS  COULD UNDERSTAND WHATEVER  DOCUMENTS ARE PRODUCED AND I  THINK TO NOT TURN THEM OVER IS  WITHOUT DEFENSE AND ATTACKING  THE INTELLIGENCE OF MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS. SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY THING THAT  THE PRESIDENT SPOKESPERSON CAN  DOO.  >> SO AS SOMEONE WELL VERSED IN  PREPARING AND LOOKING AT TAX  RETURNS AND AS I SAID, EVEN  BEING INVOLVED IN AUDITS, WHAT  DO YOU WANT TO SEE? WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU  LOOKING FOR? WHY DO YOU AS A MEMBER OF  CONGRESS WANT TO SEE THOSE  RETURNS? >> WELL, THE PRESIDENT HAS  BILLED HIMSELF AS GENEROUS. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT  CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS HE'S  MADE AND WHETHER HE'S USING  QUESTIONABLE LOOPHOLES, HE  SHOULD PAY WHAT IS OWED AND NOT  WHAT HE SAID IS OWED, MAKING USE OF ARGUMENTS THAT COULD FALL  UNDER AN AUDIT OR WOULD LIKELY  BE REJECTED BY ATAX COURT. IT IS ONE THING TO PAY LESS THAN YOU WOULD PAY IF THE LAW WERE  DIFFERENT. IT IS ANOTHER THING TO STRETCH  THE LAW AND MAKE USE OF  LOOPHOLES SO WE WANT TO SEE THAT AS WELL.  >> I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE  PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS SENT A  SECOND LETTER TO THE LAWYERS AT  THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT CH IS  THE DEPARTMENT OVERSEEING THE  IRS AND SAYING THE IRS SHOULD  DENY THE REQUEST AND THE LAWYER  WRITES THIS, CONGRESS HAS NO  CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO ACT  LIKE A JUNIOR VARSITY IRS  RERUNNING INDIVIDUAL  EXAMINATIONS OR FLY SPECKING THE AGENCY'S CALCULATIONS. IF THE IRS COMMISSIONER DOES NOT HAND OVER TRUMP'S RETURNS BY  APRIL 23rd, WHICH IS WHAT YOUR  FELLOW DEMOCRATS HAVE DEMANDED,  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? >> CERTAINLY WE SHOULD GET A  WRIT OF MAN DAMOUS REQUIRING THE IRS TO TURN THEM OVER.  >> COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT  IS.  >> A COURT ORDER REQUIRING THEM  TO BE TURNED OVER AND GET THEM  FROM THE ACCOUNTANTS AS WELL. THERE ARE STRONG REASONS WHY WE  SHOULD LOOK AT THESE. IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENFORCE  THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE OF THE  CONSTITUTION AND MAKING SURE THE PRESIDENT ISN'T GETTING BENEFITS AND GIFTS OF MILLION DOLLARS  FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. IT IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO CHECK THE IRS IS FOLLOWING ITS POLICY, WHICH IS TO AUDIT EVERY  PRESIDENT AND EVERY VICE  PRESIDENT AND DO IT IN A  THOROUGH WAY. AND THE ONLY ENTITY THAT COULD  REALLY LOOK OVER THE IRS AND  MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOLLOWING  THEIR OWN POLICY IS THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND THE FINANCE  COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE.  >> I WANT TO TURN ON WHAT IS  GOING ON IN THE CAUCUS. A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE IN THE  DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AND THE HOUSE  SPEAKER'S RECENT COMMENTS ABOUT  THE MORE PROGRESSIVE FACTION IN  YOUR CAUCUS, INCLUDING ANDREA -- ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ AND  ILHAN OMAR WHO HAVE BEEN THE  TARGET OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. LET'S LISTEN TO THE HOUSE  SPEAKER.  >> WE HAVE THESE WINGS AOC AND  HER GROUP ON ONE SIDE.  >> ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE.  >> NO IT IS THE PROGRESSIVE  GROUP.  >> I'M A PROGRESSIVE, YEAH. HOWEVER, I DO REJECT SOCIALISM  AS AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM. IF PEOPLE HAVE THAT VIEW, THAT  IS THEIR VIEW. THAT IS NOT THE VIEW OF THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY. >> IS IT LIKE FIVE PEOPLE? IS THAT FAIR? OR DO YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE CAUCUS MEETINGS --  >> THERE ARE THREE NEW MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS WHO ARE GETTING A  LOT OF PUBLICITY IN PART THAT IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS CHOSEN  TO ATTACK THEM. AND WE CAN'T HAVE TRUMP CHOOSING WHO OUR LEADERS ARE. OUR LEADERS, NANCY PELOSI AND  OUR LEADERS ARE THE CHAIRS OF  THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES. AND TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY -- WE HAVE 62 FRESHMAN MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS AND THERE ARE ONLY  THREE BEING TALKED ABOUT, THAT  IS NOT A DECISION TRUMP SHOULD  MAKE. AND THE PRESS SHOULD PAY  ATTENTION TO ALL 62 OF OUR NEW  MEMBERS AND ALL OF OUR MEMBERS.  >> BUT THEY DO HAVE LEADING  VOICES AND INCREDIBLE FOLLOWING  ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WELL BEYOND  THEIR PARTICULAR DISTRICTS,  ISN'T THAT FAIR.  >> THEY ARE ATTACKED BY DONALD  TRUMP AND SO THEY GET A LOT OF  COVERAGE. IT'S CHICKEN AND EGG SITUATION. TRUMP SHOULD NOT CHOOSE WHO  SPEAKS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE FACE --  >> DO THEY SPEAK FOR THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  >> THEY SPEAK AS MUCH AS I DO. THEY ARE REPRESENT THEIR  DISTRICT, I REPRESENT MY  DISTRICT. I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR 22 YEARS  AND HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE SUB-COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP BY  OUR CAUCUS AND THEY ARE  RELATIVELY NEW MEMBERS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ESPECIALLY  ALEXANDRIA BEATING JOE CROWELLY  SHOWED A REAL CAPACITY TO WIN A  RACE AGAINST A MAJOR OPPONENT. BUT MANY OF US HAVE DONE THAT  AND MANY OF US HAVE BEATEN TOUGH REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS BEATING  TOUGH DEMOCRATS.  >> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR  COMING IN AND GIVING US YOUR TAX EXPERTISE AS A CPA.

Think Tank says the U.S defense industrial base is not adequately prepared for the International Security environment that now exists the center for strategic and International Studies says its own War Games indicate the U.S use of Munitions would likely exceed the current stockpiles during a major regional conflict such as war with China and the Taiwan Strait the report says the U.S would likely run out of some Munitions in less than a week says the war in Ukraine has also exposed serious deficiencies in the industrial base tonight we want to talk about the situation with Taiwan and China Indiana Republican senator Todd young says every member of Congress should visit the island and see for themselves he is recently back from visit and he joins us this evening Senator young thanks for being here thanks for having me bro just back your sense of where things stand today where how Taiwan looks at it and obviously China's aggression happens uh week to week yeah Brad this visit was really important at this period of time I was the first member of Congress to visit Taiwan uh this year and I think the coming year and and really the next few years are going to be essential as we hear that the population is declining in in China uh they have a botch coveted response and that's broadly recognized and they have economic problems there may be a push by Chinese leadership Xi Jinping in particular to increase the threat of military Invasion which is uh why the Taiwanese have been upping their military game partnering with us on military training issues and acquiring more asymmetric weapons and I was there to reassure them uh that there is Unity uh amidst a a an atmosphere of disunity oftentimes here in Washington on this issue for the most part there is Unity that we need to continue to invest in relationship because it will cost us less to do so despite the walking back of some of the things President Biden has said saying we will stand up and be with Taiwan and then the White House walking that back and saying our policy hasn't changed you're saying there's Unity but if China attacks Taiwan are we in that game we are uh you know whether we like it or not we are part of an order and we benefit from an order uh that defends democratic values and in open trade and and that's been our way of life post-world War II and so uh we need to uh just as we're resourcing the ukrainians to fight on their fronts against Russian aggression we need to continue to give the Taiwanese what they need to contain China and ensure that a free and open Pacific is something Americans benefit from China continues to talk about this in a very aggressive way uh here's just recently the foreign Ministry only when China is fully reunified can there be true peace across the Taiwan Strait China will take the most forceful steps to oppose external interference so you know they're talking about it very aggressively and then when you look at something that you've dealt with a lot the semiconductors out of Taiwan uh New York Times writes this America's must-win semiconductor War if China took control of Taiwan and cut off our chip Supply that would be economically devastating akin to or worse than the loss of oil exports from a major Middle Eastern producer first of all do you agree with that and second of all you dealt with the chips act the science Act how long are we going to take before we are competitive outside of Taiwan on that front I do agree with that statement uh chips are arguably more valuable valuable in today's economy than hydrocarbons you can't turn on and off anything with an on off switch these days without microchips embedded in the device or the automobile or the weapon system so we need access to our own domestic Supply the chips and science act will get us that we're in the early stages of implementing that legislation of course takes a couple of years to actually build these computer chip plants these Fabs that are often in the news so uh that's more two three years from being able to compete on that yeah that's right we're a couple of years from competing but that said we've already improved our resiliency uh in part because of members of Congress and the administration have been more focused on working with other countries you see this is there's a broader narrative here it's that the Chinese are trying to weaponize our economic interdependence with their country they've become the workshop of the world and they aim to make higher end things not just toys and and assembling automobiles But ultimately designing and making these computer chips so uh they've threatened on a number of fronts a number of countries uh to use that interdependence to their own political benefit cutting off Imports of various things disrupting Supply chains we can't allow them to do that with a mission critical component like a semiconductor so we we often talk about the long-term threat from China but there's a near-term threat especially for some place like Taiwan do you think that that's coming to a head sooner rather than later yeah the conventional wisdom says that the actual threat of an invasion is is 10 years or or Beyond out in the future I've been rethinking that conventional wisdom of Lady informed by this trip as as well you know as you have a declining population a botch coveted response and slowing growth in China they may feel an urgency to go ahead and act certainly I would say there's more uncertainty about the intent engines of Xi Jinping and the Communists right now than there was just months ago so all the more reason that we need to stay Resolute we need to partner with the Taiwanese the Japanese the Australians Koreans and others and we in Congress need to send a message of unity uh by investing in our security and these important relationships last thing I mean in your party there are sections that feel like there's too much money going to Ukraine there's too much thought about other things and perhaps even Taiwan it hasn't really come up specifically in legislation but there's talk about this are you worried about that faction and and how that sits with what you see you know I I understand where they're coming from which is a lot of money has been spent of late on a lot of different things we're just emerging from a global pandemic and we need to establish priorities but the job of our federal government of government generally is to keep people safe and secure so they can go on and then carry on their daily lives this is our most fundamental responsibility that the threat has gone and the cost of War of armed conflict is far greater far greater than avoiding War which is what we all aim to do Senator young we appreciate your time come back thanks Brett thank you

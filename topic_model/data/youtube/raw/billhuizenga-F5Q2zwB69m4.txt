a nice to have you with us Fox 47 television as well and the emergency manager for the city of Detroit Kevyn Orr says the city is not expecting a federal bailout Kevyn Orr told Fox News Sunday that that was in Detroit that Detroit caused its own problems we'll have to dig itself out it's 18 billion dollars in debt chapter 9 bankruptcy on the other underline the United States congressman bill Huizenga Republican from West Michigan welcome back to the show hey MPs good to be with you you glad to hear the emergency managers say he's not expecting a federal bailout well and frankly I didn't expect him to say much anything different than that and I think we see governor Snyder echoing the same thing and that makes it very difficult I think for Obama to the Obama administration to sort of foist themselves on it when the people that are responsible for this are saying no no we need to take care of this we need to do that and I think that's a good thing interestingly Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina is sending a copy of her order to the President Obama she wants to stop the bankruptcy process she says it's against the state constitution to put Detroit into bankruptcy I haven't read her order but I've heard about it obviously and hey look this this this has been very well thought out Andy Dillon former democrat speaker who is the state treasurer appointed mr. or mr. wars been through all this Governor Snyder isn't the type of guy that typically just sort of plunges ahead without without knowing exactly what path he is going down so you know again I think you've had people for whatever reason try to inject race or try to inject a lot of the other stuff that's been going on but this has been 60 years in the coming and look you know the White House can't keep it gates open doors open for tours how are we going to keep the city like Detroit open well tough talk there from congressman bill Huizenga thank you very much for the view from Washington via West Michigan

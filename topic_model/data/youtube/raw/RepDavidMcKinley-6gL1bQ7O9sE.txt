uh thank you mr chairman and and welcome madam secretary um look to reduce global co2 the administration has been calling for zero carbon emissions from american power plants by 2035. and a testimony to congress john kerry stated that co2 levels greater than 350 parts per million are dangerous so my question can you guarantee me that the biden plan will lower global emissions to less than 350 parts per million well what i can guarantee you is that us getting back into the paris agreement it really is just a yes or no please madam secretary can you guarantee me that we'll get both 350. i'm not in the business of guaranteeing okay thank you so let me run through just a series of observations then uh the institute for energy research and others have testified that the residential utility rates are expected to increase a skyrocket to 2000 to 4 000 dollars if we rely totally on 100 renewables and if we shut down all the coal and natural gas power plants by 2035 entire communities will be hollowed out millions of jobs are going to be lost in a transition tax revenues for schools hospitals and first responders are going to be slashed children and families are going to suffer experts have testified before this very committee that extreme weather events will still occur unless china and india decrease their emissions and speaking of john kerry just last week before foreign affairs he warned us that trusting china to lower their missions would be quote stupid and malpractice so so let me get this straight utility bills are going to go up our neighbors are going to lose their jobs our schools will lose funding we will still have extreme weather events the co2 in the atmosphere will still be dangerously high and kerry says we can't trust china the worst polluter to lower its emissions so it appears to me that this administration is is willing to make sacrificial lambs sacrificial lambs out of coal miners pipeliners gas workers just to fit his political and i i a liberal ideolog ideology so madam secretary if you think america would be providing global leadership that you were starting to enter that's naive the rest of the world is not following and you know that in fact china just announced a few weeks ago that they're building 250 gigawatts more coal-fired power plants that's the equivalent of all the coal-fired power plants we have in america and they're also announcing that they're building 20 new coal-fired power plants in africa so what are you doing if this is the administration's definition of environmental justice you're ignoring reality so let me pivot then i'm secretary according to the mckinsey report people will be moving around the cities uh moving into cities around the globe at a rate of a million people per week from now until 2050. these people are going to need places to live and work if the paris accord discourages or prohibits the production of concrete plastic steel and aluminum because of their co2 emissions and they discourage us from harvesting trees because that is such an obvious sink for our environmental contributions what do we have left straw mud clay i mean according to the professor golfer at mit and responding to the study he said the most logical material available to meet this uh these demands are products derived from fossil fuels these products were being pursued under the trump administration's quote cold to products program but last month the doe at the national co council meeting jennifer wilcox of doe said you would not be pursuing cold products so madam secretary i'm going to say if mckenzie and mitch are correct how we meet this global need for construction material if we don't use fossil fuels can you elaborate uh i can so that was that was a lot and let me let me take pieces of it number one we are interested in using coal ash and coal waste to to extract critical minerals we think there's an opportunity there and in fact the nation the national energy technology laboratory is working on just that the head of the national energy technology laboratory you probably know is brian anderson brian anderson has been put in charge of a coal and power plant communities work group because this administration is so focused on making sure that west virginia appalachia coal regions get the benefit of this movement of the globe toward clean energy technologies there is a 23 trillion dollar market for products that reduce co2 emissions west virginia can be at the front and center of that west virginia can be a place where coal miners are actually installing the carbonyl right now don't you tell me no

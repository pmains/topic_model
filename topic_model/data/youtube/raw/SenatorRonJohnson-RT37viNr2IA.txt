at the agency let's go to the Senate Homeland Security Chairman is Senator Ron Johnson Center had good to have you back how are you great Neil how about yourself fine let me ask you then about what you make of what / director Holden was saying here that there is a crisis at that border this calls for sweeping action he said of the president's replacement for Kirsten Nielsen Kevin meh Kalinin that Kevin will put his foot on the gas meaning that he he will take dramatic action what do you think that means well first of all there absolutely is a humanitarian and national security crisis of the border back in 2014 President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis 120,000 unaccompanied children and people came into this country illegally his family units in just the first six months of this year 240,000 have come it's overwhelming our system but from my standpoint the ball is in Congress's court it's been the dysfunction in Congress we have to change laws listen we need better barriers you know it's up to the president's side who he wants in these agencies to advise him but the fact that matter is what's fueling this crisis are loopholes legal precedents that reward and incentivize unaccompanied children and people come to this into this country as family and it's it's basically through no father owned reduce CBP to a mere speed bump on the path of long-term residency for unaccompanied children and people coming to this family and his family it's we have to change these laws all right now the fact that there's been what some call the purge going on the security may be warranted I it sounds what you're saying said you believe it is warranted but will this complicate actions in the meantime at the border out of at a very difficult time what do you think I am concerned about a leadership void I've talked to Mick Mulvaney this sounds like this was a planned action I've got a great deal of confidence in the CBB Commissioner now acting homeland security secretary I'm a Kalinin he's choosing his team I think that's probably appropriate you still have season managers in DHS so I'm not panicked I'm concerned because leadership matters you know particularly when you're in the midst of a crisis but again let me emphasize the ball is in Congress's court the president can't fix this without Congress changing some of these laws so we're told sir that the White House senior adviser Stephen Miller has been very involved in this process I'm very dissatisfied a baby sharing the president's own anger at what's going on at the border well what do you think of the role he could be playing here well the problem with executive action even if its proper even this is legal they shop it to a court that overturns his decision or puts an injunction which again emphasizes we have to change these laws kneel only about 15% of the asylum claims that are made by people coming in as family and us are granted so we have to first create a you know have a more accurate initial determination so that we only so that the people that actually are lend this country based on a class Island claim have a far greater opportunity having that be a valid claim otherwise we have to be able to hold those individuals make that determination and if they don't have a valve asylum claim we have to return them to the home country that would be a real deterrent you know Michael Chertoff faced this with influx a surge of Brazilians in 2005 you know small far smaller numbers but 31,000 he instituted proud a program of rapid removal called Texas Holdem the next year only 1,400 came in so we know what works there has to be a consequence we have to remove people that don't have a vowel silent claim it has to be rapid but fair adjudication of those claims I'm wondering what you make separately doves me sir the president has two picks for the federal reserve that obviously have to get Senate okay's and the one that just got a fourth no vote among your Republican colleagues is Herman Cain the former presidential candidate fast food Titan is he toast independent whether he can make it first through the Banking Committee but he's been a former Governor chair in the past he's a business person means a capable individual I'm certainly not disqualifying him I don't want to listen to his testimony I'd want to evaluate him if he comes through the Banking Committee so I know he's at the limit of no votes among Republicans assuming doesn't get a single Democratic vote I know I've divided the Senate is these days in Washington in general is it is it your understanding that there are other Republicans who would similarly say no you're not the guy I really have no idea for my standpoint I kind of wait to see how the nominees work their way through the committees what information they're provide how they go through that confirmation process and I'll make my final decision if you had a choice between the two of them Steve Moore and Herman Cain because obviously two rejections for the president would be a bit much is it your sense it's going to be Stephen Worley survivalism again I really can't make that prediction again I will wait for these individuals go through the confirmation process provide the committee's that the information go through the hearings then we'll make our determination okay I know through a lot at today's I just wanted to get an update from you always good talking to you have a great day

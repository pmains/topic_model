Thank You mr. chairman as as many of you know I'm proud of how Eastern Washington has been leading the country in clean energy solutions such as clean renewable reliable affordable hydropower as we discuss ways to increase building efficiency I also wanted to highlight a way that we are leading and that is cross laminated timber CLT is strong sustainable and a renewable low carbon building material and it has the potential to significantly increase the energy efficiency of buildings there are two CLT manufacturers in the United States and they're both right now in eastern Washington Vagan Timbers in Colville and Katara in Spokane Valley in Spokane Avista utilities is working to develop an eco district center Center in our community that it will be that will include one of the most sustainable buildings in the country using cross laminated timber and and later on today katara is unveiling its new state of the art factory which will produce the highest volume of CLT in North America these Eastern Washington companies are on the cutting edge of building a more efficient and sustainable future I'm excited about what the potential of new and innovative building materials and processes such as CLT have economic growth for rural communities a cleaner environment stronger buildings and better forest management so it really is it's a it's a rural job solution it's a timber solution but it's also better forest management solution but it also is part of the carbon solution mr. Allen Funt do you agree that the properties of CLT mainly in strength flexibility sustainability and ability to sequester carbon make it an ideal material to build more energy-efficient mid-level buildings so I think that the most important thing about CLT is is that indicate what an innovative future would look like where we consider carbon sequestration as one of the factors I talked about the four things that we in the building sector understand that we must do one of them is essentially embodied carbon which you know the CLT technology is a terrific example of not just looking for products that are more energy efficient but actually have this additional benefit of actually sequestering carbon in the actual material itself there's a lot of innovation happening in that area I would say that at this point the CLT technology is kind of the poster child of just how how many layers of benefit can come from looking at that sort of innovation thank you I wanted to move on to another important issue in eastern Washington and that is housing affordability like many areas in the country we are experiencing a serious crisis and affordable housing we've consistently heard about the desire to mandate Net Zero buildings across the country I have concerns about how this is going to impact housing cost and how it might only add to the current affordability crisis that were in it's going to be difficult for me to support any legislation that would make it more difficult to find affordable housing as a result of additional government mandates mr. McIntyre given your experience building green homes how much more would it cost to go to Net Zero well one of the key items with Net Zero the first thing to get to Net Zero is you gotta optimize the envelope you got to reduce your load that's done a number of ways it's done by the shape of the structure the configuration the structure doesn't matter how you build or what you build it out it's just simple shape and then it's materials to build it out of reduce the load but it's I think it's a pretty fair statement to say that to get to Net Zero it's going to require renewables or something and that's where the additional cost really comes in at this point to get to an optimized home from I'll say a standard built home you're talking a few thousand dollars five to fifteen thousand dollars in that range could be as high as 20 when you go to Net Zero now we're looking at renewables of some sort I personally just put in a 12 kilowatt system on our farm and I did that work all myself and I did it because it makes sense now because we have net metering there's tax incentives and the cost of solar has come down because it's scaled much more than it was 15 20 years ago so now that that they're more affordable makes sense to do but they were still $18,000 for me and I installed all of it actually it was more like twenty thousand dollars and I installed it all that system quoted to me was about forty thousand so the difference in cost really starts coming in the PV that's we're getting to scale getting that consumer recognition which is solar we're starting to see we have net metering in Michigan and now we're seeing solar panels pop up small panels all over in yards and homesteads around Michigan thank you

tim kaine what do you think people in Virginia think about the fact that 200,000 people and workers in your state could lose their jobs that a lot of pain is going to be experienced by a middle class that has been squeezed over the past decade and yet you have politicians on both sites that aren't even getting together trying to save their jobs Joe three quick stories I i went on a 10-day Armed Services tour around the state went to an Army Hospital Fort Belvoir that treats wounded warriors and the wife of a guy getting treated there said hey these DoD civilians who are getting furloughed include the nurses who take care of my husband you know what can we do about this I was in Hampton Roads talking to ship repairs one small company was issuing warn notices to 300 of their 450 employees and here's a scary one I talked to rotc students at UVA who want to make military careers and one of them said to me essentially this I'm willing to to face the risk of hostilities that would put me in harm's way but in making a career choice do i really want to face the risk of uncertainty about whether my political leadership will provide support to the American military this is what I'm hearing as I travel around Virginia it's going to have a major effect on our economy 90,000 furloughs of DoD civilians alone and potentially 200,000 job losses so that's why we got to find the suburbs governor I call you governor I'm sorry senator and you got promoted you were my governor and you were terrific and you always liked emotion or not well I didn't say that Alaska does a year right way yeah what what are these so when you talk to these guys that are outraged flummox at what's going on what I've always thought the American people had great common-sense solutions for these things to what do they say is the best way to do this here they say three things so i went to it i took a little bit of time off saturday i went to a bluegrass concert set next to a guy who was about 80 was wearing a veteran's gap he leaned over to me and he said look I'm you're here for the music I'm not going to bug you but just go up and find compromise so fine compromised most people get that it's got to be a balanced approach that if we're going to deal with these fiscal issues whether sequester short term or budgetary long term it's got to be a balance of cuts and revenues and they accept that and the last thing this was interesting as i was doing this armed services to her not a single person at a shipyard or at a naval base said to me look lift up on our cuts by doubling cuts to somebody else nobody is saying make us at least out in the public you know save my bacon by frien somebody else's bacon there is a notion that we're going to have to make cuts but we ought to find revenues and as you guys know you probably watched in my home town on saturday my republican governor and my Republican legislature did a transportation package that was about two dollars of new revenue for every dollar of expense cuts they told Grover Norquist to take a hike if you know what transportation take a hike and they did the right thing in a balanced way that was Saturday 90 miles from here we ought to learn from that

Thank You mr. chairman I I really want to commend the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania for her work on this legislation and I believe the Congress must find a bipartisan way to solve the country's student loan debt problem this will require a multi-pronged response that includes reforming federal policies and price distortions providing loan education and counseling pushing colleges to reduce costs instead of using subsidies to increase the sticker price of tuition and protecting taxpayers who shoulder the tremendous financial burden of loan forgiveness program programs and defaults student loan crisis affects the financial stability of families and workers across the country including those who have taken out loans and those who have not but still bear the burden of paying for problematic loans and defaults as taxpayers my amendment would allow the estate of a deceased student loan borrower or a student loan borrower who has become disabled to seek discharge of a debt it is the current practice for bank lenders who provide private student loans to forgive the loans of the estates of deceased students and borrowers and borrowers who incur total and permanent disabilities upon request and certification and the current practice of this private agreement should be codified this amendment is consistent as a ranking member has mentioned with what industry is doing already and I urge my colleagues to support it and I yield back thank you

joining me now South Dakota Senator Mike rounds and Senator you've authored legislation to sort of uh you know push back on the ESG and these other Trends by the way which are designed to sort of gut business profits and even business culture but what I'm wondering is it too little too late this is a multi-trillion dollar Juggernaut on both sides of the Atlantic well it is a juggernaut but these types of new proposals should come through elected officials and right now the SEC is trying to do this just using a bureaucratic approach to rule making in fact the last time around here their last rulemaking process and by the way there's been over two dozen of these through the SEC in just the last year but the last one was 510 Pages at length and the goal of it was not to of whether or not there was a chance for an investor to make a profit they were talking quickly about had to do with the environment or with governance uh primarily what they're suggesting is is that they want to go after uh climate change through rule making and that's not the way that it should be done right yes he doesn't have any experts in there on that but what they are trying to do is is to put pressure on those those entities those businesses that many people are trying to invest in so what we've done is proposed that it any new rules that they have an interest in proposing have to be materially directed at whether or not an investor would find it useful for profit making purposes would an investor want that information to make a determination on whether or not they want to invest and this would apply to not only the Securities Act of 1933 but the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. so let me ask you uh about President Biden right now the White House really seems to be in a talespin after misjudging Saudi Arabia there's a lot of talk now about punishing Saudi Arabia for cutting their production and you know I mean many people are just saying why don't we just call a truce on the war of fossil fuels here at home it's a delicate thing but should we be punishing Saudi Arabia should we be looking for some other solutions to help Americans the best solution is to become independent when it comes to energy once again President Biden sent a terrible message the first day in office when he started telling investors I can shut down billion dollar energy projects with the stroke of a pen what that said to investors is is I could lose a lot of money if I invest in traditional proven energy sources that's the wrong message to send we have to get back to allowing investors to recognize the need for long-term energy sources we can keep them clean we don't have to to say we're going to limit it to one what we can do is is simply say that we're going to allow for investment in all energy sources we ought to be looking at clean uh uh uh atomic energy nuclear energy right now we ought to be looking at getting oil and gas back in the market natural gas can be produced right now and it is very clean but the bottom line is is why would an investor go in there and invest billions of dollars in major projects if a single person the president of the United States can shut down an entire multi-billion dollar project with the stroke of a pen it was a terrible message to send and the regulatory environment in this country right now which appears to be anti energy is the wrong direction to go if we really want to be tough on Russia if we want to be tough on other oil producers we should be competitive once again and we should be able to put ourselves in a position of not being reliant on outside sources absolutely I agree one thousand percent sir thank you so much Senator I really appreciate it and good luck with this uh pushing back on that ESU movement if there's some ulterior motives there

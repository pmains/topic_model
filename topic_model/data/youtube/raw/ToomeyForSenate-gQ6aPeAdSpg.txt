without further ado i'd like to introduce pattoon thank you very much chairman gleason and uh thank you very much to all of you who are attending today i'd also like to say a quick word of thanks to our host tony salvajo is the entrepreneur who launched computer aid and he and his colleagues were kind enough to give us this facility for this morning's press conference computer aid's a great company they do some great work for their clients both in the business and the government sectors helping to improve the efficiency and productivity especially of their technology applications and activities so i'm a big fan of computer aid we need more companies innovative entrepreneurial companies like computer aid here in the valley and here in pennsylvania i also want to welcome president obama to the lehigh valley i am uh first of all i'm delighted that he's coming to pennsylvania i'm delighted that he's going to be here in the lehigh valley i appreciate the fact that he is paying attention to pennsylvania and i appreciate the fact that he's turning his attention to job creation because this should be the number one priority of this government of this administration and it's awfully important here in pennsylvania i would suggest there are two huge fundamental problems that are intertwined really they're inseparable and we need to address both of them first is the fiscal crisis that has been created by the federal government in washington and the second is simply the lack of jobs the staggeringly high and unacceptable unemployment rate here in pennsylvania and across the country first regarding the fiscal crisis the truth is is just a staggering amount of spending has led to unprecedented deficits and unsustainable debt and we've got to fix this think of the litany that we have witnessed in the last year or so 173 billion dollars to bail out a single company aig uh 700 billion dollars in tarp money to bail out a whole series of failing banks almost 800 billion dollars in a stimulus bill that is not stimulating economic growth or job creation 110 billion dollars to nationalize two-thirds of the american domestic car industry 200 billion dollars to bail out fannie mae and freddie mac and several trillion dollars worth of guarantees for assets on their balance sheets you know in 2008 the federal deficit reached a level of 460 billion dollars and i thought that was unacceptably high i in fact was very critical of some of my republican colleagues in the house who i thought engaged in too much wasteful spending i was critical of president bush for his unwillingness to veto republican spending bills i think spending was growing too rapidly then but what's happening now is a whole different order of magnitude it's a whole different scale we went from a 460 billion dollar deficit last year to this year 1.4 trillion dollars and it's expected to be at least a trillion dollars next year as well think about the magnitude of a trillion dollars the federal government takes in something slightly less than a trillion dollars in all personal income taxes combined in a given year so in order to cover just that incremental increase in the deficit we'd have to double everybody's income taxes that's how big this is and these deficits are huge and they're projected to stay huge as far as the eye can see this is just unsustainable and all of this spending all of this money coming out of the private productive sector and going into the hands of politicians and government is already contributing to job losses it's actually making it harder for us to grow this economy and create the jobs we need and we see it in the numbers unemployment nationally over 10 here in pennsylvania about 10 and unfortunately i'm afraid likely to go higher but that's not all that they're doing in addition to this staggering amount of spending and deficits and debt we have proposed legislation that will is guaranteed to destroy millions of jobs across the country hundreds of thousands of jobs across pennsylvania if it's enacted one is this cap and trade idea this is a very convoluted and complex mechanism to basically impose huge new taxes on energy use well we all use energy and pennsylvania is an industrial state so we use lots of energy we're a coal state cap and trade would be devastating to pennsylvania would cost us tens of thousands of jobs this health care bill that's working its way through congress hundreds of new mandates on businesses all kinds of new expenses it doesn't lower the cost of health care in fact it's expected to raise the cost of premiums for people buying their own health care and the taxes that would be imposed new taxes can only discourage the creation of new jobs and speaking of taxes of course there's a whole raft of new taxes that they're proposing tax increases on wages on business on capital on income this cumulative effect can only have a further devastating effect on job growth these proposals alone already have a chilling impact on the willingness of small businesses and entrepreneurs to create new jobs if they actually get enacted it'll be absolutely devastating so i have some suggestions for president obama as i said i'm glad he's here i'm glad he's here to listen and i hope he'll consider these suggestions first we ought to terminate this tarp program it was bill conceived in the first place some of these monies have not yet been actually spent we can cut it off now and let's have a very specific plan to require the repayment of these bailout payments that went to big banks secondly i'd like to see us rescind the unspent and unobligated portion of the stimulus bill it isn't working why continue spending money we don't have let's save the hundreds of billions of dollars that can be saved by ending the tarp program and ending the unspent portion of the stimulus bill thirdly i think we really need to consider a cap on federal spending now when i say a cap it wouldn't be an absolute dollar cap it would be a tool to limit the rate of growth federal government spending is going to grow over time we understand that but it has to grow at a sustainable rate and so we need a mechanism to limit the rate of growth because clearly it's been growing at an unsustainable rate now if we did those things the many hundreds of billions of dollars we would save would number one reduce our deficits help to get our debt under control but secondly i would advocate taking a portion of it and using it to lower payroll taxes we had an across the board cut in payroll taxes both for workers and employers then every worker would immediately get a take-home pay raise on day one you wouldn't have to worry about whether there was a shovel ready project every worker is ready for a little more take-home pay he would help their families balance sheet help pay the bills and help grow the economy and by providing a match on the employer's share a reduction in the tax that employers have to pay we'd make it less expensive to hire the next worker and that's how you generate more job growth you know pennsylvania and america have some very great fundamental strengths that will allow us to recover very very strongly we've got the best educated best trained workforce in the world but here in pennsylvania i know we've got a terrific work ethic we've got people who want to work hard and be productive we've got a tremendous physical and technological and intellectual and institutional infrastructure on which to rebuild our economy we've got a long history of entrepreneurship and innovation and productivity and and that is the cornerstone of economic growth so i'm convinced we can restore the kind of job growth and prosperity that we need and we expect we've just got to remember where it comes from it comes from small businesses and entrepreneurs and private investment it doesn't come from ever more government borrowing and spending so my suggestion to the president is end the bailouts get federal spending under control no new burdens on job creators and let's lower taxes where we can so we can create the jobs that we need thank you very much

a 98 percent voting record on key votes for nfib no tax increases received a yes vote but most importantly pat has character and resolve what he says is what he will do and i'm pleased to announce that nfib has endorsed pat tsumi to be the next senator from the commonwealth of pennsylvania thank you very much lucian thank you for your kind words and thanks to all of you for having me here today and and most of all thank you for the endorsement of my candidacy for the expression of support and uh and cooperation and solidarity i'm very grateful and it means a lot to me as a former nfib member as lucian observed i did spend 10 years as a small business owner my brothers and i took all the savings that we had which wasn't terribly much but it was enough to just barely launch a little restaurant business and we did in allentown pennsylvania we later expanded the lancaster and there's no experience in my life that was more informative for me from which i i learned more and uh which i i cherish more than they experience of launching our own business and and seeing it grow and and uh i'll be honest with you many united worried about whether we'd be able to make payroll on friday but somehow we always managed and the business grew and it prospered and you know i took a lot of satisfaction from seeing the kind of folks that we were able to create opportunities for you know young men and women going to college who worked on the side in my restaurant um as a waiter or a waitress helped to defray some of the costs of going to college people coming out of out of high school who had never had a job before but learned to work in a kitchen and learn some skills were able to advance themselves and become more productive and and people who took a management role and were able to advance their career and and support their family so i i understand from a very very first hand and personal experience the invaluable role that that you as small business owners and entrepreneurs the opportunities that you create and it's a big part of why i'm running for the senate i have to say i do believe that the federal government in washington has gone off very much on the wrong path here and when you think about what has happened in just the last year or so serial bailouts of failing companies nationalizing whole industries spending on a scale that i never imagined possible deficits and debt that are absolutely unaffordable cap and trade which will drive energy costs through the roof card check which would deny workers a secret ballot and government run health care and that's just the first year this is this this is a government that's gone off the tracks but i am very um confident that the people of pennsylvania really don't want us to move in this direction this this leftwood lurch in the direction of a european style welfare state was not right it's not meant for america it's not what we're about and across pennsylvania i i hear people every day many of whom have never been involved in politics before but come up to me and say pat how can i help your campaign you've got to win we've got to take back our country we've got to take back our government we've got to restore the principles that helped make us the greatest most successful most prosperous most wonderful country in the history of the world and uh the fact is it didn't happen because government made it happen you know no government's ever created wealth governments can destroy wealth and governments can redistribute wealth but wealth and opportunity and prosperity and a rising standard of living in higher wages those things have always and only come from ordinary men and women who get up every day and go to work and they make the things that we value and they provide the services that we need it's the voluntary exchange of free people in a free society that's lifted more people out of poverty and created a better standard of living than any other system in the history of the world and it's certainly not too late and we still have the core of that system and we've got a i think a misguided government that's in control by one party which has been captured by the most liberal wing of that party and i think too many in that wing don't really have an appreciation often they don't have any personal experience they don't understand where jobs and opportunity really come from but i do and i know you do and i intend to go to washington and do the kinds of things that will help to encourage the real sustainable job growth in the private sector let me say one quick thing if i could and then i'd be happy to take questions and have a discussion here but one of the things that worries me a great deal and while the health care bill has been on the front page for a long time and understandably so i think it's a profoundly flawed bill but but we can't lose sight of the huge problem that's being created with the magnitude of spending this is a very very big worry for me you know for for about 60 years in america the federal government spent on average about 20 percent of the gdp of the country with remarkably little variation regardless of who was in power in one year this government took that to 25 percent of gdp that is itself a 25 percent increase in the size of the government virtually overnight and according to their own projections it stays at nearly that level for the indefinite future this is what is driving an unsustainable deficit and an unaffordable debt you know there's a little country on the edge of europe that's on the front page of the papers every day greece has jeopardized the value of the euro created political instability within the european union all because this little tiny country that's maybe three percent of europe's gdp is running a budget deficit that's 13 percent of their gdp folks the united states is running a budget deficit that's 11 percent of our gdp when when ronald reagan left office the total debt the accumulated deficits from all the previous years the total debt was about 40 percent of gdp when george w bush left office total debt was about 40 percent of gdp today total debts about 62 percent of gdp and according to the obama administration according to their own projections it goes over 80 percent before this administration leaves office if they have their way and if they have the optimistic outcomes that they're projecting and about which i am skeptical folks we cannot afford this we cannot sustain this this will cost us an enormous amount of economic growth and it will deprive our kids of achieving the kind of standard of living that they deserve so we've got to change the direction that's all we got to win some elections to do that uh and i'm confident we're going to but uh uh you know i learned firsthand where opportunity comes from as a small business owner a lesson that you all know very very well and i am determined to go to washington and to end the bailout to failing companies to get spending under control to lower taxes where we can to help encourage entrepreneurs to take risks and to create jobs and create opportunities but at the end of the day we need to remember prosperity comes as driven by the private sector and that's that's where that is going to be the source of the growth that'll get us out of this economic recession and if we remember that we remember the source of economic prosperity then the 21st century can be another great american century so thank you very much for your endorsement and i look forward to your questions

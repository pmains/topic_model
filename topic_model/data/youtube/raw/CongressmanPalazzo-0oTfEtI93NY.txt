mr speaker the resolution proposed by my colleague from ohio does a disservice to the men and women who have courageously defended our country from our enemies in afghanistan this past weekend i had the distinct pleasure and honor of welcoming home the 287th engineering company commonly referred to as sappers based in lucedale mississippi they had the most dangerous mission in afghanistan they were the ones that cleared routes so our men and women in uniform can have safe passage they're the ones that rooted out the ids ieds and the roadside bombs and i'm happy to say they came back a hundred percent uh with one wounded warrior but but they did their mission while they were obviously overjoyed to see their loved ones again the soldiers i spoke with were good to go with that mission and what they had accomplished they fully understand that there are those who want to indiscriminately kill and maim americans and we would rather take the fight to them overseas and abroad instead of having them come to our backyard to our schools and our playgrounds just yesterday i had the chance to speak personally with general petraeus after his testimony before the house armed services committee and again as a marine veteran the persian gulf war and currently serving in the mississippi army national guard i know firsthand what good military commands look like and general petraeus is a great leader a professional soldier and someone whose opinion i respect very much he quoted it with based on this resolution his quote was the taliban and al-qaeda obviously would trump this as a victory and a success needless to say it would completely undermine everything our troopers have fought and sacrificed so much for quote mr speaker congress's constitutional responsibility is ensure the courageous men and women in our armed services have the tools and equipment and the training to do their job and come home safely to their family our war fighters don't need armchair generals in this congress arbitrarily dictating terms that will cause irreparable harm to them and to the national security of this country i urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and i yield back

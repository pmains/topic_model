I rise today in strong opposition to these baseless articles of impeachment our founding fathers never intended impeachment to be a one-sided political weapon sadly the majority has reduced this serious constitutional action to a purely partisan tactic to takedown president Trump history will not be kind to the vote today it will be remembered as a rushed process that lacks credibility or transparency with a predetermined outcome that puts a premium on political theater instead of facts by any objective standard the Democrats impeachment case is the thinnest imaginable there's no impeachable offense before us today it's a complete and total sham I close not by quoting a president from the past but rather from the duly elected president Donald Trump to my Democrat colleagues through you madam Speaker you are the ones interfering in America's election you are the ones subverting America's democracy you are the ones obstructing justice you are the ones bringing pain and suffering to a republic for your own selfish personal political and partisan gain these are hard words I know but that is the sad reality of this entire process I will proudly vote no today a vote that oppose our Constitution defends our president and preserves the pillars of our nation's democracy and now I yield back

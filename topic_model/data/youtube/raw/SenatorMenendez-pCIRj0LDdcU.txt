thank you mr chairman i rarely do this but i have to say that in the 108 year history of the federal reserve there has never been one hispanic appointed to the federal reserve not one to the regional banks to head the regional banks recently the federal reserve had the opportunity to change that history it had two qualified candidates that didn't choose one of them 60 million americans of hispanic descent 18.4 percent of the american population 2.3 trillion dollars of domestic gdp and the federal reserve is making major decisions about this community as well as america as a whole and yet we have no voice um now i like my friends at the federal reserve like to tell me that i should have faith but faith that hasn't been rewarded faith that ultimately doesn't lead us to see a change in the course of events after a century and faith also and those who are making these appointments where there was an opportunity to make appointments that would reflect the full diversity of our nation is uh you know a faith that isn't ultimately uh honored so uh i'm going to vote for mr barr because he made a personal commitment to at least pursue a process that can create the opportunity for a hispanic american to be considered there's no guarantees that that person would be appointed but to create a process which the federal reserve itself should adopt as a whole in order to break uh this century-plus period of time in which no one no one from our community despite a 2.3 trillion domestic marketplace uh ultimately has a say in i take the constitutional role of advise and consent seriously as you know and as you and i have talked i i will continue to work with you on this and uh president biden has been very open to suggestions from members of this committee and we will continue to aggressively move in that direction i

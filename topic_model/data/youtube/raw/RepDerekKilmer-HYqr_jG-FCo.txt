Mr Speaker I rise today in opposition to legislation that is nothing short of an attack on workers a bill that will harm the economic security of American families all over this country Mr Speaker I strongly believe that economic growth is the key to strengthening the middle class but only if we have fair rules in place that allow workers to share in that growth by negotiating for decent wages and benefits national relay the National Labor Relations Board put forward a rule that ensures workers are treated fairly in the election process the reduces bureaucratic red tape and ensures the right to collectively bargain is guaranteed unfortunately this body is considering legislation that would overturn that rule it's wrong and it's a waste of time if Congress wants to support business we should pass legislation to repair our crumbling infrastructure so the folks can get their products to market to reform our tax code to make it easier for small businesses to compete or to invest in workforce development so that our kids are prepared to compete in a 21st century economy mr. speaker there are Democrats who stand ready to work with you on an agenda that actually strengthens the middle class but this resolution doesn't do that and I urge my colleagues to stand up for workers by voting down this resolution Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back gentlemen

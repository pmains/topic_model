something far right of each party a Republican supporter of the president's trade policy congressman Patrick McHenry is the house chief deputy whip we still don't know Pelosi do we we still or or Hillary Clinton it's very strange the way that the this has got people in different corners well she was Secretary of State she started the initial rounds of discussions she was very deeply involved when she's in an administration and it's like she doesn't know what what's happening on this which is shocking to me this is the president's top legislative priority at the moment but and yet Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic nominee won't get off the offense here I don't think you're not speaking totally honest it's not shocking to you that she's not taking a stand now that's actually pretty fair yeah it's pretty generic say let's just say I'm what skeptical yeah okay there you go seen its twenty years that we've been in the public eye you're obviously not okay at this point when we hear even from the right that nobody knows what's in this and that there's climate change stuff and there's Obama's doing all this crazy stuff in here I have you been sold a bill do you know what's in it if you read it does anybody know so we're talking about trade promotion Authority that is the mechanism by which Congress both the House and the Senate has a vote on this trade agreement now that means that we have to construct how we deal with trade agreements within this legislation it is our internal processing Congress and it also dictates the president must make public disagreement hookah for 60 days before we have a vote on any trade agreement in Congress so then that's a red herring right people aren't the right if people don't know what's going to be we have to pass this piece of legislation so Congress actually has oversight if we pass this legislation members of Congress can go to every negotiating round for every trade agreement going forward we're currently not credential for that it mandates this public disclosure piece it also gives us the opportunity on an ongoing basis friend put with the administration if they don't comply with it fat chance they're going to get any agreement past so that we need to pass trade promotion Authority so we can restrict with this president his act as you as a person that in the past that someone had said you're going to be going door-to-door selling one of the presidents programs yeah you would have said what you would have said that's what has people wondering and it has me wondering um the present makes a lot of sense on this I've seen him make so little sense on so many other things what was it about this this that I mean don't you look at it and say there must be something that I shouldn't like here right but here's the problem it Republicans just look at policy let's separate the president out from this description if you look at policy of bringing down taxes where are Republicans we know where Republicans are in favor of that so when we're talking about tariffs their taxes and if we're saying we're we have the ability to go she ate with other countries around the globe for them to bring their taxes down water than bar bys not see it that way there well because this it's all these red herrings that come out there are accusations and if you look at what the labor unions and what's here a club have teamed up to do with their coalition they've made some very inventive assertions in what they're saying in my district it which is very anti-labor you need to restrict the President's authority you need to not give the president this authority I need more Democrats that come around or you need more but hold the line of them if you look at cap toe we had 15 Democrats if you look at the last time we had trade promotion Authority we had twenty five Democrats if the president's in the 20s I think if the president hits 30 days I think I think it's possible so but what this has to be led by as Republicans and Republicans need to understand the opportunity to restrict this president is for us to pass trade promotion Authority you can sell it that anyway Thank You chief deputy like a whip mchenry did i say thanks okay still

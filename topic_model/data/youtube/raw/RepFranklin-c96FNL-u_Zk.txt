thank you mr chairman uh admiral early in the testimony today uh you painted a pretty stark picture of the threat we're facing from china the things we need to do to get there and your exchange with ranking member rogers it sounds like you know your assessment this current year budget doesn't cut it and if extrapolated over a number of years we'd have a hard time meeting that threat that we're facing is that that a fair assessment i think this is a critical decade for us to close gaps against china or in those areas where we have over match to create distance against china uh and so i think that if we don't do it in this decade i think we're fooling ourselves based on the momentum that it's going to happen in the future that's why we need to get after it and that's why we need to make these risk informed decisions about modernization versus keeping uh legacy uh platforms all right thanks general um from the marine corps perspective would you agree with that is this current year budget what you need i know there are things on there that you want that we're not getting but this is if this is extrapolated over a number of years is that going to impact your ability to get to the core that you feel we need to face the china threat if our budgets don't even match inflation then the risk is high correct that at some point the future will overmatch and that's that's not what you want us to that's not a place we want to be in very good uh admiral specifically on p8s uh the neptunes the risk informed uh war fighting requirement was for 138 with the nine congress added last year 128 yet there's no funding for this year has the assessment changed or is this an example of we don't have enough money to do the things we think we need to do sir i think the the assessment has changed we don't think we need as many as we initially uh estimated so we've had some good runtime in the p8 they're a heavily sought after aircraft we're using them we're using them in the eastern med we're using them in the high north we're using the pacific with a great degree of effectiveness so we know how to use the platform better than we did initially when we first procured it and so it's led to a decrease slight decrease in overall numbers okay uh general berger talked about uh the pilot shortage and some of the things the marines are looking at but admiral from from your perspective one of the things we're going to need to do and as as he alluded to and i've seen in my own experience you it's not just the the pilot being produced right out of flight school it's that second tour jo with a couple of cruises under their belt that's strike lee qualified that doesn't happen overnight we we ran into that deficiency in the 90s with the t-notch and by the late 90s you just can't you can't produce them at the snap of a finger what are we doing to ensure we don't get there i tell you we're monitoring it really closely and so in terms of incentives to those pilots i'll just mention a couple one of them is the career uh career intermission uh break where they can go off and study if they need to or they can uh they can take the time off to begin a family if they need to uh we're trying to work with them on an individual basis so that we can retain them at the same time keep their skills uh proficient there are also as you would uh as you would imagine there are monetary uh considerations there we we do have we do have some incentives that uh that we have offered pirates we've created a separate now track for a professional flight instructor uh and so that avenue exists as well uh and so what we're trying to do is in a very in a competitive uh environment with respect to the commercial aviation sector we are trying to remain competitive to ourselves competitive ourselves in terms of making naval aviation the best place to work i'm glad to hear that about the professional instructor that was an idea kicked around a long time ago and i knew a lot of people that would have loved to have stayed in the cockpit didn't have aspirations for all right like you all right that's great to hear uh and and finally mr harger this is really more just editorial for me this is my first uh pass through on the budget here it's not what from a bipartisan response you're hearing here today it's not enough um you've got professionals who uh we've entrusted to come to you with the advice of what's needed to get the job done but they're also military and at the end of the day they're going to snap to and salute and get the job done with what you give them and it's not enough in peace time that's going to lead to low morale uh lack of readiness and it's going to kill people it's going to kill soldiers sailors and airmen in a wartime footing in the in the future that we're headed towards it's our very national security at risk we've got to do better this is not going to be an acceptable posture going forward let's now yield back thank you

all right well first let's talk about uh jen saki there congresswoman mace uh trying to blame republicans for defunding the police i mean i guess you guys deserve a round of applause somehow the republican party has infiltrated the oakland city council of the minneapolis city council the atlanta city council all this time i guess you guys had a gop operatives in there nobody knew it i know it's crazy there's brazen and shameless and then there's jen saki accusing republicans of wanting to defund the police uh you know we want to defend the police not defund them and they are backtracking with this infrastructure package trying to throw everything in it to make us look bad but i gotta tell you thursday friday and monday we receive three different messages in three different days regarding the supposedly bipartisan infrastructure package and so i don't know what they're doing i don't even know if they know what they're doing but republicans aren't going to get behind a bill that's tied to budget reconciliation more spending never ending spending and the highest tax increase tax hike ever seen in american history we just can't get behind that deal yeah well congressman buck um i want to take uh take a closer look at that gen saki sound bite again we heard one from emerald here here's another spin on the president did mention that the american rescue plan the state and local funding something that was supported by the president a lot of democrats who supported and voted for the bill could help ensure local cops were kept on the beaten communities across the country as you know didn't receive a single republican vote that funding has been used to keep cops on the beat now i would be willing to bet if democrats were willing to offer that up as a skinny bill you guys would support that part of it but it's not really in there is it that's disingenuous of her to say that well it absolutely is and the problem with that bill was it was a multi-trillion dollar bill and it had a small portion for police and now they're saying that republicans don't support police because we didn't support the multi-trillion bill uh it's absolutely nonsense and and the the problem is the problem that democrats have is that they are being uh labeled because of the uh activities of various city councils as well as members of congress who have called for defunding the police they are rightly being labeled as the the party who wants to defund police uh if they want to offer a bill a small bill to help local police departments absolutely they'll get republican support on that i personally don't know that republicans should be supporting at the national level uh what happens in state and local uh jurisdictions but we certainly will be out in our own districts supporting the police and making sure that they have appropriate funding yeah no it's an important distinction i mean we've seen you know communities that do need additional resources when it comes to law enforcement but uh republicans certainly don't support a federal law enforcement approach at least not from the bite administration other than the department of justice and we know what's going on there i i want to talk to you congresswoman mace about nancy pelosi and her desire to create this 13-member panel to investigate january 6. we heard congresswoman maxine waters from over the weekend saying that democrats tried to work with republicans to find some common ground on where this investigation would go but she said that was impossible what is that common ground she is talking about or was is she just lying well there's very little common ground right now in dc on capitol hill and in fact we spent more federal resources and money investigating january 6 than we did for 9 11. there are four federal agencies already on board doing their own investigations criminal investigations in fact the fbi secret service homeland security and the attorney general and and in the department of justice and then on top of that we have 10 committees both in the u.s senate and the u.s house of representatives who are also each doing their own investigations with broad subpoena power and investigative authority to do that and so if that's not good enough when all of those investigations are done and already 450 people have been charged with a crime there have been over 500 federal charges for crimes committed on january 6. if at the end of the day when all of this is said and done and they don't get the answers they want then i think at that point you could have that conversation but at this juncture all of the agencies and all the committees are already investigating they're doing a very good job and if you want to talk about bipartisan i would hope that of all places the department of justice would be nonpartisan in those investigations so it's it's kind of confusing we're doing all this we're focused on all of this and yet they need to have one more commission do you really think that they're doing a good job on the investigation i i really i you know in terms of the charges they've already been over 450 people charged that's significant we are seeing uh we are having committee hearings in fact we've had multiple hearings in the oversight committee that i sit on for january 6th so the work is being done um and i think everyone's doing their part for it to have another commission with 13 people led and guided and put together by nancy pelosi i think that it's too much it's overkill for all the other resources we're devoting to december today and i asked that question because we've almost been conditioned as americans to you know watching episodes of csi like there's going to be you know cut and dried information everything's going to be clean and packaged and we're going to get this you know thing that's going to be obvious to everyone actually what happened and we're learning that that's not quite the case here this is going to take some time to investigate what do you think congressman buck do you think the investigation i mean are you happy with what you're seeing from the department of justice and the fbi so far when it comes to investigation into this well i have to tell you i think that there is a much broader investigation that needs to happen we currently know that antifa was funded on a national basis we don't see any indictments we don't see any charges of what happened in the summer of 2020 we don't see the department of justice moving in a coordinated fashion with state and local authorities to investigate those issues if you want to talk about political crime and you want to talk about giving americans some assurance that that crime in their communities is going to go down it's not an isolated incident on january 6th it is the the pattern of conduct that we've seen over time uh throughout this country really not just in portland but throughout the country uh from from these radical socialists that are uh really bent on destroying uh property and killing humans yeah i mean you used to hear the fbi director for christopher ray talk about that as part of this discussion about what he considers dves which is domestic violent extremists his terminology but now you know he has stripped away all that kind of talk of antifa and these other leftist organizations from that broader conversation so that hasn't happened let's also talk to about these big tech bills i'm going to go first to congressman buck on this and we'll go back to congresswoman mays because congressman buck you do support these house judiciary bills that are coming out of the committee there but i wanted to ask you about what happened yesterday the new york times headline saying that the antitrust case against facebook crumbles a federal court said the ftc did not prove facebook maintains a monopoly what's your reaction to that well what the judge said was that the ftc the federal trade commission didn't show the market that uh facebook was uh supposedly uh in control of and the problem with the law is that the law of the the sherman act was written in the late 1800s the clayton act was written in the early 1900s and those laws haven't been updated there was no such thing as social media around obviously in the early 1900s and so the judge said you know if we look at the tobacco industry we know what the market is in the tobacco industry we don't know what the market is with social media and the ftc hasn't made their uh hasn't met their burden what the judge did was give the fdc uh 30 days to further define that issue but it's exactly why we need to update the laws to meet our new economy and these laws the six bills that pass on a bipartisan basis out of the u.s house judiciary committee are exactly the first step the starting point and getting us to where we need to go and holding big tech accountable not just with their monopoly and protecting consumers but also on on the speech side making sure that the antitrust amnesty that these big tech giants have had for years doesn't apply to the uh the censorship um and and we are able to deal with the censorship in the marketplace the congresswoman mace i talked to congressman jordan jim jordan about this too he does not support the bill like congressman buck does so i'm going to ask you how you feel about this do you think it it is a first step or does you know is it really a starting point i do believe it's a starting point what we do know is that we need to modernize our laws for for big tech and social media but and we do know that big tech and social media is stacked against conservatives in my own campaign for congress in november a week before the election my ads on facebook were pulled for 15 hours in a very critical time in a swing district in a in a heated race one of the top races last year where republicans flipped a democrat seat we also see conservatives all the time being banned or temporarily banned from social media where that's twitter or facebook they've banned president former president trump for the next few years but then leave communist china on twitter as they're advocating for genocide against muslims in their own country the standards are different so if you're going to have a standard for free speech on those platforms those private companies and those businesses it needs to be the same standard regardless of your political affiliation needs to be an evil and equal playing field i'm also hearing rumblings about facebook investing in ads over hundreds of millions of dollars in certain areas around the country to turn out the vote those are things that i have questions about and i want answers for to understand what's really going on and and and recognize and know that there is an uneven playing field and hold these companies accountable yeah and congressman jordan's message was that he wants more in those bills to address those issues specifically a great conversation unfortunately we are out of time we got to get to a commercial break congresswoman nancy mace thanks so much congressman ken buck thank you for your time as well we appreciate it guys

friends we are within days of the most critical election in our lifetimes the reason i say that is because this election isn't just about who's going to occupy the white house for the next four years it's also about which party will be in control of congress come january because whoever is in control of congress will set the destiny of this nation for the next several years if not decades to come and we've already seen what the democrats have planned which has returned to an era of big government oppressive regulation and high taxation actually to an extent that we have never experienced before in this nation that's why it's important that we work harder and do more than we have ever done before to make sure that republicans regain control of congress that's why i'm working extremely hard this year not only just to win my own election but also to help some of our candidates who are running in these key races in swing districts which are critical for us regaining control of the house of representatives i have seen the numbers and the numbers look good for us but the democrats also know the numbers and they're dumping millions of dollars in these races we have an incredible field of candidates possibly the best that we've ever had but they need our help that's why i have created a fund that will allow me to raise money to help these candidates this fund is called standpack and i'm asking you to help me help them by making a generous contribution to standpack today this money will go to races not just here in georgia but across the nation which will ensure that we take control of the house of representatives so that we can save america it is that important please contribute to standpack today and we will save this nation for our children and our grandchildren god bless you and god bless america

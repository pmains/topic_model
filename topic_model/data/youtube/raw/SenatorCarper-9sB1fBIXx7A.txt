mr president i rise today in strong support of the nomination of judge merrick garland to be the united states attorney general and to describe some of the greatest challenges confronting the u.s department of justice the oj as it's often called is unlike any other federal agency it's charged with protecting the constitutional rights and civil rights of all americans the past four years to put a miley broke the log-standing precedent that has enabled the department of justice to operate above the political fray the trump justice department joined a misguided lawsuit to take away health care coverage for tens of millions of americans the trump justice department oversaw a cruel set of immigration policies that separated young children from their parents at our southern border and locked these children in cages and the trump justice department remained painfully silent as our nation cried out for racial justice in the wake of the murder of george floyd and unarmed and unarmed black man after the firing of attorney general sessions the attorney general the united states became the attorney general for donald trump when our nation's top law enforcement official becomes little more than a political fixer for the president it erodes the principle of equal justice under the law and calls into question the mission of the department in waning days of the trump administration with nearly half a million americans dead from the coronavirus a swarm of white supremacists and other extremists storming our capital including this very chamber and disrupted our peaceful transfer of power tragically five people died during the january 6 insurrection including a united states capitol police officer our nation must now bring the perpetrators to justice and address the root cause in our society root causes in our society that enable white supremacists and other extremists to fuel hate and violence mr president the next attorney general can cannot shy away from these historic challenges the next attorney general must meet these uh challenges head on to restore integrity and the justice department and to work every day every day to restore the trust of the american people president biden has nominated judge garland not just one of the finest public servants i have ever met but one of the finest people i've ever met the attorney general of the united states his name should be familiar to many of our colleagues because president obama nominated him to serve on the supreme court in 2016. at the time i called him perhaps the most qualified individual ever nominated to be on our nation's highest court and i still believe that to this day judge judge garland graduated at the top of his class at both harvard undergrad and harvard law school he clerked for justice brennan on the supreme court and after a time in private practice he worked at the department of justice where he prosecuted the perpetrators of the oklahoma city bombing judge garland called this and i quote him the most important thing i've ever done in my life close quote in 1997 republicans democrats joined together to confirm judge garland to the d.c circuit court of appeals which is often called the second highest court in this land judge garland has served honorably and dutifully for the past 24 years on the d.c circuit including several years as its chief judge judge garland is gaining the respect of all of his colleagues left right and center as someone who knows the law never allows politics into the courtroom judge garland works to build consensus and find principle compromises judge garland will build a bring a wealth of legal law enforcement and judicial experience to the department of justice to make him uniquely qualified uniquely qualified to lead the department at this critical moment judge garland will be an attorney general for all americans all americans he will not shy away from the challenges facing the justice department he will meet them head on at the top of judge garland's to-do list is bringing the perpetrators of the january 6 insurrection to justice judge garland will make sure that the department states out of the political fray and remains independent from the white house and judge garland will answer the calls for racial justice and refocus the department on one of its core missions to protect the civil rights and voting rights of all americans mr president while i will never truly forget the shameful treatment of judge garland during his previous nomination to serve on the supreme court and in my heart i'll always believe that he should be serving the supreme court today i am grateful that judge garland has answered the call to serve i'm also grateful to his wife for many years i'm grateful to his family for supporting him and allowing him to serve us as he has he's more than just a a judge or an attorney or a servant he's a mentor he's somebody who every week for years 20 years has made time found time in his life to mentor a kid who needs somebody in his life or her life as a someone who's mentored for many years myself i just want to say god bless you god bless you judge garland my hope today is he'll get a re resounding resounding food vote out of this uh out of this body he's earned it he deserves it and with that i yield the floor

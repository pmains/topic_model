joining us back in studio tonight is bakersfield congressman kevin mccarthy good evening congressman good evening just today we learned that you will help lead an economic recovery hearing to find solutions to revitalize america's economy in response to president-elect obama's request for input first uh how did you get chosen to lead that hearing and secondly what do you think is going to help revitalize this economy well i got asked to serve on a panel when uh the president-elect went and met with all the leaders he asked the republican leadership to put together a panel to come up with their ideas to be a part and i i applaud the president-elect for doing that and so we have a working group about 12 of us and we've been working all last week we'll go back tomorrow morning work tomorrow night and others and then we'll have a hearing on thursday from some outside experts because we want to come up with the best ideas to work to put a stimulus forward that best moves the country in the right direction we just heard from steve handelsman do you agree with president-elect obama that the second half of this wall street bailout be expedited we're talking about 350 billion uh no because uh studies have come out from the accounting office to show the first 350 how it was used was it used effectively efficiently how many americans actually got a bailout themselves so when you think about it they want 350 billion right now and a trillion after he's sworn in we cannot spend our way out of this problem i mean part of that is what's gotten us into the problem the first place i think we need a great great deal more of accountability and transparency before we move forward what about help for distressed homeowners who are facing foreclosure i mean they seem to be slipped off to the back burner here they're slipped off they want to put another 350 billion into the financial industry market where you see some of these banks that didn't need the money forced to take the money what'd they do with it they went and merged and bought other ones that's not the best use of taxpayers money at this time

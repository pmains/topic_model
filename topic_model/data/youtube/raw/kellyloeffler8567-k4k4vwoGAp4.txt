joining me right now is Senate joint economic committee member and Senate health education labor and pensions committee member Georgia senator Kelly Lafleur senator it's a pleasure to see you this morning thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me on Maria and congratulations on five years what an honor to be on your show today thank you oh thank you so much Kelly really appreciate that let's talk about this stimulus and what you'd like to see where do you think are the holes right now I know that we're trying to understand better where the cares Act has landed and how it's being distributed and how that plays out before another stimulus package is is coming up but what are you and your colleagues talking about in terms of the real need for a fourth stimulus package senator well it's an important question right now and as we look at the efforts that we've put out through the cares act and cares 3.5 it's been around jobs jobs jobs jobs so what can we do to get people back to work this is the number-one thing I think that we've done to help rebuild this economy quickly after implementing the cares Act nearly three trillion dollars of aid and roughly half of that still has to be deployed and I've actually spoken with secretary minuchin about ideas I have for how we can continue to use that stimulus to get jobs built back up get our employers open for business we still need States to open that's happening gradually but here I am in Washington much of the city is still shut down we need our economies to open back up yeah I want to ask you about that because we've seen a little bit of an increase of cop√°n 19 cases in pockets across the country that's raising concern of a second wave of kernal virus and whether or not it's emerging in Georgia the statewide shelter in place order ended April 30th and today there are nearly 54 thousand cases so senator how are we supposed to you know balance the idea that we want this economy back in a normal normalized zone and yet the more we come out and interact and engage the more the risk increases for this pandemic to show us show it up again in a minute in a big way we're seeing spikes well Maria we're also seeing increases in testing so naturally we're gonna see more cases and we know much more about this virus today we know it's transmissibility we know what to do to prevent that we need to be talking about how we reopen safely when Georgia reopened we continued to flatten the curve we've seen hospitalizations decline the rate of deaths decline we've done it safely and people are thrilled to be back in their jobs getting back to church and synagogue we need to continue that dialogue we had a hearing this week about getting kids back to school millions and millions of kids across our country and I've developed a plan called USA rise plan about how we go back to work safely rebuild the economy at the same time meanwhile managing the safety precautions we need to take around the virus but the number one concern right now has to be kidding people back to work safely yeah these are all really important points that you make let me ask you about Georgia's primary elections on Tuesday people were seen waiting in long lines for hours to vote could this be a preview of what November will look like these long lines can we get this done any more efficiently well we absolutely have to what we saw on Tuesday is unacceptable it really doesn't represent the best of Georgia I know that will come together to fix those challenges people have to have free fair access to vote and we have to have confidence in the system so that everyone who wants to vote gets to vote and yes in November I we have to completely fix that and I know I trust the state the counties are very much working on that today and what are your thoughts as the president now heads to Dallas to talk about police reform we've got these movements across the country to defund the police senator your reaction well I think the president has done a great job of demonstrating what we need to do he like I has has mourn the loss of George Floyd our hearts go out to his family at the same time I'm so glad to see justice being done swiftly in that case that needs to happen we cannot however defund the police this movement is completely wrong in fact we need to give the police more resources we need to honor the work that the police force around our communities do they do tremendous work for us keeping us safe and I know the president is looking at how we preserve law and order and we can always improve that's what America does there's always room for improvement and I trust that what comes out of this process will be positive it'll bring that needed change so that police officers get the respect that they deserve the resources that they need to keep our community safe and I just I have to say thank you to our law enforcement community for everything they do every day across the community because I know they want the bad apples rooted out too yeah all right senator great to talk with you this morning thanks so much for joining us great to see you thank you for Senator Kelly yeah for joining us this morning in Washington thank you very much much more

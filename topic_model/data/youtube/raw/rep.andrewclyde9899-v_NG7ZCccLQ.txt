the left once again attempting to limit the Second Amendment in ways they don't even comprehend themselves this time against one of these one of these this is not a firearm they're going to try to ban this it looks like a glorified pencil holder okay primarily used for disabled veterans to enjoy the recreation of shooting joining us now for more Georgia congressman and member of the House Appropriations Committee Congressman Andrew Clyde sir appreciate being here well good morning Carl I appreciate being with you this morning so this this this awful murderous deadly piece of plastic um is what the ATF has changed the definition of a of a rifle to basically accommodate this so it is it is an assault thing now um now I have an Untold number of these on an Untold number of firearms and I find this highly um puzzling that they're gonna now classify a bunch of people as felons if they don't March in to register these under the NFA yeah it's a very troubling as a matter of fact when the ATF decides to redefine a definition then they are truly making new law and ATF does not have the authority to make new law that is uh you know the the legislative branch that's Congress Congress does that not the ATF and so they have overstepped their bounds here and it is high time that as soon as this rule gets published in the Federal Register at that point it will become official and then we will introduce a congressional review act joint resolution to take this rule down so that this rule will never be able to come back it's just unacceptable that the ATF uh um tries to create new law you know the whole point of it in my opinion is to get more guns registered through the National Firearms Act the NFA and um and you know what happens after registration is obviously confiscation because it's amazing that they gave only 120 days to register what could be you know three to 40 million Firearms which is impossible it's absolutely impossible so those folks that are quote found with the uh arm brace on their firearm unregistered after the 120 days are subject to confiscation but right so Congressman apologies here but I'm I'm not a constitutional scholar I don't have a law degree I don't even have an undergrad but it's pretty simple shall not be in French so if I own a firearm with this lawfully purchased in the state of Connecticut on it I have never committed any crimes I feel like we are the first ones taxed and the last ones considered every time how is it not infringing on my right to keep and bear that arm if all of a sudden I have to do more things to comply with something that I already own legally you're absolutely right Carl um you know that's the big issue right here the second amendment has a supremacy clause shall not be infringed and our federal government the executive branch is ignoring that supremacy clause and it's time for Congress to step up whether it's through the Congressional review act that I just mentioned or introduction of the short act myself and Senator Marshall will be introducing that with multiple multiple co-sponsors and that will literally remove short billed rifles and short build shotguns from the National Firearms Act what difference does it make what the barrel length of your gun is it should make absolutely no difference whatsoever you know if it's a 16 inch barrel then it's not required to be registered if it's a 15-inch Barrel it is required to be registered that's arbitrary in my opinion right so the short act I think would solve that permanently but the Congressional review act the disjoint resolution is a big step forward and I'll be proud to introduce that uh as soon as this rule is published in the Federal Register in Congressman I got about 30 seconds left but these are bureaucrats that have no like you saw when Chipman was trying to get confirmed he had no idea what an assault rifle was yet he was criticizing them uh he couldn't even Define it because it's not even a real thing at some point do they have to know what they're legislating in order to introduce something well you would expect that they would you know I personally spoke with the ATF director Dettol back on Tuesday at the SHOT show and uh you know I just told him I'm sorry but this is just unacceptable what you're doing here especially after the bump stock ruling that we had on January the 6th that struck down the bump stocks where ATF tried to again or previously redefine a definition and create new law and it's simply unacceptable well Congressman I was at Shot Show I missed you there so it was a fantastic fantastic ride we appreciate you coming on we appreciate you fighting for my useless piece of plastic that is now some sort of deadly thing on it itself even though it's not a firearm appreciate it sir thank you Carl all right

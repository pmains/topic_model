GOING TO KNOCK DOWN ROE'S  PROTECTIONS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH BEING WITH  US, ALI. >>> WITH US NOW, ALEX PADILLA,  WHO SITS ON THE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE. YOU TWEETED AFTER THE NEWS BROKE OUT, IT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO GET OFF THE SIDELINES. WE MUST PROTECT THE FUNDAMENTAL  RIGHT TO CHOOSE. SENATOR, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? >> WHAT HAPPENS NEX IS WEEEP  TRYING. WHETHER IT'S PUTTING THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT BACK UP  FOR A VOTE, OR ANY OTHER MEARE THAT WILL CODIFY WOMEN'S  REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. IT WAS IMPORTANT BEFORE T  LEAKED RULING LAST GHT. IT'S NOW MORE URGENT TN  IT'S  EVER BEEN. BUT I ALSO WANT TO PAN BACK AND  GIVE US A BIGGER PICTURE OF  CONTEXT HERE. ABOUT A MON AND A HALF AGO, WE WEREN THE MST OF THE  CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR  JUSTICE JACKSON. AND A CONVERSATION ABOUT FAITH  AND THE JUDICIARY. PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN THE  SUPREME COURT IS IN QUESTION. AND THE TWO BIG NEWS STORIES  WE'VE HEARD, ARE J.D. THOMAS'  TEXT MESSAGES AND THE  INSURRECTION OF LAST YEAR AND  THIS. THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  WATCHING FROM HOME, IS A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S AT STAKE THIS  NOVEMBER. IF YOU WANT TO KW WHAT'S AT  STAKE, IF REPUBLICANS REGAIN THE MAJORITY,OU GOT A SMALL  APPETIZER FOR WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN. >> WHAT HAPPENS IF, IN NOVEMBER, THINGS GO YOUR WAY? HOW WOULD THIS BE DIFFERENT? >> IT'S SHOULD BE OUR DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY. BU CONSIDER THIS -- A WOMAN'S  RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS SUPPORTED BY  THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT B BEEN SETTLED LAW FOR 50  YEARS. WE CAN'T GET REPUBLICANS OFF THE HOOK. THERE' A I ISSUE WE NEED TO WORK ON. WHY ISN'T HALF OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATE STANDING UP FOR THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS. IT'S A MATTER OF HEALTH AND  EQUITY. WE KNOW THAT SUCH A DRASTIC  CHANGE WOULD HAVE A DISPROPORTNATE IMPACT  ESPECIALLY ON LOWER INCOME WOMEN AND FAMILIES. NOT JUST BLUE STATES OR RED  STATES, BUTACROSS THE COUNTRY. >> ABOUT CODIFICATION, IS THIS A POSSIBILITY? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING  THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATS  COULD DO. >> I HOPING THIS LEAK FROM  ST NIGHT CHANGES THINGS. WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A  THEORECAL CONCERN FOR SOME HAS BECOME A CLEAR AND PRESENT  DANGER, AND IMMINENTOINT TO  THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED  STATES, IF THAT'S THE LAST  STRAW, THAT CHANGES SOME HEARTS, THEN LET'S DO IT AND CONGRESS  CAN ACT NOW. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER  ISSUE THAT IS CLOSE TO YOUR  HET,T, AS WELL. YOU WE PART O A SMALL GROUP  OF SENATORS, THAT MET LATE LAST  WEEK, TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY  TO MOVE FORWARD ON IMMIGRATION  REFORM. WHERE DO THINGS STAND THERE? >> ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S CRITICAL AND HAS BEEN PENDG. I' HOPEFUL ONCE AGAIN, THAT WE  PUT A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY  INTO BIPARTISAN ISSUES LAST  YEAR. WE LOOKED AT THE RECONCILIATION  PROCESS, TO DO THE BUILD BACK  BETTER PACKAGE FOR REFORM. THAT HAST HAPPENED. AND TALKS STOPPED UNTIL A  HEARG ON THE IMMIGTION  SUBCOMMIEEEE THAT I CHAIR. NEARLY TWO MONTHS AGO. WE'RE FOCUSED ON NOT JUST A  DREAMER'S CONVERSATION, BUT  DOCUMENTED DREAMERS. YOU HEARD SENATOR CORNYN AND  TILLIS, IN PUBLIC, ON C-SPAN. WE CAN PLAY THEAPE THAT SAID  WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS. THAT REOPENED THE DOOR ABOUT  IMMIGRATIO REFORM, EVENF  THERE'S SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT  STEPS THATE CAN TAKE ON A  BIPARTISAN BASIS. LET'S MAKE SOME PROGRESS, AND  BUILD SOME MOMENTUM AND SOME  GOODWILL AND CONTINUE TO TACKLE  THE LARGER IMMIGRATION CHANGES,  THAT W NEED. >> SENATOR, I AM SO GLAD THAT  YOU OFTENTIMES DO UNDERLINE  THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BORDER CRISIS AND IMMIGRATION  REFORM. THEY'RE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT  THINGS. ALTHOUGH SOME IN THE SENATE,  AND IN THE HOUSE, ARE INSISTENT  OF PUTTING THOSE TWO ISSUES  TOGETHER. CAN THERE BE SOME COMPROMISE,  SOME BIPARTISAN EFFORTS THAT  COULD WORK, THAT COULD, IN  EFFECT, SEPARATE THOSE ISSUES  AND TALK ABOUT IMMRATION  PERFORM? >> A COUPLE  THINGS, JOSE. I THINK THERE'S A RIPE  OPPORTUNITY SOON. WHAT IS EXACTL YOUR POINT? IF WE CAN IDENTIFY A HANDFUL OF  ITEMS THAT ALREADY HAVE  BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. WHETHER IT'S DREAME, FARMERS,  VISA RECAPTURE, EMPLOYMENT-BASE  VISA CHANGES, THAT WE CAN BUILD  THE MOMENTUM AND THAT GOODWILL,  ACROSS PARTY LINES, I THINK THAT WOULD BE HEALTHY FOR THE  GREATEST EFFORT. SECOND, PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT TITLE 42. PEOPLE HAVE COME TO THE UNITED  STATES, FROM COUNTRIES AROUND  THE WORLD, IF A NUMBER OF  REASONS. SOME PEOPLE COME ON WORK VISAS  AND SDEDENT VIS. AN YES, PEOPLE COME SEEKING  ASYLUM. THAT IS LAWFUL, BASED ON  NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. TITLE 42, WHEN IT WAS PUT IN  PLAC WAS A PUBC HEALTH  DIRECTIVE, NOT AN IMMIGRATION  LAW. IT'S BEEN ABUSED INHE YEARS  SENSE. IT WAS P IN PLACE DURING THE  EARLY YEARS OF COVID BECAUSE OF  WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE  PANDEMIC. IF RESTRICTIONS ARE COMING DOWN, AND MASKS ARE COMING OFF, YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE JUSTIFICATION  FOR TITLE 42. AS WE TRANSITION OUT OF TITLE  42, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BORDER REMAINS SAFE, ORDERLY AND THAT THE ASYLUM PROCESS IS A HUMANE ONE ONCE AGAI NOT JUST THE DISASTER WE SAW  FR

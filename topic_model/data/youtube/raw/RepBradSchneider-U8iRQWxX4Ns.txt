Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong
disapproval of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the international
Paris Agreement on global climate change. The world is watching us, and history will judge this
ill-considered decision harshly. Withdrawing from the accord weakens America’s global leadership, will
slow our transition to renewable sources of energy, and makes it more likely the clean
energy jobs of tomorrow will be created overseas rather than here at home. Let me be clear: climate change is real and a present threat. America can and should be the global leader
in developing innovative solutions, but this decision leaves us as an international outlier. I am proud my hometown Chicago joined
cities and states across the country who have pledged to continue honoring the emission
reductions that are a part of the Paris Agreement. That is why I’m introducing a resolution
to commend these states and localities, and to urge the Administration to reverse its
position. I invite my colleagues to join me. Irrespective of President Trump’s short-sighted
policies, we must continue to seek solutions to protect our planet for future generations.

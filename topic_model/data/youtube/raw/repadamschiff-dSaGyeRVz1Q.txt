  UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY  FOR FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM IN HIS  COUNTRY. SHE WAS WITH A CONGRESSIONAL  DELEGATION THAT INCLUDED HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN  ADAM SCHIFF. HE JOINS ME NOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE TO  ZELENSKYY AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE? I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO ASK YOU  BEING FACE-TO-FACE WITH SOMEONE  WHO HAS JUST BECOME A GLOBAL  ICON FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY AND  FREEDOM IN UKRAINE. >> IT WAS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY  TO SIT DOWN WITH HIM. WE WERE WITH HIM ABOUT THREE  HOURS AND COVERED A WATERFRONT  OF ISSUES TO REALIZE AS WE WERE  TALKING THERE WERE PEOPLE  FIGHTING TO DEFEND THEIR  TERRITORY AND DEMOCRACY AND THE  MESSAGE WE WANT TO DELIVER WAS  THAT WE ARE IN SOLIDARITY WITH  UKRAINE. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF  THEIR FIGHT TO UKRAINIANS BUT TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. IF RUSSIA CAN GET AWAY WITH  THIS, THIS NAKED AGGRESSION,  THIS INVASION OF THEIR NEIGHBOR, WHAT'S TO MAKE US THINK THEY'LL  STOP WITH UKRAINE? AND WE WANTED TO HEAR FROM HIM. IS HE GETTING WHAT HE NEEDS? IT'S NEVER ENOUGH BUT WE WANTED  TO MAKE SURE HE'S GETTING THE  MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE AS THE INTELLIGENCE  CHAIR HE'S GETTING THE  INTELLIGENCE HE NEEDS, DISCUSSED THE REFUGEES, THE WAR CRIMES  GOING ON AND HE WAS  KNOWLEDGEABLE AND IMPRESSIVE. >> AND WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT IN  RECENT DAYS HAS CALLED FOR $33  BILLION IN AID TO UKRAINE,  INCREASED AID TO UKRAINE. HOW DID THAT COME ACROSS TO  PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY? I KNOW HE IS, AS YOU WERE  MENTIONING A FEW MOMENTS AGO,  CLAMORING FOR MORE AND MORE  ASSISTANCE FROM THE GLOBAL  COMMUNITY. DID THAT SOUND LIKE THE KIND OF  PRICE TAG, THE KIND OF AID THAT  HE WANTS TO SEE FLOWING IN? >> WELL, HE BEGAN BY THANKING  US, THANKING THE PRESIDENT FOR  THE EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTION  WE'RE MAKING TO UKRAINE'S  DEFENSE. IT'S HIS JOB BE TO SAY THAT  NOTHING IS ENOUGH. WE UNDERSTAND THAT, WE RESPECT  THAT. WITHIN THAT REALLY VAST SUM, THE WEAPONS HE NEEDS, WHAT OTHER  ASSISTANCE THAT HE NEEDS, A  DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE NEXT  PHASE OF THE WAR IS MOVING FROM  A PHASE IN WHICH UKRAINIANS WERE AMBUSHING RUSSIAN TANKS, IT WAS  CLOSE QUARTERS FIGHTING TO  FIGHTING MORE AT A DISTANCE  USING LONG-RANGE ARTILLERY AND  CHANGES THE NATURE OF WHAT  UKRAINE NEEDS TO DEFEND ITSELF. >> AND JUST THE OTHER DAY THE  DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN  TALKED ABOUT A GOAL OF THE  UNITED STATES BEING TO SEE  RUSSIA WEAKENED. DID THOSE COMMENTS MAKE IT ALL  THE WAY TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY? AND DO YOU THINK THAT RUSSIA IS  ON THAT PATH TO BEING WEAKENED? THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING WHAT  HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL MILITARY  CAMPAIGN OR DO YOU HAVE  QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT  THEY CAN GRIND THIS OUT FOR  MONTHS AND PERHAPS EVEN YEARS? >> THOSE COMMENTS RESONATED WITH ME. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE RUSSIA CAN  NEVER PROVOKE THIS KIND OF WAR  AGAINST ITS NEIGHBORS AGAIN. FOR THAT REASON I HOPE THESE  SANCTIONS GO ON IN PERPETUITY  EVEN AS I HOPE THE CONFLICT  COMES TO AN END. IN TERMS WHETHER PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY WAS AWARE OF WHAT OUR  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SAID, I'M  SURE HE WAS. THEY PAY ASSIDUOUS ATTENTION TO  WHAT OUR LEADERSHIP IS SAYING,  HOW THEY ARE DESCRIBING OUR WAR  AIMS. WHETHER THIS IS DOABLE, CAN THE  UKRAINIANS FIGHT AND WIN AND  DEGRADE RUSSIA'S CAPABILITIES,  FORCE THEM OUT OF UKRAINIAN  LANDS, YOU CANNOT STOP THE WILL  TO FIGHT. MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD,  MANY IN MOSCOW, DIDN'T THINK  UKRAINE COULD HOLD OUT AS IT  HAS. PUTIN CERTAINLY THOUGHT THIS  WOULD BE OVER QUICKLY. IF NOT AS LIBERATORS THEY WOULD  MEET ONLY MINIMAL RESISTANCE BUT THEY HAVE MET FIERCE RESISTANCE. WE WANT TO UNDERSCORE WE ARE  WITH UKRAINE UNTIL THEY ARE  SUCCESSFUL AND WANT TO PROVIDE  THEM WITH ALL THE SUPPORT THEY  NEED. >> AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN  MARIUPOL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME  UKRAINIANS BEING ALLOWED OUT OF  THAT BESIEGED STEAL PLANT IN  MARIUPOL WHERE, AS YOU KNOW,  THAT ENTIRE AREA HAS BEEN  DEVASTATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN  BY THE RUSSIAN ATTACKS AND SO  ON. WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY ALLOWED  THIS TO HAPPEN, CHAIRMAN? >> I'M NOT SURE. WE RAISED THIS WITH PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY AND HE WAS HOPEFUL  THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO EVACUATE  SOME OF THE CIVILIANS. AFTER SO MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS,  WHO COULD SAY. IT REMAINS DIRE IN TERMS OF  MILITARY PERSONNEL. THEY HAVE LEVELED THE CITY. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A VERY  IMPORTANT MANUFACTURING CITY AND THE RUSSIAN APPROACH TO THE  RESISTANCE THEY MET IN MARIUPOL  WAS TO LEVEL THE CITY AND ENGAGE IN CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. >> AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON A TRIP  TO UKRAINE. SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD CONSIDER. I KNOW SENDING THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES -- TOTALLY  DIFFERENT STORY -- WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING A TRIP LIKE THAT TO  KYIV. SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD CONSIDER? I THINK IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF  TIME. WE DIDN'T DISCUSS THAT WITH THE  PRESIDENT TODAY ALTHOUGH WE DID  HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE  PRESIDENT. WE SPOKE WITH HIM TO GIVE HIM  OUR REPORT ON OUR DISCUSSIONS  WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, WHAT  OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE AND HOW WE COULD MORE MATERIALLY SUPPORT BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION. >> ALL RIGHT. CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, KUD

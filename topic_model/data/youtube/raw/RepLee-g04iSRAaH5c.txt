appropriate joining us now is Democratic congressman barbara Lee she sits on the Appropriations and budget committees let's talk policy first because this matters on this show we have been reporting and testing constantly on the idea of why the president this President Obama and Bush before him have been allowed to take military action often in a way that seems legally to clearly exceed the authority in the 2001 authorization for the use of military force you were against that 2001 AUMF and now you're saying it is time to have the president make the case and have another vote from Congress make your case hi Chris what I wanted to make sure I make clear is that three days after the horrific attacks of 9/11 Congress passed a 60 word resolution that was a blank check its authorized the use of force in perpetuity forever unless we repeal it and ended it really sets a stage for perpetual war secondly this resolution has been used over 37 times in many countries unrelated to the terrible attacks and we have to go back to the drawing board Congress needs to do its job repeal this amendment and come forth with a debate and decide whether or not we're going to continue to authorize or authorize reauthorize wars that were not covered under this 2001 resolution fair criticism that one of the main reasons that we are in the situation that you just described is because of congressional inaction and you could even suggest cowardice a desire not to own the military realities to allow president after President to take that authority that really belongs with you under the Constitution to declare war in some of these circumstances practice because you don't want to own it fair criticism absolutely Congress is missing in action but we were elected to do our job the Constitution requires us to engage in matters of war and peace and so if you ask me today given where we were 16 years ago and where we are now we're building bipartisan support as we witnessed yesterday in the Appropriations Committee the American people deserve better they want us to do our job and we and must insist that we have a congressional debate and vote for these new Wars that we're engaged in well so because Syria is an animal of a different stripe here than what we've dealt with in the past because functionally it seems like the president and many in Congress supporting the move would be endorsing a regime attack because Assad no matter how he has enabled Isis from his own action and inaction is not seen as a terrorist group right this is a regime in charge in Syria and that's what you would be attacking if you do further military action that's a meaningful distinction is it not it's a distinction but also we do not have a strategy and what the president must do is come to Congress lay out his strategy and allow members of Congress to do our job we should debate the strategy do we believe that the use of force is warranted and do we believe the strategy is correct vote yes if we don't vote no there be there would be many forms of an authorization that would come to us but we need a debate and Krys minimally that's what we did yesterday and I'm very pleased that after so many years and after working with Democrats and Republicans I mean it's been 16 years that we were able to finally come to some bipartisan agreement that we should at least repeal the 2001 and come to Congress for a debate and a new authorization if in fact that's what the car

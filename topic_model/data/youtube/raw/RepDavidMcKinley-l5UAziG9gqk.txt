chairman at this time i'm going to give the balance of my time to my colleague the gentleman from west virginia mr mckinley thank you mr mckinley is recognized and thank you mr lotta and thank you chairman on that uh this massive partisan partisan bill seeks to further carry out biden's environmental agenda and part of that includes the infrastructure needed for electric vehicles look i'm one of those engineers that you mentioned earlier on a civil engineer that they get they degrade on the infrastructure but i'm fascinated by the injection of political timelines and ideology into an engineering decision fundamentally transforming our entire transfer transform transportation away from the dependable internal combustion engine is one thing and i don't really have a serious problem long term on that but performing open heart surgery on such a crucial component of our economy should demand more than an academic exercise congress needs to grasp the consequences so i will ask a number of questions like how do we ensure a stable and resilient electric grid how what's the impact on jobs in refineries pipelines and drilling how are we going to develop a domestic battery supply chain will america have a reliable source for lithium cobalt nickel and other critical minerals how are we going to replace the gasoline tax that will be lost for getting for road maintenance what about the time loss in recharging stations what about accounting for the lack of trade-in values for people trying to get rid of their internal combustion engine they're gonna pay the nurses and school teachers are gonna have to pay a hundred percent is this another unfunded government mandate or what about increa addressing the increase in landfill waste from batteries renewable energy pieces wouldn't this transition be less stressful if it occurred using free market forces wouldn't that be a novel thing in washington to use a free market approach not unexpectedly california and massachusetts already are banning the sale of cars with internal combustion engines as early as 2035. so mr chairman this debate is no longer the same as legislating against plastic straws and styrofoam this is real world what we're talking about people's jobs economy and communities congress should find the answers to questions like i've just phrased before we move headlong into something so so transformative thank you mr chairman and i yield back

beyond being ineffective our budget process is also leading as down a very dangerous path of increased deficits and exploding debt our budget should reflect national priorities and require difficult choices I think it's irresponsible to ever shut down government you wouldn't do that in any business I mean and then still have people go to work give me a break who are we kidding ourselves and we shouldn't be able to create programs and then not fund them for those of us who were in state legislatures when you carried a bill you provided the funding for the bill we do this process of authorization and then later on we try to find the appropriations or the funding for it what a disconnect and and by the way why shouldn't the American public think that we're dissing genuine you know you go home and say I got this authorization this all worked out da-da-da-da-da oh one thing it's not there's not money to appropriate it and then maybe a year or two years later you get part of the funding I think we ought to take a page out of the book for those of us who served in legislatures you carry legislation you got to have the money for it and I think that would create another level of discipline in terms of our deficit issues

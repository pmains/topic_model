uh questions what would it take to gain the support of the caucus for the financial regulatory reform bill in the house for next week also if the caucus did not vote you voted against the bill today it would have died in committee are you prepared to vote against it on the floor if you don't get what you want we are prepared as 10 members of the financial services committee to use our power to leverage opportunities for our community this particular moment provides an opportunity this is a bill that would give expanded powers uh to the regulatory agencies unprecedented powers they would be able to examine to dismantle to downsize and they would have a legal bailout authority the bailouts that we have been doing have basically been for too big to bail and so if we're going to support extraordinary powers for these regulatory agencies we have to be sure that these powers will be used to benefit small and minority businesses just as well and so we continue to work uh with all those uh leadership and administration and otherwise to come up by with ways by which we can do this give a name specific specifics and what it would take to get you know specific measures specific programs to get your support from this bill no i'm sorry uh i i cannot do that because what you're asking me is to give you a b c d of specifics in order to get our vote and what i'd like to tell you is that we're working on a number of proposals we have engaged everyone people are exploring ways by which they can equalize the playing field around some of these issues and make sure that minorities and people of color and working people can benefit yes is waters what what connection do you see between jobs or lack of jobs in minority communities the faltering economy and the military buildup the president called for last night and the ability of the country to pay for it my only statement to that is this we are trying to focus on the domestic agenda uh the domestic agenda needs a lot of attention as we move forward to talk about whether or not we're going to have a second stimulus whether or not we're going to have a job creation program i think that's where we need to be engaged legislatively and with that kind of engagement we can come up with ways by which to do job creation and expansion and include more opportunities for those who have been left out for the reward the treasury secretary understands these concerns that you've expressed do you think that he understands what the congressional black caucus is asking for what we believe is that we have a responsibility to educate we believe that a lot of people do not understand and sometimes you know they would say oh they're just asking for something uh that they don't deserve and we see the figures we see the numbers we see the devastation increasingly your newspapers are writing about it you're telling everybody look at what is going on 28 of african americans on food stamps look at the unemployment among black youth where are they going to go what does this mean you're right keep writing about it and we're going to keep working on it as well yeah do the um democratic leaders understand your concerns as well as the administration we're going to spend every waking moment educating everybody as a matter of fact the 10 members of the financial services committee meet in conference call every morning since we've been out as i reminded about this time by maryland at six a.m in the morning from california to nine a.m in washington d.c we're all convened every morning and we will continue to do that so that we can forge ways by which to educate and influence and one of the ways that we influence is just reminding people we're 10 members on the financial services committee yes would you like to see a job on the floor before the financial regulation i'd like to see a jobs bill yesterday i want to tell you ben at home in our districts over this uh break that we have had has not been so good it's hard to enjoy thanksgiving when so many people are without jobs when so many people are knocking at your door asking for help i as many others participated in some of the turkey giveaways we gave away 10 000 baskets at one location in los angeles with a woman 94 years old standing in line the crippled the blind the disabled it was horrible it was awful so yes we'd like to see a jobs bill very soon yes and then back to you ms waters the the president united states the former community organizer in chicago do you think he has been sufficiently attentive and focused on the issues that you're talking about i think that it is important for us to educate those people around him those people who are in charge of the agencies those people who have the responsibility for bringing advice to him i think it's very important for this to work its way to him while he's concentrating on afghanistan while he's concentrating on um all of these other issues that he's been confronted with i think we've got to get his people educated and moving so that they can make sure that he understands what is going on he brought these issues to him personally no we don't we don't we we have not brought these issues to him personally uh first of all uh it is important to educate those around them so that they can understand for example when we look at the financial services committee and we look at the consumer protection agency we look at the oversight committee and we see that the oversight committee does not have one minority on it and we said you look at why is this it's because it is structured so that the heads of the agencies are the only ones who do the oversight so we did an amendment and our amendment would expand it uh by five more places and we describe those presidential appointments in ways that will get to more women and minorities so that they could be on the consumer protection agency oversight committee but we think that that kind of lack of understanding that kind of appreciation that here you are organizing the consumer financial protection agency and the very people who have been targeted and have been harmed are not represented on it it's just a matter of not understanding and so we have to educate people and get them so that they're talking about these issues in ways that make good sense yet oh no i'm sorry you were there so the people around him fine but to follow up on questions what about the president himself does he get it oh we expect once the president is focused on our issues and these issues are brought to him by those around him who have the responsibility for uh bringing forth uh these issues and giving advice we feel that not only will he understand but he would move uh to do something he's got a job summit tomorrow too a little too late no no absolutely i mean that's about one job summit i mean one job summit at the white house does not solve the problem he still has more to hear to hear about yes since last thursday have you had a chance to meet with anybody else in treasury or in the administration uh throughout our meetings we've met with heads of about all of the financial services agencies throughout what we're doing what's been their response to well they listen very attentively and uh some of them have taken uh to some of our suggestions and so i didn't know that for example there is an executive order that had been issued by clinton that would help to simply deposit government money into some minority banks for example if you have all of the discovered money and you can put it in any banks that you want to some of that should go to minority banks all of them depend on having capital and so that's a very simple thing it doesn't cost anybody any money it just raises the awareness that there's diversity in our economic structures out there and that they should be able to participate like everybody else yes sir will the cbc think of um allying itself to republicans maybe some blue dollars on the ad hoc amendments we have uh liberty reform coming up and other issues maybe that would stress the point all that we can tell you now is that we are focused and we're prepared to do what we need to do to truly represent our communities and not simply be legislators were just inside the box going along uh with the protocols as usual we're prepared to use our strength and our influence uh to better represent our communities yes somebody over here had to hand up i want to get everybody you talked already my understanding was that there have been meetings with uh mr emmanuel at the white house do you feel that he's not sharing your concerns with president obama uh i feel that there is a process that they go through at the white house where they um they get the information they examine the information they play the information and individually works its way up the most important thing is that those who have the responsibility for advising the president understand these issues again another example when you talk about the census and advertising we said to them many of the uh church newspapers that um basically go out every week may be one of the strongest ways by which you get to people to have deal with the under count they said oh so we're educating we're exploring and we're working with them uh to correct some of the inadequacies in the system and we think the work that we do will determine the outcome yes ma'am you had a meeting in march regarding with stimulus money much the same issues i'm wondering uh you know are you gonna at some point have to break off and not wait for leadership to do its thing break off on your own and just you know offer legislation and just forge ahead or you know wait for a cue from george miller or speaker pelosi we wait for no one as a matter of fact the 10 members who have decided that we needed to assess what is going on very carefully it was not necessary for us to feel that we are not good legislators if we don't russian and vote for the recovery um economic recovery legislators we are um not only defining what is wrong uh but we are looking very closely at perhaps what we could have done what we should have done but no more are we looking backwards we're looking forward and we're going to use our power and our influence uh to help alleviate this devastation in our communities i think that's it i hope that this has been helpful to you uh we will continue to work on it and we will continue when we have something to share with you uh to engage you we will do that thank you very much

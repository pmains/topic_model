mr. guess Thank You mr. chairman Ronald Silva was standing with a friend in his driveway when he was shot and killed by an illegal alien who had been previously deported Agnes Gibbon II who was desilva's mother said the guy who killed my son has a determinate sentence in prison but I have a lifetime sentence of grief and pain alle Paul Maher alum Ontario is an illegal alien from Mexico he murdered Grant Rowan Bach with a gun On January 22nd 2015 in Mesa Arizona ice was working to determine whether or not he should be deported when he had the opportunity to commit this crime Gustavo Garcia a 36 year old illegal alien shot and killed a 51 year old rocky paul jones on december 17th a gas station garcia had previously been deported by ice before his deportation he had a criminal record going all the way back to 20 2002 where he had illegally possessed a firearm in addition to murdering Jones Garcia also shot a farm worker in the chest who was picking fruit committed armed robbery and shot and attempted to kill a woman after he followed her to a motel 6 On January 2nd 2019 an illegal alien shot and murdered California officer Renewal sing a story that captivated the attention of the country on November 13 2018 an illegal alien shot and killed three people in Missouri after he was released on domestic violence charges this was nice Perez aged 23 was a recipient of the daca program in 2012 and 2014 so time and again mr. chairman we see circumstances where people illegally come into the possession of firearms each of these illegal aliens did not acquire these guns lawfully matter of fact Title 18 of the federal code says that it is always unlawful for an illegal alien to have a firearm and so any it's all I appreciate folks from my state of Florida come in and Sharon their advice and their counsel to the Judiciary Committee I think that the stories of other people who have been impacted by gun violence are relevant to our discourse because they speak to the fact that there are dangerous people who do illegal things who will have access to firearms the question is what will ensure that that does not cause the massive amount of violence that we've seen in the country and so I'm encouraged by elements of legislation passed in my home state of Florida that focus on red flag circumstances mental health that look at people who go through our jails and do everything we can to ensure that when their time and incarceration is concluded they don't go back to Arsenal's where they can do harm to themselves or others but as I review HR 8 it seems to me that there's nothing in the bill that would have stopped many of the instances that we've been discussing and moreover if we're really looking for solutions maybe we ought to allow states to do what Florida did and analyze the impacts on our mental health system recognizing that those systems are different across the 50 states and so I hope that we will not adopt this federalization of deprivation of constitutional rights I hope that we will allow our states to continue to innovate and find ways to keep community safer and as we hear the stories and circumstances for those here I hope we do not forget the pain and anguish and sense of loss felt by those all over the country who have been the victims of violence at the hands of illegal aliens HR 8 would not have stopped many of the circumstances I raised but a wall a barrier on the southern border may have and that's what we're fighting for well gentleman will suspend everyone here is here at the at the at the as a guest of the committee yes and no matter what you think of what any member the committee may say or any witness for that matter you must not comment or otherwise demonstrate mr. chairman mr. Chairman I have my time restored your time will be restored Thank You mr. Chairman I appreciate that and so so again I think that was a rather instructive moment for the committee mr. chairman because as we gather here in Washington there are a divergent series of views and inputs and thoughts and my concern is that by adopting HR 8 we actually stifle the innovation that could lead to better public safety outcomes if we allowed states and local communities to deal with the challenges my great state of Florida has and so again I hope that we'll deal with all of the drivers of violence the greatest driver of violence in the circumstances that I indicated was not the firearm it was the fact that we have an immigration system that allows people to come here violently we engage there will be no comments or demonstrations please mr. chairman point of order is there a MIDI rule or a point of parliamentary inquiry is there any committee rule that prevents a member of Congress from reciting false statements in a committee hearing that are unsupported by the evidence that are unsupported by the evidence or is are members of Congress entitled you just make things up in support of specious arguments it's a parliamentary inquiry I'm not aware it off the top of my head since I haven't researched this question I'm not aware of any such rule I would also observe that the factuality of any statement is always subject to contest by someone who disagree with who disagrees with it and at a hearing such as this if a member makes a statement that is not borne out by the facts assume it's the prerogative of another member when his turn comes to comment on that or to point out his opinion or her opinion the falsity thank you Miss OH my colleague mr. chairman no I believe I still control the time okay mr. chairman it is never permissible for members of the audience to comment or to abort or vociferously to object this is a hearing for members of Congress and for the witnesses everyone else is here as an observer and must not participate in any way other than by observing mr. chairman from mr. I might make a point of order against the join make a point of order that the gentleman's words were unparliamentary because they implied the lying or the falsehood of a member now if he wants to go there then we'll take words down I would be the point of order not well taken because although because there was not an accusation did he say I mean let me finish there was not an accusation of falsity by another member there was simply an inquiry as to rules regarding that subject did he not make the statement that he was asking that the member was nice how to stop a member from making fault the the the my recollection we could have it read back but I don't think it necessary is that he simply asked about the rules that we use when a member if a member makes a false statement which is an inquiry it is not a direct accusation that a member made a false statement mr. chairman I'll just recommend that that line got so far there was no cross he got so close to that line that he couldn't tell if he was overt or not so I think we need to continue to watch well let the gentleman continue but this needs to happen in an orderly way we have differences of opinion those difference of opinion need to be expressed and when those differences for instance or messed up we need to stay in a parliamentary procedure this is not going to birdsall and just complete yelling and accusing of each other well that's what you're telling he's got coming up he can say whatever he wants decide yelling is out of order obviously yelling by members of the audience inquiry by a member did not violate the rules because it was not a direct accusation another member how much I do have one more secondary parliamentary question the gentleman was as it's been stated in the past ISM stated in the past mr. chairman when members of the audience disrupt this they are typically escorted out is that going to be the position of this chair or are we going to continue to allow Clause 2 K 4 of rule 11 provides that quote the chair may punish breaches of order and decorum by censure and exclusion from the hearings this rule has been construed to afford the chair the discretion to enforce the quorum in the committee room including through removal with disruptive members of the public my preference is not to invoke this response at this time but please consider this a warning Thank You mr. McClaren's chairman I have a parliamentary inquiry this gentleman will state his point of parliamentary inquiry famous chairman mr. chairman is there a is there a process and the committee whereby if the very same people are repeatedly interrupting the time of the members that those people will be asked to depart the committee or is there I will excuse me if the gentleman repeats that or any other comment I will directly original I will directly be removed if he repeats it Thank You mr. chairman on and I'd observe that's three interruptions of my time by the same individual and that the chair is not utilizing his discretion to remove that individual I believe I have about a minute a time remaining and I wanted to take the time well well the gentleman yield for a well my friend yield for a question I typically do my friend from Florida but since my time has been so interrupted five members of the other side perhaps you could have one of your colleagues yield time to You mr. chairman requires conversable remaining because that believes without a minute and 12 seconds gentleman has one minute and 37 seconds left I appreciate that gentleman would proceed Thank You mr. chairman we we all are entitled to our own opinions and views on how to address gun violence but I don't believe that we are entitled to our own facts and while I'll have great personal affection for the gentleman from Rhode Island it is deeply troubling to me and hurtful that as I share the experiences of people who've lost sons and daughters I've lost friends and neighbors at the hands of violent illegal aliens who have illegally acquired firearms then my colleague would indicate that that's somehow lying or making misrepresentations to the committee and so if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have solutions for gun violence or to secure our border to make sure that illegal aliens don't come into possession of firearms I'm eager to hear those but in your debate with me please don't demean or diminish the pain and suffering the humanitarian consequences the violence the bloodshed that has occurred because we allow illegal aliens to come into our country receive the veils of protection benefit from policies of catch-and-release that my friends on the other side of the aisle have supported and then come here and act like that is the great you know challenge of our day to deal with gun violence if we really cared about safer streets we would build a wall and secure the border and we would do it posthaste well my friend Oprah's indulgence and I yield back

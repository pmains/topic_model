roe v wade and access to reproductive health care including abortion helped lead to increased labor force participation i was raised by a single mom who worked long hours to keep us out of poverty i think framing it in the context of labor force participation is it just feels calloused to me there there is a spill over into labor force participation in many cases abortions are of teenage women particularly low-income and often black who aren't in a position to be able to care for children i'll just simply say that as a guy raised by a black woman in abject poverty i'm thankful to be here as united states senator that's part of an exchange heard around the world last week between republican senator tim scott of south carolina and treasury secretary janet yellen and it struck a chord with millions of people now the senator has written a new op-ed published today in the washington post it's titled abortion is not the way to help single black mothers senator scott joins me now in an exclusive interview in focus first of all welcome thank you very much and i want to know what went through your mind as she was saying those words translate what you heard and why you felt because it was very uncharacteristic to see you at times just lean in so hard why'd you feel like you needed to do it i was compelled to do so to be honest with you i could not believe my ears she was responding to a question so it was completely unprepared unfiltered and her response was to in my opinion provide a callous approach and a solution a remedy for blacks living in poverty being abortion and as a guy who was raised by a powerful positive black woman in poverty in a single-parent household i know that sometimes broken places is where you find brilliance i know that sometimes hard work and dedication and perseverance pays off handsomely you and i both know that the truth of the story is the american journey continues to evolve in the right direction yes and frankly even secretary yellen's words should have been thought through much better because less than ten percent of the abortions are teenagers and so to put the face of abortion being poor women making a choice so they can increase the labor force participation rate it was just unbelievable and with what you gave that statistic it would be young black girls i mean and now you're telling me that fewer than 10 percent are even part of exactly what she's doing i wonder if she knows the facts on that well i got to believe that she did and unfortunately it seems like whenever someone needs a poster child of brokenness they go to african americans and that's not our story our story is a story of victory our story is a story of overcoming odds our story is frankly triumphing after tragic circumstances that's the story of who we are and it's a story that should be told and should be told as a part of the american story that we as americans we are the solution we shouldn't have fewer americans we should have more americans you want to increase our labor force participation rate choose life all right i want to get to this you wrote in your op-ed about the treasury secretary here's a quote we live in a world where words are too often disconnected from the lived or lived experiences of many americans yellen's cold and robotic reference to the issue of life is just the latest example of that what did you mean by that well a couple things first when you hear her words and you see my lived experience you see your lived experience so many americans millions of us started in poverty frankly to say 97 of those who are rich today were either middle class or in poverty two generations ago my grandfather was picking cotton he lived long enough to watch his grandson pick a seat in congress that tells me that the story continues the journey becomes more and more beautiful more and more amazing but when you think about the fact that the words that people speak are disconnected from the reality you hear that inflation is good for people living in poverty nothing is further from the truth you know that baby formula is hard to find but you knew that several months ago you did nothing with it it's almost as if the administration wants us to believe what they are saying as opposed to what we are seeing yeah yeah hear the words out of their mouth not what we see them doing and i live in reality by the way fema has back piles of this they of course they have a stockpile if there's a hurricane or a tornado they gotta have baby formula what if the hospitals run out because because we have a disaster i mean it is mind-boggling that was a good example of that i want to get to more of your words yes i i don't know in the time that i have covered you as a journalist that i've ever known you to write so passionately i want to get to this you also wrote in your new op-ed in the washington post if abortion is our first and best answer to ensure that women and low-income families can thrive economically the united states has reached one of its darkest times in our history senator there's no doubt that when you think about those words that she spoke in the truth of our existence we should be leaning into the solution that is our nation and is a story of american evolution i certainly believe that hard times produces our best results that frankly that's for everybody did you get into that yes that's so true because there are a lot of people going through hard times right now that's that's just parents with the deficit of baby short baby formula shortage we always have hard times that's just the truth of our existence it's always tragedy then triumph it's always obstacles then opportunities it's always problems in promise and one of the things that makes me excited about who i am and where we are as a country is that the hardest times i've lived through made me a better person and made me more compassionate towards others so i hate to hear that those hard times should be eliminated by eliminating my life that's a stretch and one that i just have to speak out against you know when president trump was in office you and he worked on opportunity zones and i really got to do the drill down on on all of that yes can you explain where we are now because there was a lot of money spent what what happened to those areas that it wasn't just people of color i mean those benefit high tide lifts all boats absolutely i mean those communities were touched by the fact that somebody was focusing in on them one of the silver linings that we can see now looking back at the pandemic is that pre-pandemic 2019 we saw 29 billion dollars enter into private sector dollars by the way go into the poorest zip codes in america and because of that we saw the poverty rate hit the lowest ever recorded in the history of this country that's the kind of insulation you want going into a pandemic we saw african-american unemployment below six percent for the first time in the history of the country we saw wages for the bottom 25 percent grow faster than the top 25 percent so that going into the pandemic actually gave us insulation so that confronting with a global pandemic people without resources had more money more opportunity than they had seen in their lifetimes and frankly women had a 70-year low in unemployment which means that translating into the pandemic we had more resistance than we would have had had it not been for the economic success and the policies of the trump administration going into that pandemic so when you talk about the fragility of life and the harshness of circumstances like a global pandemic we should stand up straight put our shoulders back and be confident that we shall survive this too not quit in the middle and it's that resiliency that is a part of the dna of america that we should be focusing on wow those are powerful words not quit in the middle some people would say and and some of them are even doctors i've interviewed that with the lockdowns and the increasing sort of pressure on the american people to to solve the pandemic with their own behavior and not feeding us enough of the true science that the changes that we were seeing that that was quitting in the middle your last quick word well listen america is always the solution not the problem if we lean in as one american family we find the greatness that's within us unfortunately pressure typically is necessary to reveal the jewels that we are and so rather you are talking about african americans surviving the the last few hundred years of american existence and coming out better whether you're talking about the brokenness of poverty in rural america whether you're talking about the harshness and the challenges of the pandemic the one thing we know about the american family we are better together we find solutions and the greatest of our opportunities don't come from washington they come from neighborhoods and garages and libraries and apartments where people come up with the most amazing and remarkable results amen senator tim scott wow i i have to say again covering you we haven't seen you lead in like this you're passionate about this and america gets to benefit by hearing your words and giving us that that thing that most of us know but we need to be reminded of that we're so much better than the words of someone who doesn't see our potential so much better than that absolutely senator thank you just being in focus thank you

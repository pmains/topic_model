i want to thank all the witnesses for being here um unfortunately we we haven't seen sufficient coverage of what's happening as a result of the bible administration's energy policies and what that is doing on the ground we have one of our our sheriffs that are that joined us today uh sheriff tim suanye from uh terrible parish well i'll tell you a couple of things uh the congressman strawberry served in law enforcement our sheriffs in louisiana are a little different than that different than any other state and that they're they're independently elected they're independent budgeting commodity independent tax uh collection authorities so they are they are different than any other sheriff in the united states and that they're very independent and very powerful figures uh have a lot of responsibility within within the parishes where they serve sheriff's sweiner also um did serve our country in the marines and chair want to thank you for all of your service to our country the last thing about him is that he represents and and and chief walker walks into town paris but y'all remember last year hurricane item made landfall uh this was ground zero and you wouldn't believe what this man was doing the unbelievable conditions that he was operating in one of their their stations got destroyed he was uh he had his desk right here and directly behind him and a small property he was sleeping on and managed to lead this place and just uh committed uh endless hours to his community and his officers as the sheriff i want to thank you for that but keeping all of that in mind recovering from one of the most powerful hurricanes that ever made landfall in the united states we also were one of the largest energy producing areas in the united states sheriff could you talk a little bit about how the private administration's decision to effectively shut down energy production which is causing a huge price how that's affected you your ability to provide law enforcement accounts affecting your officers and importantly how it's affecting your communities recovery well first of all thank you congressman uh you know with a lot of challenges um we try and hire more police officers and we're still continue to hire more police officers but there there's a we put money in a budget for um to hire more officers but now it's we're taking a look at at cost now with fuel increases and dealing with the current situation with uh with more school resource officers which we're working very closely with with local parish government and school board but we have to we have to take a closer look uh look my fuel cost has doubled has nearly doubled and what we're asking is to increase about another ten percent increase my first my my officer count about three you know just to give you a snapshot i have over 300 sworn officers in in my office that are law enforcement so we're looking at hiring maybe 31 more that's 31 more vehicles that's another 10 um increase in total fuel cost plus the the increases where fuel costs was doubled this is uh you know in my my employee account when when you look at a cost per employee package benefits starting police officer costs to get them their first year and it usually goes up you're looking at about 60 60 plus thousand dollars a year per officer and look we paid their medical insurance uh we pay medical insurance and we have very low premiums to make very rich benefits for our people to keep good people but with the fuel cost it's giving us great challenges sure i want to put a version of listening to you go through and explain the budgetary challenges that this creates for you is it fair to say that this diversion of money that you have to put into fuel costs and and electricity costs and other things is actually impeding your ability to to provide uh law enforcement services for the community to keep the community safe is it diverting resources that otherwise would be going to law enforcement well we have we're surrounded by water fuel costs with boats we have to be very uh efficient at what we do because of fuel costs to get more bang fire buck if you would just getting out there and and trying to centralize areas where you know maybe a little less patrolling but decentralized where we can be more responsive instead of proactive and that's not something we like to do with a police officer but these are challenges to keep our fuel under control so if you weren't spending these dollars on fuel and higher electricity and utility costs these are dollars that would be going into additional officers additional equipment training and things along those lines that's that's exactly right i mean that's everything we have to take in an account and with my with my chief financial officer we're constantly looking at these these things that can really get us in the back if we're not paying attention to and where we're trying to move our office i mean from hurricane ida uh we had devastation on our on our infrastructure and we're looking at increasing costs and trying to get get us back in par with about a 35 increase in cost and just getting us there so you know we certainly have our challenges and uh we're going to continue to move forward but we hope we can get some relief with lower fuel costs because everything obviously is driven up by that i mean there's a lot of lumber you name it everything thank you sir and uh putting this panel together and just reminding you we're we're watching our president shut down energy production and terrible person but going to iran venezuela and other countries and asking them for energy this is unbelievable and you see the impact so pervasive not just fifty two hundred dollars per american and higher costs this year as a result of this administration's policies but actually directly affecting law enforcement services and others this is just awesome

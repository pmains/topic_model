mr president i was uh elected state treasurer at the age of 29 four years after joe biden was elected to the united states senate for uh the last uh 30 years or so i've had the uh the uh honor and in some cases the misfortune of following him as a speaker throughout the state of delaware and in some cases around the country uh it's a tough act to follow and i wouldn't uh pretend to be able to to to do that over the the years we've seen uh the last 200 years we've had a uh united states senators and any number of great orders come here and to speak in his chamber and in some cases to mesmerize us in other cases to inspire us and to change our our minds joe has done all those things again today and he does it perhaps as well as as anybody people speak here today and in the years in the past and they they quote churchill we quote uh john f kennedy martin luther king i'm surprised he didn't quote uh one of his favorite uh irish poets today seamus heaney i think quotes him a lot and but the person i've heard joe quote the most in his life has been none of those folks not even those irish poets but it's been his mom and his dad i i wish i could ask for a show of hands how many times have you had joe biden say to you i give you my word as a biden if we could count them all up to here today in this room we could maybe get a dollar for every one of the we may not be able to pay for the stimulus package where we could make a pretty good uh pretty good down payment and many times i've heard him say he quotes his dad who used to say it's a lucky man i'll paraphrase as a lucky man who gets up in the morning puts his feet on the ground and knows that the work he's about to do is of consequence of substances is meaningful a guy doesn't turn out like this just by chance to become uh the youngest not only one of the two youngest united states senators elected in the history of our country he's also the youngest seven term united states senator in the history of our country but uh his mom and dad his mom still live and lives on a property uh close to to uh to joe and jill's home his dad's deceased but i know that we owe them a huge debt of gratitude because the values that they instilled in him the need to serve other people and really the golden rule there's a man of deep faith he wouldn't you wouldn't always know he doesn't talk a lot about it but a person who's who's life is his values are shaped as much by his family and his faith as anybody i i know but his parents taught him to treat other people the way that he wants to be treated and that led to i think that is a great involvement in support of the civil rights act and really underlies everything that he does today all of us have families all of us love our families i don't think i know anybody in public life or outside of public life who is more committed who loves his family any more than joe his parents jill his first wife knew who i never had the pleasure of knowing but i tell you he's got a wonderful wife jill and it's clear that he loves her with all his heart three kids are not kids anymore they're 30s and 20 bows over in iraq today serving the national guard but just extraordinary bond between a father and a child it's been said that the greatest gift that a father can give to his children is to love their mother well he doesn't just love their mother he loves the kids he loves their grandchildren this is a loving guy with a family that's as strong as anything i have ever seen you heard the old saying i'd rather see a sermon than hear a sermon when it comes to family values you see the sermon you don't just hear it you see we see the sermon in politics i like to say our families are in politics i like to see that our our friends come and go but our enemies accumulate and uh when you think about the people that joe has talked about here today from eastland to jesse helms to senator thurman he didn't mention phil gramm but people you'd never imagine that the guy who has his conviction his uh has been his philosophy his commitment to civil rights and other uh causes he never imagined that he would become the friend the confident and not so much for them to change him but for him to change them and in effect to change i think this this uh this this country joe you've been these uh pres joe you have been the glue part of the glue that holds this place together you have been part of the glue that holds this place together as we say goodbye to a lot of good men in the last several weeks it's with a real uh sort of sense of not of bitterness not of sweetness but maybe bittersweet that we say goodbye to you today the eight years that i've been here i know that there's been a lot of times when we've sought to try to make sure that the vice president didn't come in and cast a tie-breaking vote and my guess is in the time that you serve for vice president four years or eight years or however it's gonna be i hope it's eight but my guess is there's gonna be times we're gonna orchestrate the votes so you have to be here and i don't know that we'll be able to do it in a way that allow you to come to the floor and give another another speech like you've just given maybe we can figure that that out but i just as a as a friend as we we say goodbye and you move on to this next assignment in life and god bless our pres president-elect he's he's made a terrific choice not not just for delaware hugely hugely happy and excited but i think for our country i think for for for the world but i just want to say for the last eight years thank you for being

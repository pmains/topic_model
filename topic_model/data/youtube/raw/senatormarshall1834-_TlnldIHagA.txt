you you may hear the abortion Lobby say that maternal mortality is up to 14 times more for carrying a pregnancy to term as opposed to an abortion but in absolute terms the chances of dying from pregnancy is approximately 0.024 percent which let me be very clear is unacceptable it's too high of a rate before Dobbs or after Dobbs it's too high let me also point out that more women ages 20 to 44 die each year from trauma cancer heart disease suicide homicide liver disease diabetes and stroke then pregnancy related complication and finally this please realize that HHS does not require actual reporting of abortion complications while the abortion industry is is quick to claim that eradicating all protections from the only from The Unborn is the only way to lower maternal mortality rates abortion is not the solution to this crisis rather the nation should focus on addressing the underlying causes that lead to maternal mortality here in our nation's capital for example has the fewest laws protecting life in the in the womb compared to the other 50 States but its mortality rate of 36 per 100 000 means that women in DC are 50 percent more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as women in the rest of the nation where black mothers the situation is even worse and according to maternal mortality report of 2019 black women accounted for 90 of all pregnancy related deaths in the districts the maternal mortality rate for black mothers in DC is 71 per hundred thousand dwarfing tripling the national average and it's especially a problem here in D.C Ward 7 and 8. if I describe this particular geographical area they have no hospitals with birth Wards they only have three grocery stores and drastically fewer pharmacies than the other Wards these are issues we can and must address each time we spend taxpayer dollars funding the abortion industry we take away money and resources from providing real solutions from others and our nation's most valuable resource our children Miss Wendell if you had a clinic in DC in this High mortality rate How Could You impact the maternal mortality rate oh oh would definitely have an thank you for that question you know Stanton Healthcare we are a non-profit life of farming Women's Medical Clinic we don't charge for any of the services that we provide and we have a very high focus on pre and postnatal education a very high focus on quality prenatal care and then also putting together an individualized care plan for every woman who walks through our doors and so we make sure that she has a solid support system that she has all of the resources that she needs that there is a plan in place and our program runs the duration um not it's nine months of pregnancy whatever that point is that she comes to our Center and then a minimum of nine months after that so it's an 18-month program and it even goes beyond that we have moms that come in that their their children their babies they're Stanton babies as we call them are 10 years old now five years old and they they still come in and we are that um support and resource for them so we're seeing very good results um through our individualized Care Program again it's that focused on that focus on pre and postnatal education and uh good prenatal care yeah thank you for that answer I want to keep on this topic of this ill-conceived concept about abortion being safer than pregnancy you know first of all say the obvious the mortality rate for the unborn baby is almost a hundred percent in abortions and very low in childbirth we also believe that continuing pregnancy is very protective of the mother and child particularly when we think about suicide rates of women that have had babies versus the abortion uh women that have had abortions we think about even higher incidents of trauma and murder for women have had abortions as opposed to women who have worn their pregnancy and had children do you see many problems with a post-abortion syndrome emotional distress suicidal because of the abortion thank you Senator yes we we do in fact Stanton Healthcare runs in after abortion CARE program and those that support program is always full we have women that walk through our doors that are very traumatized after having abortion most women experience both short-term and long-term physical and emotional challenges after an abortion in fact studies show that one in four women that undergo an abortion express feelings of depression anxiety regret things that follow along with that substance abuse to try and numb the pain hallucinations of their child nightmares women experience things like being very stressed out at a certain time on the clock because that's when the baby when the abortion happened and the baby was was killed and my own mother suffered from the pain of a past abortion in fact she only became suicidal after she had had an abortion she was never suicidal before that she also may she rest in peace passed away in 2016 but she always regretted her abortion and she became a very big supporter of Stanton health care so that other women wouldn't have to go through the same experience she did thank you so much I yield back Senator Hassan questions yes I'd like to ask a several couple more questions if I could thank you so much Madam chair Miss Swindle for years Planned Parenthood has claimed that they are not focused on abortion but provide a slate of services for women why then as planned parenthood closed a clinic in your home state of Idaho and has plans to do so another state states that have passed laws or plan to pass laws to prohibit abortions great question Senator yes I think there's been at least 60 planned parenthoods and abortion clinics Nationwide that have closed since the overturning of Roe v Wade which is interesting when you hear the argument that they are all about helping women and you know providing all these other services and abortion is just less than three percent of what they do well then why are they closing all their clinics down wouldn't you want to stay open to help women whatever they're going through with an unexpected pregnancy and to help navigate the current climate or perhaps provide all those other services that you claim to provide so the reality is they are in the abortion business that's what they want women to choose and so I think that's being exposed right now my home state of Idaho yes the Planned Parenthood in Boise right next door to one of our Stanton healthcare clinics closed down I do want to say that in Idaho we have eight Pregnancy Resource Centers and life-affirming Clinics throughout the state of Idaho Idaho now there are two planned parenthoods and I think maybe one other abortion clinic so if anybody would like uh some helpful advice on how to have enough accessibility for women facing unexpected unexpected pregnancies you can look to the Pregnancy Care Center movement and centers like Stanton again Nationwide we outnumber abortion clinics four to one so if you want accessibility um you know look to us look to what we're providing and also it makes the the charges against our centers and wanting to shut us down I think Senator Elizabeth Warren said let's go after clinics like Stanton Healthcare with hundred thousand dollar fines to shut down what we're doing so how can you want more Care for Women in one breath abortion care and explain all these scenarios where women are underserved and marginalized and then go after the exact clinics that are providing those Services very well in our nation that's great Miss Wendell you know my job is to be a voice for kansans and one of your jobs today is to be a voice for your patients what would you like to share that if your patients were here today what would you share with us that you would think would be important for senators to know well I would like to share with you if I may one of our client stories she gave it to me and I said I would do my best to share it you have it in your written testimonies that I submitted I just highlighted a few parts to save time but if I may this comes from a stamped client JC I was in a very bad place in my life when I decided to get an abortion my mom told me she wouldn't have anything to do with my baby my boyfriend was a drug addict and causing abuse in my life and left me and I was diagnosed with having severe panic attacks I drove to Planned Parenthood and saw Stanton Healthcare across the parking lot I went to Stanton Healthcare and found that they are a real Clinic that helped me with everything I needed they loved me and showed me I wasn't alone gave me things I needed for my baby counseling to get out of my life-threatening abusive relationship and encouraged me that I could have a life with this baby seeing my daughter's heartbeat made me stop feeling the panic attacks that made me want to abort and stop feeling the horrible nausea and see my baby is a real person that I couldn't kill I instantly it instantly made me feel attached to my baby and love her I felt led to start my own business and for the first time in my life I can provide for my children on my own and have more than enough they impacted my whole future and my children's future I am so glad she is in this world now and my life and in my life forever because I was able to choose to keep her with Stanton's help I thank God Sam helped me get out of fear and choose life my mother is in her life and happy I had her it impacted her as well my daughter has a sister and I found a man that loves us all all my fears were lies and had I aborted my little girl I know it would have caused me to carry shame and depression thank you Stanton for me and my baby she has a future life because of you this story to me is important number one it shows the hope that a woman found quality care and services but it also shows that abortion isn't the solution she got out of an abusive relationship she got out of an economic situation where she was lower income she was able to start her own company the depression and the anxiety went away this became a catalyst for Hope in her life because she had the care and the support that she needed 50 years of unfettered access to abortion has not solved broken systems and throwing abortion at women does not fix their problems what she found at Stanton Healthcare is what changed things in her life thank you

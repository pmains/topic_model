0 MINUTES AS THE DESIGNEE OF THE MINORITY LEADER. MR. CASTEN: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I'M HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE THREE BILLS TO MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT WORK A LITTLE BETTER. BUT BEFORE I GET TO THOSE, I WANT TO PUT A QUESTION TO ALL OF US IN THIS CHAMBER, THE THOUSANDS WHO ARE SITTING HERE TONIGHT IN THE GALLERY, FOLKS WATCHING, BUT MOST OF US, THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THIS JOB. WHY ARE WE HERE? WHAT'S THE REASON WE DECIDED TO GET INTO THIS LINE OF WORK? THERE'S A SMALL NUMBER OF US WHO, I DON'T KNOW, MAY GO ON TO BE PRESIDENT OR SOME OTHER OFFICE. THERE'S A HANDFUL OF US WHO GET OUR VIRAL CLIPS ON THE LOCAL NEWS. THERE'S SOME LARGER NUMBER OF US WHO ACTUALLY GET THEIR NAME ON A BIG BILL THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE AND WE ARE REMEMBERED BY OUR NAME HE TAFT, HART LEES, SARBANES AND OXLEYS. THE TRUTH IS MOST OF US WILL BE ABOUT AS WELL KNOWN TO OUR SUCCESSORS AS OUR PREED SETSZORS ARE TO US. WE'RE HERE. WE'RE DOING A JOB. WE WILL BE KNOWN FOR THE OFFICE THAT WE HEALTH. WE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR THE DIGNITY WITH WHICH WE HELD THAT OFFICE. BUT NOT FOR WHOER AS INDIVIDUALS. AND THAT'S OK, RIGHT? ONE OF MY FAVORITE PIECE OF ADVICE WHEN I GOT INTO THIS LINE OF WORK WAS FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO SAID THIS IS NOT A SPRINT, THAT IS RELAY. YOUR JOB IS TO PASS THE BATON TO THE NEXT PERSON IN A LITTLE BIT BETTER POSITION THAN YOU HAD IT WHEN YOU PICKED IT UP ON THE LAST LEG. NOW EVERYBODY IN THIS BODY HAS DIFFERENT POLICY VIEWS, DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT A BETTER POSITION IN THAT RELAY MIGHT LOOK LIKE. BUT I'D SUBMIT WE DO HAVE SOME UNIVERSAL GOALS WE ALL AGREE ON OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS LINE OF WORK. WE ALL WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT DELIVERS THE GREATEST GOOD FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER. WE ALL WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT UPHOLDS OUR FOUNDING PROMISE OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY. WE ALL, I THINK, BELIEVE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S ADMONITION TO US THAT A GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT PERISH FROM THIS EARTH. AND WE ALL ALSO, I THINK, AGREE THAT ON THOSE REALLY HARD QUESTIONS, THE BEAUTY OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT OUR FOUNDERS CREATED IS ON THE HARD ONES WHERE WE DISAGREE THE SINGLE BEST WAY TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES IS THROUGH A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. IT AIN'T ALWAYS THE BEST WAY BUT WE DECIDED NOT TO HAVE KINGS. WE'VE AGREED NOT TO RESOLVE THROUGH WARS. WE'VE AGREED TO RESOLVE THEM THROUGH A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. I AGREE WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL WHEN HE SAID THAT DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST FORM OF GOVERNMENT EXCEPT FOR ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT HAVE BEEN TRY. IT IS THE BEST ONE WE'VE GOT. I PUT THOSE GOALS OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE UNIVERSAL BUT IF WE'RE HONEST WITH OURSELVES, I'M NOT SURE WE'RE DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB. WHEN WE HAVE RECORD WEALTH INEQUALITY. WHEN WE HAVE RECORD NUMBERS OF MASS SHOOTINGS. WHEN WE HAVE SURGING LEVELS OF DEATHS OF DESPAIR FROM THE OPIOID CRISIS FROM SUICIDES. IT'S HARD TO SAY WE'RE DOING THE GREATEST GOOD FOR THE GATEST NUMBER. WHEN WE'VE GOT PERSISTENT MALE-FEMALE WAGE GAPS, RACIAL WEALTH GAPS, STEADY NUMBERS OF BLACK MEN GETTING KILLED FOR MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. IT'S HARD TO SAY WE'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT UPHOLDING THE PROM OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE DO IN THIS BUILDING, NOT JUST ON OUR END HERE BUT THE NORTH AND SOUTH ENDS OF THE BUILDING, DO WE DO WHAT THE PEOPLE ASK US TO DO? THINGS THAT ARE OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR? CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. GETTING RID OF GERRYMANDERING. HOLDING OURSELVES TO THE SAME LEGAL AND ETHICAL STRAP DARDZ WE ASK ALL AMERICANS -- ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS TO BE HELD TO. WE CAN'T GET THOSE BILLS SENT TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. THOSE THINGS ARE REJECTED. WE DON'T EVEN GET THEM OUT OF THIS BUILDING. THAT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE REALLY ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT'S OF, BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE. I KNOW YOU ALL FACE THE SAME QUESTIONS I GET WHEN I GO HOME. PEOPLE SAY WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE IN THIS INSTITUTION ARE FAILING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR? WHEN WE SEE THOSE LITTLE POLLS THAT SAY CONGRESS HAS A 20% APPROVAL RATING. THAT SHOULD BE A RED LIGHT THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIX THINGS. AND OF COURSE, THE REFUSAL OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ONE POLITICAL PARTY, THE PARTY OF LINCOLN, TO CONDEMN AN ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL THAT SOUGHT TO OVERTURN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IS NOT A COMMITMENT TO PRESERVE AND ABIDE BY THE WISDOM OF THE MAJORITY. I CAN -- I CAN GET DEPRESSING AND I'M NOT TRYING TO DEPRESS ANYONE. IT CAN BE A CAUSE FOR HOPELESSNESS. BUT NOT FOR US, RIGHT? WE GOT INTO THIS JOB TO FIX THINGS. MR. SPEAKER, I KNOW YOU GOT THINGS INTO THIS JOB TO FIX THINGS, MAKE THINGS BETTER, RIGHT? SEEING SOMETHING THAT'S BROKE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT BETTER. MAYBE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BUILD SOMETHING BETTER. AND MAYBE PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER OUR NAMES. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK AND MOVE THE BATON FORWARD TO DO THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE SOME -- SOME UNPLEASANT, IF SELF-EVIDENT, TRUTHS. FIRST OF ALL. WE DON'T LIKE TO SAY IT AROUND HERE OFTEN BUT WE SHOULD. OUR FOUNDERS ACTUALLY WEREN'T PERFECT. THEY WEREN'T MOSES. THEY WESTERN JESUS. THEY WERE FALLIBLE PEOPLE JUST LIKE US. ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WAS WHEN JAMIN FRANKLIN AND -- WAS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE PROCESS. HE SAID WHEN YOUSSEMBLE A GROUP OF MEN TO GET THEIR JOINT WISDOM, YOU INEVITABLY ASSEMBLE ALL THEIR PREJUDICE THEY PASSIONS, THEY ERRORS OF OPINION, THEIR LOCAL INTERESTS AND THEIR SELFISH VIEWS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. SOUNDS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH EVERY DAY. WE'VE ALL GOT OUR EVERY RECOVERS OPINION. TRUST OUR FOUNDERS WERE NOT PERFECT AND WERE JUST AS FLAWED AS WE ARE. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT OUR FOUNDERS DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK THE CONSTITUTION WAS PERFECT. IT'S NOT THIS IMMUTABLE STONE PASSED ON THE MOUNTAIN. THIS IS THOMAS JEFFERSON IN SEPTEMBER, 1789, AFTER THE CONSTITUTION WAS AT PHID. HE WROTE TO JAMES MADISON, EVERY CONSTITUTION -- THIS IS A LITTLE CRAZY, I WARN YOU. EVERY CONSTITUTION, EVERY LAW SHOULD NATURALLY EXPIRE AT THE END OF 19 YEARS. IT MIGHT BE THAT EVERY FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS SO PERFECTLY CON DRIVED THAT THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY, THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY COULD ALWAYS BE OBTAINED FAIRLY BUT THIS IS TRUE OF NO FORM. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ALL OUR LAWS EXPIRE IN 19 YEARS BUT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE CONSTITUTION WHO SAID I'M NOT SURE THIS THING IS REALLY GOOD FOR MORE THAN 19 YEARS OR SO. IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE FULFILL THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY WE MIGHT HAVE TO PRUNE IT. OK. THAT'S FINE. THE THIRD THING, AND THIS IS THE ONE I THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR US HERE TODAY, IS THAT OUR FOUNDERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND DEMOCRACY NEARLY AS WELL AS WE DO. THEY WERE AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE. THEY DID AN AMAZING THIN. BUT WE HAVE 233 YEARS OF WISDOM THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE. WE LEARN SOMETHING WITH THAT TIME OVER THE COURSE -- THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR FOUNDERS DESIGNED THE CONSTITUTION WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE POLITICAL PARTIES. THEY CALLED THEM FACTIONS. BUT THEY COULDN'T CON TELL PLACE OF A WORLD WHERE YOU COULD HAVE FAWNINGSING DEMOCRACY AND POLITICAL PARTIES. I THINK WE'VE PROVED YOU CAN DO THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE STANDING ARMIES. THEY DIDN'T HAVE INCOME TAXES. THEY COULDN'T CONTEMPLATE A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN HAD THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THEY COULDN'T CONTEMPLATE A COUNTRY WHERE THEY COULDN'T HOLD VAIFS AND NOT ONLY NOT ALLOW THEM TO VOTE BUT TO HOLD THEM WITHOUT RIGHTS. THEY KICKED THAT CAN DOWN THE ROAD. THEY WERE WISE ENOUGH TO PLAN FOR SURPRISES. THEY MADE THE CONSTITUTION AMENDABLE. BUT WE KNOW THINGS THEY DIDN'T KNOW. WE ARE GOVERNING IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT STILL URN THOSE TOOLS. AND IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WERE NO MORE PERFECT THAN WE ARE, IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MOVE THIS BATON FORWARD, I THINK WE CAN BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO AND NOT BE CONSTRAINED BY OUR OWN AMBITION. BECAUSE WHAT'S CHEER, THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, WHY SIT THAT WE CAN'T DO THINGS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT, IS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE WHILE OUR FOUNDERS PAID LIP SERVICE TO DEMOCRACY, THEY SAID IN THAT LETTER THAT JEFFERSON WROTE TO MADSON, THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT A GOVERNMENT DO THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY. AT CORE, THEY DIDN'T REALLY TRUST THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY. THEY CREATED THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TRUST THAT PEOPLE DOWN TRUSTED WITH THE VOTE, THE DIRECT ELECTIONS OF PRESIDENTS WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. THEY SAID POPULISTS COULD STIR UP THE PASSIONS OF SOME UNINFORMED RUBE IN THE RURAL AREAS. THESE ARE ALMOST DIRECT QUOTES. THEY DIDN'T TRUST THAT PEOPLE IN A FULLY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY COULD ELECT THE PRESIDENT SO THE THEY CREATED THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THEY CREATED THE SENATE EXPRESSLY TO FRUSTRATE THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY. I SAY THEY, WASN'T A UNIVERSAL VIEW, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THESE UNITED STATES TO GET ALL THOSE COLONIES TO AGREE UNLESS THERE WAS SOME WAY TO PREVENT THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY FROM CAUSING LAWS TO GO FORWARD. SO WE CREATED THE SENATE. YOU COULD ARGUE WE CREATE THE SENATE TO PRESERVE SLAVERY AND IT DID THAT FOR, JON, A COUPLE DOZEN YEARS. BUT IT MASSIVELY OVERREPRESENTED THE LOW-POPULATION STATES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO AGREE TO JOIN THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S WHAT THEY DID. TODAY, WHEN IT WAS FOUNDED, THE BIGGEST STATE HAD 10 TIMES THE POPULATION OF THE SMALLEST STATE. TODAY IT'S UP TO ALMOST 100. WE HAVE MASSIVELY DISENFRANCHISED HUGE NUMBERS OF AMERICANS, BECAUSE OF A STRUCTURE THAT WAS DESIGNED TO DISENFRANCHISE LARGE BUT NOT AS BIG NUMBERS OF AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE KICK A BILL OUT OF HERE, YOU CAN GET 50 VOTES IN THE SENATE WHERE THEY ARE REPRESENTING 17% OF THE UNITED STATES' POPULATION. WHEN VOTERS ASK US WHY CAN'T YOU GET THINGS DONE, IT'S BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM. OUR FOUNDERS CREATED THE SUPREME COURT WITH NO CHECKS OR BALANCES ON THE SUPREME COURT. LIFE-TIME APPOINTMENTS. NO ETHICS. AND MARBURY VERSUS MADISON EXPANDED THE POWER OF THE COURT CAME AFTER THE CONSTITUTION WAS SIGNED. THIS IS A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THAN WHAT THEY CONTEMPLATED AND GAVE THE SUPREME COURT NOT THE ABILITY TO WRITE LAWS, BUT DARN CLOSE TO IT, BECAUSE YOU GET ONE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT FLIPS THE MAJORITY, AND ALL THE GOOD WORK WE PUT IN IS DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON THE WHIM OF ONE VOTE. AND I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT, WHAT WOULD OUR COUNTRY LOOK LIKE JUST OVER THE LAST COUPLE DOZEN, MAYBE THREE DECADES, IF THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY PREVAILED AND LIVED IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE DID WHAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS -- I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO PRESIDENT GORE FOLLOWED BY PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. THAT WAS THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY, RIGHT? IT WOULD HAVE HAD A DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT SUPREME COURT, HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE 2ND AMENDMENT IN THE WAKE OF HELLER, WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. HOW WE THINK ABOUT CAMPAIGN CITIZENS, THE DOBBS' DECISION, DO WE BELIEVE WOMEN ARE TRULY EQUAL, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT DECISION, WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WANTING TO NOT GET SHOT, THESE ARE POPULAR THINGS AND WE CAN'T DELIVER THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED. I'M GO TO GO GIVE YOU AN EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE RULE AND WE AS HOUSE MEMBERS, THIS ONE SHOULD MAKE US FURIOUS, LAST YEAR, THIS BODY PASSED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS THE EMMETT TILL ANTI-LYNCHING ACT, FEDERAL CRIME, LONG, LONG OVERDUE. WENT TO THE SENATE. SENATE PASSED IT AND PRESIDENT SIGNED IT. IT IS NOW A FEDERAL CRIME TO LYNCH IN AMERICA. GOOD FOR THE SENATE. WHEN THAT BILL FIRST PASSED THIS BODY? 1922. IT TOOK 100 YEARS, A CENTURY, FOR THE SENATE TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED FOR 100 YEARS THAT LYNCHING IS BAD. WE HAVE TO FIX THIS PLACE, FOLKS. SO IF WE DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ANYMORE AND PEOPLE SAY WHY CAN'T YOU DO WHAT WE WANT? WELL, IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE CORRUPT AND DONORS WON'T LET YOU DO IT. AND SOME OF US SUFFER FROM THOSE PROBLEMS, BUT IF THE INSTITUTION NEEDS FIXING, WE CAN FIX IT ON OUR OWN. AND IF ANY OF WHAT I'M SAYING SOUNDS PARTISAN, LOOK, I GET IT. WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, SENSIBLE GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION AND WHO WON THE PRESIDENCY. THAT SOUNDS PARTISAN. WE HAVE ONLY IN THIS STRUCTURE, WE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE ONE PARTY IN AMERICA IS REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE OTHER PARTY DID HE RIEIVES IT FROM THOSE INSTITUTIONS. IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY WE SHOULD BE COMPETING FOR THAT MYTHICAL CENTER OF THE ELECT RATE AND SHOULDN'T SAY I WILL TAY STACK THE COURT TO OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR SAYING I CAN CONTROL THE SENATE IF I FIND A COUPLE OF SENATE STATES AND CHEAP TV MARKETS. WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, RIGHT? WE WILL BE HEALTHIER, BOTH OF OUR PARTIES, IF WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO THE IDEA, AS JEFFERSON SAID, THAT IF WE ARE NOT REPRESENTING THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY BECAUSE NO FORM OF GOVERNMENT, LET'S FIX IT. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE THREE BILLS WE INTRODUCED. FIRST BILL IS TO ADD 12 AT-LARGE SENATORS. YOU CAN'T IN ANY WAY DIMINISH THE POWER OF THE SENATE, BUT IMAGINE IF 10% OF THE SENATE HAD AN INTEREST IN REPRESENTING THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE WOULD SIT THERE IN THE PEOPLES' HOUSE WITH CONFIDENCES THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR US. MAKE IT THAT MUCH HARDER TO FILIBUSTER A GOOD BILL THAT COMES OUT OF HERE, SO WHY WOULD YOU FILIBUSTER SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT WOULD ADD 12 MORE ELECTORS AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SCENARIOS AND HAVE THE POPULAR VOTE WINNER LOSE A VOTE TO THE ELECTORAL VOTE WINNER. SECOND ONE IS TO EXPAND THIS HOUSE. NEXT CENSUS. LET'S GO AND LOOK AT THE SMALLEST STATE OF THE UNION AND THE STATE OF THAT SIZE IS GOING TO SET IT. IF WE ARE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE REPRESENT AS CLOSE AS WE CAN THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THE HOUSE HASN'T GROWN SINCE 1911. THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES HAS GROWN 3.5 TIMES SINCE 1911. WE REPRESENT 700,000. IN 1911, WE REPRESENTED 200,000. HOW MUCH WOULD OUR JOB BE TO MAKE SURE WE REFLECTED THEIR VIEWS. ONLY TWO COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IN PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACIES THAT REPRESENT MORE PEOPLE THAN WE DO, INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN. WE ARE THE CRAZY OUTLIAR. LET'S EXPAND THE HOUSE AND MAKE US MORE REPRESENTATIVE. THAT WOULD ADD 130 SEATS TO THIS HOUSE. AGAIN, ADD FURTHER ELECTORS AND DIVERSE AND NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE AND MAKE US BETTER AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE. AND THEN THE THIRD, BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATIONALLISTS IN THE ROOM IS TO RESTORE THE SUPREME COURT TO ARTICLE 3 RESPONSIBILITIES. READ ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT LAYS OUT THE SUPREME COURT AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MATTERS TO AMBASSADOR AND STATES AND APPELLATE JURISDICTIONS. IF WE HAVE A COURT THAT IS CONSISTENTLY NOT FULFILLING THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE HAVE A COURT THAT IS ENCROACHING ON OUR POWER HERE IN THIS CHAMBER, OVERTURNING OUR JUDGMENTS, IT IS IN OUR POWER TO SEE FIT FROM TIME TO TIME TO REDUCE THEIR APPELLATE JURISDICTION. LET'S REDUCE IT TO THE CIRCUIT COURTS AND DEPOLITICIZE JUDGE PROCESSES AND IF THE COURTS SAY WE PASSED A LAW THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WE WILL SELECT FROM A POOL AT RANDOM AND 70% OF THEM TO OVERTURN A BILL. TAKES 2/3 TO OVERTURN A VETO. LET'S HOLD THEM TO A STAPLE STANDARD AND GET ENOUGH PEOPLE INVOLVED. DO IT FOR THE GOOD OF MAKING THIS PLACE WORK AND ELIMINATE THE SHADOW DOCKET. WHY DO WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO ALLOW THE SUPREME COURT CAN DECIDE TO RULE ON SOMETHING, LET'S GET RID OF THE SHADOW DOCKET. I'M NOT PERFECT. YOU ARE AREN'T PERFECT, MR. SPEAKER. OUR FOUNDERS WEREN'T PERFECT, BUT WE ARE PER EFFECT I BELIEVE. AND WE HAVE A JOB THAT AFFORDS US THE OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE OUR JOB A LITTLE BETTER, MORE RESPONSIVE, A LITTLE BIT MORE DEMOCRATIC TO MOVE AT A TIME FORWARD. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IS JUST AN AMAZING PRIVILEGE. I'M GRATEFUL TO SERVE WITH ALL OF YOU. AND I HOPE I CAN GET THE SUPPORT OF THIS BODY AND MY COLLEAGUES TO REDOUBLE OUR COMMITMENTS TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT BETTER AND TUNE AND TWEAK IT AND TO PASS THAT BATON FORWARD WHOEVER FOLLOWS US. THAN

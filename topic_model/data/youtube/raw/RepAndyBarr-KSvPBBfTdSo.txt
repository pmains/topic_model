let's welcome to the show kentucky congressman andy barr sir it's great to have you on what did what was your reaction when you heard new york governor andrew cuomo saying to new yorkers you got to get vaccinated because you could wind up kissing your grandmother and killing her what was your take on that well this is another perfect example is of liberal hypocrisy you know when governor cuomo made the inexplicable and deadly decision early in the pandemic to readmit to mandate the readmission of seniors back into nursing homes uh it probably was the worst single response of any leader during the pandemic and maybe the most deadly decision in american public health history when you think about the thousands of new york seniors who were killed as a result of that terrible decision and so once again here's the hypocrisy and it had devastating consequences for america's seniors for uh and it's an example liz of how of the big government top-down approach uh of uh blue uh state and and city uh uh leaders uh was much worse than the decisions of many of the red state leaders in this country and it and these bad decisions had had devastating effects for seniors our kids and for small businesses critics are saying he's the guy who killed grandparents janice dean lost her in-laws from cove due to cover 19 and new york nursing homes he's saying she has some nerve shaming others over 15 000 elderly are no longer with us because of his order putting patients back in um and then he basically was his administration was tracking and logging the death toll in nursing homes whether they're in hospitals or happening in in in nursing homes and then he pressured state workers to cover it up for months on end new york times reporting that you know so this is at the same time he got a four million dollar book deal it's just seemed so insanely now sir he's saying it's you know it's not my fault it's the trump administration's fault he's playing a blame game here your reaction to that well yeah he was blaming the trump administration but it was his own decision that resulted in the deaths of these senior citizens meanwhile the trump administration and red state governors were doing the right thing requesting uh a targeted response uh and and and the right common sense response uh ppe looking for more personal protective equipment in these nursing homes more testing kits in these nursing homes but not sending back infected patients into nursing homes in fact the trump administration in my own district helped us secure more personal protective equipment and testing equipment for our nursing homes and in florida republican governor ron desantis was requesting personal protective equipment he certainly wasn't putting infected seniors back into those nursing homes and we knew we knew because of the outbreak in washington state early in the pandemic that that was very dangerous that's a good point congressman andy barr it's good to see you we'll have you back on you know cuomo faces a lot of probes over the nursing home scandal over sexual harassment allegations as well

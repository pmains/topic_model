hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update this one from the vsw post in North Olmsted great to be back as always so busy week in DC and back home in DC we got our suicide prevention bill passed on the House floor near-unanimous really excited about that that's going to help study the root causes of the rising suicide epidemics that we see across pretty much all aspects of our society unfortunately but excited for that we're going to try to push that through the Senate as well and then hopefully off to the President's desk for signature in addition we and this is probably the biggest thing that we've been tracking as an office since getting sworn in the President signed the u.s. MCA into law as a reminder this replaces NAFTA and does it in a big way a really broad bipartisan support which you don't see on trade deals very often but you have folks from the right and the left come together on this which was very very impactful especially for Northeast Ohio 175,000 jobs roughly in particular manufacturing and agriculture are going to benefit tremendously from this deal and it's going to lift all boats and but those numbers I just gave those are on the low end then those are the loan projections could be a lot more than that frankly and and then in addition was just running around the district meeting with different folks at in the school systems and a couple different mayors again talking about some of the mental health challenges that some of our students are facing and the services that we can provide so a busy week as always thank you as always for allow me to be your representative and I hope everybody has a great weekend

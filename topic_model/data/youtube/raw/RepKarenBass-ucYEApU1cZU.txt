the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California thank you madam chair and I just want to follow up a word on my colleague over there mr. McLintock neighborhood watch I do think provides a real opportunity for community members to get involved but Edie Davis never believed in our me the neighborhood watch I just wanted to have a couple of questions for Miss lattaker and I want to address what I believe is a common stereotype of inner-city communities in particular african-american communities because it's often been said that the only time the community responds is when a police officer kills an african-american and that when there is crime that takes place in our communities that we don't do anything and I know that you're one of those soldiers on the front line I want to thank you for being here today I know that you're also supposed to be in Canada my good colleague representative Robin Kelly told me about your work and I really wanted to ask you if you could talk about the work that you've done what role can community-based organizations play in preventing crime and comforting those who have suffered from the impact and then also what resources do you need from us one I've worked in communities for many years and I often know that it's never considered newsworthy when we're doing marches talking about crime and trying to address the situation but anyway I'd like for you to respond to what you're doing in the community and what we can do as members of Congress to help you well first of all thank you so much for that acknowledgement as I said here I listen to the back and forth about gun violence and and to me it leaves out the most important part and that's those who have to deal with it on a daily basis or a mom in my community who has lost two sons in one week because of gun violence and it seems like it's always talked around about the people who are living there now you can imagine a block with ten houses on it and six of those houses have lost kids to violence so that there is no block anymore there isn't any community anymore because all those families are hurting and then one on the Block steps up and says I need to do something and I want to help and nobody wants to help because of the color of their skin or where they come from or where they live at or the conditions and you know you're fighting a losing battle and I'm speaking of myself personally here right now you're fighting a losing battle not only to give hope to the people you're trying to help but to the community that you live in because they believe that the violence is more prevalent than the hope is it is your organization you have funding no ma'am no ma'am you all volunteer ten years yes ma'am we had seven dedicated volunteers not that we wouldn't want salaries but um and we needed but well how are you able to do that work with just volunteers because through very generous people donors people who believe in what we do have supported us all these years and foundations have helped us but we have never had a grant writer or anything like that and it doesn't come from that I just want people to know before my time is up it doesn't come from that it comes from a sense of I'm more afraid not to do anything that I am to do something right but I do think if communities had the resources oh well not so without distant are irresponsible and don't want to do anything I thank you very much thank you very much for being here today mr. Thomas I wanted to ask if you could very briefly because I need to yield some of my time to my colleague here mr. Deutsch you know in a community like Chicago that has strong gun laws it's the problem is the surrounding area state of California strong gun laws but we have out states that guns come in from could you very briefly respond to what the federal government could do to help and then I'm gonna yield my time to mr. Deutsch one of the things that the federal government could do would be to properly fund ATF so they could do their job to better trace that trafficking of guns that happens across state lines and a trafficking bill we don't currently have a federal bill which addresses the problem of gun traffic thank you I think we need one thank you very much

Thank You chairwoman paulistano and thank you to the witnesses for your testimony I've got some pictures I would like to show and we seem to get wrapped around the wheel a lot on on regulations and what they mean but I want to talk about something that's happening in in my state that secretary Kiyomi may or may not be aware of but what you see here is a photograph of water irrigation system this is surface water coming right out of the Arkansas River you can see it's got kind of a brown color to it it's got quite a few nutrients in it you may if you don't know that geography the Arkansas River flows into the Mississippi River which goes into the gulf of the algal blooms and the things we see in the Gulf a lot of that are attributed to nutrients flowing downstream and this is I wanted to show this because this shows what the private sector is doing how they're usually way ahead of us and there's a lot of benefits to the surface water irrigation system like this number one this is in Ross country and you know it takes a lot of water to grow rice and for years we've pumped water out of the Sparta aquifer to flood those rice fields also to do other row crop irrigation that aquifer is depleting which it's it's very pure drinking water a lot of areas rely on that water for drinking so getting water out of the river versus the Sparta is a is a good thing also if if we could do something to clean this water up what you see in this picture is the same water it's just been through this irrigation district and simply what they do is they use the water over and over they capture the tail water off of one crop they pump it back into the reservoir and move it down and irrigate another crop the success story of this is it's also been able to cut the irrigation cost in half or farmers who are in this water irrigation district it doesn't require Sparta water and it's obviously removing sediments and nutrients out of the water and the only water that you're losing through the irrigation loop is a little bit of infiltration and evaporation so this water would end up back in the Arkansas River flowing down the stream I show this because one problem that the is being faced here is that there there appears to be a considerable opportunities for establishing water quality trading programs around the nation and my question is why aren't we seeing more trading occurring currently if we look at nutrient trading and nutrient offsets what are the main impediments to establishing a successful water quality trading program and secretary key I'll ask you that first what you see on the state level and then I'm open it up to the other panelists Thank You congressman Arkansas is committed and has formed a nutrient trading rulemaking committee and now through the Pollution Control mycology Commission to advance nutrient trading as you speak to understanding that that has true benefits potentially for nutrient management both to deal with the Arkansas Oklahoma issue we mentioned in testimony but also as we look at the Gulf hypoxic zones so we look forward to those advancing I think the barriers at this point have been somewhat at the federal level and I know that this administration has spent and recently reissued a direction to the states on how to implement a watershed management system that could invoke or and encompass a trading regime so we look forward to working with EPA on that we believe in today's world you know our AG community it was our industry understands that a strong economy for them relies on effective and strong environment and likewise we believe that effective strong environment leadership has benefited by a strong economy so we look forward to that opportunity to tap into those upper any other panelists have any expertise in this area and would love to make that comment if I could mr. Westerman Trading's the concept trading has been around for quite a while it has met with modest success is how I would characterize it it's the couple of different reasons often centering around enforceability accountability and responsibility we have found that in some instances the the agricultural interest is not interested in being part of the regulatory program even though they may be they may be stepping in to take on a responsibility of reducing nutrient loads so there needs to be a way to bring people in without them having the fear that they are somehow going to become the regulated entity that's been a difficult hurdle for the states and for EPA to overcome a lot of these trades are based on modeling and there's some uncertainty I could you can measure what comes out of a treatment plant you can test it and measure it but you have to model for these kinds of trades that use agricultural lands and that has not been particularly successful yet either I think conceptually it has a lot of promise I mean it's very similar to what the air program has for cap and trade I think is what you'll see as TMDLs come online there will be a financial incentive for those who are regulated point sources to participate with non-regulated non-point sources in the agricultural sector to reduce the nutrient loadings at a lower cost per unit of reduction but there has to be some forcing mechanism and that accountability has to be figured out among the parties and I really again I think it's a it's a good concept but those are the hurdles that that I see I think in way over my time and not think I'm going to vote

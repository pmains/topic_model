I'm gonna bring in now Texas congressman Lance Gooden congressman thank you for joining us the president doubling yes thank you the president is doubling down on his criticism for the World Health Organization I want you to listen to this soundbite we're going to do study investigation and we're going to make a determination as to what we're doing in the meantime we're holding back we're going to we want to say very unfair so the United States 452 million dollars compared to 42 million dollars that's to the World Health Organization World Health got it wrong I mean they got it very wrong in many ways they were wrong they also minimize the threat very strongly and not good congressman should we freeze or defund the w-h-o I think so and everything the president said is right and really the president was probably too nice on them because what they've done is endorsed the Chinese Communist Party policy of lies since this virus actually broke out back in December and January they have been there right in lockstep with the Chinese endorsing every bit of propaganda that they've put out they criticized the president's travel ban on flights from China back in January they have not been helpful it's bad enough that we have to deal with a Chinese Communist Party that is telling lies about just how serious this is we would have been on top of this much earlier than we were had we gotten actual real information from China and had the World Health Organization not been so supportive of the lies coming out of China congressman tell us about your coronavirus lawsuit bill what's that about sure I filed a bill last week that amends the foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which was passed in the 1970s which protects other nation governments from lawsuits and American courts we made an exception this bill makes an exception with respects to viral outbreaks and says that the Chinese or anyone really could be subject to investigation in the American judicial system because I think it's important that we find out the origins of this virus you know the Chinese it started in a live wet animal market and we're just expected to believe them we are expected to believe the numbers of the deaths that they are reporting no one believes that they've only had 3000 something deaths when we've had as many as we've had here in the United States in such a shorter amount of time what's coming out of China is is not accurate we can't trust international bodies or international legal authorities we can't trust the World Health Organization so I believe we need to bring this home we need to investigate this here at home and if this is something that China turns out to have been responsible for we need to hold them accountable whether it was an accident or on purpose you can't argue with the fact that lies are coming out of China and we haven't been able to respond as quickly as we would have had we known the full picture in China back in December in January

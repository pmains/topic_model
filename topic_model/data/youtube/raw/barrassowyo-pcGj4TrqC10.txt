all right joining me now Senator John barrasso from Wyoming Senate Republican conference chair Mr barrasso as always thank you for coming on I believe Wyoming is probably the the biggest coal producing state by the way um let's see Ohio is a big co-producing state Pennsylvania is a big coal producing state these statements are going to affect the elections uh there West Virginia of course is also but anyway what do you make of this whole business closing down coal what do you make of it sir well Joe Biden the Democrats have been living in the Twilight Zone over the last couple of years in terms of their attacks on available affordable and reliable energy and you're right Larry the Cavalry is going to come tomorrow I'm asking everybody to make sure you get out and vote vote for Republican we have to get rid of all of these Democrats who believe in all of these things they have been sabotaging the American Energy Independence in our American Energy economy people have been suffering so when I hear the president say no coal and then he says no drilling as well this is an Administration that has taken a sledgehammer to our American Energy economy and to our American Energy workers they haven't put a dent in climate change but they've done dramatic dramatic damage to families all across the country who are just trying to heat their homes and and buy groceries and buy gas and they're going to have to be held accountable that's coming tomorrow by the way just a you know this point that Biden made we're we're I don't know we as the Royal we are the Administration we or the regulatory we we're going to close down coal pan coal plants Across America by what Authority is he going to do that I mean for one thing West Virginia versus EPA said unless Congress authorizes this you can't go ahead and do that what is it what's he talking about we are going to close down coal plants well you know I'm in Wyoming the cold capital of the United States and I know so many of these workers they are unbelievably hard-working wonderful people Larry there are over 200 coal-fired power plants in America right now these are people who go to work they work hard and all they're trying to do is keep the lights on for the American public the ones in the guys I know and women in Wyoming when they go home what they want is a hot shower a cold beer and that's about all they ask this is an Administration that's been at war with all of them they provide 22 percent of all the electricity in this country and as for Joe manchin look he made his bed as you said he was a rubber stamp he agreed to this Biden so-called inflation reduction act and he is going to be held accountable in West Virginia but let me just say say this Larry you heard the President also say no one is building any coal-fired power plants I would say to the president of the United States Mr President in China in India they continue to build in China One new Coal fire power plant is coming online every week they have five coal-fired power plants in China for every one we have in the United States so Mr President what you are doing is suicide it's economic suicide it's National Security suicide you are hurting our nation well again Senator um I just I don't understand the statement though uh we are going to shut them all down what Authority is he going to use now the Cavalry is going to come you're all going to take back the senate in the house hopefully tomorrow so you wouldn't let that anyway but what Authority does he have to just willy-nilly shut them down I'm unaware of any such Authority I'm unaware of any Congressional authorization that would permit him to shut down coal plants no he doesn't have the authority to do so many of the things that he's done which is why I think it's so important that we take over uh the Republican majority in the house as well as the Senate I'd be the chairman of the energy committee uh in the Senate Larry where we will absolutely focus on affordable American Energy reliable energy available energy unleashing American Energy and that's pipelines and its permits and its infrastructure and it's holding this Administration accountable holding their feet to the fire when they try to drag their feet whether it's on permitting on any of those things and we're going to stop them getting into place any of their climate crazies that they nominate who want to keep energy in the ground um some studies and by the way the energy department is part of these studies but studies are showing that actually technology advances are in fact making coal cleaner as you say coals still 20 percent of our power so that's very important you shut that down that would kill the economy even more but in fact is coal cleaner well most certainly is we have a program here in Wyoming through the University of Wyoming School of energy resources we have a testing center in Gillette Wyoming and have found ways to actually capture carbon dioxide and sequester it in many ways so that coal is cleaner we want to make all energy as clean as we can as fast as we can Larry we want to do it in ways that don't raise costs for American families this Administration is so fixated on renewable energy which isn't always reliable you can't power this country this economy whether you're doing manufacturing no matter what we're doing in this economy you need more than wishful thinking and wind turbines and solar panels which is why I'm so enthusiastic and encouraged by where we're going to be tomorrow on Election Day as you know I was out with Adam laxold in Nevada over over the weekend we did a bus tour big crowds lots of enthusiasm their gas is over five dollars a gallon the cost of energy is the driving factor in that race Larry well I love that picture you texted me from the campaign bus um I responded to it I hope you saw my response it was a great picture you even had my pal O'Brien in there for some National Security backing but coming back to this other matter is there any doubt that if you kept Democratic majorities with divide Administration they would end fossil fuels I mean the White House is trying to spin it but here he is he says it again he wants to end fossil fuels he wants to end call can there be any doubt that that in fact is his policy and fossil fuels no it can't be any doubt Larry in any of our minds like this is Hillary Clinton saying I'm going to put a lot of coal miners out of work and uh before that it was Barack Obama saying he's going to shut him down and he said electricity rates would necessarily Skyrocket well the American people have been living the pain this year last year of 40-year high inflation related to the policies of the administration it's Reckless Washington spending and its energy policies that have been a direct attack on American Energy which is why you see a weakened President Joe Biden having to go hat in hand to Saudi Arabia to ask for more energy to Iran to Venezuela even to Russia all of these are related to this Focus this religion on climate because they want to do things dramatically unilaterally and immediately no matter how bad it is for our economy and I'll tell you that's why it is so critically important for people to get out and vote tomorrow and reject I believe this is going to be a rejection election reject the fact that the Democrats have opened the borders wrote increased crime in the cities and have undermined our American Energy security and Independence Senator can you hear the sound of the Cavalry galloping well certainly in Wyoming I can but I could in Nevada I could in Nevada also this weekend with Adam laxalt people are enthusiastic to get out and to get out of office the Democrats who have brought us these terrible policies yeah I had a black salts a terrific candidate is going to be a big winner Senator John barrasso thank you sir we appreciate it as always

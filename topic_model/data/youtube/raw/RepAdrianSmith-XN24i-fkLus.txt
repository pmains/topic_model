N RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEBRASKA IS RECOGNIZED. MR. SMITH: THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BULK INFANT FORMULA TO RETAIL SHELVES ACT. I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE, SUZAN DELBENEY, FOR WORKING TOGE TOGETHER -- DELL BEN -- DELBENE FOR WORKING TOGETHER. IT'S A VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION KNEW OF THIS LOOMING SHORTAGE FOR MONTHS BEFORE THEY DEVELOPED A STRATEGY. HERE WE ARE NINE MONTHS INTO THE CRISIS AND AS OF AUGUST, 30% OF OUR NATION'S BABY FORMULA WAS OUT OF STOCK NATIONALLY FOR SIX WEEKS IN A ROW. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. I'M GLAD WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO CORRECT THIS. WE MUST USE EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO INCREASE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING, INCLUDING RESPONSIBLY IMPORTING F.D.A.-APPROVED BASE POWDER USED TO MANUFACTURE FORMULA WHEN NEEDED. THE BULK INFANT FORMULA TO RETAIL SHELVES ACT BUILD BILDZ ON THE BIPARTISAN WORK DONE ON THE FORMULA ACT AND SUPPORTS DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING BY ALLOWING FORMULA-BASED POWDER TO BE IMPORTED DUTY FREE THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. WILL I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE TO USE TRADE TOOLS TO STRENGTHEN CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS LIKE INFAN

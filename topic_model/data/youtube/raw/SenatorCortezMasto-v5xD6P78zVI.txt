thank you and again thank you for this hearing I think it is an exciting time for us I thank all of you for the conversation and the information that you have provided I do believe we are at the dawn of a new age with the potential for blockchain technology we cannot squander it we have an opportunity right now to invest in the R&D for the very reasons that you all have identified and I appreciate the conversation and we'll follow up with respect to what we can do at a federal level but there is a role for the states to play as well and we've talked a little bit about that I'm proud that Nevada is one of the leading states in the nation encouraging the growth of the blockchain applications for instance in Nevada our state legislature recently passed a bill and sent of izing blockchain startups to locate their businesses in the state that had the support of our governor as well our current governor it is an exciting time but let me talk a little bit about some of my concerns and how you can help us address this we talked about the architecture architecture and we talked about the framework and as we build out this framework and we do the R&D we talked about cybersecurity and security in general which i think is an important guardrail that we start looking at and putting in place as we build out this infrastructure instead of trying to layer it on after the fact which is much more difficult but one thing we haven't talked about yet is the privacy component so let me open it up all to you what privacy considerations should be examined for consumers using digital currency or other blockchain applications please if I may speak to that Senator with cryptocurrencies consumers have sort of a privacy dilemma which is that they can interact with other individuals and businesses using cryptocurrencies without providing their real name however all of the transactions that they make are permanently recorded on this public database in a way that they cannot take back as we've heard you cannot go back and modify the blockchain records later which means that if a consumers identity at any point gets associated with anyone if their transactions on the blockchain then it can further be linked to all of the transactions that they have made using a cryptocurrency this is a very new type of system it's not like the credit card system with credit cards we don't really have the danger that all of my credit card transactions ever are going to be publicly you know displayed with with my name attached to it on the Internet we don't quite know how to manage this those privacy dilemma from a consumer perspective a lot of research is happening for example there are newer block chains with switch try to hide all information from public view however that raises other questions if those block chains get adopted how can law enforcement for example still do their job and so I don't think we've quite figured out an answer yet which is both technologically sound which is usable for consumers and also meets the legitimate needs that we have for law enforcement and investigative purposes definitely very much a work in progress thank you doctor yeah I think that we didn't really have a chance to get into the technology of the digital object architecture but as I stated earlier blockchain is one example of a digital object but just one and yet I know the focus of this hearing is on blockchain and so that's why most of the questions are about it but I think if you look at this issue more broadly for example the question of managing information shows up all the time in the research data Alliance this is something the US and the European Union Australia set up where many people who deal with very large data sets are worrying about how to curate it share it protect it secure it and the like and within that context the notion of blockchain almost never shows up because it is one choice and as they look at their needs they don't see that as the critical initial thing within the digital object architecture every aspect of it can be self identified for example every individual can have an identity including an anonymous that could be an identity every system can have an identity every piece of information can have an identity and that's how privacy is generated so if it were a health record that you were looking for part of that health record would say the following a fire four people are appropriate or program so whatever to access this information so privacy is that essentially inherently built-in but by asking the question only about blockchain it seems to me that you you omit all of the other potential applications that might be useful in society for which watching me not be the solution this is not to take a position for or against it as I said before but with the focus here only on blockchain I think you need to understand that there's a broader universe of applications of which blockchain is exactly one option okay thank you I notice my time is up thank you again for the conversation

well thank you all for being here it's um as the congressman from the big first you know we have a very long storied history of agriculture in this district and there's nothing that makes me more happy than when i get to welcome people to our district and tell the story of our agriculture and that's why i wanted to invite my good friend congressman glenn thompson from pennsylvania to our district to our state to really talk about agriculture and a lot of things that are impacting us congressman thompson is from pennsylvania this is his first trip to kansas we have packed it in he is the ranking member or the top republican on the house ag committee which is a really important role it also means if republicans win the house this fall which nothing's guaranteed but looks likely then he will be the chairman of the house ag committee and he'll have the gavel starting next year when we do the farm bill so the next farm bill expires next year in 2023 which is actually the next congress and so this is a really important time for kansas agriculture we started off in garden city yesterday morning we toured a feed yard we toured a packing plant we toured an oil well that was being drilled at the time toward a farm and uh met with an ag lender talking about the farm economy around had a dinner last night with a lot of ag producers and then this then we drove to celina last night and this morning we had a quick meeting in celina and then we drove over here we met with a new president linton got an update on k-state met with the dean of ag um here at k-state and had a great time i'm doing that touring some facilities that need updated and then we went to the kansas to the wheat innovation center and learned a lot great to show off you know a lot of the history there and a lot of the great work has been doing being done at the wheat innovation center then we just toured in bath which is why we're a few minutes late and so we toured in bath which as we all know is is about to be commissioned here and um so i'll turn it over to you gt but delighted and ecstatic to have congressman thompson in kansas and in the district for a couple of days so tracy thank you so much it really is a privilege and honor to i was so excited when the congressman uh invited me to to come to kansas and uh because i've been tracking the uh well i've been really tracking the uh the the big first ever since i came on the ai committee 14 years ago i mean this is uh the largest agriculture congressional district in the country and um we've uh he's proven that in the short period of time that i've been here uh it has been fast-tracked and pretty pretty fascinating to see all the different components from uh you know the livestock and energy which happens on rural lands um you know to uh to the exciting um uh uh i always have a soft spot for uh for land grain universities and so to be able to visit the land grant university and and uh to meet uh uh dean minton um and ernie minton and um and uh and uh and dean linton actually um i've met him previously on uh when he was still the dean of agriculture president went now here uh and i gotta take congratulations to the trustees in the recruitment selection process i met him as a part of what i would call my barnstorming tour of american agriculture when i was in north carolina i had breakfast with him actually right outside the fairgrounds of north carolina and uh well done uh well done and recruiting him as as uh as the uh the president here at uh and so uh it is um you know we're preparing for the next farm bill um as uh uh congressman mann said it uh this current one expires september 30th 2023. um last one we did was 2018. we did a pretty good job in 2018. uh you don't always get everything perfect because it's such a large piece of legislation but it is the most important thing that happens on the federal level in washington when it comes to supporting those folks that work so hard every day those hard-working families provide us food and fiber and energy resources building materials and is a key factor not just in on what's on our plates and what we might wear but uh for the rural economy and uh and uh so that that's the goal we've dedicated ourselves to uh to making sure that number one we restore a robust rural economy with this next farm bill and number two that we create the conditions where we begin to to build the population once again in rural america because too many rural areas that's we've had that that drain that that loss and we need that workforce and we need to make sure work on the right kinds of things amenities like rural broadband which should not be optional uh that should be uh with uh sufficient broadband length uh to be able to accommodate all the needs that people have and so uh so part of that in in preparing for that is what we've been doing for the past two days of uh bringing the voices of of kansas kansas agriculture really to the farm bill process and i really appreciate the friendship and appreciate your helping to make this happen great great i'm delighted to have you here happy to answer any questions that anybody has

export-import bank stated goal is to support American jobs through exports however in my opinion judging by the banks prior financing deals it appears to be doing quite the opposite oftentimes American taxpayers have been unwittingly propping up foreign state-owned companies in Saudi Arabia Russia China Venezuela Pakistan India Colombia Mexico Ethiopia South Africa and others who have done nothing but frankly work against the best interests of American citizens in fact of the 50 largest loans or guarantees approved by the XM Bank since fiscal year two thousand seven forty-six percent of those by dollar amount of the loans have gone to foreign state-owned companies or a joint venture that includes a state-owned company additionally the export-import bank has a bit of an unsavory track record involving corruption bribery and fraud perhaps the most infamous example of the legal behavior is that of former congressman William Jefferson a Democrat colleague of ours from Louisiana who was raided by the FBI convicted and sent to prison for bribery racketeering and money laundering you all may remember him as better as the congressman who stuffed his freezer with ninety thousand dollars in cold hard cash literally Jefferson was working within an XM employee as well as an XM board member to broker a deal between two Nigerian companies seeking financial support from XM Bank this is just one example of how the political mandates for particular sectors and regions around the world have invited a culture of corruption by creating perverse incentives for the bank staff to meet arbitrarily stated goals while time has passed it appears the culture within XM has not unfortunately just last year X and removed for employees for accepting gifts and kickbacks from companies seeking export financing in fact one of these former employees was charged by the Department of Justice a little over two weeks ago for taking bribery's numerous times between 2006 and 2013 and he subsequently had pled guilty this doesn't appear to be an isolated incident either during the previous congressional hearing held in April fifteenth after more than two hours of testimony the acting inspector general of the export-import bank announced that there were 40 that there are 47 people who have been convicted of defrauding the bank in the past five years and that there are at least 31 open investigations with the potential for even more in it's the more that is unearthed about the export-import bank the more concerned I become while the goal and objective of the bank might might be admirable the current state of the bank is aborted best why should Congress spend tax dollars on an organization that has reestablished a track record of corruption and why should American tax dollars be used to finance foreign government owned or operated companies that compete against American workers a clean reauthorization Bank of which has been proposed by a few up here of the bank does not provide taxpayers with the accountability that is expected from my constituents in Michigan or the overwhelming majority of citizens around the nation I look forward to hearing from chairman Hochberg and I do appreciate you being here sir about your plan to clean up the blank the bank and your plan to polish up its its image and frankly your image as well or it may close shop

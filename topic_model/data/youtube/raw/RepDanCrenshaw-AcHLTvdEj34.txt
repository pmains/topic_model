so i brought you numerous examples of the problems with the woke training that's infested our military i want to help you understand today where a lot of it is coming from and it's this so there is a long-standing office called the defense equal opportunity management institute that has been the driving force behind much of the curriculum that has seeped into woke training at units across the military this institute functions at the center of excellence for human relations education and research and we've gotten a lot of reports and complaints from people who have been through this training and they provide training for equal opportunity advisors across all branches so it's very influential a lot of this curriculum is extremely questionable much of it is clearly based on social justice theory and critical race theory i've received over 1400 pages of the training material guiding these inclusion exercises including a guide to power and privilege i'm not sure that's inclusive this guide to power and privilege teaches that people from a dominant class have unearned privilege which means that they're essentially taking advantage of others and engage in a constant struggle to unfairly retain that power it also teaches that it is wrong to have what they call a privileged philosophy this includes when a person of a dominant group says that personal achievement mostly depends on personal ability does that sound like something our military should be teaching this document also states that another form of racism is aversive racism which is when a person puts high value on egalitarian beliefs they are essentially undermining any emphasis on merit-based advancement or a liberal sense of equality which is what the military is supposed to all be about advancing based on your merit i've seen enough examples that i can take this to the next step we're contacting dod leadership directly to share these specific examples we've received to push them to implement policies and get this to stop this won't end until the secretary of defense takes action first recognizing that this kind of training is divisive and bad for morale and bad for readiness we need to see policy that puts an end to it once and for all and we're not going to stop fighting until that happens

thank you Thank You chairman Johnson and ranking member Lucas we could use some real broadband in Oregon as well dr. joga Myer welcome see you thank you for being here first I want to align myself with mr. Lipinski's concerns about the cuts to in the Department of Energy you two RBE and and the energy efficiency and renewables strategy budgets or renewable energy budgets the climate crisis is an existential threat and I'm extremely concerned that in your first appearance here before this committee this Congress if you didn't even mention climate change except for when you were responding to questions from the chairwoman and mr. Lipinski you're the president's top advisor on science policy and with your background working on extreme weather issues I'm alarmed frankly by the administration's failure to take this issue seriously and to fund research on climate science and I and I do have a budget question but first I want to ask a couple of questions yes or no questions about something that concerns many of us here as well as many in the scientific community dr. Drogo Meijer should federal agencies use the best available science to inform regulatory decisions yes good I think so too should agencies implement policies that limit the scope of science it could be used in making decisions yes or no limit the scope of science I'm not sure it can be considered should you decide the scope of science it can be considered in making regulatory decisions be limited I think if it's the best science it's the best science yeah you just put the best science on the table yeah and were you consulted on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule titled strengthening transparency and regulatory science where you consulted know that it's our understanding that this draft supplemental rule was submitted to the office of management and budget for interagency review so his OSTP offered comments on the draft supplemental rule during the interagency review process I would have to check on that and I'd be happy to do that and get back to you thank you appreciate that president's top science advisor and in light of OSTP s role in leading interagency agency efforts on science policy are you aware of any larger federal efforts to limit or otherwise censor science I'm not yesterday there were news reports suggesting that the Interior Department will soon release a proposed promoting open science rule which appears to have a similar objective to the EPA's proposed rule and I have to say I share the concerns of many were deeply troubled by these proposals that would limit the scope of science used in decision-making jeopardize bedrock environmental standards and endanger the health and well-being of our community so I wanted to share that concern thank you dr. Drogo Myer in your testimony you noted that research and partnerships on ocean science and technology are a priority for the administration and I know that OSTP organized a summit on this issue unfortunately without congressional participation last year yet the President's budget request would slash funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's national ocean service by 37% and reduce funding for the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research by 40% I also noticed the concern about the elimination total elimination of the sea grant program that's proposed last year the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report on the ocean and cries fear in a changing climate they found that the ocean is warming rapidly it's becoming more acidic its losing oxygen and becoming less habitable to the species that reside in it as a direct result of human caused greenhouse gas emissions so how do you reconcile those findings of the IPCC and the administration's identified priorities with such drastic funding cuts no thank you for that so I'm privileged to serve on the ocean the ocean committee basically was created with the executive order that the President signed it's got two components and two subcommittees one is on ocean science technology and that it was on ocean resource management so the S&T part of it is is really the critical thing to look at all the aspects of ocean as the things that you just mentioned but also in the in the the summit that we had it was kind of a multi-sector summon frankly it was the first time really that there was such a summit so it brought together nonprofits who are investing very heavily in ocean S&T and ocean exploration and also for-profit companies and the government and and the university community so when you look at all those equities you look at all the resources for example the research vessels that nonprofits like Paul Allen's group is bringing at the table you know we partner with them we get this tremendous multiplier effects so even though there are cuts to the budget it doesn't mean that the science research is being cut because when you partner like that you're actually leveraging what investments are being made thoughtfully so I think in the government against all these other folks who have equities as well and it was an extraordinary event actually where people are saying okay well now we have a direction where we're gonna go in at science technology for the oceans and and I appreciate the partnership but I know that that solving this crisis is going to require those types of partnerships however in light of what we know and what we have learned and how it's affecting not only the health of the ocean which of course reflects the health of the planet but also the industries like our shellfish industry in Oregon for example very concerned our fishing industry very concerned about the warming waters about the siddik conditions it seems like this would be a time in light of that recent report to increase those investments and of course work with the private sector but it's not a time to cut and my time is expired thank you madam chair I yield back thank you

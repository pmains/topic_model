thank the gentleman from ohio we've just been treated to a master class of misinformation the speaker also just said she just said can you believe they're going after contraception give me a break she knows that's not true there's not a single republican even talking about that or any of these other categories of the law this is designed to divide the country this bill is a shameful effort at that mr nadler when we were talking about our our concerns about the care pregnancy centers being under assault to make his case that pro-lifers are violent he referenced the the terrible murder of mr slepian an abortion provider in 1998 that was a quarter century ago we're talking about the last 11 weeks we've had 50 care pregnancy centers vandalized attacked molotov cocktails spray painted threats being made to supreme court justices there's no equivocation here at all mr cohen implied that the conservative justices misled the senate in their confirmation hearings look we've got the receipts on that it's demonstrably untrue justice samuel alito who wrote the majority opinion in dobbs said that during the 2006 his 2006 confirmation hearing that roe was quote an important precedent of the supreme court it was decided in 1973 so it's been on the books for a long time but he declined to call the ruling settled law justice thomas in 1991 in his hearings he declined to comment on his views on roe at all he said quote i do not think that at that this time i could maintain my impartiality as a member of the judiciary and comment on that specific case justice gorsuch 2017 confirmation hearings he said roe was quote a president of the supreme court it was reaffirmed in casey 92 and in several other cases so a good judge will consider it as president of the court worthy of as treatment of a precedent like any other however he refused to signal how he would rule in future cases on abortion justice kavanaugh 2018 confirmation hearings echoed gorsuch by saying that roe was an important precedent but he indicated during his confirmation that he would be open to overturning settled law including roe citing a long list of past supreme court justices justice barrett just reserved she was much more reserved on the row precedent another minute in her confirmation hearings in 2020 she said this she said she was committed to obeying quote all the rules of starry decisis promising that quote if a question comes up before me about whether casey or any other case should be overruled that i will follow the law of starry decisis applying it as a court is articulating it applying all the factors reliance workability being undermined by the later facts in law just as all the standards i promise to do that for any other issue that comes up she said uh that she had to remain neutral on it as an umpire as they all did look the the record is clear the quotes are there anybody can google this what they're presenting here on this floor is not true it is demonstrably untrue and they're doing it for partisan purposes every time they talk they reaffirm our position on that i thank the gentleman for yielding

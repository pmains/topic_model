I focused on closing out my school record
on the most positive note possible, preparing my body for the strenuous tasks
that I knew would be completing. And of course, the military
so you need to be ready for that and using any knowledge I gained
to demonstrate skill at various jobs. And I think this is where
a lot of the focus should be for Academy potentials. So my high school's
junior reserve officer training or JROTC unit, WV-20021. Jefferson High School
made this task extremely simple because they exposed
me to the tenets of the military really early on,
especially for the Air Force. And they taught me that
focusing on what I'm doing now is going to get me to where
I want to be later. Right. So focus on your
development now instead of trying to focus on what you think
somebody else might want from you. The academies post the profiles
for their most recent class publicly. You can look that up that includes their academic, physical
and extracurricular records. So you can find out what the most current
class was all about. What was their S.A.T. score average? What was their GPA, what extracurriculars
were they from participating in? This was an amazing start to figure out
what you should be aiming for. And then lastly,
I would say something that probably people don't really contribute toward the idea
of being able to get into the academy is actually having real job experience
before entering. So to the max extent, possible,
I would recommend that people try to find some job. I was a cashier at Sweet Frog. I was working at fast food places,
you know, the whole nine yards but it's super helpful
because you get acclimated to working with teams in an unfamiliar territory
really early on. And then that provides
an incredible opportunity to experience what it's like to have responsibility,
which you'll have in the military.

hey mr. chairman now mr. Rubin I recently went to Russia and I I got the sense that mr. Putin is sort of them going back to a Cold War mentality and this is more of a philosophical question to you believe that Russia is intent on reconstituting its empire I think as I said earlier well I don't really want to speculation was doing because honestly we don't know and I think what we have to judge is simply what is Russia doing and what we see Russia doing is what has caused so much concern and that is intervention on the territory of another sovereign state through military force and other coercive means we're which an amount of times limit which they have done prior I think we learned from history they invaded Georgia and then they continue to occupy George I think that's very instructive as to the Ukrainian experience today in fact Crimea just voted to join Russia it was announced today and I'm concerned that the same thing that happened in Russia will now happen in the happening George will happen in Ukraine and I don't know if these sanctions will stop that that's my biggest concern when one nation invades a sovereignty of another we usually definitions are important we easily define that as an active war does this administration believe that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is an act of war a congressman we've said very clearly that we know what we have seen which is military aggression intervention in the affairs of a sovereign country violation of legal commitments violation of international law that is what we see that is what we're calling it I'm not an international lawyer so I wouldn't want to get into the terminology but I think it's pretty clear what we're seeing it is clear also that Russia continues to occupy territory of the Republic of Georgia that's something we've been very clear in condemning and it is also clear that their commitments that all countries have to each other to settle their disputes peacefully and that is certainly not what we're seeing here so I what I do think we should call what it is I think it you said it's very clear it's a violation of international law I believe it's also very clear this is an act of war against another nation when we look at the NATO i think i think mr. Putin feels very threatened by the European Union and NATO pole and called for an emergency meeting of NATO to discuss its concerns about this Russian aggression what are we doing to ensure that Poland and other NATO allies are protected well one of the things we're doing is increasing our aviation detachment deployment we are also working to ensure that the Baltic states have the support they need to defend their territory and that is why we've increased our commitments to the Baltic Air Policing mission with additional planes and refueling and we're working in Brussels at NATO to address any other concerns that the Allies have as i said we take these obligations extremely seriously and we will do our utmost to ensure that the Alliance stands together

  DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THE  RULES COMMITTEE AND JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE, MS. ROSS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION. MS. ROSS: THANK YOU, MADAM   SPEAKER. THE RULE BEFORE US PROVIDES FOR  CONSIDERATION OF THREE LANDMARK  PIECES OF LEGISLATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE ARE HERE  TO ASSURE -- ASSUME OUR DUTY TO  PROTECT OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.  JUST THIS YEAR ALONE 18 STATES   HAVE ENACTED 30 VOTER  SUPPRESSION LAWS.  IN RESPONSE, THE JOHN R. LEWIS   VOTING RIGHTS ACT WILL REINVIG   NATE SECTION 2 OF THE VOTING   RIGHTS ACT D.-REINVIGORATE   SECTION 2 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS   ACT. RESTORE REQUIREMENTS ELIMINATED  IN THE SHELBY DECISION, AND  TAKE OTHER STEPS TO BLOCK  DISCRIMINATORY VOTING MEASURES   BEFORE THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED. THE HISTORY OF THE FIGHT FOR   VOTING RIGHTS IN AMERICA IS  LONG AND PAINFUL.  BUT IT IS AT CRUCIAL FORKS AND   DIFFERENT TIMES MEMBERS OF THIS  BODY FROM BOTH PARTIES HAVE SET  POLITICS ASIDE AND DONE THE  RIGHT THING. WE ARE MEETING HERE TODAY AT   ANOTHER PIVOTAL JUNCTURE IN THE  STRUGGLE FOR VOTING RIGHTS.  AND IT'S UP TO US TO MEET THE  URGENCY OF THE MOMENT, LIVE UP   TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL  RESPONSIBILITIES, AND PASS THIS  CRITICAL LEGISLATION.  MADAM SPEAKER, I ALSO RISE IN  SUPPORT OF OUR $3.5 TRILLION   BUILD BACK BETTER BUDGET   RESOLUTION.  BY TAKING REAL ACTION ON   CLIMATE CHANGE, EXPANDING THE  CHILD TAX CREDIT, AND  SUPPORTING UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND   FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THIS  BUDGET REPRESENTS AN INVESTMENT  IN ALL OF OUR PEOPLE.  ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN AND  GRANDCHILDREN. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR  CONSTITUENTS AND OUR COUNTRY,  LET'S APPROVE THIS VITAL   FUNDING. LASTLY, MADAM SPEAKER, THE RULE  BEFORE US PROVIDES FOR FUTURE  CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE'S  BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE  PACKAGE. FROM EXPANDING BROADBAND TO  REBUILDING ROADS, BRIDGES,   AIRPORTS, RAIL, AND WATER  SYSTEMS THIS HISTORIC BILL WILL  HELP BRING AMERICA'S AGING   INFRASTRUCTURE INTO THE 2    CENTURY AND CREATE -- 21ST   CENTURY AND GRATE JOBS.

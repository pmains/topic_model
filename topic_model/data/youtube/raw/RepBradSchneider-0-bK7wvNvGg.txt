Thank you Mr. Chair. I rise today in strong support and as a proud
co-sponsor for this amendment. I do so in defense of one our most magnificent
natural resources -- The Great Lakes. The Great Lakes contain a fifth of the world's,
and 95 per cent of our nation's surface water. The lakes are an important asset to our economy
and quality of life of our nation, and in my district in particular. The National Ocean Policy also helps protect
the vitality of our Great Lakes ecosystem. However, section 505 of this bill will undermine
our national ocean policy and the ability of agencies to coordinate with states, local
governments, and other agencies to protect these beautiful waters. That's why I support striking section 505. We have a profound obligation to be responsible
stewards of the environment and to pass on a clean, healthy and dynamic environment for
future generations. I support the Pingree Amendment and I yield
back.

help committee member Jim time Connecticut congressman thank you for joining me you've just seen a couple of military experts talk about the very difficult situation we're in you've got some concerns about sending advisors share with me what those concerns are yeah I do governor thank you for having me and I thought the officers that you had earlier did a pretty good job of kind of paying the picture of what's happening on the ground but you know when we think about how we are going to get involved or if we're going to get involved here I think we need to kind of sit back and ask ourselves what our fundamental interests are and i would suggest you a governor that our fundamental interest in Iraq and in Syria and in Libya and you know in all of these areas that are having such challenges is very clear and that is to go after in an aggressive way the relatively small number of Fighters whether they're in al-qaeda or in ISIL that have trans national ambitions that's a big word which means they want to come after us or after Europe or after Israel beyond that I would suggest that we have to avoid and I think the general made this point we really have to avoid at all costs being perceived to be on anybody's team in this Shiite versus Sunni civil war that is happening in Syria in turn in Iraq and I fear and you were right i have profound concerns about the president's plans to say it send advisors because let's face it first of all there's an open question about whether there really is something called iraq anymore remember a rock was created by the british empire you know ninety years ago and whether the iraqi army such as it is is anything other than a Shiite militia at this point so my fear governor is that we are signing up to essentially coach one of the teams in a very ugly three-way conflict and i think what you're saying congressman is that picking you know a winner here doesn't make sense because none of them are winners for us they're all losers for us in terms of their fundamentally going to be against the interest of states and the friends like israel that we have in the region well i'm not i'm not sure that that's true look ISIL are a bunch of very bad people absolutely and they have people within ISIL that we frankly want off the battlefield as my friends in the military say but remember the current prime minister who were supporting apparently supporting is very much an ally of the Iranians it's not clear that the Kurds you know the Kurds aren't there they're actually our friends so really I think what we need to be doing here is doing what we're doing in places like Yemen and in ways that I can and can't talk about in places like Yemen and in Syria and in Pakistan and Afghanistan we need to say you guys need to work this out you know whether there's an Iraq in the future or three sushiya Sunni and a current state that's for you guys to work out but if you support people who are coming after us you're going to have a very bad day that's essentially what we're doing in the region and I think that's the right approach and you know this idea of a Caliphate it is scary but you need to step back and remember that if terrorists have a state they have addresses and we know where to go for them where it's hard for us is when they're in caves or in the woods or in you know areas of total chaos if there were to set up a Sunni State first of all maybe that state doesn't become terrorists remember back in the Iraq war these guys were so brutal that the Sunnis themselves turned on their own people but if there is a state there are addresses and we can find people congressman appreciate your being here and your perspective great to have you on thank you for joining us thanks a lot government

I'm Jane Eisner I'm editor-in-chief of the forward I'm here to moderate this conversation about the Jewish vote and the twenty twelve election tonight we'll have the opportunity to talk to two people who are amesh tin these issues very smart very articulate very different we have Jeremy ben-ami from jay street and Bill Kristol from the Weekly Standard and we'll get to sort of parse out the issues so as we head down the road and there are in fact more non-jews than Jews in the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean without a two-state solution over the coming generation we do know that Israel will have to choose between being a Jewish home and a democracy and that's a choice that Israel shouldn't have to make it's not going to be the case that the issue the State of Israel is going to become minority Jewish well I didn't know we were going to disagree on opinions I didn't know we were going to disagree on facts the the population between the Jordan and the Mediterranean today is about 12 million people and half of them are Jewish and half of them are not I mean that's simply the fact and so the question really becomes relatively quickly will everybody who lives in that geographic area have equal rights or will a minority continue to have the sole political power over a majority that isn't Jewish and that's not a very pretty picture and I don't see it it's a huge problem do you seriously you're sitting here and telling me the ten years from now if the current borders exist if the current political arrangement of exists you're telling me that Israel will not be a Jewish and democratic state 10 years from now I mean what do you practically want to do well the answer is you either come up with a border or you give everybody equal rights those are the two choices you can't have two classes of citizens don't disagree that could not the only two choices the third choice is basically the status quo I think it's an unfortunate situation absolutely so one of the things I vowed to myself as I stood on the west bank last week and I thought about tonight is that I wanted to invite you to come with me because in all seriousness very foundations of the State of Israel that I care so deeply about that you care so deeply about on that we cite as one of the reasons for our close relationship is its Democratic nature that is at risk and we should care as friends of israel we should care that the fundamentals of democracy on the battle system I just so Kylie I'm not going to i can go but I can go you know let's let's go together I don't really would I prefer to go with other friends frankly

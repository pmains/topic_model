congresswoman i'm very good to have you i was thinking of you because your whole rationale for running was to stop this rigmarole and and at least use some common sense now you're in the united states congress you're facing a three and a half trillion dollar uh so-called human infrastructure package that might ultimately just need in the senate to pass by a simple majority that looks very likely uh the way things stand right now does it worry you very likely and very scary and you're right republicans and democrats have contributed to this problem over the last several decades but it has reached an all-time high in fact this morning i read the compute the consumer price indexes in the first half of this year already reached 5.4 percent and the last time it spiked this high was in 2008 in and during the recession and on top of that you know the the democrats democrats have already made everything more expensive and now they want to give away the farm with a dish this additional spending and you're right we're talking about six trillion dollars just to start just for their down payment and this is for free college this is green new deal measures but the problem is things don't things aren't free somebody has to pay that bill and at the end of the day it'll be on the backs i believe of hard-working americans who have jobs and pay taxes and now democrats are training the american people that they're going to get a check from the government every single month you know i'm kind of it's interesting because the parties are chasms apart on this issue uh democrats are uh dead set to say that this is is going to be very beneficial to them that more americans like what they're proposing than don't um republicans are equally adamant that this is going to lead to a spiraling inflation um and all of the gains americans are getting and tax credits and arrests will will be eaten up by higher gas food cost and all of that one of you is going to be right and do you fear that the popularity of these measures uh is is going to make republicans look bad for being against credit rates for those with kids who are hurting in these times i understand your rationale but that you might be on the wrong side of this politically well it's always it's always a risk i mean people who doesn't want a free check from the government the problem is these things aren't free and these people are going to pay for it as you said through higher gas prices the cost of groceries are already going up inflation is here and it's not going away and let's face it i'm a single mom right now and i feel that pain as well when i i look at my kids every day when we go to grocer when you go to the gas pump the gas is up almost 80 cents it's gone up at the first of the year it hasn't gone back down we see it every day in our lives as well and it's it's not going to be easy but the pain that people are going to feel i think six months a year from now when they see that their children their grandchildren are saddled with this kind of historic debt and the way that prices will go up there's no way to pay for this without raising taxes and to pay for it in the middle of the pandemic and the covid's we don't know how long code is going to be here the delta variant is rearing its ugly head we don't know how long it'll stay here the vaccine is very good at keeping people out of the hospitals who get it but this could affect us for the long term for the next couple of years what's the impact on small businesses going to be how are they going to keep their doors open how are they going to keep their people employed and how do we keep our kids in school so they can get educated so at one point some point when we get out of this they can get a job and all these things are extremely important which is why i am concerned free checks from the government every month it's not free we have to pay that bill somebody's got to pay that bill well so far they're saying that that is the democrats that the rich will pay it um i know you've mentioned in prior appearances there that this filters down that everyone will pay at the higher inflation of course everyone pays for that as well but let me ask you a little bit about the mechanics of this congressman the first hit will be or the first proposal to come before you guys will be that roughly one trillion dollar infrastructure plan it has bipartisan support the president then wants to follow up with this three and a half year involvement let's put that aside for the timing do you support the infrastructure plan as it stands roughly at a trillion dollars half of that uh you know using re-provided covert funds that have not been been spent are you on board with that i'm on board with a trillion dollar infrastructure package as long as we're not raising taxes to get there and my understanding there's roughly two trillion dollars in unspent covered relief money so there the the funding mechanism is there and i do believe we can do it without raising taxes i i very very cautious and i think suspect of more spending when we have to raise taxes on the american people washington has never had a revenue problem but we've had a spending problem and it's been republicans and democrats that have contributed to it you had the federal government state and local government literally shut businesses down because of covid but they kept going they kept collecting taxes they didn't cut their spending they didn't set any money aside and so i all i would ask is that the government treat those you know treat themselves the way they treat businesses in this country as well so i'll support it as long as we don't have to raise taxes to get there got it

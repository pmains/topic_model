The biggest one is resiliency. Just because, again,
coming from coming from my high school where I was pretty much getting A's on
like all my assignments. And I was like when we do physical competitions
or anything like that, I was usually doing pretty well to where here you know, there's going to be times
you're going to start out with a, you know, start out of class with a D or
an F or you just and you just got to learn to put your head down and work harder
in that class and focus on it. And get it out
like I started this semester with an F in one of my classes,
which I've never done in my life. So I just had to, obviously it shocked
me at first and it was super frustrating staying up extra hours,
making sure I knew all the material because he'd give us like pop quizzes
and stuff randomly so just definitely learning
that resiliency and fighting through tough situations would be the biggest one.

mr president as we all know and any american who's watched the news over the summer knows there's been a terrible increase in crime in america's cities assaults shootings murders have been far higher this year and my home state's not been safe from this trend in fact in st louis missouri there were 55 murders in the month of july that compares to 22 murders a year earlier in july which we thought were way too many then in kansas city missouri homicides in the first six months of this year were about 40 percent higher than they were last year one of the kansas city victims was a four-year-old boy named legend talifaro he was murdered in the early hours of july 29th mr president while he was asleep a four-year-old boy murdered while he was asleep by random shooting violence going on outside his home so early in july the justice department launched a effort in kansas city that has become a national effort which they called operation legend named for little legend talifaro under operation legend federal law enforcement officers are working alongside local police to solve crimes to make arrests to track down fugitives to prepare cases for trial so criminals can be held accountable now the key phrase there is alongside federal agents aren't going on and taking aren't going in and taking over the police department they're going in to add assistance to the police department on that topic there was no immediate raid of trafficking centers or drug gangs or anything like that i frankly thought the justice department was was wrong in not announcing earlier to federal officials and local officials what they were going to do and when they were going to do it but i think we we've worked with them to see that that isn't going to continue to be the case and in fact in early august the they made a similar agree determination to go into kansas city now one of the advantage i mean into st louis one of the advantages of having federal officers work with the local police in these cages in these cases is the one they bring a whole lot more intensity to the moment with the extra help suddenly something becomes possible that wasn't possible before also many of the people arrested can face federal charges as well as other sentences certainly in our state in kansas city and missouri both the two different u.s attorney's offices have done a great job working with local officials before this but even better able to look at what federal charges might be faced to take some of that load off the local prosecutor and also look for another way to get these people off the street by september 1 in kansas city the operation led to the arrest of 355 people suspected of serious crimes in kansas city more than 100 of those 355 people have been charged with in federal court in saint louis where we i said before the the government decided to bring operation legend to st louis the justice department made that decision in early august uh and in saint louis by the uh by september 1 there were already 359 arrests and 128 of those people arrested were looking at federal charges as well in addition to st louis and kansas city the department of justice has launched operation legend in seven other cities this is not a federal overreach um it is not the federal government again taking over local law enforcement but it's the first it's not the first step toward martial law it's not a crackdown on peaceful protest what it is is a cooperative effort with cities that have been suffering from increases in violent crime under this operation officers have arrested nationwide more than 2 000 people including 163 people for murder and one of the people arrested mr president was the alleged killer of four-year-old legend talifaro the rise of violence in cities this year and particularly the cities i'm talking about uh that have been benefited i think from operation legend has been incredibly rapid and unbearably destructive not to mention totally unacceptable it's taken a toll on lives unlived families torn apart communities terrorized people wondering what's going to happen when they or their children walk out the front door or play in the backyard or like little legend are sound asleep in their bed nothing we do can fully heal the damage certainly that these victims of violent crime and their families have suffered but we can get the justice that both the victim and people who care about them deserve we may have a lot of disagreements in the congress but i hope we can agree that violent criminals belong behind bars i hope we can all agree that all parents deserve a safe neighborhood where they can raise their children i hope we can all agree that the police do a difficult and dangerous job and they deserve support and all the support and appreciation we can give them not long ago legend telepharo's mother spoke about her son and the pain of losing him she said quote he was a ball of joy i want his legacy to live on and i want us to continue to fight against violence and also to get justice for my son and others that's the end of that mother's quote but it's not the end of a life that mother will now live without her son or the life he didn't get to live and there are too many lives that didn't get to be lived too many lives lost through needless violence operation legend gives local law enforcement the valuable support they need to get violent criminals off the street again it was named for an innocent four-year-old boy it could have been named for any of the thousands of other victims of violent criminals in dozens of other cities this year it could have been named for saint louis police officer tamaris bohannon who was killed in the line of duty last month could have been named for the two officers in california that had a sneak attack as they were setting trying to secure the local transportation center just in the last couple of days it's a tragedy that had to be named for anyone and while some people have sought to defund the police and to disparage the police operation legend is successful because it supports the police these are some of the hardest jobs in america second only to the families of people who care deeply about their loved one who's decided to serve in that job to protect us all american communities are safer because of operation legend they will be safer as we continue to work toward greater and more effective community policing they will be safer when people who are violent criminals are no longer walking around to perpetuate further violence and i salute the justice department for their efforts and the local departments who have reached out and taken advantage of the moment to get something done that they were not able to get done by themselves and i deal the floor

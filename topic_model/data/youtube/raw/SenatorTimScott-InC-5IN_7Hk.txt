joining us now are three men with very distinguished careers and impressive titles but for tonight they are simply sons of very proud mothers kevin mccarthy tim scott and johnny ratcliffe kevin we'll start with you tell us about your mama my mom is an extraordinary mom like all others and to start happy mother's day to every mom you know my mom was she's always strong to teach those character lessons when you're growing up but she also can build you up when you're down and i just recently had a trip with my mom to israel that was just amazing to spend that time together but the most unique thing about my mom is she always taught you that you can never have too many friends you know my mom could be in a room with people she's never met that speaks a different language and you would walk out thinking they have been friends for life that's just who my mom is an unconditional love she did a good job with you because she passed that trade on to you you have more friends than anybody i can think of in washington all right tim scott i i i i have met two of your moms i have talked to the third i know your mom but tell us about her anyway yeah i love my mom no no question happy mother's day to all the moms out there my mother really has been my rock for my entire life she has taught me more about faith having faith in the lord above having faith in yourself and frankly even having faith in your country perhaps my best lesson from my mother is uh go take the trash out son and when i come home from being in washington she makes sure that i stay normal and she's like go take the trash out but i don't live with you mom that's exactly why you need to take the trash out someone needs to teach you to stay humble and my mother is my greatest fan but she's also a very good critiquer of of who i am so she is a force for good every single day of my life and i i thank god that i get a chance to talk to her a couple times a day every day well she is incredibly proud of you and you don't have to be around her very long to be able to tell that all right johnny radcliff you have spoken so lovingly and so beautifully about your mom tell us about her well trey you've met my mom so you know that she sees the best in everyone even you and certainly any success that i've had is a is a big result of uh my mom uh kathleen mary cummins ratcliffe um my mom is uh not only one of the kindest uh sweetest most thoughtful and giving people she's also one of the smartest people i've ever known she she and my dad were both teachers and they taught all six of uh us kids and all nine of her grandkids really the lessons to be not just successful in life but happy you know i was just six years old when uh when my mom said johnny you uh uh you think like a lawyer and that was really all the encouragement i needed to take that path and and when i thought about running for congress my mom was um the first person to write a check to my campaign so encouraging is really a word that would describe my mom and i think the thing that best defines her is every single one of her kids every single one of her grandkids without exception would say mom graham you were the one person that was always there when i needed you most so you know we don't get to pick our mothers in life but uh we certainly couldn't have done any better than we did with with our mom and uh and frankly we did far better than we deserve well john well said but i i got to be honest with you brother when when somebody says you think or act like a lawyer and you're six or seven years old that is not a compliment i mean i i know that you went on to law school but i hope you didn't do it for that reason all right let me ask you this i can remember my mom really wanted me to run for student council and i didn't do it because i was afraid and i thought i would lose and i probably would have lost but i regret not doing that for my mom is there something your mom wanted you to do that in hindsight you wished you had but but you did not and we'll start with you tim yeah there's no doubt my mother always wanted me to be a preacher from the time i was a little kid she always thought that one day i was going to be a preacher and actually when i became a christian back in the 80s i went to a seminary to figure out whether i was called to be a pastor and it wasn't there and so when i went into politics she was like i reviewed you you got to do better than that so i was the exact 180 degree term from where she wanted me to be but now she has embraced this call but there's no question my mama wanted me to be a preacher all right kevin you're on the verge of becoming the speaker of the house but surely there was something in your in your life that your mama wanted you to do that you did not do and you wished you had well my mom kind of wanted me to follow my father's footsteps to be a fireman and i did it for three summers and i don't know if she thinks i failed in life but i think she's still proud of me and and tim tell your mom you may not be a preacher on sunday but you preach very well in the senate and you minister to us quite often so you're a big success amen thank you kevin i'll tell her i appreciate that man god bless you all right john you broke your mom's heart and went to law school is there anything else that you did that you wished you could undo gosh that's a tough one trey uh you know unlike uh poor noveline gowdy who had a frequently disobedient son i always tried to take my my mom's advice uh although i will say as a as a devout catholic i think she did want me to be a catholic priest but you know there are some things you can't do even for your mom so all right all three of you also have siblings uh and some of you have a lot of siblings and each of the three of you have told me privately that you really were your mom's favorite i'd like to give you a chance to say that publicly and tell us why and we'll start with you john uh well gosh fortunately trey uh all of my brothers and sisters are really smart and politically savvy and they know that you know people like adam schiff and you frequently engage in disinformation campaign so i don't think i need to address that i didn't figure you would that's a good answer all right senator you you want to you want to repeat publicly what you've told me privately that you're your mom's favorite you want to just let that go you know i think i'm not attorney but i will plead the fifth i will say that my mother is very proud of my brother who ended up being a command sergeant major after 32 years in the army so like johnny i'm going to thank god for your mother trey on this wonderful day and just pivot away from your question okay and i'm not no i love kevin so much i'm not going to make him answer this question but i will say this to the three of y'all you know all three of you are so good to my mother and i am so grateful to you for that there are times on her birthday where i am the fourth one out of the four of us to wish her a happy birthday and if y'all don't stop sending her flowers that look so much better than the ones i send then i'm going to get written out of the will so thank you for being so kind to my mom and for helping us celebrate your moms and also two of you know michelle and judy happy mother's day john to your bride and kevin to your bride thank you trey happy mother's day mrs scotty terry happy mother's day thank you guys we'll talk to you soon you too

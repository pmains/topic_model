this hearing is entitled oversight of the sec's division of enforcement i recognize myself for four minutes there is nothing more important for this subcommittee to do than oversee the sec i look forward to the full committee bringing the chair of the sec before the full committee i would hope that that would happen either at the subcommittee level or at the full committee level uh several times each year but uh oversight of the sec is also enhanced by bringing before us the division director of the largest division of the sec the securities and exchange commission oversees a hundred trillion dollars in securities investments and reviews disclosures of seventy four hundred public companies including more than four thousand exchange listed public companies the sec has an annual budget of two billion supporting forty five hundred employees across both the headquarters and the 11 regional offices the most important of which is now in my new district in los angeles the agency's largest division is the enforcement division with some 366 employees representing a quarter of the sec staff the division is responsible for enforcing our securities laws in 2021 the sec filed some 434 new and uh enforcement actions representing a seven percent increase as the chair of the sec gary uh gensler pointed out the purpose here is to discourage misconduct before it happens today the division faces new challenges in the form of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets the combined value of these digital assets hit three trillion dollars at a peak from which it has declined in response in 2017 the sec established crypto assets and cyber unit within the divorce the division of enforcement that division has brought to some 80 enforcement actions related to fraudulent and unregistered crypto asset offerings and platforms resulting in monetary relief totaling 2 billion dollars this is by far the most of any federal or state regulatory body obviously there have been r uh recent uh downturns in the value or purported value of crypto assets uh in particular uh their enforcement actions depend upon the definition of the word security under a relatively ancient howie test the division has determined that xrp is a security and is going after xrp but for reasons uh that i'll bring up in questions has not gone after the exchanges where tens of thousands of illegal securities uh transactions were occurring the division faces a number of longstanding challenges today uh we're considering a number of important bills that are listed for all of the members of this subcommittee and are being uh considered in this hearing there is no federal statute defining insider trading i know mr himes has a bill designed to do just that and of course the newman decision narrowed the definition uh somewhat of insider trading another issue for us to confront is the maximum civil monetary penalties which some bad actors simply regard as doing a a cost of doing business a recent decision in the fifth circuit has called into question the whole use of using administrative law judges which is the primary method of enforcing our securities laws uh the court found a number of problems some are constitutional and would require a change in practice if that court decision which is now on in appeal to an on bank uh review is um is upheld but other uh concerns of the court are about the inadequate standards that the congress has put into the statute and we need to correct those by legislation probably even if the court decision is successfully appealed finally we're looking at the sec's use of waivers where bad actors admit to wrongdoing but then don't face the full penalties with that i recognize

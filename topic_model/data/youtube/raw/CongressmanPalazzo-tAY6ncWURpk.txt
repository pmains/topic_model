seeing no more questions I'll reserve the last question for myself Secretary Panetta as others advocate for immediate and sharp cuts of Defense the actual implementation of such cuts are rarely discussed I'm concerned that such a rapid decline in funding could result in an increase not a reduction in short term costs for things such as termination costs on contracts you have already committed to and increased unit procurement costs as production quantities or reduce can you describe to the committee how such unplanned reductions should they result be implemented in what liability could we face because of termination and many of the plan procurements I you know I I think we've got to take those issues into consideration otherwise you know I don't want to I don't want to cut off my notes despite my face in this process and if we try to get savings that we've identified and wind up costing us more because we've done it in a stupid fashion I think that's a mistake I mean I as I mentioned earlier my testimony I went through the brac process and I know that all the dollars that people looked at for you know huge savings in brac and yet when you they didn't take into consideration the cleanup they didn't take into consideration all the work that had to be done they didn't think into consideration all the needs that had to be addressed and in many cases that will end up costing a lot more I don't want to repeat that mistake very well again seeing no questions members may have additional questions please respond to them in writing I want to thank the witnesses for their service to their country and for their testimony here today the witnesses are excused this hearings adjourned

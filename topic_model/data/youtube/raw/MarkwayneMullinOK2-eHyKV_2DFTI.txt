long last black lives matter is finally taking a stand against theft no not the rampant looting plaguing businesses in democrat-run cities they're coming after you for enjoying your thanksgiving on stolen land the group tweeted out you are eating dry turkey and overcooked stuffing on stolen land colonization never ended it just became normalized here now to react oklahoma congressman mark wayne mullen an enrolled member of the cherokee nation and walter russell mead professor at bard college uh professor mead uh you're someone who literally wrote a book about uh the the number of different attributes that we ought to have in uh american uh political leadership tell me a little bit about what your reaction is to this idea that colonization is something that we actually have to actively worry about when we're eating our turkey and stuffing um well it's uh it does strike me as uh uh for well first of all the turkey at my sister-in-law's house where i'm having dinner was not dry it was actually quite delicious so let's get that straight and i actually think here in uh in philadelphia i believe benjamin franklin the quakers did a pretty rather quakers william penn that bought the land so i i kind of let that one go over my head a little bit um you know there's a time and a place for everything i think it's actually okay to take one day out of the year and be thankful to god for the blessings of all of the blessings of your life and there are other days to think about other problems you know uh congressman uh i wonder if you're if you have your own reaction to this it just seems to me to be over the top and and not something that was uh is appropriate to be uh sort of denigrating the idea that we can't be thankful for all the gifts that we can have and enjoy as americans today look then i mean black isle backlight matters or they're just trying to be um relative they're all they're trying to do is create controversy and and they really don't care it's how they raise money but look i'm enrolled member of cherokee nation so is my family uh we've been in oklahoma we came over what we call the first wave the first walk uh in 1850 roughly and we've been in the same spot we still live in the same spot and and we're cherokee we're natives and we celebrate thanksgiving as a family there was astrology that took place in our family and all native families but it's still our heritage and we share that heritage of people but we're not upset by it we've been blessed i mean we have been very blessed my family's blessed and we get we get to spend time together and we get to to enjoy and laugh on the land that we have removed from or removed too we had a huge celebration with my brothers and my sisters and my nieces and my nephews and we played enjoyed and ate way too much and by the way my wife's turkey was awesome too and there's nothing dry about it so i kind of get fitted by that uh and professor mead i know that you're someone who is a student of of history and and someone who has written so much about it we we have in this moment here this it's real fight about history that seems to be ongoing seems to happen uh during the through the media and in our politics and everything else is there a path back to finding ways for us to unite around the story of the american experience in ways that can bring us together as opposed to tear us apart when i actually think about what happens you know at a thank a typical family thanksgiving dinner uh nobody actually thinks that everybody they're having dinner with is perfect uh you know nobody uh is more aware of each other's faults maybe than a husband and wife who've just been putting on a major dinner you've got kids there who are acutely conscious of everything that's wrong with their parents and parents you're pretty aware of everything that's wrong with the kids and then you got your uncles and your aunts and your cousins and you've got a long history you know very well that nobody at that table is perfect and you actually have more than a few bones to pick with some of the people at that table and yet you're thankful you're in a family yeah and you're aware that there are difficulties in quarrels but you are a family and you're glad you're there and on thanksgiving you celebrate the blessing now i i don't think that's that's impossible for a country like ours yes we have problems yes this group has a bone to pick with that group yes it hasn't always been perfect you know it's not ever gonna be perfect but there's a lot to be grateful for and i for one really really think it there's nothing wrong with celebrating thanksgiving day let us do our best and endeavor to love all of our relatives and do our best along the way thank you so much gentlemen for joining me this evening

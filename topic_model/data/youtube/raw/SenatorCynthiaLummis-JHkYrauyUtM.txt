Mr chairman um as I look at these nominees to the FDIC board I'm really scratching my head because for all the talk of diversity and inclusion that members of this committee have championed and that the White House has championed I'm not seeing that kind of diversity that seems to dominate the thinking about nominees in front of us today um further I'm actually kind of angry that you Mr Greenberg forced the resignation of your predecessor as FDIC chair a first generation American immigrant who was a woman so my question is this are there any women currently nominated or serving on the FDIC board Mr Greenberg uh no senator do you feel your nomination advances diversity on the FDIC board not in that sense no senator but so many on this committee think it's important to send the signal and many qualified candidates have been passed over by this Administration for other roles because they are not sufficiently diverse so why you well it's and it's a little over my pay grade Senator to all I can say is I've served at the FDIC I believe deeply in its Mission I've tried to serve it well I think I have the capability to continue to provide leadership and it's a very important agency why did you force the FDIC chair out I would if I may Senator um the the issue goes to the authority of the agency and under the Federal Deposit Insurance act the authority of the agency explicitly is vested in the board of directors and a majority of the board has the authority to place items before the board but never had but never had until this no actually Senator on a chair on a chair you have forced out chairs when there was a change of administration in the past was the chair forced out ever before this one I would challenge that uh the the conclusion that this was not a unique situation I want to turn next to Dodd-Frank 12 USC 1812 A1 requires that the FDIC board have one member with State Bank supervisory experience that's a quote State Bank supervisor is defined in that same statute as being an officer of a state with primary regulatory authority over State Banks so this is not merely a federal regulator that oversees State Banks so neither Mr Hale nor Mr mckernan have experience as a state bank regulator Mr Greenberg have you worked as a state bank regulator for a state banking agency I have not worked for a state banking agency Senator have you ever written a report of examination or issued an exam rating to a community bank the things that would give you a good understanding of how fair Banks exam rate is for example well I would point out that the FDIC supervises as you know State chartered institutions have you ever written a report of examination no I'm not an examiner I've just served on the board of the agencies do you think someone should have been nominated to the FDIC board with State Bank supervisory experience because most banks in our dual banking system are State chartered they are the majority of the institutions I understand why you asked the question senator in a sense that that's also above my pay grade it's a judgment for the White House in terms of the nomination well the statute requires someone who has actually served as a state bank regulator that's not you or any other nominee here so I think it's pretty clear that the White House and this committee think it's okay to ignore the clear text of Dodd-Frank and I don't think this committee should move forward with these nominations until we start following the law thank you Mr chairman

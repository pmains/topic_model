i like his moderation i like the fact that he is going to go to washington committed to some civility in government and i like the fact that he will work with both parties for solutions and he's very friendly and open and wants to listen it's a big thing with politicians to listen and he does that the last dying hope frankly to be very honest with you he has nothing to gain and a lot to lose and therefore i think maybe he might be the last honest man and that's why i'm for him

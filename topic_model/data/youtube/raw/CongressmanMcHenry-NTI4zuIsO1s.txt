  HOLD CREDIT BUREAUS FULLY  ACCOUNTABLE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN   FOR MAKING CREDIT BUREAUS FULLY  WITHOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE  WORK THE HOUSE FINANCIAL   SERVICES COMMITTEE DID, THE  SENATE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME  TO TERMS WITH THIS MAJOR CHANGE  OF DODD-FRANK. I WANT TO THANK MY DEMOCRAT  COLLEAGUES FOR PARTICIPATING IN  THESE BIPARTISAN NEGOTIATIONS  THAT BROUGHT THIS DAY POSSIBLE.  THE LONG, DARK SHADOW OF THE   FINANCIAL CRISIS IS OVER.  POLICYMAKERS ARE NOW SHIFTING  TO THE MUCH NEEDED REFORMS WE  NEED IN OUR BANKING SYSTEM.  WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE FEWER   COMMUNITY BANKS NOW THAN WE DID  BEFORE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. FEWER COMMUNITY BANKS NOW THAN   FIVE YEARS AGO.  OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MORE   STARVED FOR CAPITAL NOW THAN   BEFORE.  ESPECIALLY WITH THE ECONOMY  CHANGING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH   NOW COMING BACK IT COMMUNITIES   ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. NOW, TODAY CONGRESS IS COMING  TO TERMS WITH A BIPARTISAN   BILL, A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO   MAKE OUR BANKING SYSTEM MORE   INCLUSIVE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE  FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS.  I'M PROUD MY PROVISION THAT I  AUTHORED, THE SUPPORTING   AMERICAN INNOVATORS ACT, IS  INCLUDED WHICH HELPS SMALL   BUSINESSES GET THE INVESTMENT  THEY NEED TO ECONOMY  CHANGING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH   NOW COMING BACK IT GROW AND PRO  AND THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT   BEEN TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED UPON  BY INVESTORS.  BUT I'M ALSO PROUD THIS BILL   ALLOWS COMMUNITY BANKS TO GET  IN THE BUSINESS OF LENDING TO  THEIR COMMUNITY. GETTING BACK INTO THE BUSINESS   OF MORTGAGE LENDING IN THEIR   COMMUNITIES. AND I'M PROUD THAT THIS BILL   WILL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO FREEZE   THEIR CREDIT REPORTS IN THE  EVENT THAT THERE IS A DATA   BREACH OR IDENTITY THEFT.  THESE ARE BIPARTISAN PIECES OF   THIS VERY IMPORTANT PACKAGE. IT IS HIGH TIME CONGRESS GETS  ON WITH IT AND

i appreciate you being here today secretary secretary buda judge um appreciate your service to our to our country and um i'm very encouraged by the words i've heard today on members of both sides aisle and by your words today about working together and i hope that we can do that that's one of the primary reasons that i asked to be on transportation and infrastructure because i wanted to find a place given how divisive things are right now and in our country to be able to be non-partisan and to work together and i hope that we can do that um after looking briefly over the administration's buildback better plan i want to take some time to ask you about two industries important to the folks that i represent in south carolina's first congressional district aviation and waterways as you mentioned earlier in your remarks the seaports of the united states are one of the top economic drivers for our country and nowhere else is it more evident than in charleston south carolina where we have the charleston port and i represent i represent the port and it's one in ten jobs for the state of south carolina also it's about 64 billion dollars in to our economy as well the impacts of the pandemic as like all industries across the country have had tremendous detrimental impact and as global trade came to a halt last year we were reminded of how important our ports and these gateways are to trade to global and to global supply chains so my first question to you is how does the administration plan to account for the needs of u.s ports in the plan to build back better well thank you for raising the importance of ports which are unquestionably a vital part of our infrastructure and i've had the pleasure of running across that beautiful bridge that's in your background and going right up past the port of charleston i know how important that is to the low country uh but also ports are specific places in the u.s that have consequences for us uh even thousands or hundreds of miles inland because they really benefit the entire economy we need to make sure that our ports have the right level of technology in order to keep up with what's happening in industry we need to make sure we're supporting the workers who are in these sports and and one of the things i i viewed as very important in the rescue plan was making sure that we're supporting uh those workers who've been impacted by covid uh we need to make sure that as different kinds of automation or lower emissions technologies come they're deployed in a way that that's effective uh but again that also we're doing it in a way that's that's supportive of workers uh and we need to recognize this is a national priority whether you live close to a coast or not again this is one of those very interagency areas that implicates a lot of parts of the federal government not just the dot but we stand ready to do our part to support the maritime sector and ports and communities like yours thank you and will your office and the administration i know we're going to sound like a broken record today uh commit to working with the port of charleston helping prioritize some of these investments in our infrastructure and our port here in charleston especially to be future proof uh we'd welcome that opportunity and again these are the kinds of things i think we have an opportunity to make a step change in if we have the right level of ambition on the overall infrastructure package that we hope to move through right and i only have a minute and a half left so i want to go to aviation go from boats to airplanes real quick um recently the 1.9 trillion dollar relief package to the aviation manufacturing drops protection provision established a 50 50 cost share program between the industry and the federal government and i know that boeing boeing is also in my district we have the dreamliner 787 being manufactured here um they have sizable presence but they would be excluded from participation and i believe they were going to pass on it regardless because they weren't going to intend to use federal relief grants but the program is still of interest and to them and to me and hundreds of workers and at the boeing plant and elsewhere for those benefits so do you have a timeline of when that program would be stood up in the future uh so uh this is one that uh falls within the dot's responsibilities to prepare as as you know uh the the aviation industry support that was in the first two rounds of the payroll support program was uh in treasury although of course we've worked closely with them but the aerospace manufacturing relief program that was funded in the rescue plan is is set to be managed by the dot so we want to work as expeditiously as possible to implement that and are doing everything we can to make sure that we meet all of the legal requirements and stand up the right capacity so that that can flow as quickly as possible while balancing of course the need to be ironclad in our confidence that the taxpayer dollars are being protected and well spent right and i just want to thank you for your time you've literally been with us i think almost all day today and the beautiful ravenel bridge that you see behind me uh you have an open invitation to charleston i'll run that bridge with you or maybe we could bike over it one day we would love to have you down here and go get into her i'd love it thank you

this hearing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order assistant secretary Nichols assistant administrator escobari thank you for appearing before us today as we talk about United States policy towards Venezuela and a crisis which has not only serious consequences for our national security but the stability of our entire hemisphere three years ago I walked out on the bridge of the Columbia Venezuela Border in cucota and I looked out at Venezuela and saw firsthand the misery and Desperation in family after family forced to flee their Homeland as if it was a building on fire the collapse of a once thriving modern country a beacon of stability in our hemisphere turned into a failed state run into the ground by Maduro and his thugs today the situation is even more dire Venezuela is the epicenter of the second largest Refugee and migration crisis in the world the Maduro regime has overseen the collapse of the economy taking down with it the country's entire education and Health Care Systems basic household items are unaffordable for most Venezuelans maludo has weaponized starvation using it as a political tool to drive over 95 percent of the country over 26 million people below the poverty level and as his regime perpetrates crimes against humanity malural traffic's cocaine he enriches himself in his kleptocratic buddies he invites the Russian Cuban Iranian and Chinese governments into the country so as we review United States policy towards Venezuela we must reckon with how in the span of a generation a trusted Democratic partner has become a mafia state a criminal Enterprise that uses Brute Force to cling to power now I want to be clear this committee believes in diplomacy and Congress has long supported and continues to support a negotiated solution to Venezuela's crisis but a one-sided deal with the regime that kidnaps American citizens to increase its Leverage is simply unacceptable unilateral concessions to a leader that torches his political opponents is unacceptable it's not the path towards a successful negotiation and it's something the Biden Administration as well as newly elected leaders across Latin America should keep in mind because given maduro's track record given that he makes Al Capone look tame there can be no return to normalcy with this regime not without the release of American hostages in Venezuela's political prisoners not without a path to free and fair elections the restoration of Human Rights and a return to the rule of law if the regime won't seriously commit to these conditions we would use the power of our peaceful diplomatic tools imposing Swift and severe consequences on the regime because while Maduro uses the prospects of negotiations to buy himself time the physical and mental health of American hostages is deteriorating by hour as is the Venezuelan people's hopes for Freedom as they face violence imprisonment and hunger every day let's not forget that this crisis has forced nearly 7 million people we talk about the ukrainians who have fleed and certainly we are in solidarity with them but the world hardly whispers about the nearly 7 million people who have fleed Venezuela since 2014. think about that that says almost as many refugees as the entire population of the state of New Jersey in fact that's more refugees than the combined populations of Idaho Connecticut South Dakota and Wyoming everyone needs to do more to protect Venezuelan refugees and migrants across the hemisphere and the United States should be leading the way protecting Venezuelans who are already here President Biden's decision to provide Venezuelans with temporary protected status last year was the right choice after president Trump only paid lip service to Venezuelan Americans but I am very disappointed that President Biden has only provided what was an extension instead of a full redesignation and I've been disappointed by the international community's failure to keep up with the severity of the humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela it seems when these crisis take place in other parts of the world we get people's attention when it's in the Western Hemisphere we don't we must all do more so today I hope to hear the Biden Administration the strategy what are you doing to bring home Matthew Heath members of the Citgo six and other American hostages what is the administration doing to raise the price the regime pays for taking American hostages what is the plan to tackle this sprawling humanitarian crisis what is your plan to maintain our support for Democratic actors including but not limited to interim president Longway though and how will you Empower them to lead negotiations and what does your plan B if negotiations fail or never even seriously start when I authored the bipartisan Verda act with many on this committee joining us co-sponsors I was hopeful for a diplomatic solution but Venezuela's crisis endures and that's why I will be introducing the Verda expansion act in the coming weeks comprehensive new legislation to tighten the screws on the regime it defines U.S policy on Venezuela's political crisis it guides humanitarian assistance IT addresses the Maduro regime's malfeasance and it sends a message to the Venezuelan opposition to Venezuelan refugees and to the Venezuelan Community here in the United States that we stand with them in their effort to build a peaceful prosperous and Democratic Venezuela with that let me turn to the ranking member Senator Rish for his opening statement

the coronavirus pandemic joining me right now congresswoman madeline dean democrat from pennsylvania she serves on both the judiciary and financial services committees i'm glad to have you here thank you so much for joining me um as we understand it despite what we heard a snippet of there from nancy pelosi and previously chuck schumer democrats and administration officials still seem to be worlds apart do you expect both parties will be able to come together and strike a deal i certainly hope so we were finished yesterday with our work uh on capitol hill but we are on call to come back at any time and i hope it's sooner rather than later when you think about it it was yesterday that the moratorium on evictions has expired as well as the federal unemployment compensation i just don't understand how senate republicans can go home and not worry about the families that are going off a cliff a financial cliff as we face this uh extraordinary pandemic over which we have no control so i'm curious what the big sticking point is is it the amount is it 600 and if that's the case would compromise be better for than nothing even a lower amount for those americans that right now will get nothing if this doesn't get resolved there's so much more in the package than unemployment compensation but that is certainly a critical part republicans had suggested maybe we should guarantee or provide 70 percent of a person's former income these are millions of families out of work through no fault of their own they don't have 70 expenses as a result of that their rent didn't go down 30 their mortgage didn't go down 30 their food costs didn't go down so i don't understand that kind of an ocean the other idea of giving sort of some short term a couple of weeks that's not how a federal government should respond in a pandemic the house passed in may the heroes act that would have of course extended unemployment compensation it would have included direct payments to families i introduced a bill that is payments for the people after all this should be about the people direct cash to people continuing during this pandemic instead the republicans put forth little or nothing the other thing that is in this bill our bill that i hope will make sure we get across the finish line is the protection of our elections uh we had 3.6 billion dollars in the bill to protect our elections mail-in ballots for people so that they can safely vote from home there's an awful lot in here support for the post office is critical none of this is by accident that the administration and senate republicans are sitting on their hands mitch mcconnell said let's wait and see when we passed the heroes act that was his response let's wait and see well here's what we see people going off lift because they don't have unemployment compensation they don't have protection from addictions in in terms of this conversation we have to reference the president as you know who tweeted thursday about possibly delaying the november election something that he does not have the power to do it is something both democrats and republicans in congress have said no they have shot that down why tweet it is it a distraction or is he trying to sow the seeds of doubt on the validity of this election because he's worried he might lose all of the obama he's losing he knows it he's in a panic he actually tweeted that the day we buried john lewis imagine that a civil rights hero a hero for human rights for people's rights for voting rights the president is in a panic because he knows he's losing he's in a panic because he's also losing lives of american people 155 000 americans are dead and he has failed to lead so what does he do so confusion so doubt so fear he's been incompetent and so all he can do now is strike out and use others around him like attorney general barr to to so doubt uh and to to actually attack with pepper ball spray uh protesters bringing their sins to our government you mentioned uh attorney general barr i want to play part of your pretty contentious exchange with him it was about the use of chemicals to clear protesters in lafayette park before the president's photo op let's play that when asked about the use of pepper bombs fired at americans in lafayette square you said quote no there were no chemical irritants pepper spray is not a chemical irritant it's not chemical quote well everything is chemical i was referring to a dichotomy actually a dichotomy and these kinds of things between chemical compounds and naturally occurring substances attorney general reclaiming my time there are rules by which we operate here i would ask you to respect them so what was your take away from your questioning of the attorney general did he contradict himself there yes and that was the theme of his testimony uh you saw that on i think it was face the nation he had said no chemicals were used it's not chemical i showed him the definition of what a pepper bowl is it is an instrument by which chemical irritants are deployed with blunt force trauma so while his word said it's not chemical he stood there and said of course it's chemical everything's chemical he did that over and over claiming both sides or speaking out of both sides of his mouth i don't know why he thinks that's effective and it's very puzzling for the top law enforcement officer of our country to be so imprecise can i ask you what the big takeaway was from that hearing and and i don't want to put it in terms of did one side or the other win did the the did congress members that were asking questions when did the attorney general win it's not like that there were a number of people with whom i spoke afterwards who said it was just kind of ugly on all sides no it it was it was sad and it was ugly uh and the behavior of the attorney general uh the difficulty to get him to answer in a straight way nobody won and what i think it revealed was the american people are losing we are losing uh control over the rule of law you know at john lewis's funeral president barack obama spoke about democracy that it's a precious and fragile thing that it's something that needs tending to that's what i think that hearing was about we have to tend to our rule of law we have to tend to our constitution value it hold it preciously and those who do not must be put out of office they are a danger to our democracy for our lives our livelihoods and the life of our democracy let me ask you one more question it's regarding your colleague louis gomer the texas congressman who tested positive for coronavirus this week and he was seen around capitol hill almost immediately before coming uh forth with that news walking around without a mask and and fraternizing with other members of congress and the like um why is it that congress does not have a rapid testing system in place like the white house does shouldn't it uh you know i've heard speaker pelosi speak about this and her point was that just to have rapid testing for us members of congress seems awfully inequitable until we have testing for everybody and i'm thinking of the staff who stand there all day long as we go in and out to vote we go in and out of committees louie gohmert is just one of many irresponsible willfully ignorant members of the other side take a look at that dice when we were in the hearings or the markups in judiciary with jim jordan the ranking member sitting next to jerry nadler most of the time not wearing a mask for hours on hours mr johnson the same thing scoffing and holding up his cup of coffee my constituents want serious lawmakers my constituents want people who will lead who will protect others from the possibility of the spread how this mask thing became an issue to the irresponsibility and to the lives to the deaths of many americans i will never understand but we will hopefully get control over it because we'll do the right thing we just need to do a measure the right thing when other leaders fail to lead sounds to me like your constituents are asking exactly the right and legitimate questions congresswoman madeline dean good to see you thank you so much

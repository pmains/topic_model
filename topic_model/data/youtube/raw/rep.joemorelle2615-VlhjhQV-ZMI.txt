triple negative breast cancer awareness day is observed by Americans on March 3rd every year triple negative breast cancer is a highly aggressive form of cancer which affects about 10 to 12 percent of all breast cancer victims but it accounts for nearly 25 percent of breast cancer deaths annually it affects young women particularly Hispanic and black women and it is something that I didn't know much about until my daughter Lauren was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in January of 2016. Lauren passed away in August of 2017 five years ago and I've committed myself to doing everything I can here in Congress to getting rid of this uh tragic tragic disease so you'd like more information or you'd like to join in the effort to raise awareness to make sure that people have proper diagnosis and treatment contact the breast cancer Coalition or the triple negative Breast Cancer Foundation thank you

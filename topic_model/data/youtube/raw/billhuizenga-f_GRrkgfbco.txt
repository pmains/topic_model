welcome back to to the point automatic spending cuts sequestration something that the president says now is a bad idea he says it could impact military readiness and have other negative impacts on the overall economy Republicans in the House of Representatives will have a lot to say about that you heard from one of those Republican representatives earlier now from the lakeshore congressman bill Huizenga we're coming up quickly to a deadline on sequestration it's not first one it's been pushed back once president now says it is a bad idea but at one time the president also said that he would veto any attempt to change sequestration's where are we on he's been all over the place frankly this was his idea this was something he and Jack Lew the new or the at least proposed Treasury secretary came up with when John Boehner said well if the super committee doesn't work I think we should not raise the debt ceiling the White House I don't know hold on a second we got a better idea we think there ought to be across the board automatic cuts well now they don't want to live with the ramifications of that and and that's the problem I think that's what people are so frustrated with Washington they can't pick a path and stick with that path so he's he's trying like crazy to make sure that he deflects this somehow off to off to Congress and anyone but himself but the problem is is that the lame that the blame lands right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on our website right now if you go there you'll see a number of things that the administration says will happen because of those cuts however in talking with Committee Chairman commerce committee congressman upson earlier in this show he says he thinks there's plenty of flexibility and that the kind of draconian things that some warn of when those cuts go into place don't necessarily have to happen because he says there's flexibility within the budget sandy if there isn't Congress will give those those different departments that flexibility do you think that's a fair assessment that you can cut that kind of money out of the existing budget from this year and not have some real pain felt by people up it let's not kid ourselves Rick any time that we're going to go in and spend less than what have been in the past someone is going to feel that the question is is is this going to be as catastrophic as the as the White House is portraying it and just put it in perspective you know we we are going to be with this automatic across-the-board cut cutting somewhere around seven or eight percent of our overspending not our total spending our overspending so that means the trillion dollars plus that we are going to put on the credit card basically we're trimming that back by 80 to 85 billion dollars there's a lot of people that go you know I've had to do that in my own personal life or at work we've had to do that and they don't understand why the government can't or shouldn't do that exact same thing and frankly you know we this is just a sliver of the things that needs to be done when you talk about it in those terms it is part of the additional spending the spinning that will be borrowed to happen so on one hand you appear to be saying along with others that we've talked to that these cuts can take effect there will be an impact but they won't be catastrophic perhaps from from your viewpoint I'm not trying to put words ya know and in another way of looking at this because I've been asked this question you know are we are we going to see an impact on the economy with 80 to 85 billion dollars of government spending coming out of the economy yeah any economist will tell you that the question then is is for what you know and we've got the White House talking about again raising taxes that's pulling money out of the economy that's going to take away productivity any of the money that's going to be spent is going to be borrowed money there's going to be both a short-term and the long-term effect on that an economist will come back very quickly and say hey won't wait a minute there's going to be an impact if we do suspend this somehow and again I think this has been the problem with Washington is it's refused to deal with the tough issues and make the tough decisions and live with some of the ramifications of that and we've got to quit kicking the can down the road this this person defines kicking the can down there on the other hand you defined this as less than ten percent of what you called over spending the extra trillion dollars that will be borrowed this year so does it really have a significant impact on the deficit or on spending in total now eighty billion dollars is still 80 billion dollars and that certainly does have an impact but the other thing it does is that it sets our new spending levels alright so moving forward we're going to have a different base line of spending the other thing that that it does do is it shows what we can control we've got about a trillion dollars of our three point seven or three point eight trillion dollar budget so a little over a quarter of it that we actually control through the legislature the rest of it's on autopilot the rest of it's in Medicare Medicaid Social Security number of the other health care programs and things like that so when you've got the White House or others in Congress saying ah well we don't need to talk about reforms or having a more efficient or effective social security system for example or Medicare or Medicaid system they're just kidding themselves frankly and and and I hope that this is the first step not the last step but the first step in dealing with those and you know the simple fact is is that we need to have a smaller smarter more efficient and effective government and I think the president frankly just wants to to continue to grow government and just simply wants to spend there is an interesting conversation that has started to bubble up and we even had some of the Democratic leadership say there isn't a spending problem in Washington I think the White House may have tamped that down a little bit but that that was that was interesting though because suddenly they were stepping on their narrative right and they they had to go back and and really try to at least attempt to view like be viewed like they're trying to correct it but that is the philosophical divide that I talked about you know it's really often times not a partisan divide that Republican versus Democrat it's a philosophical divide about the proper size role in scope of government you know we wouldn't be in this economic situation if we had just doubled the size of the stimulus or maybe we'd be exactly where we're at if it was as much is that we had spent on a stimulus package you know it's that kind of philosophical divide I think that really drives it and there are people i call them debt deniers there are people in Washington who do not believe we have a spending problem and I think they're just simply wrong silliman last election the president won reelection he was talking about raising taxes on what he called the wealthiest americans which has happened he was talking about other government programs that he had implemented and wants to implement Democrats one in the center they picked up in the house so is part of that narrative that the president talked about during the campaign resonating with the American people well certainly there was a there was an attempt I think had a bit of a class warfare discussion and those kinds of things that were going on the president won he's going to be president for four years that that is the reality that the other reality is though the Republicans retain control of the House of Representatives second largest majority that we've had in the modern age we can't just be bullied or dismissed we have to be dealt with I'm thrilled that the Senate has finally found its voice and is going to actually pass a budget that lays out the priorities that they see as an institution we've been doing that for the last couple of years we're going to do that again and you know we need to have all three of us getting in and getting engaged in this so you know obviously the elections have consequences and and there's ramifications to that but that certainly isn't just something that we're going to roll over and and you know like a bunch of trained poodles and suddenly you know snap to it just because the president wants to go in this direction but on everything from immigration reform to raising taxes for people over four hundred fifty thousand dollars any Republicans in that latter case did go along and there's been some conversation otherwise because there are some Republicans that are saying wait a minute our messaging was wrong in this last cycle I mean there is a political component that goes along with this how much of that is seeping into this conversation when it comes to sequester ation and how certain are you that Speaker Boehner and the rest of the leadership are going to hold fast to the idea of these automatic cuts yeah I do believe that they're going to hold to that I believe that that is the intention of Congress and not to do these just willy-nilly in fact we in the house have proposed two alternatives to different ways of reaching that same goal through creating a smaller spending plan the president's answer to that is well we're going to cut somewhere but I can't identify where but we need more revenue I mean that really is what their what their messages and I think the American people say hey wait a minute we did the revenue thing now it's time to start bringing our spending in line with those revenues and this simply doesn't do it yet I mean we still have a long ways to go on how does it play when you get back to Washington and this is already coming up pretty quickly the the first month is this going to be another one of those two or three-day crisis where there are going to be a lot of people doing a lot of hand-wringing and wondering what's going on or is this going to just kind of go into effect the way it is scheduled to now as almost a matter of fact well this is again the freshman this is again the frustration right the super committee was created we knew the super committee did not hit its deadlines back six months ago all right there's been little to no preparation from the administration to deal with this and we again we have offered alternatives out of the house of representatives they haven't been taken up by the Senate that the president has not embraced those or offered any of his own other than again revenues and so it's it's confusing to me that there again they're going to just try to create this crisis but I think we saw this with some anonymous Senate Democrat staffers who have said hey you know we get it we're sort of painted into the box here much like the Republicans were at the end of the year with these automatic tax increases that we're going to be happening they had to figure out a way how to mitigate that at this point the narrative I believe rests with us who believe that we need to have a smarter efficient more effective government and it does need to these these cuts do need to go into effect one way or the other maybe not with this across the board maybe we need to have more flexibility and get selective I support that I believe that they have the ability to do that and it just seems like they're throwing out the scare tactics again to sort of justify or cover their tracks when they are the ones that came up with this plan in the first place we're back with more to the point injustice

Thank You mr. chairman it's a pleasure to get to present testimony on HR 2485 the federal land asset inventory Reform Act or the flair Act I would first like to recognize and thank my colleague from Wisconsin mr. Cahn for introducing this sound bipartisan legislation and mr. Chairman I would like to point out this bill were passed and signed into law it would be the kind Westermann Act so not a bad name to have in front of your night yeah I'd also like to recognize my former colleague senator Cramer for continuing the fight for smart governmental reform over in the upper chamber as we legislate in the age of Twitter and 24-hour news cycle that seems like little attention is paid to rational practical or common-sense ideas in this era of polarization it seems like folks prefer confrontation the legislation or shouting to fixing but this bill represents something different it represents a return to good governance to common sense now the Interior Department alone uses 26 different financial management systems and more than 100 different property management systems nationwide if you multiply this number by the number of agencies and departments spread across the federal government we're looking at hundreds if not thousands of different management programs even worse very few or maybe even none of these systems talk to one another employees must frequently duplicate data and putting things like procurement data or financial information into multiple programs each with their own codes and processes the GAO estimates that the federal government wastes two billion dollars a year on unneeded federal property as we work on this committee to address issues like maintenance backlog and other things where we would like to have more funds to make our public lands better and when if there's two billion dollars of wasted money just on data duplication that seems like it would be a really worthwhile thing to the tackle and and this statistic it only covers federal buildings because GSA doesn't serve a federal land and and get this the most recent official interior report on lands suitable for disposal was from 1997 22 years ago it's plain and simple because of the overwhelming number of systems codes and processes needed to keep track of what the federal government owns we're losing things moreover we're wasting taxpayer dollars and the inefficiency has a real impact back in our districts I would like to share with you an example from my district I have a constituent who decided to build a cabin on private land surrounded by the Washington National Forest I he wanted to get a power pole strung along the existing forest service road that provided access to his cabin everything was was good to go he worked with the Forest Service and they signed off on the environmental analysis the power company agreed to come drop the poles in and then nothing for six months nothing it turns out the Forest Service survey lacked an accurate wilderness boundary that information was contained in a separate system so no problem just move the poles to the other side of the road that seems like it would make sense the Forest Service approved the project again the power company was ready to go and guess what nothing happened for three additional months turns out the new route skirted a historical burial ground now information which coincidentally was on a separate system mr. chairman I wish that this was a unique case but my office receives enough casework in this nature to fill a full-time position everything from constantly changing ATV access to vacant lots which take years to come off the federal books I've often said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and this bill is the ounce of prevention that this problem needs it takes thousands of different information systems and puts them into one coherent program if implemented it will allow federal employees from DOI to communicate with USDA about the state of BLM rangeland health surrounding some at-risk Timberland if implemented GSA will be able to differentiate which National Park Service properties need addressing as deferred maintenance in which properties have exceeded their lifespan the list goes on and on well this money will this bill cost money upfront yes it will but what the CBO score won't tell you is the money this measure will save a streamlined system will empower our federal agencies to make better choices faster easier and cheaper for the American taxpayer this in turn will lead to more economic growth as infrastructure wait times to decrease and excess property is offloaded to small businesses we need bills like the federal lands asset inventory reform bill that take common-sense approaches to little problems and do it in a bipartisan way American taxpayers are losing money as federal employees struggle to keep track of hundreds of complex complex incompatible systems and I say that's something we should all be able to fix your back

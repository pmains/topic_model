Mr Speaker I rise today with grave concerns over a recent Justice Department inspector general report detailing how federal prison industries manufactured defective military equipment that endangered the lives of our troops the DOJ investigation into FBI which is owned and operated by the US Bureau of Prisons found that quote the I had endemic manufacturing problems this photo of a test mannequin in an NBC news story from about defective prisoner made equipment shows brain damage likely would have occurred from a small nine-millimeter bullet through a helmet making matters worse the investigation also uncovered that FBI employees instructed inmates to lie and falsely indicate that the helmets being manufactured had passed inspection and met the required safety specifications this is completely unacceptable and potentially criminal the FBI response reassigned the employees can you imagine if these were private sector employees rather than government bureaucrats in order to hold FBI accountable ivan introduced HR 4671 the small business Protection Act it is our responsibility to supply our troops with the highest quality american-made gear available FBI does not deliver on that promise and I request the support of my colleagues in this endeavor

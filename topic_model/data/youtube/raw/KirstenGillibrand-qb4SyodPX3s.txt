Thank You Iowa and congratulations to a Hall of Fame inductees not very polite that's what I was told I was by a Fox News host at the Town Hall I did in Iowa last week because I spoke out about the nationwide assault on women's reproductive freedoms not very polite you got that one right because if Fox News takes issue with me demanding the fundamental human rights for women 50% of America I must be doing something right women luckily I'm not alone I proudly count myself among the formerly well-behaved women fighting back the women in this room the men who love us we are rising up and we are demanding our rights and our voices women are on fire in America today we have marched we have organized we have run for office and we have won because of women we flipped the US House of Representatives and said more than a women 100 women to Congress we elected Cindy axe me and a view thinkin our the first two women from Iowa in the House of Representatives these are unsung heroes there are unsung heroes all across Iowa whether it's the everyday acts of resilience or the big bold moments of resistance women are taking a stand now more than ever our rights are under attack whether it's Georgia or Iowa or Alabama or Missouri in the White House at the Supreme Court across this country right-wing politicians and a whole lot of men are making decisions about our reproductive freedom now is not the time to be polite now is not the time for small steps now is the time to fight like to the pundits who say to the pundits who still say can a woman really win yes of course we can presidents drop kryptonite is a strong woman who stands up for what she believes in we know women leaders across the Globes actually have faster growing economies are more inclusive tolerant and collaborative when women lead we get things done I've already taken on the powerful the corrupt and the seemingly impossible throughout my career I took on a two to one Republican district and won the second time by a twenty four point margin and in my last campaign for Senate I won back 18 counties where President Trump had won whether I'm standing up to the Pentagon or Congress or wall street or corrupt members of Congress I have taken on the fights that no one else will and one I have voted against President Trump more than any other US Senator on this stage I will go toe-to-toe with anyone to do what's right I was the first presidential candidate to pledge that I will only nominate justices and judges who see roe v-- wade as a precedent I am also going to codify Roe and I will repeal Hyde so that women of color and low-income women also get access to abortion services in fact I don't think there is room in our party for a Democratic candidate who does not support women's full reproductive freedom the days of dismissing maternal mortality or adoption rights or paid leave or affordable daycare or universal pre-k or equal pay for equal right right work is just a woman's issue those days are long gone when America's families succeed we all succeed that is why I will pass my family Bill of Rights within the first hundred days of being president just imagine what we could achieve with a working mother in the White House instead of a misogynist imagine the progress we could make with age of first cabinets of Americans who actually reflect why we are a great country and the agenda we could pass not only with women at the table but with a woman at the head of the table now it's not the time to settle for the status quo or to compromise or to be polite now is the time that we must be brave because when hope Rises fear loses and brave wins god bless Iowa

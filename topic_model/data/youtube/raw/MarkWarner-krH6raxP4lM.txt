look now at the evolving threats to the homeland we begin this morning with the chairman of the senate intelligence committee mark warner of virginia good morning to you senator you know 911 introduced to many americans for the very first time this sense of vulnerability at home and it launched the global war on terror i wonder how vulnerable you think america is now are we paying enough attention to the middle east and to afghanistan well margaret i remember as most americans do where they were on 9 11. i was in the middle of a political campaign and suddenly the differences with my opponent seemed very small in comparison and our country came together in many ways we defeated the terrorists because of the resilience of the american public because of our intelligence community and we are safer better prepared the stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later and the attack on the symbol of our democracy was not coming from terrorists but it came from literally insurgents attacking the capital on january 6. so i believe we are stronger i believe our intelligence community has performed remarkably i think the threat of terror has diminished i think we still have new challenges in terms of nation state challenges russia and longer term a technology competition with china but i do worry about some of the activity in this country were the election deniers the insurgency that took place on january 6th that is something i hope we could see that same kind of unity of spirit as you're pointing out america came together after 9 11 and we are incredibly divided right now one thing that is potentially quite explosive is this ongoing investigation of the just by the justice department of the former president and his handling of classified information you've asked for a briefing from the intelligence community given how sensitive this is why should anything be shared with congress given that this is an ongoing investigation because as the chairman of the intelligence committee and i'm very proud of our committee we're the last functioning bipartisan committee i believe in in the whole congress the vice chairman and i have asked for a briefing of the damages that could have arisen from mishandling of this information and i believe it's our congressional duty to have that oversight remember what's at stake here is the fact that if some of these documents involve human intelligence and that information got out people will die if there were penetration of signals intelligence literally years of work could be destroyed we talk about the enormous advances our intelligence community has made helping our ukrainian friends that comes about because we share intelligence if there's intelligence that has been shared with us by allies and that is mishandled all of that could be in jeopardy now we don't know what's in those documents but i think it is incumbent uh as soon as we get approval let me be clear as soon as we can approve of my understanding is there is some question because of the special master appointment by the judge in in florida whether they can brief at this point we need clarification on that from that judge as quickly as possible because it is essential that the intelligence committee leadership at least gets a briefing of the damage assessment but that damage assessment it has been paused as says the classification review and it will take some time so a i'm assuming in your answer there you're saying there have been no promises of the briefing to be scheduled is that right i believe we will get a briefing as soon as there is clarification whether this can be performed or not the judge in florida why should that happen because i want to get to something you said which was the last bipartisan committee um you and marco rubio your partner in in this request for a briefing put forth this letter asking for the damage assessment but lately your colleagues been making some comments that don't sound quite as bipartisan he's compared the justice department to corrupt regimes in latin america when it comes to this investigation he's accused doj leaking sensitive details and he said the only reason to leak it is to create a narrative for political purpose when information gets shared with congress as you know the accusation is it will get leaked so a it looks like you're losing that bipartisan partisanship and b if you brief congress isn't it going to leak further and worsen the record of our intelligence committee of keeping secret secret that's why the intelligence committee shares information with us we remember this was the committee bipartisan that did the russian did you know that your oversight capability many would argue including former heads of counterintelligence fbi the line is drawn when it's an act of investigation they don't we do a briefing we do not i do not want any kind of insight into an active investigation by the justice department i do want the damage assessment of what would happen to our ability to protect the nation here we are 21 years after 9 11. if classified secrets top secret secrets are somehow mishandled i pointed out earlier people could die sources of intelligence could disappear the willingness of our allies to share intelligence could be undermined and i think we need that assessment to make sure if which you will get but i think but it's going to take some time but to that point because it's so sensitive because the country's so divided because you already have in many ways a target being put on the back of law enforcement isn't it more important to get it right to be deliberate and not to be fast here i want the details just as you do i do not think we should have as as the intelligence committee you know a briefing on the ongoing investigation what our responsibility is is to assess whether there's been damage done to our intelligence collection and main maintenance of secrets capacity that isn't a damage assessment that frankly even the judge in florida has said can continue before november listen once we get clarification from the judge in florida and again i don't think we can cherry pick what part of the legal system we like or dislike i have trust in our legal system i may not agree with the decision of the judge in florida but i respect our department of justice i respect the fbi i think they are trying under extraordinarily difficult circumstances to get it right and we owe them the benefit of the doubt senator thank you for coming on and i know we're going to continue to track this and any potential impact to national security thank you

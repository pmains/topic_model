you will serve on the House Armed Services Committee yes absolutely it's privilege to serve there and well I think your salty egg are you only egg come on the AG armed services and small business yes when you when you look at what's going on as far as rebuilding on military and we're spending a lot of money on that and it's I look at Trump as a guy who says look I understand that we're overspending I understand what the deficits happened to be but if I'm in a business I understand that I'm taking a hotel that is dilapidated and I know I've got to push the money in there I don't want to spend it but I got to get it up to where it needs to be and then we can look at cutting back am i off on them no and the bottom line is if you take defense is the biggest item in the discretionary budget but if you take all of defense out we still run into the deficit and the bottom line is our interest and the money that it brings in and and the main thing is lives you know we lost over a hundred lives a year before we started this build back of our military in training accidents planes falling out of the sky tanks rolling over ships crashing into each other and we've not had that same level since we've reinvested in our military and the training and equipment that we need to keep these guys safe I don't think there's anything more disheartening to hear stories about our Air Force or Navy or Marines having to go to a boneyard to pick up spare parts I mean if I'm a Russian I'm sitting here laughing well we've gotten out of that and thank God and hopefully we'll continue that we just passed the NDAA we'll go to conference on that as soon as we get back and get that done so we can get the next year of investment and the top-line number is where we need to be the keepers like what are you one of you back and say we go back in September is it a foregone conclusion Congressman Frank Kelly is with me is it a foregone conclusion that the Wills of impeachment will begin when you get back they probably will you know that's Judiciary Committee yeah and they don't have time to deal with this immigration problem that first of all they said was not a crisis and then all of a sudden it is a crisis but it's all done wrong but instead of worrying about dealing with a crisis on the border we've got them worrying about impeachment and having Mueller to testify Jeunet learn needs to do his job and that's fix his immigration problem rather than taking all his time trying to deal with stuff that doesn't matter his full gone and already decided the president yesterday made more news I think cuccinelli was made that an announcement the announcement about look if you're coming here just for the taxpayers and you're gonna come here and illegally and the only thing you do not look for a job or anything else you're gonna come here you've it you're here illegally and you're on the rolls you can't come here to take advantage of our taxpayers here's a little bit of what mr. Cuccinelli said yesterday USCIS has issued a rule that encourages and ensures self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or to stay in the United States under the rule a public charge is now defined as an individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than twelve months within any 36 month period this final rule has no impact on humanitarian based immigration programs for refugees and asylees that's that's made some people on the Left angry of course you know the confusing part is is is we have ports of entry and if you're truly claiming asylum which I think the numbers like over 90% are not granted asylum because they don't have a an asylum need but why not come to a port of entry it's like saying I'm sorry after you get caught you're not sorry you're sorry you got caught so come to the Florida Entry do it the right way and if you do that then we've got laws to take care of but when you when you get caught illegally this is not the time to holler heard one story yesterday and I forgot who it was they chased a carload of illegals coming across and I mean it was a long long arduous chase and as soon as they finally caught them they all say I'm coming for asylum they it's almost like you can rob a bank but you can at the end of the if you get caught you can say safe I'm safe playing I was going to get oh yeah that's it it is amazing in eight years of the Obama administration how much we've bastardized the laws of this country and I'm I got asked we'll earlier this morning when you look at what happened in the state of Mississippi that's made national news what are we supposed to do if you're here breaking the laws what are we supposed what do they want us to do you're either a country of laws or you're not a country of laws you know and the problem is is right now if you don't like the roads then Jerry Nadler needs to quit dealing with Mueller and quit dealing with impeachment of the president and put solutions good common-sense solutions on the table we need immigrant workers but they need to come here legally they need to come here the right way and you know and I have compassion but at the end of the day are we going to become a sanctuary state is Morton a sanctuary city what what are we gonna do either enforce laws or you don't if you don't like the laws you change them but you know what our judiciary committee and our Speaker of the House have no intent of bringing anything to the floor all they want to do Jews and politics and use it for politics were you a little bit surprised yourself about how many of this was happening in the state of Mississippi because we never here we're we're a border state we're southern state I should say with with coasts but you never hear about a MEC about a immigration problem in the state of Mississippi so a lot of people were kind of surprised I think it took a lot of people off guard you know and the one thing I do hope they do I hope they follow up with the businesses because that's unfair to our other businesses who are doing it right we met with some of those yesterday who doing it right you're hiring the right folks and so when you have a business take advantage there needs to be consequences for them also according to mr. Hurst who was long yesterday that is probably gonna happen absolutely he can't talk about ongoing investment is a former prosecutor I know that and now everybody will saw the answers but he's doing a great job

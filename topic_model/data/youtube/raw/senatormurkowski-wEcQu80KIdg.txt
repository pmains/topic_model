so madam secretary to an area that i think we have much more agreement on and that's working together to provide resources to our tribal communities whether we're talking about public safety and justice natural resources construction programs working with our tribes throughout alaska and in indian country i think that this has been one of those areas where we do have bipartisan support we do have bicameral priority we know that the approach appropriations process is never quick it's never easy but as we work through the process i do think it's important for us to continue this bipartisan approach to these issues to ensure high priority program areas like pl280 programs are funded

hello I'm Drew Ferguson since Joe Biden took office and implemented his open border policies there have been a record number of illegal border crossings leading to more illegal drugs than fentanyl resulting in overdoses more crime and a demoralized border patrol instead of addressing this crisis Biden and house Democrats have continued to double down on their radical open border policies that are outrageous and are outrageously gaslighting the American people by claiming that there isn't a crisis at the southern border make no mistake we're in the midst of a historic border crisis because of Joe Biden and house Democrats when Republicans earn back the house this November we will end Catch and Release loopholes require proof of legal status to get a job eliminate welfare incentives and secure our Southern border this is our commitment to America

witness and congressman adam schiff of california joins me now congressman let's go right to that because the idea that you have a current uh republican house staffer that is on the list already that feels like the door is now open should we be expecting to see names on that list that are more recognizable and there are members of congress up to and potentially including the speak of the house minority leader we haven't made any decisions uh yet on particular members of congress but one thing we have been very clear about it and that is no one is off limits we want to get to the bottom of all the facts what led up to that insurrection what planning went into it who was organizing the rally what expectation they had about potential violence or planned violence that day and if they're members of congress and i think there are that have relevant information about the planning of that day that we're on the phone with the president during that day that can shed light on what the president knew when he knew it what others in the white house were doing why the the military response was so slow and coming we want answers to all those questions so um people ought to understand whether they're in congress or out of congress if they have relevant information we're going to want it what's frightening here is how the connections between some of these extremist groups and the white house appear to be playing out just in the order of the subpoenas that are coming out this is this woman cindy schaffian she openly praised these militias uh some of whom later were involved in the insurrection she she stood on january 5th at this pre-rally that was where the extremists were thank you proud boys the proud boys the oath keepers the three percenters all of those guys keep you safe there's also pro-public reporting that one of the organizers of the rallies told propublica and his that his group felt the need to urgently warn the white house of possible danger it remains unclear precisely what the white house officials learned about safety concerns about the march and whether they took those reports seriously the indication here that at least some people who were planning these uh rallies leading up to january 6 understood that they were going to be violent people around and they seem to have done nothing if not encouraging those people to still show up is that the sense that you have well this is exactly what we need to flesh out and you know for those who say don't we know what happened on january 6th there are so many unanswered questions uh what did we know what did the planners know what did the president know about who was showing up and was it part of the plan that if they couldn't get the vice president to violate the constitution and decertify the results from this state or that that they were prepared to use violence was that part of the plan uh what was the president's thinking what was the president advised about who was showing up uh and so these are among the most central questions to this inquiry uh and these folks that were involved in the planning of the the rally um they have pertinent information to share and we are going to expect their cooperation and we are going to insist on their testimony one way or another and you mentioned uh the former president i mean this is somebody who said we're going to go down i'll walk with you and we're hopefully going to see the vice president mike pence be brave we hope he will be we hope these congress people will be in retrospect that all sounds very threatening he seems to be an obvious person that the commission might want to hear from is that in the plans well i i don't want to get ahead of where our committee or our chairman are but you you raise a very important point which is the president of course said that he was going to go with these marchers descending on the capitol and didn't so why did he tell the crowd he was and why did he decide not to was the president aware of what was going to happen when they got to the capitol these are really uh pivotal questions at the heart of all of this uh and and we're gonna be calling in anyone who has relevant information uh and uh and look we expect to get a fight uh on some of this the president is already gearing up for a fight but the fact that we're going straight to subpoenas with some of these witnesses show you that we're not messing around here we're not going to allow ourselves to be endlessly played rope-a-dope within the court we need to get answers and we need to get them fast and how hard are you guys willing to go in terms of enforcing these subpoenas we know that the trump administration's officials routinely batted away subpoenas and pretended that they didn't have to comply with them now that they are no longer in charge of the justice department do you expect these subpoenas to be enforced by the doj and if so how uh that is certainly my expectation um and i hope i will not be disappointed in that expectation uh the mechanism is if we subpoena people and they don't show up or they refuse to cooperate we can hold them in contempt and we can make a referral uh for a criminal contempt charge against those who are flouting the law uh and then it will be up to the attorney general uh now we didn't have that uh option during the last four years when we had people like bill barr who essentially would do anything the former president wanted no matter uh how corrupt up until the very end apparently uh so uh given that he was one of the people in contempt of congress uh it wasn't viable to go to him to enforce uh subpoena it's obviously a very different situation now uh and we will uh hope and count on the abiding justice department uh and the new attorney general uh to enforce the rule of law uh as somebody who does not feel that i know very much about what happened on january 6 i feel there is so so much more to learn i thank you all for uh this inquiry we will be watching and paying very close attention congressman adam schiff thank you very much sir really appreciate you being thank you

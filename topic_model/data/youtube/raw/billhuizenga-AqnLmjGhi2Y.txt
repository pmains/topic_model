hey everyone bill heisenga moved away uh a little quieter spot uh but uh out in front of the supreme court was just uh on the street in front and um it's amazing seeing quite honestly the bitterness of the left as they're standing there screaming obscenities into the faces of these pro-life kids in fact there was one kid i just passed who said young pro-life dems and uh that's a rarity i can tell you that young man is an absolute rarity in today's democrat party but this is a good day it's a good day for the babies good day for the moms the dads and a good day for society we've got to restore that preciousness of life uh we've got to get back to this respect for life and uh we're not seeing that obviously so uh you know this is something that uh that my family and i have worked on uh for me i was telling some other younger college guys that uh that i was part of the pro-life movement back when i was in college and uh and and and see to see this 35 years later uh is uh is amazing so quite a day uh but the struggle is not going to stop uh it shifts uh it shifts away from the supreme court uh and and goes to uh goes to the state capitals and uh in michigan we revert back to a 1930s law that that gives gives the only exception as the life of the mother and that struggle is going to be real and lansing obviously with governor whitmer she is a radically pro-choice she's going to be pushing this at every uh with every ounce of energy she has as is dana nessel and and and others uh in the state so uh we've got to be vigilant we gotta be there we gotta love those moms love those dads and most especially love those babies we'll talk to you soon

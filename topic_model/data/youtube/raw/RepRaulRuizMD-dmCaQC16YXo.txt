recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman for holding this hearing the issues that we're discussing are wrong in so many different levels and I'm going to talk about 31 are your goals two are your data integrity and three is the veterans experience so goals are important because it defines your success it helps you achieve your objectives setting a goal of 30 days is arbitrary there is no clinical data to suggest that's the best practice anywhere in the healthcare literature and you had mentioned how a term which earlier in the beginning of your presentation about the trying to match scheduling with the clinical practice right so we know that some illnesses are urgent in emergent and we need to really take care of them right away and some others could be scheduled maybe more than 30 days like your routine colonoscopies that you get once a year right so I think that you need to start perhaps changing your premise and getting more towards a clinical approach so that you can take care of your high priorities first and not necessarily rush take up a spot from for your high priorities with things that can be done in a routine basis the second thing is setting up a goals of urgent care appointments within 30 days which I recently heard of is nonsensical then why are they urgent if you're going to wait 30 days usually an urgent is what you call your walk ins or maybe even within 48 days when you want to match your clinical practice with your scheduling goals the third thing that I'm concerned about in terms of your goals is the use of the word same day access for all primary care and mental health you're setting yourself up for more controversy by not clearly defining to the veteran what access is is it going into picking up the phone and having speaking with a scheduler is that what access means is it receiving the appropriate care does is that what access means so the second part is your data integrity now we use population studies to reduce the chance that errors are done by chance or so that we can get a statistical significant accounting of whether this is a true problem and whether this is systemic but the only way that we can really rely on those population studies is if your data is accurate if your data has integrity and the GAO is continuing to find faults in the way that you collect data and how you're reporting it so you can understand why we're still skeptical when you tell the number that ninety-six percent of all appointments have been seen within this arbitrary goal of 30 days the other thing is the way you report data so you're telling me that by veterans who use vet link inside the hospitals are telling you that they're eighty-nine percent of them raynor access good what you're giving me data with a very high reporting bias of course they're going to rate it good because they're already on the inside of the hospital how about asking those that don't get access that are not inside the hospital to tell us what their access is going to look like so for those of us who know statistics and no methodologies you know we are skeptical when you report some of these some of these reports to us that that may not be as accurate as possible and lastly when we can't rely on population data when we can't rely on the integrity then we go by case studies and case studies depending on the accuracy and the right up and the details is what is what oftentimes we're left to look at so let me tell you about a case of a wounded warrior who actually works in my office who is a hero in my book who went for his yearly checkup for the VA he is service-connected disabled managed as well he's prescribed medication through the VA after waiting 30 minutes on home old 30 minutes on hold the veteran was notified that because he had not had an appointment in over a year he would have to schedule a new patient appointment even though he was not a new patient he agreed to the appointment as to schedule that appointment as well they couldn't fit him in until 134 days later again arbitrary right as a result this veteran elected choice but they still said you have to come in and do your new patient appointment before you get to your choice appointment so one what is same day access mean and two why do these arbitrary numbers exist in the first place and three why do they need to have what why do veterans need to have a new patient appointment after a certain amount of time even though they've been getting prescribed medications you know as recent as a month okay thank thank you and I appreciate your skepticism I think most doctors and politicians generally are skeptical data and I think that's a good thing so let me very briefly tell you first of all you said it absolutely perfectly the VA needs to clinically prioritize its appointments exactly what I brought in to the system we used to have 31 ways of ordering a consult today we have to it's either urgent or it's not there is no 30-day rule for urgent care I don't know where you got that that does not exist urgent patients have to be seen now that's why we did the stand downs I've never had a patient who has an urgent care need that I wasn't working to get them to be seen right away that's our goal get them seen right away when they have an urgent care problems so I completely agree and you said it perfectly secondly same day access what does it mean it means resolving the veterans needs that day if they need a prescription refill they don't have to come in we can do that on the phone or electronically if they need to talk about how to understand how to use their their their treatments we can do that over the phone or from tell health but patients who are sick and you to be seen should be seen that day that's what we're working to get implemented so I agree with you we have to set expectations and explain it in a way quicker than we can do today the last thing about the veterans experience look the only thing that matters are we meeting the needs of veterans the vet link system that you talked about asks them when they're in the system you're exactly right so we have a second survey called caps it's what's used by the industry the private sector industry to that asks whether you've been able to get in to see your doctors when you need it both for routine and urgent care so we compare ourselves to the private sector using caps internally we use the vet link system because that's a point of care system so all of your points are absolutely right congressman and and and we take them to heart thank you

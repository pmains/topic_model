thank you very much mr speaker i rise in strong support of the equality act this landmark legislation will bring our nation closer to the promise of its founding and will change the lives of generations of lgbtq americans for the better this should be one of the easiest and most affirming votes we ever take equality is after all a self-evident truth it's part of the bedrock of this nation throughout our history the march toward full equality has brought more americans of diverse backgrounds into the heart and soul of this country today's vote is another important milestone along that path americans in 29 states can be denied housing education credit or other services simply because of who they are that this can happen in our country in 2021 is a grave injustice that must be corrected with this vote and by passing this bill we can also send an unequivocal message to every lgbtq american and their families you matter you have dignity your country sees you and has your back growing up in new hampshire i never thought i could live as my authentic self thankfully i have a loving family and a welcoming community who embraced me as a young person and i'm fortunate to live in a state that has already added sexual orientation and gender identity to its civil rights statutes but too many other lgbtq americans live in fear of sharing their truth and millions live in fear that the law won't protect them from discrimination when they need it look we're not asking for anything that any other american doesn't already enjoy we just want to be treated the same we just want politics politicians in washington to catch up with the times and the constitution no one deserves to be treated as a second class citizen in this country just for being themselves let's pass the equality act let's achieve full equality under the law and let's pass this bill with a strong affirming vote today i yield back

[Music] hello Delaware welcome to another edition of we all go to Washington I'm your host congresswoman Lisa Blount Rochester Delaware's at-large member in the US House of Representatives between now and Election Day you can catch me here on channel 28 on the fourth Sunday of every month at 9 p.m. and on YouTube and Facebook in this episode I'll be joined by some exceptional guests including a trailblazer and personal friend Delaware state senator Margaret Rose Henry and a surprise guest before I welcome our panel I want to take a moment to highlight another of my legislative initiatives in Congress just this week I introduced a first in the nation criminal justice reform bill called the clean slate Act which gives a second chance to nonviolent offenders who have served their time and paid their debts to society based on recent data nine out of ten employers four and five landlords and three and five colleges use background checks and my proposal would automatically seal records so that a minor drug offense is not a hurdle in getting a job buying a home or getting an education or training the clean slate Act is also supported by bipartisan think tanks on the left the Center for American Progress and on the right Freedom Works just last month Pennsylvania passed into law their bipartisan version of the clean slate Act I'm raising this important issue and taking it on a national level because I believe all of us deserve an opportunity to earn a good job and thrive in today's economy we've got an exciting show for you and a lot of ground to cover and don't forget we've got a surprise guest so don't go anywhere in our past two episodes we've covered the importance of voting and how you can get involved today our guests are going to discuss breaking down barriers to voting your rights as a voter and what you need to know if you experience an issue at your polling place the bottom line is this people can be removed from the voter rolls mistakes are made at polling places and then there are national stories of voter suppression we want you to know your rights that's why we've got a great lineup of guests here today I'm joined by my dear friend Delaware icon and woman who needs no introduction recently retired state senator Margaret Rose Henry welcome thank you we've also been joined by rowdy Flynn the executive director of the LGBT equality caucus in Washington DC rowdy is a Delaware native and a leader of the voter protection effort in Delaware rowdy good to have you good to be here and we are also joined by Hanif Salam with the hope Commission who is currently working to assist individuals who are exiting prison and re-entering society thank you honey for the work that you do and we're glad to have you thanks for having me so welcome everyone I want to start off with a question to you Roddy first of all talk to the audience about what is voter protection election protection talk a little bit about that sure so election protection is any effort there's an effort in Delaware run by the Democratic Party to ensure that every voter who is eligible to vote and it was registered to vote is able to cast their ballot and that that ballot will be counted gotcha you know it's really important one of the reasons we wanted to do this show is because it's about breaking barriers you know a lot of times a person might be re-entering you know back into society from prison they don't know what the rules are a person might have a disability or might be a senior and need to know what how to get to the polls and so can you talk about some of the common problems people actually have experienced in Delaware sure so the biggest problem that we see on Election Day are folks who have moved within State but haven't updated their voter registration the important thing to remember is if you're eligible to vote meaning you're over 18 a US citizen and a dell or resident you must be allowed to cast a ballot that day now the Department of election may take time to figure out whether you're eligible later on so if you've moved and you can't quite figure out where exactly your polling places in that moment you should always be able to cast a provisional ballot anyone who shows up to a polling place action must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot and then that about the Department of lection will determine your eligibility and count that ballot if you're eligible to vote that is so key because a lot of people might just think okay I'm going to give up I'm going to turn away and walk home but say that one more time absolutely and this is something that election work you know we have great election workers in Delaware but sometimes you know they're overwhelmed they've a lot of folks coming through they may not always remember in the moment all of what they should be doing do with every voter right the really important thing to always remember is anyone who presents themselves to vote if there's a problem with their registration if they can't find them on their registration rolls if they've made me moved and they can't quite figure out where they should be voting and if their voter said let's say that they are or have committed a felony been convicted of a felony and this unclear whether they're allowed to vote right now everyone who presents themselves to vote must at the very least be able to cast a provisional ballot gotcha and the important thing for everyone to remember is just stay calm but there's ever a problem with your registration just stay calm assert your rights and you can always cast at the very least always cast a provisional ballot that's very important and what do people need to bring with them when they do come to vote what should you what materials do you need to have at the polls sure this is something we see problems with on on Election Day as well in Delaware you present yourself to vote and you'll be asked what is your name and you'll be asked for a proof of identity so prove identity does not necessarily mean a driver's license though it can be a driver's license a proof of identity can be a utility bill any kind of government document or if you don't bring any document with you they'll ask you to sign what's called an affidavit of attestation and it's basically a short form that you write your address your name you sign it and that's proof of identity so you don't really don't need to bring anything with you it can make it a little easier if you bring a driver's license or something like that if you have one but if you don't that's perfectly fine as well and last question who can vote a lot of times people don't know can they vote are they not allowed to vote yeah well anyone who is over 18 a resident of the state of Delaware and a US citizen is presumptively eligible to vote there are some questions if you have been judged by a court to be incapacitated if you are currently serving a prison sentence you cannot vote if there are certain felonies in Delaware that permanently prohibit you from voting but it's not all felonies so it's important to check the Department of Elections website consult with an attorney if you are able to consult legal aid if you don't there financial resources to consult with an attorney and figure out what your eligibility is if you are in what if you are either been judged did you incapacitated or are an ex-felon excellent thank you so much for sharing that valuable information I'm going to shift gears now and talk to Hanif a little bit about your story and why voting is so important and what you personally experience would you mind sharing with the audience your your personal story sure well being born and raised in one it's in Delaware in a community called Southbridge it was rough growing up but unlike most families I had a two-parent home my mother and father were in the home and I'm so thankful for the values and morals that they instilled in me but unfortunately like a lot of families in Wilmington and other urban communities and the 90s the crack epidemic really it changed our family dynamic and with those changes that led me to make bad decisions one was becoming fascinated with earning money through selling drugs and then in 1999 while a student at Delaware State I was arrested and later convicted of a felony drug charges it was the worst experience of my life but fortunately I turn that around after completing all consequences of the crime that I was convicted for in 2003 when I came home I began to identify what could I do to better my life and to help the people around and I was introduced to an AmeriCorps program I'll call public allies and in public allies I learnt all about nonprofits and government and I was introduced to someone who's very dear to me Marla blunt Carter I think you may know her and she became my mentor and just taught me that despite my path that I could really make a change locally and potentially nationally at some point and from 2005 to now and I've just been passionate about helping people who've come from similar positions as myself we are just so proud of you honey we're so happy to have you on the show you represent so much to so many of us and your presence even on this show one of the reasons we wanted to have this show is to make the connection between voting in people's real life and the fact that that vote is precious and what that means and so if you could talk a little bit about why it was significant for you to have the right to vote again and just what that meant to you again the work that you're doing now we'll talk about that in a minute at the Hope Commission but can you talk about voting and what what the significance of that is for you personally definitely well my commitment to making a change in my community and in my state I learned that a lot of that takes place within politics and government so I began to study and learn politics and I'm started becoming a part of the process for example in 2008 I volunteered heavily or 2006 Kuzmin volunteer heavily with beau Biden's campaign for attorney general and then also in 2008 was invited to protect participate in senator Biden's campaign for president and then eventually the obama-biden ticket but it would always hurt come election time because I was a part of these campaigns but I could not vote so although I had support for these candidates and believed in those candidates I felt like my voice truly wasn't being heard and then in 2012 I thought I had an understanding of the old law which used to speak after seven years your voting rights would be restored well I decided I was going to go for it I was going to run for City Council but then I was I became aware through the Department of Elections that even if you had court costs or fines attached to your felony it would prevent you so I was unable to run and again it was another major election that I was not able to participate it but thank to thanks to the champions like senator Margaret rose Emery shortly after that election a law was changed so in 2016 now was able to vote Lisa as well as other close friends of mine that were running and the filling was just undescribable because I've done the work I've helped campaigns but this time that is the incredible incredible story I hope people are just paying attention to this because hanif story is so many of our story and it's so powerful and we have one of the champions here who made that possible Senator Henry has been involved in so many things that have benefited the state of Delaware and this is one that we wanted to highlight just one of the many senator can you talk a little bit about follow up on honey oh absolutely you make me so proud I started a process I was elected in 1994 and I became really concerned about the fact that so many people in my community could not vote and so the first thing I did was to set up a task force to figure out how we can change the laws so in 2000 a law was passed that said if you if after five years if you've made restitution and it was not a crime that was forbidden you could have you could go to the Department of lectures and get your voting rights restored and but it was five years you had to wait and then in nineteen in 2011 and 2013 great constitutional amendments changes and it's called a hey supplant bill and remember the plant died before he could pass so Helene Keeley represented Kela picked up the gauntlet and we passed removing the five year wait but you still had the fives so in 2016 I passed another bill removing fines because you don't you can vote without having paid your traffic in the hell so now you can vote period that is so incredible I mean I'm so glad I had to get her on the TV show cuz she was like I don't need no we want to celebrate you and thank you for all of the incredible work that she's done up and down our state it has benefited all of us and so again senator we thank you for your work honey if we thank you for your story and also for the work that you're doing with the Hope Commission and rathi as well for protecting our vote this has been an incredible panel and stay tuned because we have a special guest that will be coming on on the show and we want to make sure that you're around to see this special guest that we have lined up and we're back I like to introduce our special guest a friend respected colleague and former mayor of Newark New Jersey u.s. senator Cory Booker Cory it is a privilege to work with you on legislation like our soar act that you have in the Senate side and I want to just thank you for joining our program this is the segment we kind of call member to member and happy to have you here I'm psyched to be on with you you are a rising star in American politics and I just was with you for an event when I heard you speak you lit the room up and I'm just so grateful I think that Delaware is lucky to have you well I'm blessed to be in Congress right now because it's such an important time and you know I get to see you and I get to work with you and watch you even in our congressional black caucus meetings where you really bring to life those issues that touch people everyday and one of the purposes for doing this television show is for people to understand how important their vote is how significant it is and how it connects to real life and so you know we just have two simple questions the first is talk about the importance of voting and especially right now well you know the opposite of justice is not always in justice it's often in action and dif apathy and I've seen firsthand in your northern neighbor State Jersey the difference that folks make a lot of folks who might say we're complaining in my city especially when I was mayor complaining about Chris Christie so upset with the things he was doing but if people had just turned out that was a 2009 election at the same number say than 2008 change do these things would have happened funding for Planned Parenthood wouldn't have gotten cut the Earned Income Tax Credit would have got cut money for schools money for policing all of these things and so people just don't understand how powerful they are yeah and Alice Walker said the most common way people give up their power is not realizing they have it in the first place and so the big impact of America today if young people voted at the same level as you know the the baby boomers they would change all of Congress you wouldn't be fighting to get legislation done it would happen in a wave but the problem is this folks are surrendering to cynicism about the system and there's not just certain into cynicism but they're giving up their power and they're giving it over to the very things that often are making them cynical about the system that is so powerful because and especially when you talked about younger folks you know I've heard folks say to me it doesn't matter my vote doesn't matter and and to your point you do have power that you're surrendering and so we want people to really really connect that vote that act to your real life can you talk to the audience about what's at stake in November well I mean so much is at stake I mean I can go through the things that affect us you know we can pass legislation lowering the cost of prescription drugs there undermining the Affordable Care Act so if you have a pre-existing condition your ability to keep your keep healthcare and have access to quality healthcare you could talk about the cost of education you can talk about for us in our areas that quat the cleanliness of our environment in our ocean I mean literally we are just pushing something through this week that's gonna there they themselves have said they're rolling back climb up clean power rules that said would cost thousands of more cases of asthma I mean what people don't understand is the things that you are fighting for and representing and your colleagues affect every aspect of your life even if it's just something like the roads in Delaware in New Jersey are just too darn bad this infrastructure investment right and so so many things that are on the agenda for Democrats things to do with education things do with health care things do with investing in America again whether it's our infrastructure in our roads or its to health funding things that are gonna help with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or sickle-cell all of these things right now are in the balance and we need a level of activism and you don't need to do everything right but do something and the most basic thing you can do in a democracy is to let your voice be heard and your vote is your voice I love that I've been trying to share with people that they think oh I have to run for office or oh I have to do something major but voting is major you know a couple weeks ago actually a couple months ago when there were the demonstrations for the families that were separated I remember two little kids passing out bottles of water because it was so hot outside to the adults that were marching on us those kids were doing their part you know I mean you when you stand up for the issues that you stand up for even when we look at the Supreme Court you're doing your part and so I've said to one group if everybody just had that they talked about it on MTV on the awards a plus one that they took to the polls some who's never voted before we would double the number of people that participants that act alone so before we as we round out and close out could you just if there's anything else you want to share with Delaware please take your I love you Delaware my neighboring state we got each other's backs but look never allow your inability to do everything to undermine your determination to do something and before you complain about something remember those ten two letter words if it is to be it is up to me do something in the cause of your country and we in our generation won't be called to storm beaches in Normandy we're not gonna be called to do Freedom Rides we're not gonna try to cross into Pettis bridge being beaten like the ancestors before us all the things they did but the very least we can do is to vote and if you want to do something more listen to your congresswoman vote and get somebody else to vote vote and register somebody else to vote those are the things right now that we are in the situation we are in this country because over three states 77,000 people voted a different way or a better way to look at it over three states tens of thousands people didn't even show up right right and so for you right now the first thing you can do for the cause of your country is to make sure you go out and vote and to bring some folk with you yes yes thank you so much are you being on our show my friend and my colleague and thank you all right and thanks for watching ladies and gentlemen were almost out of time but keep watching because we have some important dates for you regarding voting in Delaware at the end of the show we have so much more to talk about in the next few months so I hope you'll continue to join me I want

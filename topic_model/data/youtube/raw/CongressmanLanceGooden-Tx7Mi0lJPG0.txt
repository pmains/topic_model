protesters descending on the home of the los angeles health boss angry over yet more restrictions being put in place in southern california this as an l.a county supervisor dined out in santa monica just hours after voting to ban outdoor dining the hypocrisy is overwhelming and continues and all of this on the heels of the major flip-flop from new york city mayor bill de blasio now saying some some schools will reopen next week joining me now is republican congressman lance gooden of texas good to see you congressman thanks for coming in you know a lot of americans are beginning to feel like we are being governed by an unaccountable group i mean we we now have this this woman from from l.a she reminds me of marie antoinette you know let them eat cake while i'm having a full course meal here when will there be political accountability we are not in an unaccountable uh government we are supposed to have representatives who are accountable to our interests and who don't countermand their own rules when will they people like this woman be held accountable well the answer is i don't know but i'll tell you with respect to her before that vote was taken she specifically said that servers are not safe and that's why she's voting to ban this outdoor dining and then a few hours later she goes out and what she does is says that either a she doesn't believe in the words she just said and this whole thing is a game to her or b and this is actually worse she doesn't care because if she really thinks that servers are unsafe for her to go to a restaurant right after that says that she doesn't care about the health and safety of the people she claimed to the hypocrisy is outrageous i think even in liberal places like california the citizens are sick of it um in new york as well but you know as elected officials we're held to a higher standard we have to practice what we preach of course you know and you know somebody there was one politician forgive me but there was one politician who saw through all this about four years ago and he wasn't a career politician and he became the president of the united states and and you see this this strong red wave that happened in in the election a couple of weeks ago a lot of people are wondering gee the guy who really championed the idea of holding these career politicians accountable uh why didn't he join in the red wave that's why i think a lot of people are upset at this election and the the results and the certifications that are coming in that's right in my district especially uh you know we're upset we see the fraud around the country we want that investigated we want that stopped uh because you know if you lose an election and it's fair that's one thing you say you know we'll pick up the pieces we'll come back in two or four years and we'll make it right but if the game is not fair and the deck is stacked against you then you throw your hands up and say what do we do and that's some of the frustration i see in places like georgia where we have the senate runoff coming up we want republicans to be engaged but they're rightfully frustrated and disappointed and don't have faith in the system congressman very quick final question if donald trump does announce a run for the presidency in 2024 of course he would first have to concede and that's not a sure thing but if he does announce a run for 2024 will you endorse him oh he already has my endorsement and he knows that so i hope he runs and i suspect that he will win and i will work as hard as i possibly can over the next four years to campaign for him and make sure he is our next president congressman lance gooden of texas thank you sir appreciate you coming

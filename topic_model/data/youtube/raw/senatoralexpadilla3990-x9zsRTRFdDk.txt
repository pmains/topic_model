senator padilla senator cruz is willing to have you go next even though he's next and appreciate that thank you senator padilla thank you very much uh he shares my pain to go back and forth to judiciary committee same day same time um thank you for the indulgence uh now thank the three of you for uh your in-person testimony and our two witnesses that are participating virtually now i agree that it's critical that we modernize and clarify the electoral account act and i'm grateful for the bipartisan group of senators that have come together to work on this issue but i do have some questions for our witnesses and not just how we can best fix this law but for a moment i think it's also important for this committee and for this hearing to focus on two other related points about the electoral account act reform first while the ambiguous text of the current electoral account act left room for exploitation on january 6th the text didn't exploit itself people did the former president did senators members of congress did and an army of lawyers all had to give up on our democracy enough to give in to the big lie and use it to fuel a baseless challenge to the 2020 election so while fixing the eca is important i think it's also important to remember why we need to do so in the first place because bad faith actors stand waiting in the wings to try again to exploit the text again for their own cynical ends second fixing the eca won't do anything to remedy the significant barriers to ballot access that far too many voters across across the country continue to face fixing the eca might make it harder to cheat in our elections we hear that a lot from our colleagues and we should absolutely do that but i hope that we can soon find our way back to making it easier to vote as well my first question is for miss nelson i know she's participating virtually but let me ask miss nelson to elaborate on the second point i just raised can you please expand on your testimony regarding the barriers to access that voters across the country will continue to face regardless of whether or not we reform the electoral account act yes thank you senator pedia for that question as i've said both orally and in the written testimony election sabotage does not occur only once a ballot is cast it is also determined by who gets to cast a ballot in the first place and under what conditions we know that voter discrimination and voter suppression is still rampant in our electoral system we know that there have been uh hundreds of bills proposed and passed in states across the country that limit access to the ballot and that particularly have a disproportionate impact or were directly targeted at black and brown and other marginalized voters what the electoral reform act will do is to resolve many of the ambiguities concerning how votes are counted and what certifies an election and ascertainment and to shore up so many ways that the exploitation of election results might occur but it doesn't deal with the process of inputs of who gets to vote and under what conditions and that is why it must be complemented by legislation that protects the right to vote and restores the voting rights act to its full capacity and creates uniform standards across the country for voters that cannot be manipulated or in any way uh discriminated against based on race or another protected characteristic okay thank you so very much my second question it's more of a speed round for all the witnesses is as follows now the bipartisan group of senators that engage in a serious effort to address some of the major vulnerabilities of the current eca text i i appreciate their their work now the bill takes serious steps towards reducing excuse me the likelihood that the law can be exploited again as it was as it was on january 6th but the committee you can take a second sentence we were fine we'll give some extra time we're all in a good mood here today but the committee has jurisdiction on elections so i'd like to hear just uh briefly from each of you we know what's in the bill is there anything else that you would suggest to this committee that be added to the bill to make it even better we'll start with mr gore and recovery down the table then to the witnesses participating virtually thank you senator i do believe that some of the technical corrections that have been suggested to the bill by professor mueller and others are appropriate we had a back and forth earlier about the time period for bringing challenges under the reform act and this question of whether six days is sufficient i do believe that the five-day notice provision in 28 usc 2284 for actions brought before a three-judge court involving a state officer or state official should be waived for these kinds of cases just to ensure that there's as much time as possible to resolve any federal constitutional or statutory claims ambassador thank you senator i think extraordinary and catastrophic should be defined i think the timing should be extended we still had state litigation going in 2020 during the so after the so-called state harbor and after the electoral college met i think that lawfully certified and regularly given needs to be defined better to prevent mischief here in congress and there in my testimony i've laid out some procedural specification that i think is important to put in um if you call those clarifications and technical corrections i'm all for them and i do appreciate the huge bipartisan effort mr mueller with senator warner's endorsement i think i'll rest on the four recommendations i put in my written testimony thank you very much mr bower i do not think there is a gaping hole in the statute i do think that there are technical corrections of the kind that i understand professor mueller has advanced uh clarifications it could well be in order and could help to secure answer questions and secure bipartisan passage i would contrast that with any glaring weakness in the design i don't think there is any glaring weakness in the design but those technical corrections and clarifications it seems to me you're appropriately considered thank you and miss nelson yes i i shared some principles that we hope will guide this committee's consideration of any tweaks to the ecra but i will say some more specific uh i'll state some more specific recommendations we think that with respect to the timing uh while we are not promoting a particular time period for expansion that the six days for litigation is uh they're rather tight if we consider what needs to happen within that time period so we urge the committee to think about some expansion of time for litigation and to ensure that there aren't any unintended consequences we've also raised some issues concerning the assignment of judges for the judicial process to ensure that there is no actual and and more importantly no appearance of bias that may undermine public confidence in the process uh we also believe that the right to a mandatory appeal to the supreme court is something that this panel should consider and think about uh ensuring the supreme court's review of these all important issues when they arise through the federal judicial process outlined in the ecra and then also to make it very clear that the process in the ecra does not supplant or supersede any state or federal court avenues and i think that we've articulated that several times in this discussion today but we want to reiterate that point because it's very important that voters still have an opportunity to vindicate their rights under state and federal law outside of that process thank you thank you all thank you madam chair okay thank you good question senator pedia

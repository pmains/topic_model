WH ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR  THESE HEARINGS TODAY? >> GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU,  JOSE. LO, I'M EXPECTING A BIG AND  OBVIOUSLY, AN HISTORIC WEEK. I'VE HAD THEONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF NOT JUST STUDYING JUDGE JACKSON'S BACKGROUND, BUT  MEETIN WIT HER ASHE WAS  MAKINGER ROUNDS AND MEMBERS OF THEUDICIARY COMMITT AND  OTHER SENATO, MY OFFICE WAS ON THAT ITINERARY, SPENT JUST SHY  OF AN HOUR,OT JUST TALNG  ABOUT LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND  ISSUES, BUT GETTI TO KNOW HER  AS A PERP. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M  EXCITED ABOUT IS THE WHOLE  COUNTRY GETTING TO KNOW JUDGE  JACKSONTTER, GETTING TO KNOW  JUDGE JACKSON FOR THE JUDGE AND  THE PERSON THAT SHEIS. I WANT TO AO MAKE A APPNT  RIGHT AWAY ON TH, JOSE. SHE IS MORE THAN EMINENT  QUALIFIED TO BE ON THE SUPREME  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU LOOK AT HERRECORD, LOOK  AT HER CREDENTIAL, HER  EDUCATION, A HER LIFE  EXPERIENCE, SHES RDY FOR  THIS. AND I LEAD WITH THAT BECAUSE,  SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE SIGNALED THEY'RE GOING TO  CALL SOME OF THAT INTO QUESTION IT'S JUST WRONG. E'S MORE THAN QUALIFIED, AND  YES, SHE'S HISTORIC. REPRESENTATION MATTERS. YOUND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT  THIS. SOUST HER APPEARANCE BEFORE  THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TODAY  WRITES A NEW CHAPTER IN OUR  STATION'S HISTORY. >> WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,  IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO  REGNIZE THAT I'M SPEAKING TO  E FIRSTATINO SENATOR OF  CALIRNIA IN THE HISTORY OF  THAT STATE. REPRENTAON, DOES, INDEED,  MATTER, SENATOR. I WAS WONDERING YOUR REACTION TO  REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,  ACCUSINGUDGE JACKS OF HAVING SPECIAL SYMPATHY WITH CRINALS, AS SENATOR McCONNELL PUT IT. >>FIRST, ABSOLUTELY WRONG. ABSOLUTELY FALSE. WHATEVER THEY'RE POINTING TO IS COMPTELY TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. SENATOR McCONNELL HAS POINTED TO IT. BUT REAL,, IT'S BEEN LED B  JOSH HAWLEY, SENATOR HAWLEY,  WHO'S ON THE COMMITTEE, ASOU  SAY. THAT'S A LTLTLE BIT OF AARNING OF WHAT WE MAY B IN FOR THIS  WEEK. BUT LET'S REMEMBER WHO HE IS SENATOR HAWLEY IS PT OF THE  FRINGE ELEMENT OF THE REPLICAN PARTY, WHO WAS FIST-BUMPING WITH INSURRECTIONISTS ON JANUARYth. NUMBERONE, IT'S FALL NUMBER TWO, REMEMBER WHERE IT  COS FROM. AND NUMBER THREE, LET'S NOT GET  DISTRACTED FROM THE  QUALIFICATIONS AND THE  EXPERIENCE THAT JUDGE KETANJI  BROW JACKSON BRINGS TO TS  ROLE. SO PLENTY OF OPPTUNITYOR A  NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO RAISE  QUESTIONS, RAISE ISSUES, BUT  MOST IMPORTTLY, THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE WILL HEAR DIRECTLY FROM  JUDGE JACKSON HERSELF.  AND THERE WE SEE HERUSUST A  FEW MOMENTS AGO, STEPPING OUT OF HER HOUSE AND GOING INTO THE CAR AT TAKES HER TO CAPITOL HILL. SENATOR, BEFORE I LET YOU GO, I  WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ONKRAINE  OVER THE WEEKEND, WE'VE BEEN  SEEINGHIS ESCALATG OF THE  BOMBING, OF THE DESTCTION. ST EARLIER IN TH LAST HOUR,  WE HAD A UKRAINIAN MEMBERFF  PARLIAMENT PLEADIN FOR THE WEST TO SENDN AIRPLANES, TO SEND  IN, BUT TODAY,OT NEXT WEEK,  NOT NEXT MONTH, THINGS THAT THEY COULD USE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES  FROM RUSSIA. WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE? IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE  COULD OR SHOULD BE DOING MORE?  LOOK, I THINK THE UNITED  STATES STANDS FIRMLY WITH  UKRAINE AND THE PEOPLE OF  UKRAINE, ALONG WITH OUR OTHER  NATO MEMBERS AND OTHER ALLIES  AROUND THE WORLD. EVERY TIME THERE'S BEEN AN  APPEAL FOR MORE RESOURCES,  PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FRANKLY  CONGRESS HAS STEPPED UP TO  PROVIDE THAT. SO WE'RE GOING TO CONNUE TO  SUPPORT TO PROVIDE THE RESRCES NECESSARY FO UKRAINE TO DEFEND ITSELF, DEFEND DEMOCRACY, AND  CONTINUE TO EVOLV AS THE  SITUATION ON THE GROUND  CONTINUE TO

mr molinar thank you madam chair uh good to see all of you today thank you for being with us uh dr tavik i'd like to start by asking you uh i know you're new in this role but you're familiar with um policies and i noticed you have a background as an ethics advising on ethics and um it's recently come to my attention that there is a policy at the nih where scientists and people can receive royalties one of the concerns i have and i'd like you to speak to this issue is the nih is in the process you know in the midst as you know of you know awarding grants for research is also in the position of sort of evaluating or giving opinions on drugs that work or don't work and the idea that scientists may be benefiting financially from the work that they've done at nih that creates to me the appearance of a conflict of interest and um just building on what mr cole said about public confidence in the nih to me one of the biggest concerns people had during this last couple years is were they getting truthful information from their government could they trust what people were saying about the medicines and um to me that creates a very disturbing appearance and i'd like you to comment on that policy and whether you are going to take a fresh look at that policy the award of royalties is based on a by doll act which makes no distinction as to whether or not the inventor is paid by the government the private sector academia and so forth so we are following the buy doll act when it comes to that so if i understand what you're saying so you're saying it's federal law that allows the nih to do that that's correct okay but in terms of the potential for conflict no individual who is in a decision-making role on a particular product would um have benefited from being the inventor of that product because we separate out those functions the individuals who make recommendations to leadership of institutes and centers are in the extramural space the individuals who are making the discoveries that that you speak to are in the intramural space they're they're active scientists and we we do not allow those two things to enter into interdigitate well but my understanding is leaders of the organization have received royalty payments some i think dr fauci you've said that you've donated your royalties to charities is my understanding um but what what strikes me is you're in a position where you're saying certain drugs don't work but then you can at the same time be getting royalties from other pro and i i understand you're saying there's a firewall but that information has not been made public and i think sooner rather than later you should make that information public because right now i think the nih has a credibility problem and this only feeds into this and i'm just learning about this people have always in my district been saying well you know so and so has a financial interest in a certain you know they don't like iver mechtin because they are benefiting from that royalty or they don't like hydroxychloroquine now you may have very sound scientific reasons for either recommending a medicine or not but the idea that people have a financial benefit from certain research that's been done and grants that were rewarded that to me is the height of the appearance of a conflict of interest again nih does not um we support the science that validates whether an intervention is or is not efficacious we don't say this is good and this is bad um well i truthfully i i would say you've had leaders of nih saying certain medicines are not good based upon the clinical trials that were supported by the agency but if the if the agency is awarding who the beneficiary of the grant who's doing the trial and there are somehow finances involved that there's a financial benefit that could be accrued if someone's you know patent or invention is considered valid do you not see that as a conflict or an appearance of a conflict of information i i certainly can understand that it might seem as an appearance but and and it's the sort of thing that maybe we could uh work together on so that we can explain to you the firewalls that we do have in place because they are significant and substantial okay well i would appreciate that and i think in terms of restoring public trust i think that would be a good next step thank you i yield back i'm sure

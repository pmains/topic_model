I think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what's best for the economy and as much as I respect you dr. Falchi I don't think you're the end-all I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision I have never made myself out to be the end-all and only voice of this I'm a scientist a physician and a public health official I give advice according to the best scientific evidence Senator Paul thanks for joining waters world that confrontation I guess you could call it with dr. pouchy at the hearing made a lot of waves across the country how did you think his response to you was now Jessie you live in New York that's not a confrontation that was a friendly chat all right but here's the here's the thing is is everybody says these scientists want to base things on facts and so I simply pointed out a fact if we're gonna keep schools closed shouldn't we at least discuss what the mortality for children is the mortality for children 0 to 18 is virtually zero it's not exactly zero but it's close to zero it's point zero zero zero one percent it's very very small and this virus is very very deadly for the elderly and for those who are in nursing homes but it actually is not deadly at all for those who are young and we should get them back to school and we should have a debate over this look this is so bad that I know people in my state that are going to send their kids to grandparents in other states because our idiot governor doesn't want to open the schools that's what's gonna happen is ultimately people are going to move to venues or send kids or even buy a you know rent an apartment in an estate that is not does not have a draconian shutdown of the schools that's what this is gonna come to yeah you're also gonna see moms across the country take to the streets and you do not want millions of angry moms mobbing this is things very quickly this right unmasking situation it's kind of something that everybody didn't really know how deep it went but now it looks like it just happens like 10,000 times a year but what looks really sinister is that it looks like Flynn was just unmask it looks like he was targeted to be unmasked and that's what it looks like it looks like political espionage what can you do about that well saying I think you've hit the nail on the head it is this unmasking process it's about bad actors we had bad actors Joe Biden in the inner circle of Obama I think snooping for political dirt and trying to damage their political opponent but it's worse than that unmasking is so rampant that it's done by the thousands by all administrations but it's a backdoor way around the Constitution if the government wants to listen to your phone calls or my phone calls the Constitution says they have to have probable cause that we committed a crime they have to take our name and the reasons to a judge and they have to present that and then I'm allowed to have a lawyer on the opposite side maybe not exactly at the beginning of these dropping but at some point in time I can protest it in these secret courts there's no protesting no one ever tells you they've even listened to your phone calls and so it's an end run around the Constitution and there is every possibility that they began listening to people in order to try to listen to general Flynn that maybe he wasn't incidental at all that they were trying to listen to people in order to get back to him but to have two dozen Obama administrations unmask him I mean this is crazy we have to have reform the unmasking not only get rid of bad people in government who misuse government we need to reform the processes so so many of these easy way of listening to phone calls we don't snatch up Americans in this do you think that they wanted to get Flynn fired because once he got in there and the National Security Adviser role he could sniff out all of the dirty things they'd been doing before the campaign you know he'd been involved with Defense Intelligence he knew his way around this world yeah so I think that but I think also there was this malevolence of the Clinton campaign and the Obama people and this hatred of this idea that she lost because they they felt that she deserved the presidency and it was just so unfair but they were gonna take him down and they were gonna use these powers but there's a twofold issue and an explanation that we need to all understand it's not just about bad people in government it's about allowing the power or too much power in government to investigate and hear private conversations lots of people talk to the ambassador's from other countries that doesn't mean that you can listen to every senator or congressman or journalist who talks to a foreigner just by tapping into the foreigner you're allowed to listen to the American so what I've been saying all along is we need to get Americans out of this world of spy demand if you want to investigate or listen to an American you really should go to a regular court a Constitutional Court and you should ask a judge for permission they had no permission to listen to Flynn's conversation well and you remember what they did with the FISA Court they fabricated evidence and that was rubber-stamp so I think either way you cut it it looks like abuse of power ironically what they impeach the president for I'd like to know if your name was ever unmasked any of your Senate colleagues I'd like to know Jared Kushner Zinn I mean this is just a three month period during the transition that they he wrote it on this incoming administration I'd like to see the last couple years I was asking about this two years ago and I was asking people in the Senate on the Intel committee what about this what about this and they said oh we looked at all of it all of it was on the up-and-up and all it was fine well it's not on the up-and-up to have 16 members including the vice president unmasking the private phone call of a trump administration new trump administration official talking to an ambassador so you're supposed to allege a national security reason what were their reasons so if the journalists on the Left who get to interview Joe Biden because I don't think he's coming on Fox News any time soon but if the journalists on the Left were worth their salt they would ask Joe Biden what was the national security reason that you unmasked Flynn they should ask clapper that but then again clappers a notorious liar so he will probably simply lie to them you know clapper was the one who lied about the bulk collection of all our phone records on the Senate in a Senate committee under oath clapper said we're not doing it and then you know a month later Edward Snowden revealed that yes they were collecting millions and millions and millions of the information on our phone calls yeah this is a pattern with the Obama administration they spied on the AP they spied on the Senate they spot on a Fox News reporter and it looks like they spied on the entire Trump campaign so Senator Paul why don't you have one of your friendly conversations with some of the people behind the scenes and change their minds thanks for coming on Watters world thanks Jessie

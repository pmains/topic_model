congressman happy father's day to you by the way uh let's start right there on uh infrastructure do you expect a deal to be struck within with this latest compromise that's coming out well i've been working on the compromise on the house side and i'm optimistic i think we're very close to a deal at least on the spending and i think it's a really good deal i as a democrat i don't see this as you know just fixing potholes around the country this is a bill where we would we're getting democrats on board with what is the number one priority of democrats in infrastructure and that's a bill that that takes us closer uh to a a future of clean energy and away from fossil fuels so we're fixing bridges and roads and all the traditional stuff but it's also upgrading our national electric grid it's also building electric charging stations it's accelerating that incredibly important uh and necessary economic transformation and hill reports quote senate democrats in tough races next year namely senators mark kelly of arizona and maggie hassan of new hampshire say that it's more important for an infrastructure spending bill to be bipartisan than for it to fit in with all the priorities that president biden has outlined for his party base and what his party base is claiming clamoring for now that is because of the midterm elections if democrats end up going it alone with this multi-trillion dollar package which uh they have the option to do is that going to hurt them in the midterms should be they be thinking about that in the future their their elections so i i see it a little bit differently the important thing is to deliver it's to pass a bill we are the governing party now we're not just the messaging party and we are going to be judged whatever kind of district we come from we're going to be judged on whether we actually pass a bill that makes things better in this country and helps people bipartisanship is not an end in itself it's just a means to an end it's the way to get to a bill that can pass the senate and get to the president so that we can make the change that we promised congressman i want to turn to the voting rights bill right now because it doesn't have much of a chance at least at this point but there's something interesting that's going on you have big hollywood names like kerry washington and john legend who are actually going all in for the for the people act with katy perry and orlando bloom even appearing in a campaign video the america you know doesn't exist in our future democracy is dead we it started when voter suppression ran wild all over america the voting rights bills died in the senate polling places closed we lost our right to vote like we've ever seen them and i've seen the lord of the rings movies but will these big names help get the public's attention and if so you get a sense of to make a difference i i it's always good to be raising awareness and the public is paying attention but you know i i've seen katy perry rock the super bowl i've seen orlando bloom take down mortar i don't know if they can take down the filibuster but i certainly wish them luck uh i i do think look we i'm also a little bit more optimistic on this in the last few days than i have been uh joe manchin the senator who is at the center of this drama in the senate put forward a compromise version of hr one the voting rights bill that actually contains most of the key elements it's a good compromise and what it is is a test of the good faith of the republicans which of course they are failing in the senate and i think it's a it's a step in hopefully the progression of senator manchin from working on a bipartisan deal to ultimately deciding that he has to use his leverage with the republicans too and be willing to support some changes to the filibuster well congressman i appreciate your lord of the rings knowledge i'm curious whether you're more left shark or right shark at the super bowl yeah the katy perry knowledge was impressive very impressive uh congressman tom milinowski uh joining us a katy perry fan for life thanks congressman all right

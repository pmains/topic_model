we're going to begin this hour with a touch more on the midterm elections they are exactly one week away and we're going to have a conversation now with Republican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas who has been on the campaign Trail supporting his party's nominees that include Senate candidates Herschel Walker in Georgia and Dr mehmon Oz in Pennsylvania Senator cotton also has a new book out today it's called Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power in the book cotton looks at Decades of U.S history and makes the argument that progressives and then Democrats have weakened the country and done so intentionally Senator cotton joins us now uh Senator good morning congratulations on getting a book launched into the world not an easy thing I do want to get to the book but I want to begin with this news uh from Paul Pelosi and the Speaker of the House one of your fellow elected officials a break-in in her home her husband assaulted and according to the authorities uh the perpetrator was looking for her to potentially break her kneecaps wheel her into Congress as an example of consequences what's your reaction to all that well Tony thanks for having me on it's a terrible crime against Paul Pelosi I wish him the very best in a full recovery and we should throw the book at the assailant I would point out he was apparently in the country illegally if we would protect our borders and kick out people who were on uh visas that expired he wouldn't have been here to commit this crime to begin with this is just one more example though of what we should always do with violent criminals which is throw the book at them we should do the same thing to the person who tried to assassinate Brett Kavanaugh the same thing to all the agitators who are protesting in violation of federal law outside of Justice's homes and for that matter not just speakers of the house or Supreme Court Justices any common Criminal Who attacks someone who rapes who murder should have the book thrown at them we need to crack down and get tough on crime in this country that's the solution to all of these heinous crimes senator for the moment I'd want to separate out everyday violent crime and what seems to be politically motivated crime and and get your thoughts on whether the temperature in the country is just too high uh the misinformation is just too much and that we're going to see more not less political violence going forward that's the concern people in your own party have voiced that concern well you seem to arrange lunatics attack both Democrats and Republicans alike I don't think John Boehner 12 years ago pointing out that Nancy Pelosi passed Obamacare Kevin McCarthy now pointing out that she passed trillions of dollars of spending that causes inflation led to this you know apparent nudist activist breaking into her home the simplest way to stop crimes like this is to get tough on crime it's not to try to stop campaigning in the middle of the campaign seven days for an election on legitimate issues of public concern and absolutely people should continue to campaign on legitimate issues of public concern no uh no debate there but to be clear from your answers here I'm here you don't see any connection between things said in this country in particular by people denying the results of the 2020 election uh and the motivations of as you call it this madman in Paul Pelosi's house with intentions against the speaker you don't see a connection between the political rhetoric and the actions of this individual and other individuals Tony no more connection than Chuck Schumer going to the steps of the Supreme Court and saying that Brett Kavanaugh wouldn't know what hit him if he issued rulings that Chuck Schumer disagreed with and what did you have a left-wing Hitman showing up at Brett Kavanaugh's house to assassinate him the answer to all of these crimes is to get tough on crime and throw the book at these criminals all right Senator let's talk about this book uh Only the Strong uh you know you make the case in this book uh that Democrats are not just making as you say mistakes which Republicans have made but are intentionally as you put it plotting against America trying to weaken America a design a decline by Design is how you put it uh why'd you want to put this book out right now well after the Afghanistan Fiasco last year Tony so many arkansans asked me how did this happen how did we lose to a medieval band of savages in Afghanistan I wanted to explain going back to the origins of the modern Progressive Movement with Woodrow Wilson the most ideological man to ever become president why so many on the Progressive left seem to be weakening our country at best these progressives are ambivalent about America and they're openly hostile to American power that's why you see them undermining the foundation of American power a strong and fearsome military a prosperous free economy sovereignty at our borders and freedom of action in the world American energy production this is not something that's just happening it's not bad luck Joe Biden for instance in the 2020 campaign said that he was going to end fossil fuel production in America that's why we have gas at almost four dollars a gallon that's why people are going to struggle to heat their homes in some parts of the country this year so I wanted to explain why this is happening why it's driven by the lifts audio logical Ambitions and also lay on a road map for how we can recover America in an hour Senator there is a lot at stake in these midterm elections and there will be points and counterpoints to everything you just said there but I I am curious looking ahead at 2024 as I know you have as well you want to win in 2022 and then take back the white house uh with your resume Harvard Harvard U.S Army 101st a ranger and now this book A lot of people are looking at you and thinking he wants it in 2024. am I right well that thanks Tony for even uh asking the question but I just say it's one of my drill sergeants you say in basic rifle Marksmanship there's 50 meter targets there's 300 meter targets there's a time to hit the 300 meter Target but right now the 50 meter Target is seven days away and after this election will be a time to look towards 2024 one reason I wanted to lay out this book though is to explain to our fellow Americans what it would take to turn around uh our country what it would take to restore American power and arrest the decline we've seen under Barack Obama and now Joe Biden I hope it'll be a good book for everyone to read whether they're in public office or whether they simply want better elected officials in public office all right Senator Tom Cotton I think people heard you loud and clear waiting to take his shot in 2024 the book Is Only the Strong and it is on sale right now Senator cotton thank you very much

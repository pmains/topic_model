president biden today also announced the administration was looking at ways to convert assets seized from wealthy russians associated with vladimir putin and use them to help ukraine arm and rebuild new jersey democrat tom malinowski is one of the co-sponsors of a bill that passed the house yesterday the asset seizure for ukraine reconstruction act and he joins me now representative malinowski welcome back to the program uh your bill is a sense of congress that is non-binding but most efforts against oligarchs freeze their assets why do you think the u.s should go further and confiscate those assets and actually convert them to help ukraine putin has caused tens of billions of dollars of damage in ukraine at least not not even counting of course the horrific loss of life at the same time we the united states and our allies have frozen or blocked uh potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of russian assets up to 300 billion dollars of their central bank assets not to mention yachts and villas and private planes that ostensibly belong to these oligarchs but in fact are the property of of vladimir putin it seems fitting to me and right that we should be willing to use some of that wealth to help the country that putin is destroying we're not going to be returning these yachts anyway anytime soon even if there is a ceasefire so rather than letting them sit and rot in a port somewhere why not use them to help the country of ukraine rebuild is it possibly a slippery slope for congress to give the power to administration to seize the assets of a country that it chooses to confront and then give those assets to another country that that administration chooses to support i think this is a very unique circumstance this this is stolen money in the first place it was money that was stolen from the russian people by the putin regime and i think we also have to remember the fact that we are complicit in this corruption over many many years the united states and our european allies uh have have frankly welcomed uh the uh the uh the the transfer of this massive wealth from russia into our real estate our banks are hedge funds there are also legal questions the aclu criticized an earlier version of your bill for not having enough due process do you acknowledge there are concerns about going down the road of the executive branch identifying people to target and then taking their assets i i acknowledge that there is a need to do this in a careful way but at the same time i i think you know one one mistake we sometimes make is that we apply an american construct to a russian reality so an american lawyer might look at a russian oligarch who owns a soccer team in in england and say oh that guy's the owner of the soccer team anyone who understands how russia works would say no that guy's not the owner of the soccer team it's the russian state um it is putin who is the owner of of that soccer team these are pooled assets that that the leader of russia can use as he pleases and so you know let's let's not use our due process to protect uh to protect property that was stolen without due process and that is financing a war that is killing thousands and thousands of ukrainians uh and and let's seize the opportunity here um to be able to do something for the people of ukraine with the wealth that contributed to the attempted destruction of their country you mentioned possibly hundreds of billions you even mentioned the central bank reserves of russia that are frozen inside the u.s we're presumably talking about russian oligarch money uh taking that and sending it to ukraine how much of that can the u.s actually sees isn't most of that money outside the u.s most of it is outside the u.s uh maybe it's a you know a few dozens of billions of dollars if you count the central bank assets that are available to the united states but that's not chump change that's a lot of money uh the european union has also uh started a discussion about uh embracing a similar mechanism so i think between the united states and the european union there's a lot that we can do and yes i i asked secretary of state lincoln today for example whether this principle that we are agreeing on encompasses potentially central bank assets and and he says potentially yes as we reported president biden sent to the hill a 33 billion dollar supplemental that is more than five times ukraine's annual defense budget is there any point is there any number past which it is becoming too expensive to support ukraine the ukrainians aren't just fighting for themselves they're fighting for us they're fighting for democracy they're fighting for a set of rules and principles that protect everybody including the united states of america it is absolutely essential that they win this fight there's bipartisan support in congress for doing what is necessary to achieve that goal tom malinowski democrat in jersey thank you

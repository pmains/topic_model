evening everyone welcome to the next revolution I'm Steve Hilton and this is the home of positive populism pro-worker pro-family pro community and in these times more than ever pro America joining us tonight from around the country our good friend Sarah Carter Florida congressman Matt gates and Tammy Bruce all right there they are and here we go this week felt to me like a turning point in the war against the virus of course the death toll continues to mount families across the country ripped apart but the data is clear things are getting better meanwhile the shutdown toll is getting worse this week on imaginable numbers out of work with all the pain and suffering that goes with it President Trump understands that all along he's had the right instincts at first he tried to block the virus coming here with travel restrictions when it did get here in low numbers he tried to contain it everyone forgets this the media scream what did you do in February he did what you're supposed to do it's called containment tracked and follow every case only when there was a breakout did he move to the stage of mitigation and shutdowns when he saw the testing system was broken he ordered a completely new one private sector-led when he saw problems with equipment he ordered a business led emergency response project air bridge for PPE the dynamic ventilator reserve our health system was stretched but it didn't break there was nothing like Italy in fact now we're in a position to help Italy or places with even fewer resources like Africa and the president leads the legacy of a much stronger system for the future this was a total vindication of the entrepreneurial data-driven approach he and his team brought to this crisis this week in response to the failures of the World Health Organization he rejected globalist groupthink and brought some long overdue accountability and now because we have flattened the curve because we have slowed the spread with those important new guidelines he wants to reopen America ASAS P as soon as safely possible that is our focus tonight last Sunday wheat told you about a Stanford University study that would revolutionize our understanding of this pandemic the scientists we had on tested over 3,000 people in Santa Clara County for antibodies to try to gauge the true infection rate the results were released on Friday between forty eight thousand and eighty one thousand people were infected in Santa Clara County by early April fifty to eighty five times more than the official number of cases those famous models doctor foul she talked about were wrong based on bad data the corona virus infection rate is much higher and that means the fatality rate is much lower not three percent or even one percent as we were told but likely between north point one two and not point two percent what does that mean first as we said last week protect the vulnerable they really are a great risk so the White House guidelines are absolutely right to emphasize that but it also means that this virus is out there on a much bigger scale than we knew that has to affect our plans to reopen the big thing we've been hearing is you can't reopen unless you can do widespread testing isolate everyone with corona virus and trace their contacts this was doctor foul Chi's mantra identify individual cases isolate them and contact tracing identification isolation contact tracing identify isolate and contact trace now we know how widespread the virus is from the survey testing it's likely that millions of Americans have it millions more will get it you can't quarantine and contact trace them all so it was a major victory for science and common sense that this was cut from the new White House guidelines they do not recommend testing everyone only those who already have symptoms or people with no symptoms in vulnerable populations like nursing homes but as the president has said it's state and local leaders who decide how and when to open up and the problem is a disastrous establishment groupthink has emerged around the extreme version of dr filiz plan I think widespread testing and contact tracing is going to be absolutely essential to finding out exactly where we are in this and this fight against this deadly virus the variables will include the capacity of the healthcare system to identify isolate and treat those infected so they can slow the spread we can't open the country back up until we can do testing on a massive scale why aren't we even close it will be impossible health experts believe to fully reopen the country short of a vaccine which still seems a year or so away unless there's widespread testing just in the last few days the establishment put up a new road block to reopening tripling the number of tests to quote identify the majority of people who are infected and isolate them from people who are healthy this establishment groupthink is miss-information it ignores the latest data no surprise that big business has bought into it too Jeff Bezos told Amazon shareholders this week that those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for everyone who test negative could re-enter the economy with confidence what an idiotic statement we've got enough problems without Jeff Bezos casually throwing out ignorant unscientific mumbo-jumbo but this is how some state and local leaders are talking to Gavin Newsom this week said the California will need the widespread ability to test contact rates and isolate before relaxing it stay at home order Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the same thing these people and their public health officials talked to doctor foul Chi now I'd like to talk to doctor pouchy his advice is hugely consequential unfortunately although we've been asking for a while he won't talk to us so tonight I'm just gonna ask the questions anyway and see if we get a reply one doctor pouchy you keep telling us you're led by the science and the data why was your data so wrong for so long why didn't you Commission survey testing like the Stanford team have just carried out to get an accurate picture of the spread and fatality of this virus will you carry out nationwide survey testing immediately - based on this new data do you now cept that it's unnecessary and impractical to identify isolate and contact trace everyone who has this virus three will you tell the governor's the media the big business bosses like Bezos that widespread virus testing of individuals is not necessary for reopening will you rule out immunity certificates immediately for do you agree that all debts matter not just coronavirus debts will you commit to a study of the long term public health costs of the shutdown to help inform any future pandemic response and factors like disrupted medical treatment suicides rise in opioid and other addictions and lower life expectancy caused by shutdown induced poverty now the contours of the political battle over all this became clearer this week president Trump now owns reopening but with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont looking at the end of May de Blasio sang July Gavin Newsom saying next year Democrats own the shutdown along with their allies in establishment media the voice over the 37 percent work from home elite by setting up the small business rescue plan and pushing for infrastructure payroll tax cuts and bringing manufacturing home Trump owns the rebuilding but with Pelosi and Schumer blocking emergency help the Democrats now owned a small business collapsed and job losses the White House reopening guidelines were mercifully free of the worst excesses of the Falchi doctrine free of stupid / restrictive mandates but even there there's still room for improvement you can't really reopen the economy until you reopen schools for example and we still face a grave danger of government Korona overreach that is the immediate political battle the threat of this overreaches everywhere even among conservatives who should know better Texas governor Greg Abbott put this man mark McClellan on his reopened task force he's a co-author along with Scott Gottlieb of a reopening plan that is a Monstress technocratic nightmare and look at this beauty from former Romney visors Loni Chanin avec Roy this is a real quote those wishing to engage in air and Amtrak travel should be required to participate in a certified contact tracing app and demonstrate at check-in that they have tested negative insane do not let them expand the bossy petty busybody bureaucratic State on the back of this crisis we now know finally thanks to the Stanford Research just how widespread this virus is we can't hide from it we must learn to live with it until we get a vaccine a cure of course protect the vulnerable but most people who get it don't even know they've had it all these complicated technocratic schemes are reopening an endless testing or a trap we were supposed to be flattening the curve not eliminating it slowing the spread not stopping it we've done those things it was an incredible achievement now let's get back to work if you agree with this message please follow us at Steve Hilton X and that nextrip fnc and share it forum White's everyone else can hear it too alright let's bring in our guests for the night Fox News contributor and host of the Sarah Carter Show podcast very exciting Sarah's podcast you've got a go for it Florida congressman Matt gates and Fox News contributor and president of independent women's voice Tammy Bruce alright and great to see you all Matt Gaetz you're on one of the president's groups looking at reopening where do you think things stand right now both at the national level and at the state level in terms of reopening and moving on from the immediate crisis stage that we've been living through the last few weeks the president is chomping at the bit to unleash the opportunity in the American economy yet again once we can do so safely but Steve there is a globalist element to the establishment elite thinking that you described in your monologue I recall the w-h-o telling us that the death rate could be as high as 3.4 percent and yet the Santa Clara experience you cite shows that it that the w-h-o could have been off by a factor of 17 to 28 Americans turn can take great pride in the fact that Trump isn't going to overpay for bad science from people who shill for China when it is convenient for them to do so I think that brings the decision-making to the president and I think that you know Eisenhower warned in his farewell address that we could end up ceding too much decision-making to a technological elite and that real leaders had to ask tough questions and balance these considerations that you've reflected on great point about the dog nature and you still hear people today go you know siting w-h-o advice in terms of how we should reopen it's absolutely unbelievable Tammy one of the things that's very interesting about this Stanford research the group behind it we had them on last week part of that team not on the medical side but kind of helping them with resources and so on is David neoman who's the founder of JetBlue and he's just as Matt gates just said chomping at the bit to get things moving in because he's highly conscious both of the jobs impact of this with his companies but also his parents who are risk and he's got a plan to bring this virus not the virus sesang but the antibody surveys so you could get a snapshot of how widespread the virus is in different communities as a way to inform local decision-makers they say they can see that it's already out there and that would make them more confident and also make people more confident about opening up it's amazing to me that that you've got this sort of slightly renegade group of doctors and entrepreneurs pushing this forward and that the system itself isn't demanding that kind of testing so we get an accurate picture of this virus everywhere well obviously after the santa clara result what I would have expected and it seems to be coming true is that the Machine doesn't want that to continue because it does exactly what you've outlined there is that it takes fear away and when there's less fear government has less power we're less inclined as individuals to cede power to the government because of an unknown you know monster that's out there as long as we don't know it really that is the problem so clearly we must do that I understand it's it's not the president's goal to test everyone literally but when we can have a groups random group so thousands of is what Stanford looked at over there in Santa Clara finding that in fact this is widespread now that doesn't mean that it's harmless we still have a lot of unknown yes we don't know long term impact we don't know like with chickenpox which leaves itself in your system to appear decades later as shingles you know there's a lot we don't know but right now what California relies on is an example and what the acidity system relies on is being able to tell people you've got to stay hidden because this is still a monster as we learn more you know powers information information is power you've got they rely on ignorance and the more information we have the better of course and then we'll at least find out the degree to which this is spread especially for individuals and business owners to understand that this is something that is similar to what we've seen we must do more research and when we do that we'll be able to move on even further allowing the President as an example when you say in your monologue that he's preparing us and he's gonna leave us better prepared this entire system must be better prepared for what something like China does and for the impact of viruses like this on our lives it's that's so well put I totally agree Sarah I do something for the time you mentioned the shells that I'd like to get you to react to which is this this this attack that comes against all of us who you kind of emphasized the need to get things moving in the economy to stop those job losses to stop the human suffering and health problems that come from the shutdown we're just accused of not caring about lives and and and putting the economy in Wall Street ahead of people it's exactly the opposite you can balance it's quite possible to say as we've been saying all along of course we recognize this is a really dangerous illness if it gets there the people are most vulnerable especially the elderly those the underlying conditions as we've said out ad infinitum we've got to protect those but because it's true from their data we now see that over 80 percent or whatever it is have mild or zero symptoms it's just not necessary to have this sort of total lockdown forever and it seems to me that the the media and the establishment they're actually invested in the shutdown they kind of like it they want it to keep going well because Tammy was 100% right about the fear utilizing fear then people secede their their liberties to the government because they're so afraid but the random sampling to understand this pathogen and doctors have said this over and over again experts have said this the Stanford study is an example of that in Santa Clara to understand this pathogen you have to do you don't need to test everybody you just need random sampling throughout the country to truly understand this we may have already developed a certain herd immunity to this virus anyways to the Wulin virus and we may have developed that in tammy's right we don't know everything about this virus because of course it emanated from China the Chinese Communist Party has been totally totally untruthful and have hidden so many factors about this virus from the from the world not just from the United States of America so we do have to understand that but we may have developed a herd immunity already in some sense to this virus now that's not to say that we can't protect those that are most vulnerable we have to but Steve we have 1.5 million people in the healthcare industry that are going to be losing their jobs according to Oxford Economics we have people that can't get to a hospital to check on they may have cancer who knows they can't go in for regular check-ups we've seen hospitals across the country that could be filing for bankruptcy and Boston Medical is furloughing 10% of its staff so there's a lot of other people that are going to be affected by this particularly when we're thinking of of health and the health of our nation and both the economic aspects that go along with that just such great points I just want to kind of wrap this up by underlining a couple of things there what one on the on the the health care system and the disruption there the cost of that I noticed that in the UK a really senior cancer doctor just this week said that in his view already because of the disruption to treatment in the UK over a five-year period more people will die from the disruption in the UK - just a cancer treatment than - then because of a corona virus and secondly to your point about herd immunity it's interesting that phrase kind of frightens a lot of people because the UK government and Sweden and so on used it at the beginning and and and it put a lot of people off but I was very interested to see the gavin newsom used the term herd immunity over and over again and his remarks this week he's just got a timeline that's much further out than what you were suggesting Sarah but the key question is we need to know that's why we need better data that's why the Stanford study is so important all right thank you all coming up Nancy Pelosi gave some interviews this week from her ivory tower they were truly revolting we will bring you the worst of it after the break enjoy welcome back it's bad enough that Nancy Pelosi is playing politics as hundreds of thousands of businesses lie on the verge of bankruptcy and tens of millions of people have filed for unemployment but instead of taking responsibility for her in an action disgracefully she's literally accusing the president of killing people here she was this morning his earlier delay and denial pause deaths Tammy it's incredible to me a few weeks ago she did this but you know in a kind of less direct way where she's she said that his actions had resulted you know in in you were killing people and now she's doubled you've got a lot of blowback for that now she's doubled down on it it's totally shameless it is and let's remember as the president was making his decisions in late January and early February what was she doing she was impeaching the president they are really hoping that people somehow forget about that but even during that time the American people didn't like it and his approval rating went up they didn't like what they were seeing so this is a remarkable turn of events where they look this is about this is an existential issue I already has been costing the lives of tens of thousands of Americans will cost more lives and all they can think about is how to smear the man who made the difference for us because of the November election that is all they can think about now this brings to mind for the American people to think about and we've seen this across the board with media with politicians with other people we've known with the behavior people it's funny what you learn about people when there's a crisis and how they respond some people would argue that you know this is partisanship how you view the Democrats and this is not fair even Democrats at this point when you look at the approval ratings of the president when it comes to how he's handled a virus indicate that they understand what he's done and they approve of it this is desperation but it also reveals that there is nothing being taken seriously about the seriousness of what they could actually do to make people's lives better and I'll just make one more point yes individuals have filed for unemployment and businesses might go bankrupt did we look at the detail of that but in the middle of that remains the psychological impact on people who don't know what tomorrow brings this is unacceptable for the greatest country on earth and that is what the Democrats have created they've created an environment where yeah at the average person still really does not know if the company the big company they work for would survive Neiman Marcus is expected to file for bankruptcy next week you know these are remarkable times in the emotional impact for how people view their own lives and what the future holds and and shame on her it's as they have no shame and they clearly don't care about the individual in this country at any point that's right I mean that's really strongly put and I totally agree and I would you know if we weren't on TV I'd speak even it even more strong terms because every time I see her I just get so angry with her attitude just like politicizing this to an unbelievable degree Matt I mean you know she's saying all this about the president and at the same time again for political reasons she's blocking the money she'd been doing for over a week now blocking the lifeline money for small businesses and they go on about how they're the party of working people I mean if she says the president is killing people then are we entitled to say the same applies to all the consciousness or lack of action Nancy Nancy Pelosi is the hypocrite of the house while Donald Trump was shutting down travel from China Nancy Pelosi was volunteering as a tour guide in Chinatown and she said she did so so that there wouldn't be racist attacks and really that's just the Democrats resorting to identity politics but it is in fact Nancy Pelosi who is directly responsible for the death of businesses it's really rich for her to talk about and it delays by the president when heard delays in reauthorizing the Paycheck Protection bill will result in the death of businesses that will never come back those families are forever changed because of Nancy Pelosi's irresponsible conduct but not all Democrats are behaving this despicably got to give a shout out to Democrat Jimmy Panetta Democrat Tom Suozzi they are on the president's task force with me they give constructive meaningful comments the president hears from them directly so we need more Democrats that are willing to work with this president like Panetta and Swasey and a lot less like the leadership that just want to score political points totally totally agree and by the way the president has that attitude just like you have a bipartisan spirit he's constantly praising the Democrat governors he's working with you know just this afternoon Andrew Cuomo and so on but she just can't get that Sarah the other thing that just made me sick this week now while she's grinding the noses and the faces of small business into the dust with her delays she's there parading in her mansion with a sort of giant fridge and her hoarding ice cream and going on about what are you 'king it up with James Corden I mean this woman is don't know what to say about this I think we've got the pictures now there she was her fridge my goodness she's so disconnected from the American people I mean she doesn't even see it herself Steve she's so disconnected there are 22 million roughly 22 million people have filed for unemployment we haven't even really seen this since the Great Depression 17.7% were expected with unemployment this month that's up from 4.4 percent last month and she does this social media type of advertisement with her thousand dollar fridge and all of her ice creams any ice cream inside as she just very disconnected but I want to say one thing she should put the blame directly on the CCP the Chinese Communist Party president Trump is not to blame for this virus that came out of Wuhan China they lied to the world so if Nancy Pelosi wants to do the right thing for the American people as House Speaker she should stop playing politics and she should put the blame where it needs to reside and that is on the Chinese Communist Party that not only wounded and hurt their own people their own people but the rest of the world and if we stay together and focused on that we can make real effective changes but we can't when the Democrats keep playing these political games totally right and that's going to be a big issue in November of course she and the other members of the Democratic establishment been sucking up to China for donkey's years and you know Joe China remembered that's that's the point that we keep going back to because it's incredibly important for the future of this country and the choice in November all right coming up coronavirus is serious enough without the media stirring up fear and panic with apocalyptic spin one liberal talk show host finally called them out for it will show you who after the break [Music] welcome back we all know how serious coronavirus is so we could do without the ridiculous fear-mongering from media outlets that sensationalize every piece of coronavirus related news bill marble people he highlighted this trend on his show on Friday take a look last month the Washington Post ran the headline it feels like a war zone with this picture this is not a war zone this is a man with a box of eggs and I've never seen a war zone with this much bacon he he ended that monologue with this we need the news to calm down and treat us like adults Trump calls you fake news don't make him be right I thought that was great Matt I don't know if you saw the whole thing but it was just a really good very forensic look at some of the ways in which these just these headlines are just so hysterical these days I said it's bad enough without making it sound even worse than it is well I will give you the most vile example of media hatred from just hours ago Fabiola Santiago a columnist with the Miami Herald tweeted essentially that it would work out nicely if crowded Florida beaches resulted in the death of Trump and De Santis supporters because that could result in more political power for the Democrats and will she lose her job at the Miami Herald for that of course she won't because the media has been feeding into the hate and hysteria with equal portions my governor Ron de Santos has taken a lot of incoming from the national media but when you look at the science and the facts dr. Burks today said that the state of Florida has one of the most sophisticated contact tracing systems so that we're able to use science and innovation and data instead of the most draconian procedures to shut down the economy and zap the will of our fellow Americans that's really in shock up believe that Miami Herald did you say that's amazing yes unbelievable I mean look Sarah that the the we talked we also be partisan and of course it's a big national emergency but the media I don't think they treat it like that I think that their subconscious and sometimes explicit bias which is to sort of paint Trump as this villain whatever happens is leading them to to make these frightening statements to people that exaggerate and terrify with the language they use it's so irresponsible it's absolutely irresponsible it's like screaming fire in a theatre you know and there might be just some smoke outside I mean and not having all the facts I mean we shouldn't downplay that people have really been affected and their lives have been changed when people have lost their lives because of coronavirus but because of the way the media has been treating this we can't separate the fear from the absolute fact and the media is supposed to be delivering the facts to the American people and to our legislators so we can make the best decisions moving forward just like Matt said and unfortunately the media is not doing that they're focused on president Trump 24/7 and trying to target him in this administration and unfortunately that just backfires and it backfires in a really bad way and the United States really needs to move forward and find solutions not live in fear and panic exactly I mean tell me there's another terrible example today Matt reminded me of it what I've been looking at today there was a column I saw in the New York Times Tom Friedman the great guru of the globalist elite he had an analogy and it was in the headline of the Trump's reopening plan is inviting Americans to play Russian roulette with their lives they're just so over the top and ridiculous well well it is but it also it's it's abusive of individuals who in the regular news of what the reality is is stressful enough but remember in the beginning yeah the same news media was getting excited viscerally excited at saying this was going to be Trump's Katrina so they pictured it from the beginning as a political opportunity one that they could associate of course with harming a Republican president they didn't see it as well another disaster for America natural or man-made disaster it was oh how can we use this to get what we want politically this is how absolutely depraved and ghoulish the media has been the bit of anti-trump that is still out there that can't see past any of that in order to think of the American people or this nation so remember that was the core of their initial response this was Trump's Katrina once again under estimating him under estimating the people who think of this country first and of her people first and mostly under estimating the American people and it is a mystery even ghoulish point of view and it's one that they've held for obviously at least a generation now and it's actually so clear when you put it like that the alliance between the median as we were discussing earlier the Democrats that's exactly how Nancy Pelosi is handling it as we discussed earlier all right coming up the Democrats touted that 10th amendment in their latest attempt to vilify the president but have they actually read the 10th amendment I have actually know it by heart and I don't think they'll like what it says the details after the break [Music] welcome back the left's outraged mob worked themselves into hysterics this week when the president said that he'd be the one who decides when to open our states back up of course on to say that his decision would be made in conjunction with the states governors but the left didn't let that inconvenient fact get in the way of their narrative he's proclaimed himself a king they cried out what about the Tenth Amendment it's obvious that these Democrats haven't even read the Tenth Amendment if they did they'd realize they'd have to throw away about half their platform here's what the Tenth Amendment actually says the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the States respectively or to the people take note Biden Cuomo and the rest of you Virtue's signaling trough hating elitist this means there's no role for the federal government in health care education or housing just to name a few so say goodbye to your plans to expand Obamacare your plans to give everyone free college and your plans to make banks give out risky mortgages you use taxpayer dollars to expand the federal government in a hundred different ways every day now you're the ones lecturing us about the Tenth Amendment give me a break the American people see right through you we here on this show on the other hand truly believe in D centralizing power and we're planning a big campaign on it so stay tuned for that all right coming up Tammy Sarah and Matt Gaetz will be back to react don't go away [Music] welcome back so let's talk about the 10th amendment and the Democrats obviously in nuran in sincere and coherent embrace of it just to attack president Trump Matt I mean look they they have they are so inconsistent on this you know earlier on they were screaming at the president to nationalize the response and now and tries to do that they said no you can't do that is the tenth most laughable isn't it you know the president's consistently in favor of states executing complex issues from coronavirus to even our health care bill where he tried to get block grants to the states the American economy was a war a bonfire and you know the coronavirus snuffed it down to an ember we've got a nurture that ember we got to blow a little oxygen into it and then you layer on the tinder in phases that's why the president's multi-phase approach empowers the states while giving them the federal support they need to accomplish the stated objectives I mean this whole debate tell me made me think of a point that you made a while back that really kind of made an impression on me we're talking about the populism of the right and populism of the left and Bernie Sanders and so on and you said you can't be a populist on the left because you basically don't believe in people power indi centralizing power it's all about centralization and that's what the Left believes so the idea that there's suddenly in favor of the 10th amendment is just a joke well it's out of convenience obviously but look you could look at it this way the Donald Trump is so powerful he even got the Democrats to believe in federalism even if it was for five minutes but at this point also in Cuomo wasn't you know he was a person saying you can't tell us what to do and we're gonna do it on ourselves it's the tenth amendment the next thing you know he's been complaining over the last couple of days a please we can't do it without federal money for testing that is because that the budgets for California in New York have been a disaster and they want to hide that back so it eventually comes out and at one point they say dad and you can't tell us what to do and then daddy please help us really federalism the power of the states is the only way for people to be truly free and I think the American people are recognizing that at this point exactly I mean it's actually really really pointing to that you know one the fundamental founding strength in this country the fact that you do have this decentralized idea built into the very foundation of the country through the Constitution Sarah I mean later the Democrats don't really understand that I don't believe in it either no they don't I thought Tami brought up a really great point as far as budgets I mean before coronavirus these states were already suffering they had terrible budgets and they were already suffering in education in health care and other areas so this is about being prepared and I think what the states have learned because of coronavirus because we're dealing with such a crisis right now is that the states need to be prepared they need to be ready to face things that they never expected to face before and I think that is the lesson learned here and I think the president did a phenomenal job of saying look the federal government's here will help you out but this is a state issue and we want to be here to support you but this is up to the states and the states need to be ready whether it's ventilators whether it's their budgets whether it's other systems and other unexplained or unsuspecting issues or crises that come into the future the states need to be ready and that's what the Tenth Amendment is about it's about individual rights it's about the states rights and then the federal government assisting we'll just have to remind them in November exactly all right well as you all know we like to try and them end this show in a happy way when we can and we need to keep our spirits high during these tough times so while it may be a while before you can go to a stand-up comedy show again we've got the next best thing right here to Joe Biden comedy segment after the break [Music] all right so we had more comedy gold from Joe Biden this week they've started actually I'm putting his wife Jill out there with him in case you keep an eye on him as things go off the rails which they nearly always do take a look at this we kind of it's just but you gotta I mean we got agree sure look my my message to everybody I talked to him is we're gonna get through this I don't know if he's gonna get through that interview all right now watch this one this was CNN and actually the brilliant thing about this is just watch the faces of Anderson Cooper and dr. Sanjay Gupta during this moment from Joe Biden the kinds of things that that have to be done you know there's a during World War two you know what Roosevelt came up with a thing that you know was totally different than a then the this call he called the you know the World War two he had the world the war production the things you remember that what about you know the thing is other version of that or I don't know I mean we do this sorta Tommy I don't know what there's nothing you just say but it's just so entertaining yes and I end up turning into like a German Shepard who hears a weird sound because my head just keeps turning and it gets to be a very awkward all I can say is this I can't wait for the debates let me just leave it there I hope you agree Sarah I don't know I think I can wait for the debate this is just really tragic I mean I will I want to laugh but I don't because I really feel there's something going on here and people need to start asking questions I mean real legitimate questions about what's happening with Joe Biden with the former vice president and it's very concerning and I don't know if the American public fully understands what's going on here if they're even aware of this because CNN MSNBC all the other local channels are really putting it out there yeah I mean nah it's it's it's it is a serious point but as I keep saying you know he's the one that's putting himself forward that you know he can do this you know the the biggest job in the world and he's kind of competent to do that so I think you know let's take him at his word they keep saying there's nothing wrong with him so fine let's just let's just laugh at him because it's so ridiculous and it's week after week never ends dr. Jill Biden is a brilliant woman though she may have to hone her ventriloquism skills so that when the Biden got breaks she's able to step in and offer meaningful commentary you know doc talk about foolish Biden in the Democrats told us for years that Russia was the greatest geopolitical threat we had this election is going to be about who is competent to confront China and on trade on national security on global transparency Donald Trump is the person our country can trust to get the best deal and the best answers out of China moving forward I totally agree that let's just sort of you know underline that point Tommy just a quick final thought from you on that China point because it's gonna be such a big issue and actually this moment I mean just very quickly you've got all these issues that Trump's been on about for so long all coming together in his favor in this election trade China a lot manye fact that that's exactly if the Democrats are trying to make it seem as though Donald Trump didn't know what he was doing at the fact of the matter is all the facts point to the weren't really the precious nature of his decision-making leading up to this that's what we're gonna see but we through the summer and into the fall exactly alright well there you are thank you what a great show nice to see you see you all next Sunday when the next revolution will be televised [Music]

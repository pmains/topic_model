mr. manga last month this Committee held a hearing on cybersecurity threats to small businesses the discussion focused on the need for more information and access to basic cybersecurity assistance and training for small businesses however programs you know I know you your leadership SBA has been dedicated primarily to deploying dollars for small business owners and entrepreneurs however a program like the micro loan program which pairs technical assistance with loans of $50,000 or less service vehicles to deliver critical education and training to small businesses and I wanted to see how that can be applied towards cybersecurity training we already know that small businesses must strengthen their cyber defenses resiliency and recovery in the face of a growing and ever-present cyber threat can you address what more SBA could do with respect to the micro loan program to ensure these borrows these borrow borrowers have access to cyber security training in particular because we had a panel here where every one of them said we need this no thank you very much so with the micro loan program you're exactly correct there is a mandatory training and technical assistance that's made available through grant money to a recipient of a micro loan and we can certainly we provide training to our micro loan intermediaries all the time and we can certainly work with them to make sure that they are making sure these small businesses are aware of cyber security and take full advantage of everything at their disposal so that they can guard against any cyber attacks at their small business we understand that's obviously very important we take that very seriously obviously at the SBA and we would be able to do that I think through the technical assistance and training we also have you know grants that go out for for more assistance like this through our office of entrepreneurial development our SBDCs small business development centers our score Resource Partners as well as our women's business centers and we can work with them to also educate small businesses further on the need for first cyber security and protection against cyber threats so I think we have a few avenues we can work on and also you know I was the the Associate Minister for Field Operations we can certainly work with our field to make sure that when they go out and make pre patience to small businesses that they keep them aware of cybersecurity and the threat that that poses to their small business but but but are you doing that now and is that part of what the training that occurs when when small businesses come to you because I get the sense that many small businesses at least from that panel we had don't know where to go don't know who to trust and don't know what type of training exactly they need and choose instead almost to you know willfully just ignore it and maybe the problem won't won't maybe I won't get hacked and and it may and they move forward I do think there needs to be more proactive initiatives on your part and it's not happening now or would you just told me is that we have all of these ways of doing it but are you actually doing it in a proactive way because when we talk to small businesses and or some of those associations they're saying that actually they're not quite sure what to do or who to listen to of what those particular resources are right so quite honestly I can't tell you that we're doing all of that right now but I can tell you that I will go back to the agency and make sure that we begin to incorporate that in in the technical assistance and training that we provide to small businesses I think you have a very good point and I will make sure that I take that back to the agency thank you could if you could I'm keeping my office and forming and perhaps I don't know if the rest of community is interested or not in seeing the progress that you're making because I will follow up to see you know if we have if we have actually enhanced this process because I think that the problem only gets worse over time certainly I appreciate that yes I will thank you

well it's nice see everybody I'm done believing the Turner hipster supervisor and I'm joined by my my colleagues on the town board councilman thei Esposito Christopher Carini and Tom muscarella what we're happy to announce is today a great initiative where the town of hempstead is partnered up with the Boy Scouts about two weeks ago presidents and Boy Scouts in particularly email there's about things they could do to help and we said how about masks and within about 45 minutes we had over 40 different Scout troops who wanted to help create masks so what we've done here today is we've put together a collection of boxes that we've distributed to the Boy Scouts inside the boxes our materials to make masks instructions how to make the masks and they're going to be giving those back to us we will sanitize them and then be giving them out to essential workers first responders and senior citizens but I think the best part about this is it shows the willingness of people want to help we're in the most dire time in our country right now and the goodwill of the men and women those young kids and the scouts is shining and we're glad to partner up with them and I've told everybody that's pulled in here today we've had over 45 different cars come through here that when we're all able to get back together and you know what paid tribute and recognized the hard work we're gonna be unveiling the very first badge the Boy Scouts town of hempstead coronavirus responds it's a real tribute and it says a lot about the youth in our country that during a pandemic they want to step up they want to help you know this is a dark time but you're seeing a lot of shining lights and these kids these boys and girls are doing an amazing job and the response here today clearly demonstrates it and the best part really is we've actually now had scout groups from outside the town of hempstead who want to expand this so we're going to partner up with our friends in Oyster Bay in North Hempstead and do throughout NASA County but we just want to say thank you to the Boy Scouts to these young men and women and their parents because this is exactly what people leave the city people work me together to do for the betterment of everybody else we were contacted by a lot of local troops who were saying you know they had young men young women who were trying to get their Eagle Scout or the gold award project they needed something to do during a pandemic and we thought what a great idea reach out to all of the local troops and let them make masks for those that are on the frontline and I always say that uh you know in some of all worst times we see the very best in people and I think it's clear today over forty troops came here to the town of hempstead took time out of their day to pick up the materials that they needed the green mask so those on the frontlines and continue to protect serving keep us healthy the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts have a long history of supporting our communities at a time indeed another example them stepping up so thank you I just like to say the life is about accomplishments and for the Boy Scouts it isn't all the accomplishments that they've done for us them helping the elderly in the most at-risk at this particular time is very important for them to learn and to make us safe like I said it was a truly a moment that we want to expand if other troops want to join us please email the town of hempstead we don't care where you are from or ourselves we'll expand this program I'll do it island wide as far as I am concerned I'll partner up with the other districts and do this statewide it's a great program and you know what these Scouts want to help they want to advance their careers they want to reach that that Eagle Scout that is so few reach and we want to help them along the way and like I said when it's all said and done and we're all able to get back together we will be honoring every single one of them and presenting them with this new badge they can proudly display let's say during the pandemic of twenty 20 I stepped up and I did my fair share to try and help people that need it the most so thank you to all the scouts and their parents

and now it's just become this this wall street beast that's what big insurance is it's wall street run amok and it's masquerading as patient care [Music] what's it like being a whistleblower on insurance you were in the industry and now you're on the outside they give you a lot of material to work with there's there's no shortage of things to write about in my old job i used to handle financial communications for cigna so i know how they make money and what they do with it so my understanding is three of the four dollars that united healthcare makes every year are taxpayer dollars which is why no matter what kind of insurance you have um whether you're on medicare or whether you're an employer-based coverage whether you have a marketplace plan whether you're uninsured and struggling to figure it out we're all effectively paying when three and four dollars that are going to the largest health insurers are coming out of our tax dollars they use a lot of that money rather than giving relief to their customers they buy back their own shares of stock if we would hold insurance companies to account for how they're charging our medicare system and for medicare fraud in some cases we would be able to find the taxpayer dollars just out of those savings to be able to expand really important medicare services to cover things like vision and hearing the medicare program in particular has become these companies new cash cow they figured out how to gain the system the government has been overpaying them been paying them bonuses over many years to participate in this program they made enormous profits and they did last year as well too both in 2020 and 2021. a lot of us have seen frontline providers nurses janitorial staff at hospitals it's been really really tough who this pandemic has not been tough on however is insurance companies the value of our coverage decreases every single year in one way or another they make air make it more difficult to get the care that our doctors say we need through prior authorization requirements they reduce the access to healthcare providers through so-called skinny networks even as insurance companies have those record profits that you mentioned people weren't getting care they were putting off care what we saw was insurance companies using kind of the i guess the public eyes was a little bit off them and what they did when we weren't really paying attention we weren't watching is they were out there hitting providers cutting networks renegotiating contracts closing safety net hospitals making it making people's coverage less generous in the middle of a pandemic and because of that that's why i'm reintroducing a bill the patients before profits act which would make it unlawful for insurers to engage in these kind of predatory practices during a national public health emergency we've seen so many stories of these caregivers essentially being burned out and not only are they working around the clock in many cases they've been shortchanged by these insurance companies so your your legislation is so important so valuable unfortunately necessary doctors especially pediatricians mental health providers rural practices they are really at the mercy of big insurance so i think it's important for people to understand when we're taking on big insurance companies yes we are fighting for patients but we are also fighting for our providers who really want to focus on patients the entity here that isn't focused on patient care is the big insurance companies absolutely right so anyway i just love you wendell i want to grow up and be just like you i just don't know enough yet but when i get there i'm going to be really dangerous

joining me right now is louisiana congressman house minority whip steve scalise congressman it's good to see you this morning we've got a lot to get to i want to ask you about russia and china but first let's talk about these explosive new emails and the gain of function research which anthony fauci first said that it's absolutely not true there was no funding of gain and function research and in fact now he's backtrack tracking and saying oh yes we were working with chinese scientists to uh study these things your reaction to these emails yeah good morning maria there's some very alarming things we're seeing in these emails and of course they just got dropped a few days ago but i i saw like you did back in february of 2020 where dr fauci was acknowledging or was getting uh emails sent to him saying that there was a real distinct possibility that this virus started in the lab in wuhan which many of us were saying over a year ago and we were demanding investigations maria over a year ago into the origin of the virus and we were being shut down by democrats in the media you think about this you had a lot of the social media platforms blocking people who were suggesting that it started in the lab this gain of function issue and you know rand paul's been going after this for a long time again being called a lot of names turns out may be true masks a lot of questions about the effectiveness of masks that you purchase commercially all of this in these emails we need to have a hearing on this maria we need to get to the bottom of this dr fauci needs to be brought in under oath to answer questions about this uh we've been calling on pelosi to do this they've been covering up for china and for frankly for a lot of these other questions that we've been raising just calling people names conspiracy theorists and all this turns out it all might be true yeah exactly and i've got one email here from christian anderson from scripps and she writes to fauci on january 31st 2020 okay january 2020 she writes the unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features potentially look engineered okay she writes that in an email in january 2020 the entire year we heard anthony fauci say it's unlikely that it was probably a bat to a human and meanwhile he had this from his colleagues that they clearly raised their hand and said no no this looks engineered where is this going what should we think about in terms of i mean you know i mean look china is clearly culpable but president biden has not even asked xi jinping about the origins of the coronavirus yet i mean i've been raising my hand about this now since inauguration day why does biden continually roll over for communist china well that's a great question and of course he won't answer that in the mainstream media won't ask him that question but going back to that email i saw that very same email and it was alarming because again it it points out a distinct possibility that this was engineered in a lab not transferred from bat to human which is all we were being told by the scientists they were saying don't even think about this idea that it could have been engineered in a lab but also and and if you go back uh the president trump's coronavirus task force from reports i've i've seen even mark meadows uh president trump's chief of staff said just the other day they were not even told by dr fauci about emails like that where dr fauci is being told by other scientists wait a minute we're looking closer at this thing and we need to because it could very well be engineered he never shared that yeah from what people in the trump white house said with other people on the coronavirus task force this was the task force president trump put together to get the bond minutes that was before we had shut down america before we had seen the global pandemic be called out uh those those could have saved lives those questions being answered could have saved lives we need to get to the bottom of this we need hearings on this specific question and and he knew that the nih sent money to eco health alliance and eco health alliance sent money to the wuhan lab and he said it's not true the question has to be did he perjure himself and lie under oath so we're going to be following that but i've got to get your take on something else one of the headlines of the morning this morning steve and that is russian finance minister has stated that there are plans to cut all dollar holdings in the sovereign wealth fund of russia to zero instead russia says it will invest in the euro yuan and gold reserves now earlier this week the russians sent a message to the u.s telling us that leading up to this quote-unquote summit between biden and putin that the russians were going to make biden and the u.s administration feel quote uncomfortable so maybe this is part of that that they're now going to cut all their holdings in u.s assets what kind of an impact is this going to have i remember during the 2007 collapse henry paulson then treasury secretary paulson wrote a book and in that book he writes about the russians and the chinese getting together to collude to con to to discuss the possibility of selling all their us assets to put even more pressure on the us this comment this morning from the russian uh minister is to me telling me that our adversaries are smelling weakness at the leadership in this country and they are piling on what is your reaction to this comment from russia yeah and very very valid concerns look every president is tested early in their administration we just don't know what that test is going to be president biden's being tested on a number of fronts from rockets being fired into israel and any siding with some of these anti-israel allies of his in congress the democrats in congress that that are signing with palestinians telling him not even to replenish the the iron dome missiles you're looking at what he's doing with russia and china and as you said russia and china want to both collude to undermine the u.s dollar but again why did president biden give a gift to russia just days ago where he waived any kind of penalties and sanctions against the nordstrom pipeline here you got president biden shutting down the keystone pipeline killing american jobs and hurting our relationship with china and then he gives a gift to russia right before russia threatens to undermine u.s currency where is president biden on any of this he's failing miserably these first big tests where foreign countries are enemies there are bad people around the world president trump stood up to them on every front you didn't see any of them trying to test president trump like this because they knew he wouldn't take it biden's just looking acting as if he doesn't even know what's going on right under his nose these are very big concerns and by the way and it's and it's got to be confronted you talk about giving a gift to russia ahead of this summit that he's going to have how about the gifts he's been giving to china my sources are telling me that there will be a revised executive order on the pentagon list for capital market sanctions uh pretty much lessening the load on the chinese sanctions that are in place for companies that are tied to the chinese military why are we making it easier for china to own america the other day president biden says that xi jinping is firmly believing that they china will own america within 15 years well what are you doing about it president biden it looks like he's helping him get there i mean guys this is uh that's unbelievable but you look at what president trump did to confront huawei where you know our defense assets uh were using huawei technology a lot of commercial assets in america and around the world president trump not only blocked their ability through the defense department but he was pressuring other countries when great britain was using their technology uh because they they steal data giving away intellectual property trying to give away the vaccine intellectual property marian you've covered this well but he wants to give china our vaccine dna the technology for the mrna yeah that created these viruses that are saving lives but also future viruses will be built on that same american technology biden wants to give that away to china where where is his concern about american jobs in america's economy the the the communist party has been trying to steal the vaccine for a year we know that from senator thompson he's just gonna give it to us we have to steal it we'll just give it to them real quick the crisis at the border deepens fox news captured video of migrants in the rio grande river nearly drowning congressman okay this is the health and human services commission announced it will not shut down the child migrant holding facility in texas despite an order from governor greg abbott to do so because the governor says there is abuse going on at that facility your thoughts on where we are at the border why what is kamala hara so afraid of why won't she visit the border yeah maria it's a great question i've been down there myself many of my colleagues have been down i went to that donna detention facility and it looks like child abuse by the bible administration the way that they're keeping those kids in cages and by the way dr fauci even admitted that they're violating the cdc guidelines on how to treat people many are coming over with tobit and spreading it because they have facilities designed for 250 people and biden's putting over 4 000 in these facilities because he's lost control of the border and then he just just this this last 24 hours got rid of the remaining mexico policy formally that was something president trump negotiated with mexico to get control of our southern border it's out of control and it's not just south and central america people on the terrace watch list from middle eastern countries are coming across because the borders wide open and kamala harris who was put in charge by president biden is trying to walk away from this thing uh it's it's all on her lap right now but she needs to go down there she's yet to visit the border i've invited her she ought to go today president biden ought to go today and see just how disgraceful the treatment of these young kids is being carried out by the biden administration it it's absolutely disgraceful if anybody has not seen the video of the five-year-old boy at the border in el paso google it right now just google crying boy el paso and you will see this poor baby screaming help because uh the mexican cartels took him to texas dumped just to get through because you have to have a a a six-year-old or younger to get in and then they just dumped him and he's screaming help it's a must-go president imagine if this happened under the trump administration oh yeah you know that answer but president biden has given control of america's southern border to the drug cartels from mexico that's what's going on right now border patrol agents tell you what's going on and what needs to be done to stop it trump had gotten the border under control uh biden's got it wide open and it's a disgrace what they're doing to these kids congressman thank you so much we will see you soon steve scalise we appreciate your time this morning

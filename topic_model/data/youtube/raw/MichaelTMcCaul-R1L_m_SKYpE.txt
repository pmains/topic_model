my next guests recently led a Border Patrol guided toward the texas-mexico border highlighting what he describes as woefully inadequate resources and he has introduced a border security bill that requires operational control of our border with no less than a ninety percent apprehension rate on the entire border with Mexico over five years the full house could vote on his measure shortly after the summer recess joining us is congressman Michael McCaul chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security mr. chairman good to have you with us you you took a number of congressmen with you on that tour of the border what are your thoughts and and and their reactions we know my thoughts are this this ad hoc approach we've used over the last couple decades throwing money at the problem without a national strategy without a plan plugging holes up we went to San Diego they have good fencing there they have technology but they're getting around that with the boats Tucson has wonderful technologies but all does is it presses them to other points and now the new point of entry now is Texas the Rio Grande Valley the immigration flow has gone up fifty five percent and without a national strategy and a plan to dictate where we put those resources we're just going to continue to throw money at the problem without a real solution and your proposal this administration to be clear has rolled back 287g the the co-operative legislation that uh that authorized regulation that authorizes cooperation between the immigration authorities the Border Patrol and local law enforcement this administration wants no part of it your law your bill would encourage that cooperation or what has been the reaction boy local law enforcement or force multiplier the ones down the border have a valuable role to play the border sheriff's endorsed my bill they support it because it gives this bill gives them a voice as stakeholders as to what the national strategy is going to be and what the implementation plan is going to be along with the border governors along with the Coast Guard and Border Patrol and National Guard as well but it brings everyone together to create this national strategy we've never had before we've never done this before we've never had a plan to implement it we've never had metrics that measure results we thrown 75 billion dollars at the border over the last decade with only a forty-four percent success rate that is abysmal and we can do better than that and we also define operation control as a ninety percent apprehension rate which i believe is achievable within two years i spent the three days with the Border Patrol Chief Mike Fisher and he agrees we can get this thing done and Lou you and I have talked about this issue for quite some time ever since I got elected to Congress now is really the moment when I think we can finally get this thing done well as you know I've endorsed or whatever to whomever make hair I've endorsed the approach taken by the House of Representatives an incremental approach in which your committee congressman Bob Goodlatte the chairman House Judiciary Moving's I had with the rules of regular order committee hearings on these issues which has been denied in the Senate and and for crying out loud Senator Chuck Schumer has even endorsed now the incremental careful deliberative thoughtful approach that you and and your fellow members of the leadership and the house have chosen are you stunned by that I am stunned I mean this comprehensive idea to throw together a bill in three days in the Senate which is a misguided approach it throws almost 50 billion dollars without any rhyme or reason it's totally arbitrary is a total waste of the taxpayer dollars what we want to do it's fiscally responsible to have a strategy and a plan first and you know what g and the real novel concept as a founding fathers envisioned we go through the committee process we have hearings we go through committees and then piece by piece develop legislation thoughtfully in a smart way that i think will finally Rizzo and provides solutions to a very a very difficult complex issue what Congress comes back to what the ninth of sep tember so we look forward to your return and watching those hearings take place and legislation move through the Congress as the as was intended by our forebears congressman it's always good to talk with you Michael small chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee thank you

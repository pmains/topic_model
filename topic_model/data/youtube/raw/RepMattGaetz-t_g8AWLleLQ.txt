I guess tomorrow we will find out if there is anyone that Michael Cohen hasn't lied to we already know he lied to Congress we already know he lied to law enforcement lied to the IRS lied to three banks and he's going to prison for his lies and so I guess it will be relevant for us to determine like does he lie to his own family does he lie to his finance ears do we look does he lie to his finance ears who are members of his family and it'll be one heck of an inquiry for us because this is someone who has tangled such a web of lies that he is not to be believed and I think it is entirely appropriate for any member of this body to challenge the truthfulness and veracity and character for the people out of a history of lying and have a future that undoubtedly contains nothing but lies that is the story of Michael Cohen we'll see it play out tomorrow and I for one can't wait to the get to the bottom of things and can't wait to get to the truth I yield back

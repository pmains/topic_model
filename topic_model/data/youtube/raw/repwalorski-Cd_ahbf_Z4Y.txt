GOOD THING. YEAH, UNDERSTANDABLE. THANKS, RACHEL. WE'LL SEE YOU SOON. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SEEN FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAND OUT A LOT OF MONEY TO AMERICANS, BUT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH IS THE RAMPANT FRAUD THAT IS OCCURRING EVERY DAY, COSTING THE TAXPAYERS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHEN IT COMES TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. HERE TO TALK ABOUT COMBATING THE FRAUD IS INDIANA CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE WILL OUR SKI WELCOME BACK TO WAKE UP AMERICA CONGRESSWOMAN? THANKS SO MUCH TIME. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. YEAH, THIS IS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS ALREADY OUT OF HAND AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE LAST SUMMER, SO WE JUST DROPPED THE BILLS. YOU SAID TO START COMBATING THAT AS THE REPUBLICANS ON WAYS AND MEANS, YOU KNOW, IN THE BILL THAT YOU INTRODUCED YOU SAID QUOTE ENHANCED FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE NOT ONLY HURTING OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY, THEY'RE TURNING AMERICANS. INTO EASY PREY FOR FRAUDSTERS AND CRIMINALS. RAMPANT UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD HAS COST TAXPAYERS AS MUCH AS $200 BILLION. DEMOCRATS DON'T REALLY SEEM TO CARE. AH LOT ABOUT THIS. WHY? WHY IS THAT? YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY WERE TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THE FACT THAT THIS UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT, WHICH NOW GOES THROUGH SEPTEMBER THERE, BELIEVING THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY HAPPENING, THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT SAFEGUARDS ON THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE SENDING OUT TO PEOPLE TO STAY HOME AND NOT WORK. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS ACTUALLY, TOM COULD GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE GREATEST RIP OFF OF TAXPAYER MONEY WE'VE EVER SEEN. THIS COULD GET US HIGH AS $200 BILLION, AND SO. I HELD A HEARING FOR THE REPUBLICANS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT THAT I CHAIR AND PRETEND LISTEN TO PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NOT A STATE THAT IS EXEMPT. PEOPLE IN EVERY SINGLE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FINDING OUT THAT THEY'VE BEEN COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF. AND THEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ADDING IDENTITY THEFT ON TOP OF THAT THIS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF HIS WELL. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO OUR FELLOW DEMOCRATS IS, LOOK, YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE PAYING PEOPLE TO STAY AT HOME, GET WITH US ON THIS BILL, BECAUSE WHAT THIS BUILD US. HAD SAFEGUARDS ON THE FRONT END LIKE IDENTITY VERIFICATION TO PREVENT FRAUD BEFORE IT OCCURS. IT STRENGTHENS THE EFFORTS TO CATCH THE CRIMINALS AND RECOVER THOSE FUNDS, AND THEN IT HAS PROTECTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS AND VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT. SO THESE ARE REAL COMMON SENSE PARAMETERS THAT WE BELIEVE WITHIN WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR AT WE'VE LEARNED. THIS WILL HELP CURTAIL THIS, BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO THIS OR TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET RIPPED OFF. CONGRESSWOMAN YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE WHO COULD GO BACK TO WORK AND JUST CHOOSE NOT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR WORK AND HAVE PULLED THEMSELVES OUT OF THE WORKFORCE. FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WHO AREN'T EVEN IN THE BUREAU OF LABOR. LABOR STATISTICS NUMBERS ON UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO THEY'VE BEEN SUCH A LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED. SO WHAT IS THAT WHAT IT CAN BE DONE ABOUT FOLKS WHO TURNED DOWN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT OR AREN'T LOOKING FOR WORK WHO STILL WANT TO COLLECT THIS MONEY? THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF DEMOCRATS, SLOWING DOWN THE ECONOMY AND REFUSING TO MOVE OUR ECONOMY. GET IT OPEN AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW AMERICANS HAVE PROSPEROUS LIKES. YOU KNOW, I HAD TO BUILD A BASICALLY SAID WE'LL PAY YOU A BONUS TO GO BACK TO WORK IF YOU GO BACK TO WORK BY JULY. AND WE'VE SEEN HELP WANTED SIGNS ALL OVER MY DISTRICT ALL OVER THE STATE OF INDIANA AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND SO, OUR HOUSE LEADERSHIP SENT A LETTER. I JOINED THEM LAST FRIDAY TO EVERY REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY, ASKING HIM TO PLEASE STOP THE EXTENSION OF THE BENEFITS. THE FEDERAL BENEFITS. PLEASE GO BACK DOWN TO THE STATE LEVEL BENEFITS AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY. ON MONDAY MORNING OF THIS WEEK, THE STATE OF INDIANA'S GOVERNOR GOVERNOR ERIC HOLCOMB, DID THAT I THINK WE'RE UP TO OVER 20 STATES NOW THAT WE'RE CUTTING THOSE EXTENSION OF FEDERAL BENEFITS, AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST GOOD NEWS FOR EMPLOYERS IN MY DISTRICT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE TWO EMPLOYEES AND YOUR MOM AND POP SHOP ON MAIN STREET OR IF YOU'RE A PRODUCTION FACILITY GENERATING MANUFACTURING AND HAVE 5000 EMPLOYEES. THIS IS A KEY OF GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS ARE BROKEN. THEY ARE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PUTTING RAW MATERIALS TOGETHER IN THE OTHER STATES. THEY'RE NOT WORKING EITHER. SO THIS IS THE NATIONWIDE EFFECTS. I'M I'M THRILLED THAT THE STATE OF INDIANA IS OPEN AND WE'LL WE'LL DISCONTINUE THOSE BENEFITS IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS. MENTIONED IT LAST HOUR. YOU HAVE SIX MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT ARE OPEN. YOU HAVE ABOUT 3.4 MILLION FOOD SERVICE AND RETAIL JOBS OPEN BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER, THOUGH. HOW DO YOU REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE? TO GET OFF THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE AND GO AND ACTUALLY GET BACK TO WORK. I THINK THE ELIMINATION OF THESE EXTENDED FEDERAL BENEFITS IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIND IS AS PEOPLE COME BACK AND AS OUR ECONOMY CONTINUES TO PICK UP, I REALLY DO THINK THAT THERE'S NOT AN EMPLOYER IN THIS COUNTRY THAT COULD COMPETE AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'VE GOT TO STOP THAT. WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THAT CONCEPT, AND WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK AND REALIGN OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ON THE AMERICAN DREAM. IT'S THEIRS TO AND THEY CAN HAVE IT. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A 16 MONTH HIATUS OFF THIS, BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF WITH WHAT WE'RE OFFERING PEOPLE BONUSES TO GO BACK, GO BACK AND BE A PART OF THE SUCCESSFUL AMERICANS PUTTING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT HELPING THIS. AZIZ YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH THE FRONT DEMOCRATS ARE HELPING PUT PARAMETERS AND STOPPING THE FRAUDSTERS. AND ON THIS, YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE 17TH IF YOU COULD MAKE 17 50 AN HOUR IN THE STATE OF INDIANA ON BOTH BENEFIT STATE AND FEDERAL EXTENDED BENEFITS. IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO GET PEOPLE TO COME OFF OF THAT. SO YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I'M OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE THAT LETTER TO THE GOVERNORS HAVE SHOWN SOME GOOD, PRODUCTIVE RESULTS. AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP ON WITH OUR MESSAGE, WHICH IS EVERYBODY CAN GO BACK TO WORK. EVERYBODY COULD BE A PART OF THIS GREAT NATION TO GET OUR ECONOMY OPENED UP TO GET COVERED IN THE REAR ROOM HERE BEHIND US CONGRESSWOMAN NANCY PELOSI AND OTHER DEMOCRATS HAVE TEASED THIS IDEA OF A NEXT TENSION PAST SEPTEMBER. THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT ADDITIONAL STIMULUS PAYMENTS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE UNEMPLOYMENT. BENEFITS AND THE ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT. IT'S ALSO THE YOU KNOW THE CHILD TAX CREDITS. IT'S ALSO THE DIRECT CHECKS THE $1400 CHECKS IN THE $2000 CHECKS THAT ALL ADDS UP. IN TERMS OF INCOME FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO ACTUALLY GO BACK TO WORK, AND THEY WANT TO LIVE OFF THE GOVERNMENT. ARE YOU HEARING THAT THAT THERE'S AN APPETITE AMONG DEMOCRATS TO ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS DRIVING THIS GRAVY TRAIN GOING. I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR MANTRA. TOM IS THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO THROW MONEY OUT THE WINDOW. WE'RE GONNA PAY PEOPLE. I THINK YOU KNOW, I THINK PART OF THIS AS A POLITICAL CALCULATION THAT THE MORE MONEY YOU SEND TO PEOPLE, THE MORE PEOPLE LOOK FOR YOU. ON THE OTHER END OF THIS. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CASES. DON'T GET ME WRONG. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY DO NEED THIS THAT ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT FOR THE MOST PART. YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA COME FLYING BACK AT US. IT'S ALREADY STARTING RIGHT NOW, WHICH WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT HIS INFLATION. THE PRICES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SKYROCKETING. SO ALL THESE FOLKS HAVE ALL THIS MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS BY NEXT SUMMER, WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE IT TAKEN OUT OF THE LEFT POCKET IN THE RIGHT POCKET, RIGHT BACK TO THE DEMOCRATS AND TAX INCREASES. ANYTHING GOOD COMING FOR THAT? I SEE. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON AN INFLATION OBVIOUSLY MEANS THAT YOUR DOLLAR DOES NOT GO AS FAR AS IT USED TO. CERTAINLY DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTED JACKIE

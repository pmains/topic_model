thank you very much first of all let me thank you congressman Rourke forth lifting up my mother who was a phenomenal woman passed away last year who broke many glass ceilings and I want to thank you for recognizing what at rude she room she was and I just have to tell you I want to thank you also for your tireless advocacy on behalf of my hometown the place of my birth el paso texas on so many fronts but especially on behalf of immigrants I grew up in an immigrant community and i can tell you my mother my grandfather my sister's my brothers excuse me my brother-in-law's everybody from el paso consider you our representative and so thank you very much we're very proud of you i attended st. joseph's elementary school on waco avenue and we were taught that we must value the dignity of all human beings i was taught by the sisters of loreto in el paso and so now representing the beautiful East Bay of Northern California did my use and what I learned from my mother and my grandfather my parents in El Paso really drive me to continue our fight on behalf of our young people on behalf of our dreamers four years ago President Obama made history by announcing the deferred action for childhood arrivals this critical program provides and this is just common sense humane protections for undocumented Americans mind you who are brought to our nation as young children since the executive action about seven hundred and forty-four thousand young people have benefited from this important program and i'm proud to say though that now one in three dreamers in the united states are from my state of california these are brilliant young people who deserve the chance to live the American dream Dhaka empowers young people and keeps families together even in the face of Republican in action on comprehensive immigration reform now this is an issue that is dear to my heart as i said i grew up in el paso in an immigrant community and so I know no option I mean we have to protect our young people and keep families together more than a quarter of the residents now in my congressional district were born outside of the United States tens of thousands of young people have benefited from the daca program we sponsored a town meeting several weeks ago actually sponsored by oakland community organizations which is an affiliate of BP CO and it was an amazing town meeting everyone participated was multiracial it was held in the catholic cathedral and there's several stories i just like to share very quickly that we heard that night one dreamer and daca recipients let's call her amy and she was born in venezuela and immigrated to the United medaka opened doors for Amy she received her bachelor's degree at UCLA and then went on to obtain her law degree and this is really impressive through her hard work Amy became the first Dhaka recipient to be admitted into the California Bar I'm so proud of it she has taken her skills and experiences to give back to our community today she works at a non-profit in the east bay where she is an advocate for immigration reform and helps other young people benefit from the daca program but while she spends her days helping her community she still lives in fear in fear of her for her family and fear for her friends and fear of being deported at any moment I have another constituent let's call him Gabriel who I met recently at the same event not Gabriel was born in micro and immigrated to the United States ten years ago since then he has used his voice to empower his community and advocate for immigrants in high school he started a local dreamers Club advocating for the inclusion and advancement of undocumented students he went on to attend UC Berkeley and was able to receive funds to cover most of his studies through daca and state policies he was able to afford the high cost of living in the Bay Area and receive a world-class education he and Amy show the incredible potential of our nation's young people their determination to live the American dream receive a quality education and help their communities was really unlocked through daca it's terrible to think of the dreams that would be destroyed by rolling back Dakin out time and time again I hear stories like Gabriel's and Amy's stories of families who were kept together because of daca and of young people who are able to attend college and pursue their dreams huh these young people are afraid they fear that their families will be torn apart that their parents may be reported that their American Dream is truly in jeopardy we've always been a nation of immigrants this is a history that we should be proud of but right now we know that immigrants in my district and El Paso all across our nation are scared to death about what this next administration will bring their families who wake up in fear that come January 21st their work or their school will be rated there are dreamers who dread being forced to leave the country that they have ever the only country that they have ever known this is morally wrong the nuns who taught me at st. Joseph's would be shocked if they knew what was taking place now we're better than this these young people deserve better from our country they deserve better from this Congress so again I'm calling on my Republican colleagues to let us vote on bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation that will reunify families it will grow our economy and provide a clear pathway to citizenship and so I know yourself all of our colleagues are going to continue to fight for and to pass immigration reform the DREAM Act but minimally we've got to protect our nation's dreamers our immigrants and all families thank you again for your leadership thank you for inviting me to be with you tonight and again my family is very proud of you our congressman

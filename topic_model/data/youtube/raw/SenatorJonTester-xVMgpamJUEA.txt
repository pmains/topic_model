mr. president I rise today for one simple reason that reason is to tell this body to stop pointing fingers and start writing a budget that works for not only my state but every state in the Union it can be done it's been done many many many times before unfortunately this year our budget ran out on September 30th we had a CR that took us from the next day October 1st to December 8th and then when December 8th rolled around we had another continuing resolution CR to take us from December 8th to December 22nd and then when December 22nd rolled around we had another CR that took us from December 22nd to January 19th and that's where we are today because some of us said enough is enough we need to have a budget that works for this country here we are on day 2 of the government shutdown and this body can't even agree to pay our troops that's how dysfunctional we have become now we're using military men and women as political pawns because of the dysfunction we have here in Washington DC in the past we've always taken care of these folks because their servicemembers and their families have sacrificed much for this country but we continue to draw it out by the leadership of this body for political gain folks I talked to the rank-and-file folks think it's ridiculous both sides of the aisle and they think it's ridiculous that we've gotten here in the first place but the truth is is if we're going to give predictability and in the belly for our agencies to plan and the military to plan and the v8 a plan and our border security folks to plan and everybody else we need to have a budget that goes longer than a month-to-month there are three weeks to three weeks we need a budget that funds more than just chip and it's interesting that chip that could have been reauthorized months ago I did events in Montana talking about how important this was months ago I'm co-sponsoring a bill but it said on the leaders desk that could have been passed months ago but it was put in I guess is a sweetener but unfortunately using chip as a political pawn isn't exactly what I had in mind for the program program it's been around for nearly 20 years and served Montana's family so very very well but that's not the only program that we haven't funded we haven't funded our community health centers I heard the senator from Alaska talked yesterday about how critically the important er they are for Alaska well they're critically important for Montana I got a notion they're critically important for every rural state in the Union and probably every urban state too as far as that goes that needs to be taken care of in Montana where we have just over a million people a hundred thousand people depend on community health care for their community health centers for their health care then there's a thing called 340b not to get in the - weeds too far but this these are payments given the hospital's that hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and keep our hospitals open I had hospital administrators and former hospital administrators in my office over the last month telling me if this doesn't get fixed we're gonna lose hospitals in Montana once again taking work we access from regular folks that's not included in any of this and could have been done months ago there's been plenty of folks come to the floor and talk about opioids talk about pensions neither those are included in this there's no money for the borders southern border needs some attention northern border does too particularly the ports there's no predictability for our military defense secretary mattis has said that many many times things that are closer to home like rural ambulance services needs to be addressed isn't addressed and hasn't going to be addressed unless we push the envelope and get work to get things done here teaching health centers that allow us to have doctors in places around this country that can't get doctors critically important full Medicare coverage for physical therapists and occupational therapists we're gonna lose these folks if we don't have it special diabetes program for particularly for Indian country where diabetes is rampant needs to be addressed plus a whole lot more when I was in high school I debated for a couple years and one of the things that it was interesting during debate because you go through a debate and you'd hear the affirmative and the negative lay out their cases much in the same way as being done by the two leaders here on this issue and when you got done debating if one team was particularly behind her head they would say well they didn't make a case on why this is a good idea or they didn't make a case and the negative did not make a case and why their case should stand over the affirmative and I hear the same thing today when folks come to the floor and say people agree with everything that's in this well I don't because there ain't much in this we've been coming here for the last four months since the budget ran out the end of September and continue to kick the can down the road it's just how dysfunctional this body is because we can't do the basic thing that we were elected to do and that's past the budgets at the end of the year that and have it include the things that are so important to this country whether it be military or whether it be health care whether it be issues that revolve around Medicare whether it be issues that revolve around pensions we just don't do much and I think many of us are getting very tired of saying you know what we don't want to we don't want to put forth any excellence in this body we don't want to put forth any vision or any leadership we're just gonna do the bare minimum every day we need to stop Congress needs to stop with short-term solutions going from crisis to crisis that is no way to run a nation and I would tell you that most folks on both sides of the aisle would agree that's why we need to start working together to get this problem fixed because it's a problem the problem of three week or four weeks ER is the problem of not addressing the issues that are so critically important to working families and businesses in this country need to stop we need to work together I said yesterday we're being pulled apart by the far left and the far right and that's the truth and days gone past and Mike Mansfield day 70% of the work got done in the middle now we don't even do the basic of work today so I would say let's get together the truth is is the Republicans control the White House they control the house they control the Senate they control the agenda and they should they won the last election but that doesn't mean we shouldn't work together as Democrats and Republicans and most importantly as Americans to do what's right by this country so I would just ask that particular to the leaders both sides get together do the tough negotiations compromise and come up with a budget that works for not only Montana but for every state in this great country mr. president I yield the floor

kasie hunt as well on Capitol question for Republicans not whether they have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act they have a lot of plans it's whether they have a plan that can get 218 votes from party members Chris Collins is a Republican congressman from New York he is also a member of the president elects transition team here's what he said today we have six or seven different replacement plans we've talked about you know right from day one there's some common parts in that but we're going to have to over the next six months put that pen to paper and we're going to do it in a open process regular order through committees through hearings and when it comes to pass I'm confident we do it 218 but we don't have that plan in front of us today plan right now dr. are we Raul Ruiz as a democratic congressman from California before the election he was an MD specializing emergency-room medicine he provides a very unique perspective that's why we invited you to the congressman thank you so much thank you for having first of all let's start with that meeting take us inside that meeting with President Obama what did he say about defending the Affordable Care Act well you know it wasn't necessarily about defending the Affordable Care Act or his legacy it was about defending the American people defending my patients that I have seen and all of our constituents from East Coast West Coast and everybody in between from the harmful policies that the Republican Party want to instill repealing the Affordable Care Act will harm millions more than 20 million people who have health insurance will raise health care costs will put middle-class working families from across our great nation into financial ruin and that was the topic of conversation today did he help with with strategy you know I think that that we talked about the importance of telling stories and I'll tell you a story of a young man who had ultras ulcerative colitis first time in his life was able to get affordable health care and not be discriminated against the Republicans want to goes back to old failed policies where insurance companies will now discriminate against people with diabetes chronic pulmonary diseases I raised their their health care costs and even deny them health care costs and put back lifetime limits on what they will cover to benefit their profits and not the health and well-being of the American people what do you say to those who have criticized President Obama for not doing enough to defend the law from the beginning even Democrats who have said that that is one of the reasons that they lost both houses while he was in office well you know I've said from the beginning as a physician that we have to keep the good change the batting really ugly what's the bet you know that some of the bads could be the the health care costs that are out of control premiums were going up at a much higher rate than the Affordable Care Act but if we start pointing the blame into the Affordable Care Act for high premiums then we're not going to really look at the root cause and the root cause is the out of control health care costs Republicans want to take us back to a time where health care costs were even more out of control and that would only lead us to financial ruin because premiums will go even higher and that means that that they will have to own that and it will be on their shoulders now why the American people are going to be pay even higher premiums than before the Affordable Care Act what else would you support in terms of a fix well I believe for example one of my bills that I've introduced was to give small businesses relief in terms of the individual in terms of the business mandate individuals have the opportunity to claim economic hardship and be exempted from the individual mandate so to do I believe that small businesses who meet a certain set of criteria whether or not they will have to keep their businesses open whether or not they were going to be on the brink of declaring bankruptcy those small businesses should also be exempt from the the mandates that that they have Paul Ryan today as you know talked about a transition period that's the language that the speaker used vice president-elect pens he talked about an orderly strategy reading between the lines that what did you hear their strategy to be in terms of a replacement so they have no new plan they have old ideas that have failed and that caused everybody to take action with the Affordable Care Act what we are hearing is they them wanting to delay in order to evade the responsibility that they will have because even they know that repealing the Affordable Care Act is going to harm over 20 million people who have health insurance for the first time the medic the people that rely on the Medicaid expansions in even Republican states that now have health insurance for the very first time young people being able to stay on their parents health insurance women paying equal as men in the in their health insurance as well insurance companies not being able to discriminate against real people who have chronic health conditions you know this is we need to put front and center the human story of patients that visit the emergency department day in and day out congressman I mean you could argue that you guys have had the better part of late years to sell that part of the story seven years there last century we've suggested that that's one of the major reasons that Obamacare has become as unpopular as it is in large swathes of this country that of course the misinformation campaign yeah well I agree with you on that and and I think that from this point but we need to talk about the American people and this is the time that all those who have benefited the more than 20 million people across our nation in red states and blue states and east west coast and everybody in between need to call their representatives right now and their senators to express their anxiety about the fact that they're on the verge of losing their health insurance congressman and dr. Raul Ruiz congressman we hope you'll come back then

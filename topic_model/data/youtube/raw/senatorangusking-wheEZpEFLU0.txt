I want to talk about a different kind of hurricane a slow-motion hurricane a slow-motion hurricane that is sweeping our entire country not just the southeast it is sweeping through our small towns and our cities our families our schools and is taking lives of a scale that's unprecedented and almost unthinkable I'm talking about the hurricane the epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose deaths many of us this week are watching with rapt attention Ken Burns magnificent study of the Vietnam War we are losing more people per year to overdose deaths than we're lost in the entire Vietnam War that's one way to think about the magnitude of this catastrophe that's striking our country the problem is it strikes here and there it strikes a family here a family their community here a community there but it doesn't strike all in one place so it's not so apparent if we were losing a small city in America of 63,000 people once a year we would be turning ourselves inside out to solve the problem that was causing those deaths 63,000 people killed last year through overdose deaths almost 400 in my state of Maine more than one a day and all indications are that it's increasing one a day 63,000 is about seven people an hour 24 hours a day 365 days a year are succumbing to this plague and that's the right term for it it's a medieval plague it is afflicting people all over our country lives lost families torn apart communities compromised and it's a huge cost I hesitate to talk about things like dollars when you're also talking about lives but it is a cost in both ways not only our lives being lost and families being torn apart but the estimates are it costs our society something over 400 billion dollars a year in everything from medical cost criminal justice costs to lost economic loss productivity in our society in our economy but mr. president I'm here today because all hope is not lost contrary to what some people hear and you hear sometimes this is hopeless there isn't anything we can do about it there is ample evidence that treatment can work this is not a death sentence opioid abuse is terrible and from talking to people that have suffered from it it's it's it's literally changes your brain and it becomes almost impossible to escape but it can be escaped and the reason we know that is that there's data from across the country but the reason I know that is my friends in Maine Andrew Matt and Chris these are people that I know that I've interacted with that I've sat down with Andrews a guy who was at the University of Southern Maine he was trapped in the throes of addiction he went through treatment and now he's in recovery indeed there are 25 million people in this country who are in recovery and they'll tell you that they'll always be in recovery because they can never shake this disease whether it's alcohol but the really destructive one that we're focusing on right now is opioids Andrews made a new life he's at school he's at the University of Southern Maine he's helped form a student centered community to help people who are in recovery or who are working on getting there Matthew is a young man who in 2009 again was trapped by this horrible scourge now he's hoping to go to medical school chris is a guy that sat in my office he worked in the White House he was in it up to his neck and above he had criminal justice problems he was in jail he was convicted but now he's a member of the main bar he got himself through school he got himself through law school and there was an important moment that I think all of us should think about when we think about people that are in this situation when he went to apply to law school the people at the law school said well we don't know if we can take you because you have this record and his question was which was brilliant which indicates to me he's going to be a pretty good lawyer his question was what was my sentence when I was convicted the response was three years he said you're putting me in for life if you don't let me move forward with my life you're making that a life sentence not a three-year sentence he was accepted to law school he graduated and this year he was accepted past and was accepted in the main bar and he's making a contribution to his community treatment can work it doesn't always work the first time anybody that's been through this whether it's alcohol or anything else will tell you that it or even quitting smoking it doesn't work the first time necessarily sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't sometimes it'll take multiple trips through the recovery and treatment process but it can work we know it can work twenty I have 25 million reasons to tell you that it can work and three that I know I'm going to be introducing a resolution later today I hope the Senate can take it up and pass it designating next month as national recovery month honoring and recognizing the people that are in recovery so if it works what's the problem why is this hurricane still sweeping our country why does 2017 look like it's going to be worse than 2060 well the sad truth is that of all of those millions of people that are addicted that are stuck that are trapped only one in ten has access to treatment only one in ten now what we have to do to deal with this problem of course is like most other problems there's no single answer it involved law enforcement it involves interdiction and let me pause for a moment on interdiction the presiding officer and I are both on the Armed Services Committee and we've heard testimony in our committee that we only have the Coast Guard and naval resources to interdict one fourth of the drug shipments that we know of coming up from South and Central America by sea in other words we have intelligence we know of a hundred boats and we can only stop 25 there's no excuse for that so yes law enforcement at the source along the way in our states is an absolutely essential part of this process but it's not the whole answer we also have to work on prevention and frankly I've been talking to groups around Maine and around the country on this we're all still trying to figure out how to make prevention work what will work and I haven't yet heard a really strong answer to that question I guess it varies from person to person but prevention has to be part of it but treatment can work but if only 1 in 10 people have treatment available to them or have access to treatment that means 9 are sentenced to life and maybe to death we passed last year a year and a half ago Cara comprehensive addiction Recovery Act great bill lot of good things in it but no money that's like sending the fire department to the fire and saying fight that fire but we're not going to give you any water we know that this costs money and it's something that we have to commit to it has to be part of whatever we do around here about health care and about budgets we have to realize we're losing our people and these aren't bad people these aren't people over there i sat at a round table in in a small town in Maine South Paris Maine next to me was a deputy sheriff he'd lost his daughter this isn't these aren't strangers these are often middle-class people these are people who are whose kids or sometimes parents this is not age-specific are caught up in this scourge so I guess I want to leave us a day with two points one is treatment works and the second is we need more of it we know if we know that something works but only 1 in 10 people have access to it shame on us for not remedying that situation and to me the most tragic case and I've talked to people in Maine about this the saddest moment the most tragic case is when someone who's in the throes of opioid abuse is ready to ask for help and they have to be put on a waiting list that is tragic and inexcusable it's hard to get to that point it's hard to admit that you're trapped that you're no longer in control of your life once you're willing to do that and say I need help then it's up to us to be sure the help is there and that's what we're talking about today so this is a different kind of hurricane but it's a hurricane nonetheless that's destroying our families destroying our communities and wrecking the lives of our friends but it's no act of God we can't stop the winds of Maria or Emma but we can mitigate the effects ameliorate the effects soften the effects and that's exactly what we need to do for those or victims of the hurricane of opioids that's sweeping our country I hope and believe that we will respond to this challenge as we have at other times in our history and indeed as we are this week to the Hurricanes of the Caribbean I want to respond also to the hurricane that is sweeping America that we can indeed ameliorate mitigate and soften Thank You mr. president I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum

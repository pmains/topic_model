we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey everybody welcome back and we've got a very special episode today we have with us dr jonathan height he is a social psychologist at new york university's stern school of business i have been looking at dr heights work for quite a while his book the righteous mind why good people are divided by politics and religion is one of my personal favorites and one of his newest books the coddling of the american mind how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure that was also co-authored by greg lukianov these are excellent books i would highly recommend them and uh dr heights work on on moral psychology and as it relates to business ethics is is in incredibly illuminating he's also the co-founder of heterodox academy.org a collaboration among nearly 2 500 professors who are working to increase viewpoint diversity and freedom of inquiry in universities so uh dr hight thank you so much for being on the show well thanks so much dan please call me john john well i want to start with uh some current events so right now we are in the midst of the coronavirus uh economic lockdown and and and worldwide pandemic um and there you're gonna have an interesting perspective on this uh first of all because you were quarantined right yeah that's right that's right and um so go ahead oh just uh i i gave a talk at my old middle school i've i'm really interested in what's happening to american teenagers the rates of depression and anxiety so i agreed to give a talk at my old middle school where my the principal invited me back you know i graduated in 1978 and coincidentally scarsdale new york a town in westchester just north of new york city there was one coronavirus case you know a month ago it was one of the early ones and i happened to give a talk on you know and sit at the table with that very teacher so yeah i had to spend two weeks in in relative quarantine uh about three weeks ago you're okay now and um you know here's a very general question uh just just based on the approach that you generally take to problems how is america reacting and how does how is that tied to your research in moral psychology um yes well so the you know one of the big features of american politics in american society is that we have very rapidly rising political polarization since the late 1990s and the the key way to conceptualize that political scientists talk about polarization in a lot of ways but the key thing to keep your eye on is what's called effective polarization that is emotional polarization that is how much do you hate the other side and that has been rising steadily since the late 90s and that defines all the weirdness and awfulness of our of our current politics a lot of our weakness compared to other countries is that we hate each other so much that we interpret almost at least people are politically active a lot of the political class they'll interpret a national tragedy or a national challenge uh not in pragmatic terms how do we solve it but how can we blame the other side how can we profit from this for our side and that's exactly what james madison worried about in federalist 10 the founding fathers were so worried about faction that's the word they used a lot in those in the federalist papers because they knew and you know writing in the 1780s they knew that when men hate each other they lose sight of the common good and they think only how can i get advantage over my enemies and that opens us up to making it's a foreign influence anyway it's all in there in the federalist papers and in george washington's farewell speech and we're falling right into the trap so back to coronavirus um you're seeing that play out now exactly that's right so i guess what i can contribute as a psychologist is a social psychologist who studies morality is that there are three really deep interesting psychological systems that we inherit from our ancestors who faced threats to their survival constantly and so one is for an attack um our ancestors for hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years lived in groups that competed with other groups and when we're under attack boy do we come together that really happened after 9 11. so that's system number one it brings us together system number two is what do we do when there's a disease when there's a contagious disease and our ancestors have been suffering from contagious diseases forever and so we have all kinds of disgust at people who have sores or or pus or signs of illness and we move away from them so we have a contagion response and that drives us apart and then we also have a shortage response because our ancestors were hungry most of the time sometimes there'd be a lot of food most of the time there would be not enough and for sometimes for a month at a time there'd be none so we we have this hoarding response when we think there's a shortage so you put all this together and what we see is it wasn't really an attack by foreigners so we don't have that system going that brings us together but we do have the contagion and the um and the shortage mentality so that tends to both of those tend to drive people apart now given that i think we're actually doing pretty well so you know you see some of those reflexes but overall i think you know america there's a lot of stories of people helping each other um because the bottom line is that even though we're terribly divided it is still shared adversity we are all going through something together and that's actually an encouraging thing that we're actually going through this together with everyone in europe and people in asia it is kind of a global experience so it's very much in flux i think so far we've seen more much more positive than negative what do you think about it yeah it's gotten better that's what i would say uh my initial my initial observations were there was a lot of political opportunism um and uh i was i was very outspoken against that uh i think it's i think it's gotten better um but it's it's still there and frankly will probably never go away the next big battle is is going to be over what are the solutions from an economic standpoint what are the solutions and that should be a debate of course i mean i have different ideas than than my own republican colleagues and they have very different ideas than the democrats that's fine that's that that is what we're what our job is to debate those things what our job should not be is to be casting blame and then celebrating when things go wrong that's the real growth growth that's horrible part of it all yes and it's interesting that you use the word gross because i study discussed a lot of my early research was on the emotion of disgust and the fact that we have this disgust reflex for dead you know dead bodies and excrement we use the word disgust for all those things that smell bad but we also use it for a certain subset of motions and yeah when people take a national tragedy and try to make money from it or turn it to their advantage it is there's something gross about it you know it's um and this is jumping a little bit ahead when we talk about your book the righteous mind where you you you identify five pillars of of morality and one of those is that that sense of sanctity or or sense of disgust and um i i'm curious if you have a take on this which is um in america you know we know that the virus came from a combination of perhaps snakes and bats okay yeah these are things that we would never that we i don't think that i was ever taught not to like those things right i just it's that's just part of my that's just how i feel i don't i don't like them i don't want to eat those things so can can you talk about the the evolution of that like why is it that in asian countries they do and that's considered a delicacy but but here in america it's not oh boy that's yeah that's a fascinating question um i'll try to not be too professorial and luxury on this but uh that's why we brought you up okay all right all right so discuss is a really really interesting emotion because if you think about it as a defense of the mouth against pathogens against bacteria and things that they get into our digestive system make us sick it makes a lot of sense um so there's what we call core disgust which is a guardian of the mouth and it focuses on food and contaminants so it makes sense that rats um and cockroaches are disgusting whereas say bunny rabbits and ants are not particularly disgust they're not as as disgusting so things that are hanging around garbage piles they they are disease vectors they they brought germs to our ancestors so we're disgusted by them but snakes aren't like that yet they're creepy there's there's a bunch of different kinds of disgust there's subtypes of disgust and animals that don't fit neatly into any category um are some are often taboo so if you look around the world at traditional societies they almost always taboo some animals so i'm jewish the you know the hebrew bible has all kinds of taboos on animals that you must not eat most societies have have taboos and there was an anthropologist named mary douglas who observed that things that don't fit into a category are especially likely to creep us out they're especially likely to um to elicit taboo which is uh related to disgust and so if you think about it i mean snakes what are they you know they're they're actually vertebrates just like us and i think they have tiny little legs inside because they once had legs but you know snakes they move in a weird way so even though they're no disease threat um they have a special power and you see that it's not always negative they're very powerful in myths and in religions and then bats what on earth are those they're like mice that fly like what are they so it does make sense that bats and snakes would creep us out you know until you mention that i kind of forgot about the bats and snakes origin i don't know that the origin of it in disgusting animals translates all the way through to what we feel now it's an interesting hypothesis and i suppose if you if you pointed it out oh that would be a fascinating experiment you you ask people how creeped out they are by you know walking near a person who has a covid but then in half the cases you tell them covid a virus that came from you know snakes and bats versus covid a virus that came from you know an animal an animal market or something more general and maybe there'd be some residual disgust effect yeah i mean and i was wondering more of how is it that americans don't consider these things good things to eat but but other cultures do and and like you said it sounds like it's more of a it's just a traditional cultural issue because that you're right they they don't fall directly into those really gross things like a cockroach i mean god i can't even think about that yeah well no but okay so in terms of eating so um you know i think the rule is this that cultures vary in how food positive they are that is in america we are not very food positive what i mean is um any animal is kind of off limits or taboo unless it's a cow pig horse horse oops sorry you know cow pig chicken uh you know a couple others uh or fish we're very picky whereas um china is notoriously not picky and especially um so they in the french for example francis you know like the french for the french verse of the british were more british in our style the british found it disgusting that the french eat frogs uh and so they that was their term for them was frogs you know the french are frogs so we're more british in our in our uptight food sensibilities and the french and the chinese i think have have more fun with food so i want to go back to um because you mentioned madison and federalist 10 and the issue with factions and that that is applicable to today to today's conversation you wrote about that in your article in the atlantic um uh what year was that twenty the la the atlantic article where we i wrote about madison that was last november okay so fairly recently and that article is called the dark psychology of social networks why it feels like everything is going haywire uh it kind of feels like you could also write that right now and um and it would be a useful some useful lessons in there and what was interesting when i read that part about federalist 10 which was the the founders had had some security in believing that our sense of checks and balances would prevent an overly emotional faction from radically changing the direction of the country uh i think that is still true and i think it's unbelievably important frankly i don't think 51 of the population should be able to tell the other 49 what to do when people talking about packing the supreme court or removing the electoral college that worries me a great deal for that exact reason because ultimately what we're getting at is hey if we can just get to 51 we can tell the other side exactly what to do and that scares the hell out of me that's right and but the other thing you noted was that there the other reason madison wasn't so fearful of the factions was because it's hard it would be in in his time they could imagine a lot of things in the future i don't think they imagined the way we communicate so effectively with the internet and social media and so he thought to himself well it's too hard for people to communicate so quickly that they could that they could create a movement just like that of course we know that's not true anymore you can do that on social media and um you know so how does that pertain to today would you what would you rewrite from that article in that analysis today no that's right exactly that's that's the key section here to focus on uh in the in federalist 10. um so i've been i've been really interested in and why we're coming apart i've been studying rising polarization since around 2008 and i came across a quote from the federalist papers in a an estimated by princeton professor sam wang originally a couple years ago and really stayed with me uh let me see i can find it in our original in our article here um and it's um so the the basic the basic insight that is somewhere in the federalist papers is that there's a long section in federalist 10 where they talk about whether it's better to have a large rip a large republic or small one and uh because the founders a lot of people don't seem to realize this the founders did not particularly like democracy they read plato they read their what the history that they had available to them and there's a there's a line in there uh where madison says that um direct democracies have have ever been as oh shoot what is it as violent as violent in their deaths as they've been short in their lives something like that yeah and so they they deliberately set out to contain the explosiveness and the instability of democracy and so there's a section where they they meditate this one is written by madison he meditates on well you know actually being a really really large country because even though they were you know the 13 colonies plus whatever else they joined by then um it was very large compared to ancient greece or britain or anything else so you know if it's a very large country well um somebody might start a fire in one place or you know there might be some spark that ignites in one place but by the time the news of this gets from you know georgia to maine i mean it will have had so much time to cool down oh my god you read that and you think oh is that that's what we're depending on is the slowness of transmission and so uh and so that that was really the take-off point for this atlantic arctic which i wrote with my friend tobias rose stockwell who really understands the guts of social media and which i don't um but we teamed up write this article and it was uh you know i'll just share with you so the the metaphor that we used to open it because that's this has just been on my mind for years something has changed something is weird about american democracy and it's not just us it's happening in other countries too and it started around 2014 or 2015. so you can't blame this on donald trump it started before he he came on the scene and so the metaphor that we use in the article is suppose one day god was bored and he said just for fun let's double the gravitational constant you know i've been watching this universe spinning around expanding for 14 billion years i'm kind of bored let's just change a parameter let's double the force of gravity everywhere in the universe what would happen it would be instant chaos think you know planes would fall from the sky um clocks would start working incorrectly like anything that had movement would start screwing up and that's what it has felt like to me these last few years and so we try to say well what is that thing what is the thing that changed and the answer i didn't know this when i started writing this the answer is that social media fundamentally changed between 2009 and 2012. it's that specific it's not that social media is intrinsically bad you know originally facebook or the facebook was just like here's my page here are the bands that i like here are my friends that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but it's that when facebook added the like button and now you got a lot of information and people are training each other and twitter added the retweet button and now anything can go viral and then they both algorithmise they start applying algorithms and now everything everybody's trying to game the system and make their content go viral and outrage spreads outrage pays lighting a fire gets you attention and boy is this system set up to spread fires so that's our conclusion that um facebook uh social media and its original forms in 2005 through 2008 were not particularly toxic but between 2009-2012 they radically changed and they gave us a system that we think is very very bad for democracy that seems accurate to me as well just being in politics or it's right in front of me all the time um you know i probably tend to think it's worse than it really is uh i also read books like yours and they scared the hell out of me too so yeah um but it's one reason instagram recently took away they didn't take away the like button but they they made it so that you can't see it right yeah so you can't see how many people have you can't easily see you can still find out but it's not right there in front of you right and there i believe that was more for the teen mental health problems exactly so i'm i'm really concerned about two problems with social media one is the democracy problem we were just talking about in which it spreads outrage and undercuts trust in each other and institutions the other is the teen mental health problem because teenagers especially teen girls suddenly become a lot more depressed and anxious beginning in 2012 2013 and the rates just go up and up and they're still rising so yes facebook and twitter instagram i should say um you know i've spoken with the people there i do believe that they they care about this i do believe that they are looking for ways that they can make the platform more helpful and less toxic but they have been experimenting with um uh hiding the light counters that if a girl posts a picture of herself and nobody likes it she still is going to be embarrassed but at least her shame is not exposed to the whole world to see yeah and frankly i i can't see any reason to be against a policy like that um we're pretty much on the subject of your book the coddling of the american mind right now so we're just going to stick to that line of conversation um because uh one because it's a great book um and one thing you mentioned which is a lack of as you were just talking just now you said uh we're losing trust in our institutions in the coddling of the american mind you also talk about victimhood quite a bit um the sort of ideology of victimhood what it means what it doesn't mean social justice um one of one of the things that i observed again in my own writing is that this victimhood mentality has has led to the the lack of trust in our institutions because if you are a victim then you must have an oppressor and that oppressor might be somebody individually at first but then it has to grow it grows into a group and this gets into the identity politics this sort of group on group power dynamic but then that turns into institutions and and i worry greatly that we're it's one cause for us losing our institutions of course i didn't actually set up the book the coddling of the american mind so maybe you want to describe that too as you respond to what i just said sure yeah we will ease listeners into it um so the book begins when with the observation by my friend greg lukianov he's the president of the foundation for individual rights and education which has been arguing for free speech rights for college students since the 1990s and it's always been the case that administrators are wary of threats of legal liability they they don't want students to say something that could lead to bad publicity so they're often creating these free speech zones and say oh you can say whatever you want over you know in that corner of the parking lot or something well you know free speech zone i mean we have first amendment rights wherever we go so fire was created to push back on a lot of these regulations against college students and greg observed something very strange beginning in 2013 2014. now that will relate to the social media thing because you know but we didn't know it at the time we just knew that something weird was happening on college campuses beginning in 2014 which is that college students were for the first time they were the ones who were asking for the restrictions um greg came to me in in may of 2014 he came to see me said john something weird is happening we're finding college students asking that books be banned taken out of the syllabus requests for trigger warnings if a professor is going to speak about greek mythology there should be a trigger warning because the like almost all mythology there's there's rape in almost every mythology of every society it seems there there's sexual violence and some students were saying well you can't just have us read that without preparing us for it and a lot of us were like what what do you mean it's fiction it's it's literature anyway so greg was puzzled by this and greg thought greg noticed that the reasons that students were giving were the exact reasons that he had learned to stop giving himself when greg was treated for depression when he learned cognitive behavioral therapy so greg had a terrible depression in 2007 he nearly killed himself and when he was released from the hospital he learned a very powerful psychological technique called cognitive behavioral therapy where you learn to recognize that your thoughts are catastrophizing black and white thinking over-generalizing now these are all really bad habits of thinking they're exactly the sorts of things we should be weeding out on a college campus when we try to teach you to think critically but students were saying if this speaker if this conservative speaker is allowed to come speak on campus and spew his hate you know this will you know there will be bodies in the street there will be you know people will be marginalized and dead so it was catastrophizing and greg's theory was that somehow on college campuses we were teaching students to think in this way and i think his suspicion was like yours that that in certain parts of the university when they teach this victimhood culture if you teach 18 19 year old students to think this way you actually make them depressed you make them disempowered and that was the original working title of our book was disempowered and uh so greg came to this theory we wrote it up in an article for the atlantic in 2015 um and we couldn't really find strong evidence that students were depressed we were hearing stories about the rise of depression but there wasn't good data then so the article comes out in august of 2015 and for those of you listeners who are aware of the chronology you know um the when nicholas christakis when his wife at yale submits sent out a letter about halloween costumes there was this big blow up at yale students protesting over this letter about whether the university should regulate halloween costumes and the protests went national so our article came out in august and just a couple months later everything blew up and greg and i followed this and and we learned a lot more about it we realized wow it's not that colleges were making students depressed what we later learned is that gen z that is students who were born in 1996 and later were are the most depressed generation in history they're much more depressed than the millennials depressed and anxious and they began arriving on college campuses in 2013 or 2014 and things blow up in 2015. now there's a lot of other causes not just because gen z arrived it's not just it's not the student protests are not driven by depression i'm not saying that but there are a whole bunch of factors that came together and social media was one of them it was that change in social media so that anybody who claims victimhood anybody who wants to tell a story now can spread that story very very quickly and of course here what we're saying you know all of this is is pointing much more at problems on the left they're equivalent they're not necessarily symmetrical but social media has driven everyone crazy it's made everybody reactive and there are you know there are movements from the right as well that um you know that that have made it difficult uh on campus so i'm just saying it's like we're a moralistic species where we're quick to anger uh we're quick to judge and social media has made us all much quicker to judge without evidence and it's making it very difficult to run anything yeah that mob mentality is definitely made much easier uh by social media i've been a victim of it on the left and the right uh so so i i do agree must be doing something right yeah it's um it's a it's a different kind of problem on the right but it's it's similar uh um because you know because being a conservative i i obviously come with certain biases but you know i want to be honest about the overall arching problems of our culture um one one thing i wonder and what i think you found in your book was that this was mostly a problem on elite institutions on the coasts so it's really hard to argue that these kids are indeed victimized in a real sort of way i'm not saying they're not saying that their complaints aren't valid okay just for media matters when they listen to my podcast um i'm just saying it's highly unlikely um it's much more likely that that kids going to community college uh have actually had some real hardship in their lives and um it may actually have a victim story to tell and yet they're not the ones protesting they're not the ones feeling anxiety they're actually holding another job while they do classes and um taking care of their kid so that's right what the heck is going on here is there is there like a psychological need for us to to be the champion of the oppressed uh if we're not oppressed ourselves okay so there's there's a lot going on here um so the first thing is so let me bring in a concept from the righteous mind the righteous mind is based on three principles there are three principles of moral psychology so the first is intuitions come first strategic reasoning second meaning we're not really that rational we go with our gut feelings and groups are and political movements are very good at triggering those gut feelings the second principle is there's more to morality than harm and fairness now on the left they tend to focus on harm and fairness as the basis of morality on the right across countries what i found in my research is that conservatives tend to have a broader moral palate you might say conservatives of course they value fairness and care for for their children and the vulnerable but they also are seem more keenly receptive to issues related to group loyalty respect for authority and traditions and a sense of sanctity or purity so that's the basic left right split over most of our culture works and we'll get more into that just for the listeners we're going to get more into that uh as soon as we're done with the conversation about cuddling the american life okay but but people on the left especially when when they reduce morality down to a focus on care um care for the vulnerable well what could be wrong with that you know you'd think caring for the vulnerable that boy that could only be good but as aristotle told us long ago any virtue carried to extremes becomes a vice so if you have a moral community in which you're totally focused on the vulnerable the victims and you're willing to get rid of everything else nothing else matters rights don't matter uh you know authority tradition none of this matters all that matters is is the victims that we're caring for well then your movement is coherent in a way and you all circle around that sacred value um but if you're circling around a sacred valley you kind of go blind you kind of lose sight of a lot of other things that matter and that's something that has it can only happen when you have a bunch of students all living together and creating their own moral matrix so like the movie the matrix which is defined as a consensual hallucination if you're students up at middlebury college in central vermont you have a bunch of 18 to 21 year old generally you know wealthy left-leaning left-leaning students sequestered in the woods in central vermont they can invent a fantastical moral world and live in it and in that world everything is racist everything is oppressive everything is whatever it could be anything whereas if you're a community college student uh you know in in detroit or or phoenix and you go home to your parents your grandparents at night and you just take classes during the day there's no way you could create a fantastical world everybody would laugh at you um and so if you start saying i you know i need a trigger warning because uh you know somebody we were assigned the great gatsby and there's a scene there's a scene where you know i forget what the character's name is he punches the woman in the face like well i can't be expected to to read that that's violence against women like everyone's going to just laugh at you so so that's why it only happens at residential colleges that are fairly um fairly non-diverse ideologically and so that's why it's in the northeast and along the west coast now there's also some in the midwest like oberlin college and some in chicago so if you look at where speakers are being shouted down and where there was actual violence there wasn't a lot of violence but where there was it's almost all in the northeast or right along the pacific coast like in uh there's a bunch in washington state and oregon yeah yeah i would say i wonder if there's a lack of perspective too because i mean the the difference i pointed out was some people have had real hardship in their lives and some people have have really haven't just relatively speaking yeah and does does that play into to how you react to these sort of microaggressions well in general facing hardship makes you tougher uh like you know it's like the princess and the pea if you've been spared from hardship then you know somebody putting a pee 20 mattresses down you're gonna you can't sleep on such an uncomfortable bed so there is a bit of that but i would i would actually i'm developing a way of thinking about this i'm trying to develop a way of explaining it so i'll give it a try here um if you think about what we find intolerable or what we find offensive in in our group or our community there are two things to look at one is some degree of actual reality so if we take racism so you know how much racism is there at yale and how much racism is there at say auburn you know in alabama um and um you know if you were to count up the number of racist jokes or or something some measure if you've got some objective measure my guess is there'd be a lot less at yale just the nature of the culture is very anti-racist so my guess is there's less but that's only one piece of the puzzle the other thing is what is the social construction of reality what is the moral matrix that we live in and if you have a moral matrix that is so anti-racist that it is really focused on finding microaggressions on interpreting any outcome difference as um as a as a uh caused by structural racism um so i mean these are useful terms i'm not saying that there's no meaning to those terms right but what i'm saying is the the the framework that you use to understand can get anti-racist faster than the reality so even though yale surely has less racism it could be the case that that a black student or an lgbtq student at yale might find it more offensive than one you know somewhere in the deep south which doesn't which isn't so focused on on on fighting racism and science they see it they see it wherever they look and they also that you know it's like thomas sowell's book discriminations and disparities or maybe it's disparities and discriminations but the point is is that nobody's asking the question is there a disparity with with a good logical reason behind that or is it true discrimination is there a true injustice happening here are we defining the term justice correctly uh you're right about that that's right exactly that's right that's that's it that's the question to ask so all americans support justice everybody does and there is a version of justice here which is very widely supported which is equal opportunity and so if you're talking about on the left or the right everybody supports equal opportunity although the left and the right tend to differ on how much should the state helped equalize starting conditions and that's a legitimate political debate you know how much should we equalize spending on education those are all legitimate debates between left and right um but yes there's a there's a shifting definition of justice on some parts of the left where they've shifted recently to not equal opportunity which is deeply american but to equal outcomes which is not deeply american that is the idea that the state needs to guarantee that we all end up with the same amount i don't think there's any trace of that in the founding fathers or in lincoln um it's pursue your happiness not not happiness it's pursue your happiness that's right you are that's right you're guaranteed that's your word yeah that's right uh and so there is this shift which i think leads to a lot of conflict because if you insist on equal outcomes well that means that people who work harder and achieve more must be stopped uh that would be unfair to let them end up with more um so i'm not saying that this is this is generally what the left believes it is most most people everywhere in america believe in equal opportunity and that you should reward hard work but at least on college campuses you get you get uh there's a sort of well i guess you could say the like more the bernie sanders left you get you know the left right now is divided between more like the joe biden you know more moderate barack obama left um you know like as bill clinton said it was a very winning formula for him it was you know if you work hard what was the formulation i believe if you work hard and play by the rules you should get ahead yeah uh and that's you know that conservative could say and the conservative could probably say that as well yeah that's right that's deeply american and i think most democrats believe that but there is a movement on the left that is much more of like a european style you know egalitarianism that says if it doesn't if it's not equal outcomes then it's then it's racism or sexism or something right then exactly and that that's the key point there is the is the redefinition of the word justice and this notion that if there is a different outcome then it must be due to an injustice uh one of my favorite examples from again the thomas soul book uh is is his example of of of children who are first born so first born children uh if you if you look at their outcomes dramatically outperform uh their siblings and who knows why um but but the point is is they're more likely to be a member of congress they're more they're more likely to to be an astronaut i mean dramatically more likely it's it's it's not a small statistical difference and so you have to ask the question if and and he asked that question which is if we can't expect the same outcomes from people who had almost the exact same life then how could we be so sure of the same outcomes for everyone else and this gets to the second moral pillar um that you brought up earlier which is fairness which we all agree that there's we the fairness is a part of our our moral compass the the question is how how do we define that fairness and um yeah i think in your in your book the the um the now i'm just drew a blank here the righteous righteous mind yeah in the righteous mind you draw a distinction between proportional fairness and in you know egalitarian fairness and that's an important that's right that's right yeah that that if you so you know one resolution of this is to go deep psychologically and say what what's that what are the tools in our head that that we use to judge fairness and so in the book with greg lukianov we we go into how um there's distributive justice and procedural justice and they're a little different but as long as you perceive that people are getting in proportion to what they're giving and so uh you know people if people work harder or or produce more of value should end up with more rewards that's proportionality and then procedural justice is the process is fair nobody's been able to bribe it or or tilt it in their favor everybody got their say and so as long as you have a system that produces both procedural and distributive justice well that's pretty darn good and at that point you'd have to say the system is fair so that's that's a kind of fairness that i think is widely supported and any political party that goes against that any political party that says no fairness is um equal outcomes and so we use the example in the book of the uva men's crew team i used to teach at the university of virginia i really loved teaching there and the every fall we would get flyers in our mailbox from the i thought it was the men's crew team but i didn't realize there is no uva men's crew team it was the virginia men's rowing association something like that and the reason there's no crew team is that title ix which began with good intentions to create equal opportunity for women in sports was reinterpreted in the 1990s to require equal outcomes in sports and so if a university has a lot more young men on its sports teams than young women well that can't be right that must be sexism and so the justice department began enforcing this or putting pressure on schools that they were at risk of prosecution or of of investigation if they didn't have the same number of men and women and if they didn't spend the same amount now you can't possibly spend the same amount on women's sports if you have a football and basketball program because those are hugely you know there's vast amounts of money there but they had to do what they could to push off any men's sports teams that were sort of marginal and to ramp up including with forgery uh the rosters of of women's sports so there's a lot of dishonesty that comes when you try to you know the system to achieve to make it look like you have equal outcomes well this whole time yeah so just the point is just that it was just unfair that the uva uh if you were a young man and you wanted to row crew you had to do yard work uh for professors and everyone else in order to raise the money to buy your boats whereas if you were the women's crew team um everything was paid for and you know they were thrilled to have you because they they wanted to get more women rowers so you know that's the point is just most of us believe that you should treat individuals fairly not groups that you shouldn't you shouldn't make individuals pay or treat them badly to achieve some sort of cosmic justice as as thomas sowell puts it yeah and that conversation about men and women sports has become infinitely more complicated than uh since since even i think you you wrote about that crew team because and now the debate is over whether uh men who identify as women can be on a women's sports team yeah and is that fair i mean that's a deep moral question is that fair i would say no it's not fair of course it's not fair um yeah you know you can't you just can't do that um yeah that topic that's one that is so taboo i i long ago made a resolution that i would just never even talk about it there are certain taboos it's just yeah nothing good can come from me talking about that yeah i can but uh okay but i won't press you on it then the uh and we don't have a lot of time left so i want to move on to the righteous mind um one of my favorite books uh the leadership institute which um you know it's it's actually they they were it's required reading um oh cool yeah it's uh and the reason it and that's for for conservatives right they they train conservatives now your book is not written for conservatives by any means uh in fact i wrote it for liberals yeah exactly you you were you wrote it because you thought democrats needed to be talking about moral morality in a more coherent way and so i guess i'll just let you take it from there i mean how did this book start and let's let's review those those five pillars once again what they mean and uh well i'll let you take it from there yeah sure yeah so i um i was always on the left from the time i was in college i went to yale as an undergrad i grew up in new york area and i ran a gun control group and i was a pretty prototypical you know left-leaning progressive um throughout my 20s and 30s and but you don't really identify as a staunch conservative now just to be clear right oh no i'm not you know i'm not a conservative i'm uh i'm on no team i'm a social scientist and i think that social scientists who study this stuff um should really try to be non-partisan we really should not be on teams if we're studying the nature of these teams frankly so i'm i'm um i'm non-political it doesn't mean i don't have views about political issues i do and and uh but but i'm i don't work for any team i don't um take money or consult for any team i just wanted to make that but i started the book so you know in 2000 i couldn't believe that george w bush won and i thought al gore should have won and i you know i blamed it on al gore i mean that he you know he he um was very he didn't make good moral arguments and he kept saying you know my plan will put money in a lock box and it was it was all about appeals to self-interest and american religion at the local level is a lot about self-interest but at the presidential level it's more like a religion and and i thought that the that the republicans especially since reagan have been much better at appealing to that that sort of religious sense of american-ness and what's special about america shining city on a hill with a role to play in history and that that divide has gotten even more pronounced since then if if if i were to make an observation it's uh well i would say that um that you know reaganob was the best at it um clinton could do it at times he writes the occasion right and and obama could also really do it you know and i don't think that president trump has you know he's had moments here and there but uh he really but those seem to be moments that his speech writers wrote for him i think he's been very bad at this especially in times of national crisis um but anyway so i um i wrote uh so i was i i was upset that uh you know al gore had no idea how to talk about american morality the democrats had no idea and then when bush won again in 2004 i thought i can't stand this john kerry also had no idea how to talk about this so i'm going to actually start using my research to help democrats make better moral arguments and if i was a professor at uva and i now see that i think this that's inappropriate like i should not have i should not have used my professional abilities to help one political party i mean it's certainly a legal thing to do but i think it's a violation of professional ethics at least now i think that but that's what i set out to do originally my research and and i gave a ted talk on this laying out um my research and around that time i signed a deal to write a book and which became the the righteous mind and to write the book i committed to really understanding conservatives i had spent some time in anthropology with my postdoc advisor at the university of chicago richard schweiter and i and i really admired anthropologists who just can immerse themselves in someone else's moral world and interpret it for us that's what i set out to do and actually beginning around 2004 or five i began watching fox news subscribe to national review talking to conservatives whenever i could and what i found is that i learned things i saw things i'd never thought of that you can't understand anything complicated until you get people to criticize your views i learned so much i began to really love listening to conservatives and and reading their ideas and that's when i found thomas soul conflict of visions that book boy is that book powerful i signed that my uv in my uva classes and at that point in a sense i stepped out of the matrix that is i i um i sort of dropped the partisan stuff like i've got to help the democrats win it was more like oh my god our country is coming apart and we're all lost in illusion and we don't understand each other and so the book very quickly became not a partisan book but a book about how to understand and be more tolerant it doesn't mean you have to accept everything but but don't demonize the people that's the main thing don't demonize the voters on the other side try to understand they're your fellow citizens and they surely are right about some things that you can't even imagine so that's what the book did to me so i'm glad to hear um that that it's it's assigned to conservatives it tends to be popular center left center right libertarians and actually religious people i find a lot of evangelicals mormons um like it um it's very it's unpopular on the far left and i suppose on the far right maybe people don't know it i don't know but uh but i'm glad to hear that that you found it useful yeah i don't think it's unpopular anywhere on the right um they probably don't know okay perhaps but to your point the um the reason it's popular among conservatives is because i i think it it clarifies and i think the the the study of psychology in general clarifies kind of what we already know but it puts it into terms that that we can then explain and and formulate and i think i think that's an important thing that that psychology as a as a as a general academic study does it's one of the reasons i enjoy the study of psychology because it kind of tells you what you already know about yourself and your interactions sometimes it tells you stuff you really didn't know but oftentimes it just helps you it helps you articulate it and um conservatives know why they know they're wired a certain way and they feel a certain way but they're but oftentimes they're unsure how to articulate it liberals have a much easier time articulating it because it really is about caring and fairness about fighting injustice right they can they can they can rattle that off very quickly and so i spend a lot of time reading books like yours trying to articulate exactly why we are as conservatives why we are the way we are and your book does that um in a very clear way at least at least for the moral foundations aspect of it which by the way leads to everything else i often extrapolate policies from your moral foundations to help people understand where we're coming from like why did i arrive at this is it because i'm a bad person do you really think i'm a bad person or do you think maybe that we do operate off a broader scent of more broader set of moral foundations and so if you could just repeat what those are real quick and maybe and then let's dive into them for the limited time we have okay sure um so the so the idea of the moral foundations is that cultures vary in their morality but it's not random like you if you read profiles of other societies they're doing things that are kind of similar to what we do but also kind of different and so what i did was uh with craig my friend craig joseph we we read through a lot of anthropological literature and we noted what are the kinds of things you see all over the place and then we read through the evolutionary literature what are the theories that are out there about how human nature evolved and so a good example is care where mammals we have this attachment system that makes us very sensitive to the suffering of our own offspring but we apply it to other offspring and other things that are cute like puppies and kittens so we have clearly something built in that makes us responsive to suffering especially when it looks like a suffering of a child and that's a foundation of morality you find it all over the world some moralities can sort of say well that's not so important like the spartans or the nazis or other there are other moral systems that prioritize strength and that and that made weakness or compassion into it they made compassion and weakness but those are very rare so um so you know care is is a is a universal aspect of just being a mammal and it becomes a part of our morality um fairness or reciprocity or exchange you find this in every society and there's a lot of evolutionary thinking about you know playing tit for tat or being able to trade favors and insults group loyalty is the third foundation we evolved in groups and those groups were always competing with other groups and so we hate people who are disloyal who betray us authority versus subversion is the fourth foundation we're hierarchical like most primates chimpanzees and gorillas many other primates have hierarchy and there are they're we're very sensitive to proper behavior um you know if you're too informal with one of your superiors other people might be shocked unless it's a very egalitarian culture in which case they might not like you being too formal with others so there's some variability but we all have within us the capacity to recognize respect for authority and then the last one is sanctity or purity versus degradation and it's the idea that some things have a sacred essence it doesn't make sense materially it's not practical and we can see that most clearly obviously with the religious symbols and so there was an artist andre serrano who had these famous photographs of piss christ it was a crucifix submerged in his own urine and the image is actually quite beautiful because it glows a golden yellow i mean it's visually beautiful but it's disgusting to think about and for some people especially on the left who didn't take the the the crucifix seriously um you know it was an interesting mix of aesthetic reactions and that's great art um but for many it was deeply offensive you can see it with the flag you know is the flag just a piece of cloth well for many on the left it is just a piece of cloth but especially for those who've been in the service or prefer conservatives more generally no it it stands for the country it it should be protected from touching the ground so um we treat it with a kind of a a kind of a religious sensibility and what i found in my research in the united states in particular is that the left right split that we've had um recently this was not true in the you know 100 years ago but the left right split since the new left of the 1960s has been much more um sort of social conservatives in one party increasingly in the republican party and social progressives in the democrat democratic party and if it's it whenever there's look at any culture war issue and if you just keep your eye on those three foundations of loyalty authority and sanctity um those are the ones that conservatives build more on they they care more about than progressives do that's not the key to the culture and it's not that they care more about them than caring and fairness it's just that they're about equal right it's like conservatives look at all of the foundations uh about the same right the way we we derive some morality from all five but liberals just the first two yeah to be a little more specific because in terms of the scores on our scale yes what you say is true and so if your listeners go to yourmorals.org just y-o-u-r-m-o-r-a-l-s yourmores.org they can take our moral foundations questionnaire and they'll they'll see their scores in the foundations and then yes what you said is true the scores will be fairly similar across the five foundations now if you actually look at daily life how much of daily life is about group loyalty versus fairness not much that is daily life is much more about fairness when we're dealing with strangers and other people well and siblings have two kids they're always fighting about what's fair um so fairness and care tend to predominate um it's really when when you look at political disagreements fairness tends to be still the most important but that's where you you tend to get more left right difference over over loyalty authority sanctity the other interesting thing that you do on that website was you you have people take that survey and i guess they self-identify as a liberal or conservative and then you ask them to answer how would somebody on the other side of the aisle answer that question if you're a conservative how would a liberal answer that question so what were your results from that okay um it was that um yeah so we did this study and we invited people to take the survey and one-third were assigned to pretend that they were um a liberal and one-third were assigned to pretend that they were a conservative and one-third were assigned to just take it as themselves and uh and what we found is that sent people who come to the site and say that they're a centrist they're the most accurate conservatives were pretty close they were the next most accurate um liberals were less accurate and by far the most inaccurate were the people on the far left so on a seven point scale it was really the people who say that they are very liberal they're the ones who were least accurate in guessing what conservatives would say yeah and the way we interpret it is if you're a conservative and you grew up in the united states you know what liberals think you can't it's forced on 21. well yeah i mean if you've seen how you know you've seen hollywood movies you've you know you can't possibly unless you unless your parents shelter you in the basement you can't possibly not know what liberals think but if you grow up you know as i did in the suburbs of new york city or if you're in san francisco a lot of places um you could reach adulthood and have no idea what conservatives think i've met many of those adults yeah that's right so yeah so yeah i do think that uh the the the right tends to understand the left better than the left understands the right yeah in my own personal experience that's absolutely true i'm amazed by my conversations sometimes when there's a well when there's a very well-intentioned liberal who genuinely wants to understand how i think to to watch them to watch them listen to me and that they've truly never heard anybody articulate or formulate uh the conservative reasoning before and it kind of baffles me because i know exactly what their response to what i'm about to say is i know exactly what it is and i predict it 100 at the time um now granted i went to liberal universities whatever i guess i lived in the bubble um why here's here's a question i want to be respectful of your time so you can cut me off at any time yeah we'll have to stop in five minutes but let's yeah this is great let's keep going so well then here's a final question which is why does it matter which moral foundations we care about as it pertains to structuring a society and and i would guess as it pertains to the sustainability of a society so does it matter that liberals only really focus on on caring and fairness and and why should we care about all five yeah so here's in a funny way we can actually appeal to a lot of what gets written about diversity and the benefits of diversity um so um you know like i'm i'm on the big five personality like i'm an introvert high unconscientiousness um you know relatively low on neuroticism would i want everyone to be like me no of course not be a weird society if we all had the same personality and just as we'd like to talk about the benefits of a variety of kinds of diversity um i think there's a there is some benefit to moral diversity now of course if we really don't have similar morals at all it's hard to have a coherent polity a coherent you know we need to have some some things in common yeah but if you look at it this way um if if you assume if you accept what i say in chapter 11 and 12 i review the evidence on how politics and morality is actually pretty heritable and you know if you have an identical you know you dan if you had an identical twin and you're separated at birth my guess is that that identical twin would be a conservative too uh even if raised in a different family um our temperaments lead us to prefer one side of the aisle the other but think about it like this would you want the military and the police the people who go into those fields to be the same as the people who go into advertising and mathematics and art there are different virtues and and different professions um require different virtues and for one side of the aisle for one side of the political spectrum to say everybody should have our virtues and only our virtues that would be so self-destructive so i think that that moral differences can be productive if they play out within a circle in which we either respect each other at least grant each other basic legitimacy and decency and i think that's where the greatest generation had a that you know why we think of that as the greatest generation is going through world war ii together they were bound together so tightly that when there were differences they never questioned whether the other people were still americans they had that experience that that kept them all in the same circle and then they could have their disagreements and if you know famously ronald reagan and tip o'neill could you know argue bitterly during the day and then have a drink together at night and so i guess we can end on a hopeful note like this which is to say our democracy is fraying the things the bonds holding us together that were so strong in the mid to late 20th century with after world war ii and the cold war those bonds are weakening social media has weakened us we our country has a lot of problems okay now i said i'd be optimistic this what we're going through now what we're going through now with the coronavirus is the greatest degree of shared adversity we have had since the second world war i think um you know there have been brief things here and there but you know 9 11 certainly brought us together but this is going to go on a long time and this shared adversity really it seems to i think it will bring us together and um if if we can have more a sense that we need each other that we're all in the same boat then we could return to a time when our moral and political differences are not reasons to write each other off they're not reasons to hate each other there are things that will always cause puzzlement and conflict but but sometimes puzzlement in conflict can can even be healthy and so that's my hope that we'll at least get back get back to that somewhat because our democracy has been in a sense running outside of its bounds outside of healthy parameters for a number of years now i think that's uh i i think that is a good helpful understanding as to why you need a diversity of moral understanding one thing i point out to conservatives is that we wouldn't necessarily be better off if there were no liberals okay liberals do a very good job of pointing out some of these injustices and now again they changed they changed the definition on us quite a bit but sometimes we should listen and the problems they're pointing out as it pertains to a sense of fairness or injustice or a sense of caring or maybe things that we wouldn't have seen and they need us to i think i think solve those problems responsibly because we do care about those other moral foundations like a sense of authority and rule of law a sense of in-group loyalty i think that i think that matters quite a bit when you're talking about sovereignty or borders or just you know some of these bases some of these more basic discussions i i think i think we i think we find a lot of value in in caring about that symbol of the american flag and the pledge of allegiance and the national anthem and what that does to us as a country and actually viewing it as as something that is that has a sense of sanctity and i think that's good so in that sense we do need that's right that's right and what and what you're articulating there is is the understanding that i got from reading edmund burke who's one of the obviously one of the patreon philosophers of modern conservatism that you know burke did not say we should not change we should always cling to what is old but he said we should change carefully you know one should i i mean this is a paraphrase but you know one should operate on society as one would operate on one's own father uh you know you do you know you do have to change you do have to uh to do things but you you you have to be careful and i think um since the french revolution uh progressives have been gung-ho charged everything's terrible let's change it and conservatives have been saying not so fast let's not burn everything down uh and uh so yeah the french revolution didn't end so well but let's hope we're uh let's hope we're in we're in better we're certainly in better balance now i'd like to think so and we could talk for another hour but i know you've got to go i really appreciate your time jonathan uh it's been it's been really fascinating again i'm i'm a huge fan so it's an honor to have you on oh well thank you dan so what an honor to be in to be uh interviewed by you to be interviewed by a congressman and a person who's given so much to this country i really appreciate it well have a great day and stay healthy thanks you too dan

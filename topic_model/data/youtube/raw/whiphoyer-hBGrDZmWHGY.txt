now my understanding Ways and Means Committee has been told this bill is going to be marked up on Wednesday there will not have been a single hearing there will not have been a single witness and members cannot on our side of the aisle as I understand it see the bill today I don't know where all my tea party friends are who demanded full consideration and that everybody read the bill I don't know I don't see them out on the lawn I don't see them out on the plaza I don't see him out on the sidewalk as they were when we were considering the bill and we had those hundred eighty-one witnesses the hundred hours of hearings that they thought worth sufficient I don't know whether they'll think that having a markup next Wednesday when the bill has not even been made available to Democratic members of the House apparently Republican members have to go to a room to see it and the public clearly has no idea of what that bill is mr. later I hope you will tell me that I'm wrong that there will be hearings consistent with what speaker Ryan said three days ago I hope you will tell me yes we're going to honor what speaker Ryan said that we're going to have those hearings we're going to have witnesses we're going to consider amendment all of us understand that this is one of the biggest issues confronting the American people we have had hundreds of thousands of people showing up at town meetings saying how concerned they are and yet if my information is correct leader they will have no opportunity to talk to the Ways and Means Committee I am further informed and i hope the majority leader says this is wrong that the markup will look for the congressional budget office has the opportunity to say how much it's going to cost all this weeping and gnashing of teeth about balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility a bill that affects eighteen percent of the gross domestic product and the critical need for people to have access to affordable quality health care not one of them will have an opportunity to know how much this repeal will cost again mr. Lita I hope you're going to be able to tell me no mr. whip we're going to have hearings we understand how important this issue is how much interest there is in this country and we're going to give time for serious consideration and we're going to have witnesses come before those earrings and then after the witnesses we're going to have a markup after substantial debate and consideration is allowed on both sides of the aisle I now yield to the majority leader with the hopes that he will be able to give me some degree of confidence that Paul Ryan our speaker was correct that we're going to follow regular water and make a transparent consideration of this piece of legislation I yield to my friend well I think we gentleman for yielding I always look forward to your quotes they're always quite interesting now it's gone beyond you know

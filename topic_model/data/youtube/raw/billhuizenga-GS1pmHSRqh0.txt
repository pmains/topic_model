folks it's clear too many in washington do not believe that we have a spending problem tonight we heard the president call for more spending and higher taxes essentially the same agenda he's been following since he first took office in 2009. for each of the past four years the federal government has run a deficit greater than a trillion dollars these deficits are not because americans aren't taxed enough they exist because washington is not delivering efficient and effective government programs just this week democrat minority leader nancy pelosi said quote it's almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem end quote our kids and our grandkids will have to deal with the 16 trillion reasons why you're wrong mrs pelosi even the obama administration has acknowledged spending is a problem and hopefully for the first time in four years the senate will even pass a budget what's misguided about the president's proposals is that they're based on past rhetoric of a balanced approach which is really code for tax increases and fails to address the real issues which is reckless and out of control spending house republicans are again finalizing the nuts and bolts on this year's budget our goal is to balance the budget in the next 10 years many of you want us to get there faster and frankly i do too but we didn't get into this fiscal crisis overnight and we won't get out of it immediately either i for one am prepared to make the tough decisions necessary to get america's fiscal house in order regardless of the consequences but we need willing partners on the other end of the capital as well as the other end of pennsylvania avenue thanks and have a good night

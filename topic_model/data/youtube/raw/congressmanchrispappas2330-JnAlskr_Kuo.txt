hi everyone i'm here at the portsmouth senior center we've got a tour of a vaccination site that's staffed by the portsmouth fire department and it's a great community effort to make sure that we're delivering vaccines at the community level so really want to thank the chief and everyone who has put this effort together in the city of portsmouth hopefully over the next few months we'll see even more people coming through this site and other sites all across the state stay safe

4k a day at 8 a.m. 11 a.m. 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. here on Newstalk 780 K rich folks as we begin this Monday it becomes more frightening I think on a daily basis to observe the Bill O'Reilly would call it the spin zone in action over the weekend it was reported in multiple places with a headline very similar to this one mark Amodei becomes first House Republican to publicly support impeachment I'm sorry she's like oh my goodness they've turned him what do we do vote for Bernie that's what we should do right so the question that's the perception that they're selling it says how the spin works so the congressman was speaking with reporters last week and the question of appeasement of course came off so look what we all want to know of course is did he or didn't he say he supported impeachment and I'll let him answer for himself because congressman mark amity is here this morning there you go stirring the pot again man said that thing about Paul Ryan not coming back and so I'm not greedy for national attention but once in a while you know it's appropriate you can't be terribly surprised though and how they immediately spun that and and what was interesting as I saw a number of articles and I got a couple of emails to or people say oh how can a man they do this as if nobody else did virtually everybody else supported this including the White House right well the it is the resolution that said use regular order with the whistleblower complaint and that means you sent it to the Senate intelligence folks and the and the house intelligence folks for them to go through their committee process and see what they produce so there was a resolution that passed through unanimous consent last week in both the Senate and and the house oh and by the way the White House supported that resolution so during the interview and by the way I think the Nevada media that participated in the interview basically did a pretty fair job of reporting it what most people didn't realize is the word inquiry in DC has now become synonymous with I support Nancy Pelosi's let's refer to six committees in blah blah blah now where it's like I just thought inquiry met inquiry you know and so if that's a mistake then fine all owned up to that but multiple times during the interview I refer to the fact that it was unanimous consent in both houses the White House supports it I support looking into it in regular order let's quote follow the rules unquote and so from that somebody basically saw inquiry in one of the articles and went so I guess my timing was bad maybe if I'd have done that press conference today instead of Friday there'd be other stuff going on but it was like so now it's like a Maday is the first republican which is hilarious I know because I'm getting criticized by some of the like indivisible folks he votes with the president 98 percent of the time you know I've been with him since the Billy Bush stuff never wavered and so it's like now all of a sudden I miss my opioid dose or something yeah and I've totally and but but what's and it shouldn't be surprising but it's like people like instantly like oh my god and any needs to be basically it's like trying to go steady I guess with some people in the third grade it's like it's tough to keep that stuff going you know but it is probably one of the better examples we've had recently of how the spin zone works and I got an email from from someone over the weekend couple of them as a matter of fact but one of them in particular immediately you know lambasting how could he do this he's catering to the Liberals and all of this stuff and I wrote back as it will do your homework he was not the only one there was this was as you just mentioned unanimous House Senate White House and of course they wrote back and they go oh you're right I looked into it that's that's what they want to happen for people to hear this and buy it without doing their homework hey and by the way the way I guess the reason they keep doing is because this is a perfect example of it works so I've been doing this for a while I mean it's like listen unfortunately this comes with the territory and so I recognize that we try to treat everybody with respect and so I think that you know Breitbart did a couple of great articles Chuck booth did some newsletter Humberto Sanchez who was the reporter for the Nevada independent did a follow-up piece which was very fair and so the irony of all this is I'm sitting you're going those Nevada press outlets that were on that phone call I think did an accurate job of reporting the fact that that we didn't realize that inquiry had now become a buzzword for something other than just and generally is like well okay I guess but in the context of the whole 40 minute interview it's like you can't listen to that tape which is out there where I refer to unanimous consent multiple times and the White House supports this and get it mixed up so I think that's where you get the East Coast spin stuff to where it's like okay and in this case it wasn't everybody because they were some what I would describe as left-leaning media outlets who came out and said no no no this is this is BS that is not what the congressman said so these are some lucid people yeah it's interesting it's interesting how some of the people that you would think are your political enemies the day before yeah it's like well this doesn't fit the narrative against him at all so now some of them are I think confused but it's like hey welcome to to the national news cycle as reported by those east of the Appalachians yeah and there's a lot flying around on both sides of this the president another tweet storm a yesterday he wants to meet the whistleblower and confront him and and the odds of that happening I don't think are very high but you've read the whistleblower complaint yeah are you troubled you've got to be troubled by the fact that whoever this person is was not in the room and everything is here saying what gets me about that as you know what do we hear about on you know in courtrooms all the time well not hearsay so no it's okay now I mean it's kind of like that this whole thing on inquiry versus something else where it's like hey if you're trying to fulfill a narrative then you're gonna basically write it too that narrative you know I I should also mention it's like listen Kevin McCarthy called me on Friday goes hey what's going on yeah well you know that's what you get when when Cal State Bakersfield beat UNR and basketball a couple years ago but anyhow talked to Kevin talked to Steve Scalise and said hey do the articles are accurate I just I just don't understand how this basically got to the point where somehow I'm I'm a D and talked with Mick Mulvaney a couple times it's like so we're fine you know the somebody from the New York Times says are you getting are you getting any blowback from leadership or whatever and I said well not from leadership or the White House I've spoken with him no I said I am getting blowback from some misinformed conservatives and Laura Ingraham but I said but you know what that's that's really Laura fell for this yeah yeah this is a person who rants and raves against fake news and blah blah blah it's like Jesus sounds to me like you like it yeah mark Amodei our congressman here in studio with us this morning on Newstalk 780 koh now you were not in favor of Nancy Pelosi instigating this quote/unquote inquiry well as a matter of fact here's another one that little homework will help is when the Senate resolution came over to refer him to the intelligence committees basically the Democrats were gonna run Pelosi x' thing with the six committees and all that they had to they had to pull that whole thing back because it broke multiple rules which they couldn't get around and substitute the Senate resolution wording word-for-word that's what the house adopted versus unanimous consent so it's like hey and and by the way I think I mentioned that during the forty minute thing too so the answer your question is of course not I mean here's here's the ironic thing it's like hey treat everything by the procedures and the rules we have confidence in them you know although some days you wonder if you should after the FBI stuff and the Department of Justice stuff but it's like we have confidence in the rule so so let's use them their main reason this is a whole lot of nothing is gosh when's the last time we had unanimous consent yeah from the house and the Senate and the White House I don't know if I could remember when that happened it's like isn't this what everybody's been saying we need well yeah and so here's here's the one of the underreported things about the whole deal is is they had to pull back their original resolution about referring it to six committees and having a inquiry which is now a very special word yeah and they had to pull that back and substitute it with the Senate language so it's like you know you got to play by the rules even if you're in the majority yeah and and then when you do they find a way to turn that around on you was all because everything that I've seen you said is consistent with what you've always said to me over the years as like hey we got a process let's follow it and see where it goes we'll have none of that around here and now that's controversial so congressman mark Amity is our guest when we come back we'll delve into a little bit about what's going to happen as this moves forward moves use talk 7/8 Koh welcome back Monday morning Dan Mason you know congressman mark Hammond a our guest in studio stirring the pot over the weekend with a fairly benign comment about the impeachment inquiry and that's it's pretty consistent with what you always say is let's just see what the process brings up and we'll go from there and and now this was a telephone call with multiple reporters that you took part in right and then some of the national news media took it and twisted the information basically and it became oh I'm in favor of impeachment well they took Humberto Sanchez's article maybe his was the first out I don't even know and they basically took that there must have you know must have been not much else going on on Friday probably and they took that it's like hey we got we got something here let's go with this and it's like well if it was true you you'd have yourself something I was actually surprised you know anybody noticed goes did it you know on Friday night is is when you know I I get the Jackie Rosen a Katherine Cortes Masto email dump where I get about 40 different things on Friday night every week I'm thinking well how did they see this stuff from Amedeo let's don't this yeah yeah all right so take your on recess for a couple of weeks at the house and there was talking calling you back for a vote and all this what happens now how does this inquiry proceed because I understand we got six committees involved where does this all go well the rules say that the committees go through their process of fact-finding whatever you know high crimes misdemeanors that sort of stuff and then if they think it's appropriate the committee's the committee that that's investigating whatever portion of it is will then make the decision to write articles of impeachment or not or an article of impeachment and so you think back the last time this happened was Clinton and and so it's like I think three or four articles were sent to the floor of the house from the committee and then the house takes them up and they ultimately have a vote and impeachment is the same as an indictment right and and so if any of those articles because not all the ones that were sent to the floor in the house for Clinton were passed but it was like perjury and something else however many articles are you vote on them one by one yes and there can be multiple ones depending on what we have six that six command the rule is in the house it's like listen it's like everything else in the house first side to 218 votes wins yeah so you go well I would expect the house to pass them then because the DS are like 225 oh and and so it's like well let's see because quite frankly there are many DS in the column that also has many R's that says let's see what happens in the process and see how that goes so they're not tying themselves to an automatic vote against the president at least right now they're saying there are also around 30 districts congressional districts that basically voted for Trump in in 2016 and which DS now sit in after the 2018 midterms and so there are DS that quite frankly that are going to be feeling this heat in terms of her if you're one of them who votes for it you better have a solid basis yeah and and if you don't and you just vote for it because you got but then after that it goes to the Senate what do you think the possibility or I guess I should say it sounds like you're fairly convinced that something is going to come to the floor at some point how soon might that be and and and I just have to ask or the Democrats just gonna try and draw this out as close to the election as they can I think I don't think that with the trajectory it's on now what was different and what Nancy Pelosi's done in the last 10 days than before is is they basically they're in a hurry this time before they say oh we think we got it and we're it's like so before you can get too much light on it it's like hey this trains leaving and it's going fast and so I think it's like listen and I think I said and they interview it's like if you guys think you got something why don't you bring it to the floor right now you got you 218 votes whatever well they don't have their 218 votes so that process is going to be important to some of the more moderate Democrats in there who are not just going to sign up but I'll tell you what and I'm not Nancy Pelosi's defender she's under incredible pressure from a segment of her conference to basically do this and guess what yeah if you want to be the Speaker of the House you got to have 218 votes that can be called into question at any time John Boehner was threatened with it a couple of times sure never happened but so it's like part of what she's doing quite frankly is is she's she's under tremendous pressure from the al greens and and the far left folks of her over conference to where it's like you know what I've got if I want to ride this horse I have to be able to stay in the saddle and produce something for this so they're off to the they're off the races I predict you'll have a you'll have a impeachment vote unless it totally implodes that all those committee things which is possible these days know that they'll be there'll be a vote on the floor I've heard before thanks yeah that's what I've heard yeah I think that would be good I mean I want everybody on the record and sooner rather than later we're away from a pretty important midterm election I want to know what what and to your point a lot of those Democrats especially in some of those districts where Trump they're hedging their bets and they're smart to do that well and you know what Dan that's fair to judge me by how I vote I mean I've always said that and and so it's like yeah if you think you're that good then get that on the floor and let's see where everybody votes you know one of the comments you made that everybody got all fired up about is I now have a full appreciation of how I know let's well yeah and then the old code word sign-off have a nice weekend I can Green when referring to the whole Ukraine thing and the phone call and and Biden and his son I keep hearing people say well Biden didn't do anything wrong it's like we've got we've got him on tape admitting that he pressured them right and one of the stories heard was well you know that the whole the whole trial about or the whole thing with the prosecutor in Ukraine it was kind of on the back burner and they weren't really pushing it at the moment a my response to that is well that doesn't mean it went away yeah so that would of course still motivate the former vice president into doing what he did and I just I'm challenging people to tell me what they think the difference between the two is you know that's that's emblematic of a lot of stuff floating around like you know where are we at with the Comey stuff where are we at with the McCabe's stuff well yeah with the FISA Court stuff because if you want to talk about let's let the system run through and see what it says like you know and and I'm not gonna prejudge them any more than anybody else but it's like hey we got a lot of stuff that quite frankly before it's put through the process doesn't sound good and so it's like where are we at on that stuff I didn't see over the weekend that the State Department has stepped up there supposedly ongoing inquiry into the whole Hillary email situation that they've gotten new information and that's got a higher profile again all of a sudden but I'm kind of with you it's like you know Hannity for example has been telling us for months and months and months I don't know it's all going to come out and I'm like fine when let's get to it yeah if there's something there let's get it out and have a look at it's kind of the exact same premise if you got something let's hear it and if you don't can we move on and start running the country and you know the other thing is I remember when Kevin McCarthy was given all sorts of criticism because when we were in the majority he said something that basically said hey we're doing this because quite frankly there are political implications at them and everybody went nuts back east oh my god you're doing stuff because it's political and and yeah that's your reaction so I sit there now and and they're saying well do you think this is political and I said I think that that's on the interview tape do I kind of laugh I said hey everything's political you know I mean and whether it's supposed to be or not everything has political implications so let's just move right along quite frankly in two well of course it's political its indc but let's let's see what the facts are yeah I mean heck what you know which way you drive to work is political back there so to say hey do you think this is political is to say like hey are you breathing the atmosphere on the planet yeah yeah some days that facts seem to matter everywhere except in politics yeah and the spin is what it is and they tried to get you with the spin and you know a nice nice epic fail again on that one well you know it's like hey you take it as it comes in some days this comes with the territory and so that's fine we'll keep plugging away all right well I want to stay in touch we'll see what happens I hope you're right that this all somehow wraps up by Thanksgiving but I don't know that any of this ever truly wraps up as well the longer it goes the less you know it's like well I mean let's face it if you got the smoking gun you want to show it to everybody and the longer you go without seeing a gun with smoke coming out of it that does not strengthen your case yeah and the guy who kept saying for two years that he had the smoking gun was Adam Schiff and we know how that turned out the history is not good no congressman Mark Hamill a always a pleasure thanks for stopping by and clear in the air so to speak you bet thank you Dan speak you bet

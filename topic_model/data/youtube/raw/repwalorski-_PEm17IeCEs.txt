women should never face discrimination or harassment and women and girls should be empowered to achieve their dreams so it's disappointing to see these important issues turned into a political stunt the deadline for states to ratify the equal rights amendment passed nearly four decades ago congress cannot simply remove it now even the late justice ruth bader ginsburg said last year that the only path forward is to start over but speaker pelosi's resolution to remove the deadline for ratification of the era is not about equality or women's rights it's about enshrining unrestricted abortion in the constitution and allowing full taxpayer funding for abortion that's why i voted no now is not the time to weaken pro-life protections now is the time to defend the unborn and uphold the sanctity of life sadly the new administration and leadership in congress are committed to a radical agenda that devalues life and denies the humanity of precious unborn babies we should protect the rights of the most vulnerable among us lift women up strengthen families and stand together for life

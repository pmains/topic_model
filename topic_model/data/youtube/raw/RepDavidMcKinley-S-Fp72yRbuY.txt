uh thank you chairman tonko and welcome administrator reagan i particularly appreciate our conversation yesterday look i think one thing we can all agree to is the world needs to reduce his carbon emissions and i think we're on the same page here and but the president has has repeatedly pledged publicly to decarbonize the power sector by 2035 and some in congress are trying to upgrade move that up till 2030 but i want in this hearing today with him and his over his budget is to look at what we'll need what will have to happen for a power plant to meet that that goal first we have to have carbon capture technology must must become commercially viable secondly we have to have a new source review program must be reviewed and thirdly the united states needs to develop a pipeline system to dispose of this captured carbon utility companies have found that it takes seven to eight years to get a new source review permit and do all the engineering design and permitting to install carbon capture to achieve net zero so if utilities must comply with the democrats goal of 2030 they're going to have to start immediately using today's technology but it's widely recognized that today's carbon capture is not ready for prime time it's incapable of capturing 80 of our fossil fuel or our carbon emissions so but let's just assume that the technology works in the next 12 months and we can indeed capture 80 of the carbon emitted utilities will next need to have a new source review permit approved to upgrade their facilities yet the new source review program lacks certainty and predictability when just think about when was the last time any of us in congress heard of a utility getting the new source review program to make a major modification they're not it's not a reliable process according to gao all the recent their epa recently reviewed 831 nsr units that have been approved by the nsr 467 of them were found to be in violation and the utility had to go back and redo everything that they had just gotten permission to accomplish that's that's not certainty that's insanity and it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to utilities and the consumers as a result of the epa not following its regulations so what our utilities need is certainty that's why the new source review needs to be reformed if there's nothing in the president's agenda or in this budget that i can see discussing reforms to this program rather it seems the administration is following the same philosophical agenda as president of biden's which is focusing on regulations what a novel thing chairman if we focus instead on innovating first finding that later in our laboratories our scientists and our researchers to come up with the way of carbon capture rather than punishing them so we could be showing american leadership now let's assume that that that they can get the carbon technology and there's and they're actually to get a permit for it uh so now you need the power plant needs to develop a pipeline system to transport the captured carbon that democrats don't have that they they have unfortunately an adverse position towards pipelines so just look at what's happening over there the keystone pipeline the dakota access pipeline the atlantic coast parliament the mountain valley pipeline the line five in michigan all of these are showing problems so why do we think as we develop this that the environments are going to let us uh uh let states and the administration approve more pipelines uh i i i don't think they're going to be built and those pipelines if they get held will be built by 2030. we will have accomplished nothing so all these things need to come together we have to develop carbon capture we have to have uh reforms and new source reviews and we have to build out a system of carbon dioxide pipelines to get the project away but in the quiet of the night the epa and the administration know this can't be achieved you know that and the rest of people on this panel so why isn't the domestic administration just simply being honest with the american public there is this is nothing but a politically driven agenda aimed at ending jobs and the use of coal and natural gas in this country coal miners and gas workers all across america will suffer losing their homes jobs and livelihoods and they'll fall into poverty i say again where is the justice in that process so i yield back mr chairman

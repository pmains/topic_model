hi i'm congressman donald payne jr and i'm proud to represent new jersey's 10th congressional district the safety and security of new jersey families is my top priority that's why this week i introduced the tank car safety and security act transporting flammable liquids and other hazardous materials always carries risks but it is critical that shipments of these materials are as safe as possible in order to mitigate the risk and protect our communities as we have seen from recent tank car accidents in the united states and canada the consequences of a derailed tank car carrying hazardous materials can be devastating these accidents pose significant risks to property the environment and most importantly lives among its provisions the tank car safety and security act requires the united states secretary of transportation to revise federal standards for d.o.t 111 tank cars used to move crude oil it also directs the administrator of the transportation security administration to issue a set of procedures to ensure that no rail car containing crude oil be left unattended when transferred from one carrier to the next as the practice of shipping crude oil by rail increases now is the time to solidify the safety standards of our nation's tank cars and keep our communities safe thank you you

frankie murray thank you mr chairman thank you mr speaker there is a stark choice to be made there is no question about it as i'm quoting from the gentleman from california uh mr chairman this is the stark choice look at this this is what you tried to do to the american people after bill clinton left office during his term 21 million jobs were created then the next eight years when we dropped the tax rate down from 39.6 to 35 for those most affluent we didn't gain anything in fact we lost 463 000 jobs you want to try this again we're not going to try it again you want to talk about debt on arrival those are your words this is dead on arrival i rise in strong opposition to this budget forget about the trillions of dollars worth of cuts to programs that help people with low or moderate incomes figure out forget about the tax increases that hit the middle class working poor so that some millionaires of billionaires can squeeze a little more from the stone forget about repealing obamacare for the 56th time taking affordable health care out of the hands of 16 million americans leaving them with nothing and not having the guts to tell them what's going on forget about forget about all of that the fundamental problem with this document is that even with all the draconian spending cuts and with all the tax increases i just described at the end of the day it still doesn't balance as the ranking man just a few moments ago said over and over again in fact mr ranky man it's not even close this budget while calling for the complete and total repeal of the affordable health care act continues to assume that the law's 2 million revenue increases and medicare savings it assumes that we'll do away with the bill but we'll keep the money i don't know other way to put it when we get to taxes the budget assumes that revenues remain unchanged for the current law yet you yourself you yourself mr chairman i have a great deal of respect for you doctor you stated explicitly through the chair that you weren't you don't think we should be using the current law baseline you said that i didn't last congress we passed 956 billion dollars in on four unpaid for tax breaks you all voted for that they weren't assumed in the current law baseline this year we've already passed 100 billion in unpaid for tax cuts where's this money coming from we are the tax and spend democrats you folks know better than that 200 billion i yield another 30 seconds gentleman from new jersey thank you 200 billion more have been reported out of ways and means that tomorrow we're going to report out another 300 billion dollar tax cut for paris help hilton and ivanka trump and others fortunate enough to be left a nice inheritance that's what you're going to do tomorrow my friend the chairman might just be assuming that your majority will surely pass a trillion dollar tax increase to offset these unpaid for tax breaks and abide by his budget's revenue assumptions mr speaker i urge a no vote for this budget it's simply not worth the paper it's printed on and i yield back the gentleman's times expired members are reminded to direct the remarks to the chair and not to other members of the body the chair recognized the gentleman from georgia i thank the chair

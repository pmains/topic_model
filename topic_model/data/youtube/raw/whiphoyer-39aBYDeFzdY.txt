is the Democratic majority leader gentleman from Maryland the distinguished Majority Leader's recognized I thank the gentlelady for yielding and I think this is my first time in a long time of having a magic one minute and so I have some things to say I was on the appropriation committee for 23 years I came here in 1981 we had between 81 and 95 10 shutdowns those 10 shutdowns averaged 1.9 days they shut down the longest one was three days because they were because of differences not because of a strategy in 1995 Newt Gingrich adopted shutting down government as a strategy as a taking hostage not only federal employees but of taking hostage of the American government and taking hostage everyone who is served on a daily basis by the federal government and the reason I know it's a strategy because it has happened a number of times the next one long term was in 2013 when Ted Cruz United States Senator came over here and talked to a number of members and said unless the president will repeal the Affordable Care Act we're not going to fund the government in other words unless the president didn't take health care away from Americans the Republicans would take government services away from Americans and hold hostage the government of the United States and now just a few years later ladies and gentlemen the Republicans have again taken hostage not only 800,000 people who worked for the federal government expecting them to work for no pay to protect our borders to protect our seas to protect our food and so they've taken hostage the government of the United States and one more time and so we have a crisis but the crisis is not at the border there is a challenge at the border and we need to make our border secure we are for that the proposal the president made in a campaign speech which got a lot of roars all the time he gave it was we need a wall a big wall a wall along the whole border a wall that the Mexican government will pay for it was total campaign rhetoric and demagoguery it was not a policy when I agree with my friend from Idaho mr. Simpson is the former Speaker of the Idaho House the far right in his party ran a candidate against him a few like elections ago and they got beaten badly thank heavens for that thank thanks to the voters in Idaho's judgement and I agree with my friend Tom Cole in part but I if he were here unfortunately he's left the floor but I would say to Tom Cole mr. Cole as you ended the Congress with your side in charge you rejected a bill from the United States Senate passed with unanimous consent that would have opened up all of government and you rejected that bill because the president told you to put 5.6 billion dollars in the bill which you knew and I'm sorry Tom Cole's not on the floor because he says you know this bill is not going to pass which you knew would not pass the United States Senate but you sent it anyway why because the President of the United States told you to do so let me remind all of us that we are a co-equal branch of government we are the article 1 branch of government we are the policy makers of government not to sit as Stooges and be told by the president United States if you don't do what I want what I tell you to do I won't sign the bill mr. speaker on Tuesday night the president went on television trying to argue that the American people should continue to endure a painful government shutdown until Democrats give him funding for a border wall that has by partisan opposition Democrats and Republican alike not all but oppose this 5-7 billion dollar waste of money on a physical wall along the border representative will Hort heard now who is will heard he's a Republican member of the Congress of the United States he is a member of the Congress of the United States from Texas he represents a district which has more border than any other district in America what is he saying building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border but the president United States says you don't do that I'm not playing and because he's not playing none of you are playing I say to my Republican friends how sad you were not elected by your constituents to do what Donald Trump tells you to do you are elected by your constituents to do what's best for them and their country Senator Lindsey Graham friend of the president's Republican senator from South Carolina said this the border wall is probably not a smart investment but the president's told Lindsey Graham you not for my wall I'm not for your bill and I won't sign it and I'm gonna shut down government one person is responsible for shutting down government Donald Trump and most of the people he's shut down and not paying they don't have a dad they can go say give me some money dad maybe he doesn't know that experience opposing a new barrier at the border acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney listen to me my Republican friends said in 2015 you go under you go around you go through what they need is more manpower more technology and more willing to an Asst to enforce the law as it exists today he said in 2015 now the wall more manpower more technology more willingness that's essentially what will Hurd said Senator Ron Johnson one of the most conservative senators in the United States Senate said he always thought that the president's wall was a quote metaphor now if it is a metaphor for security we're in because we Democrats want a border that is secure that does not allow people who are not authorized to come into the United States don't that people criminals that want to bring drugs in the United States are caught and prevented from doing so that people who traffic in human lives are caught and stopped where for that the president's at the border said Democrats don't care about crime they don't care about human trafficking they don't care that's baloney and as they lie it is unworthy of a president United States to make such an assertion Senator John Cornyn of Texas said and I quote I don't think we're just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under around it and through it that's why so many Republicans said the walls not the answer ranking member Michael McCaul now he's the ranking member of your Foreign Affairs Committee I tell my mum Republican friends mr. speaker but he was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee when he said this and I quote a 30-foot concrete wall is a very expensive proposition and there are a lot of other things we can be doing technology wise to make it a smarter border that's more effective and more cost efficient so don't accuse the Redeemer Kratz because there are against the wall of being against border security your Republican leaders don't believe that so you ought to stop saying it they are among the Republicans and Democrats who believe we need a smarter more comprehensive strategy to improve border security not just building a physical wall with taxpayer money President Trump said over and over and over and over and over again Mexico was going to pay for this wall God knows how any American voter believe that now of course not surprisingly he admits that's not going to happen so let's discuss border security which is important to Democrats and Republicans in life let's sit down and figure out how best to do it that is a debate on policy but by the way my Republican colleagues did not bring the homeland security and the border security issue to the floor until December 20th 11 and 2/3 months after they took control or they were in control because was the last of the session so they waited 11 months and 20 days to bring this critical issue to the floor my-my-my and now they shut down the government if we don't do it their way this is a debate on policy not politics that's why I quoted so many Republicans there's no reason to maintain a dangerous and costly government shutdown while that debate occurs let's end this shutdown right now and turn to the real discussion about border security without holding America's workers their families and the people they serve all of our constituents let's have a vote in the Senate which was which I believe would reopen government leader McConnell has a responsibility to do so leader McConnell has a responsibility their Senate and to his oath of office the Constitution and the country he swore no oath to President Trump none of us swore an oath to the price of the United States we swear it out to the Constitution and to preserve and protect and serve our people on August 24 2014 Senator McConnell said this that I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns shutdowns he said this is Senator McConnell is a failed policy that's what mr. Simpson said that's what mr. Cole I know believes I've talked to him about it I hope I remember here believes that so my plea is to stop pursuing it as a strategy remember ten shutdowns of average 1.9 days your shutdowns 21 days 16 days and now we're going to have the longest shutdown in history because you have taken captive the government of the United States how sad that it is us who are the enemy of the government of the United States Senator McConnell I hope we'll bring bills to the floor to open up the government as he did in December when he sent a bill here and you would not take it up my Republican friends when you were in charge you were the leaders you rejected that bill that would have funded government kept you up Oakland kept serving the American people but no you took a hostage and government is shut down the democratic-led Congress is doing its part the first day we came here we passed a bill that was exactly like the Senate's bill so one could assume that the bill they had passed when they got it back would in fact pass and the Homeland Security we did for a short time so we could continue negotiations in a positive way without having hostages being taken last week we passed a package of funding bills for fiscal year 2019 continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security and in order to reopen government and end the Trump shut down the Trump shut down the Trump shut down if Trump said to Senator McConnell yes I will sign the bill the bills would be passed by the United States Senate no one disputes that if Trump said to the House members here mr. speaker they would pass Trump articulated at the White House that he would not open government until we agreed with doing what he wanted to do that is not democracy that's despotism because leader McConnell was refusing to bring up your package of appropriation bills they're very same bills written by the Republican Senate as been so often said and I'm would prefer that they were bipartisan bills we are now sending him each of the bills individually on Wednesday we passed a bill that would among other things reopen the IRS so taxpayers can get their refunds they paid in more than they owed and they ought to get it back and they ought to get it back in a timely fashion but the folks who were to do that are not being allowed to come to work yesterday we passed the agricultural appropriation bill which will continue nutrition assistance for those facing hunger and reopen programs helping farmers in rural America many of you represent rural farmers and they're relying on payments from the Department of Agriculture to sustain them and they're not getting them we also passed yesterday a bill for transportation Housing and Urban Development to restore safety to air travel and keep low income Americans from losing rental housing assistance I don't think there's any Republican that wants to see people out on the street because they couldn't make their payment because they didn't get their payment from the federal government today we are bringing this interior appropriation bill to the floor to reopen America's national parks and restore services to Native Americans and tribal communities I want to thank the gentlelady miss McCollum from Minnesota for the leadership she has shown and the work that she is pursued to bring this bill to the floor I asked my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote on the merits of this bill and I hope that many Republicans will join us if you're for reopening government vote yes if you vote no you're for continuing this Trump shutdown I hope leader McConnell listens to his senators senator Susan Collins said this on the house-passed bills last Thursday it would be great to have them signed into law because there's not great controversy over them and at least we'd be getting those workers back to work senator Cory Gardner Republican of Colorado added we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open I agree mr. speaker hopefully when we vote today we will have in mind the 800,000 people we're not getting paid some half of whom are working hopefully we'll have in mind all those who are looking for a tax return all those who are looking for a Supplemental Nutrition payment so they can put food on their tables all those who are looking to make sure that they can settle on their house because FHA is cooperating all those who need visas extension or something of that nature hopefully we'll be thinking of them not just of small-bore politics of if you don't do what I say I won't play vote for this bill send it to the Senate Senator McConnell put it on the floor pass it and send it to President Trump I yield back the balance of my

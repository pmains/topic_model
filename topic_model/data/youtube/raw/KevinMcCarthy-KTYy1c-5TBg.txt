when I was 19 I started my first small business in Bakersfield a little DeLeon Stein and plans to save money my dad and I even built the counter together in our garage I worked hard hired employees put myself through college it was my own version of the American dream I ran for Congress to promote and defend the principles that make that possible that make America great today in towns across our community people are have to work harder than ever just to make ends meet when I leave home to travel to Washington it's those families that I have on my mind my focus is on getting results for us in California cutting taxes and regulations for job-creating small businesses getting water flowing for farmers in the valley protecting the health care for the veterans who defended us I'm Kevin McCarthy and I approve this message because serving you in Congress is my highest honor and my commitment to our common goals has never been stronger

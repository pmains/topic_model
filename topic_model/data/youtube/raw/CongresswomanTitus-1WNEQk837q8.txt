and you're welcome you recognized for five minutes well thank you very much mr. chairman ranking member pallone ranking member tonka and other members of the subcommittee I appreciate this opportunity to testify as you have such stated Yucca Mountain has been an issue of major importance for Nevadans for decades that dates back to nineteen eighty seven when President Reagan's signed the so-called screw Nevada bill into law in the years that have followed I along with bipartisan business Civic and political leaders throughout Nevada have been unified with rare exception and vehement opposition to this failed proposal now it's my understanding that today's hearing is intended to suggest that some benefit will accrue to Nevada for hosting nuclear waste generated elsewhere well on behalf of three out of four Nevadans who oppose Yucca Mountain I'm here to say we cannot and will not be bought off mr. chairman afterward of this hearing got out I was contacted by major stakeholders throughout Nevada who wanted to weigh in and have their voices heard I have letters in opposition from leading Nevadans and organizations also our governor and senator Heller an editorial from the Las Vegas Sun I would request that these be entered into the record yes i can get staff to grab those and bring those up here we'll look at them and then thank you so much now i realize that many people may not know about or appreciate the significant contributions and major sacrifices that Nevada made during our Atomic Age more than a thousand nuclear detonations occurred near downtown Las Vegas and you could see the mushroom cloud rising over the desert not far away these tests took place at a time when the federal government conducted duck-and-cover drills to show us how to protect ourselves from radioactive fallout I imagine some among you will remember Burt the turtle duck and cover well since then billions of dollars have been paid to the residents of Nevada Utah and other downwind States that were under that radioactive cloud earlier in the 20th century I give this history lesson not only to highlight Nevada's anatomic development but also to remind you that they told us then we were safe and they're telling us now we're safe members of Congress may board a plane to my district and then be shuttled out to the desert north of town for a photo op where they can see the dry and desolate moonscape where yucca mountain is located but you shouldn't be fooled by such a superficial look at land that Nevadans love and want to protect nevada is not a wasteland it's home to unique desert habitats rare and endangered species of plants and animals iconic wildlife like bighorn sheep and desert tortoises and cultural resources from Native American tribes dating back thousands of years such a quick visit also ignores the fact that beneath the surface are major fault lines and a water table that moves towards the Las Vegas Valley where two million people live furthermore this Way's test that's going to be stored there has to be shipped thousands of miles across this nation on highways and byways that go through all of your districts in fact almost everybody in Congress's district 14 years ago I stood next to our Republican governor Kenny Gwen and other leaders from around the state on the day he first vetoed the Yucca Mountain site in the years that have followed billions of dollars have been wasted on this boondoggle and we are still no closer to a solution it wasn't until the Obama administration assembled a blue-ribbon Commission on America's nuclear future with some of the most respected experts on this topic who released a list of recommendations to guide us forward one such recommendation which goes to the heart of the matter and has been referenced earlier is adopting a consent based process by which repositories are cited that's why I joined with my colleague Joe heck from the house and Senators Harry Reid and Dean Heller to introduce the nuclear waste informed consent act now I've heard proponents make all kind of false promises to us in Nevada they say Nevada could receive hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure projects or maybe be allocated more water from the Colorado River for example well who can take that seriously really this Congress has failed in its response to nearly every pressing issue facing our nation there's not even enough money for the completion of the Yucca Mountain project much less extra left over bribe money to give to Nevada Nevadans maybe gamblers but we're not fools we know how to calculate the odds so in conclusion I would ask you to remember that Nevada has done its part in the development of US nuclear energy furthermore we didn't produce this commercial waste we don't have any nuclear power plants so we say keep it where it is for now pass a consent-based bill move forward so places who won't it can have it so in short I urge my colleagues on this subcommittee concentrate your efforts on ways to make progress to move forwards not backwards so we can really solve this problem I thank you for your attention and I yield back generally yields back time and then we thank your for testimony chair now recognizes congressman

unanimous consent to submit for the record five letters from the leadership of this committee to the Treasury secretary and two responses from Treasury to those letters without objection mr. secretary Lew thank you for being here I want to state this for the record it article 1 section of article 1 of the US Constitution establishes and makes vital the oversight authority of the Congress visa V the executive branch and I'm sure you agree with that notion but your Treasury Department has stiff-armed this committee and its oversight capacity and it's in its unsupported refusal to provide complete responses to this committee that's unacceptable chairman Garrett already covered his concern i also sent you a letter on august 22nd 2013 requesting documents that were the subject of a FOIA request made by public interest group the Treasury's position is that the apartment would provide this committee with only redacted documents of that group already received this implies that FOIA RIA is applicable to Congress mr. secretary I hope that you would understand that FOIA does not apply to Congress and that you will direct your legislative affairs staff that they will provide those documents promptly furthermore in addition on November 6 2013 chairman hen Celine sent a letter to the New York Fed requesting information regarding contingency planning related to the u.s. debt limit the New York Fed pointed the finger at Treasury Department claiming they needed the Treasury's permission to produce the requested information although we have rejected the feds claim that it needs Treasury permission I ask that you commit to resolving this issue and ensuring that the committee receives the requested documents by the requested production date of December eighteenth you can respond in writing we'll move forward additionally this question of prioritization of debt mr. secretary you've mentioned in the past that you're unsure of your department whether or not has the legal authority to prioritize debt payments in the event of a failure to raise the debt ceiling I voted to raise the that ceiling I think we have to we have an obligation to pay to pay our obligations but have you requested from the or your department requested from the Office of Legal Counsel Department of Justice and answer to this question so congressman on the question of responsiveness to oversight I very much except I just asked for you to respond in writing for that if you would address this prioritization question have you asked or your department asked whether or not you can prioritize debt from the office of the legal counsel the department of justice the question of prioritization is fundamentally a policy question and I think as your comments reflected I do not believe nor is any president nor any treasure sir I understand this you've established that let me let me ask you to answer my question that and I've also said publicly that ultimately I appreciate that but I've got a minute 54 seconds left but have you asked the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel whether or not you have the authority in the event of not raising the debt ceiling to prioritize debt payments the the issue of whether or not that decision we made is fundamentally a presidential decision it would be a commune abut have have have you as Treasury secretary by your department requested from the Office of Legal Counsel whether or not you can prioritize answer your question congressman is it would fundamentally be a question between the White House Counsel and the Justice Department because it's the present okay let me point you to the fact that Huffington Post article from last week says the Obama administration took the platinum coin option more seriously than it let on this idea you have a 1 trillion dollar coin minted and depart and deposit the federal the the Fed and then draw upon that it is according to The Huffington Post the administration did ask the Office of Legal Counsel for this absurd idea to actually be judged whether or not it's legal yet at the same time you will not say that you've asked whether or not you can prioritize payments that is deeply concerning hurting and prepared prepared to discuss the policy on both of those issues I don't disagree with you that the platinum coin is not a subject option well good I'm glad we agree on that let me ask one final question on Volker who is the primary enforcer of the Volcker rule so if I could just go back congressman on the question of the debt limit the real issue is we must keep all of our obligations I agree I agree let me ask you that's the rule is a primer enforcer Volcker the Volcker rule is a rule that came out of five different agencies as you know well there are five different primary enforcers really want aspects of the Volcker Rule depending on what kind of a financial institution you are you're regulated by when you submit in writing sort of your view of this as chairman of sock I'm happy to respond to your question right the time of the gentleman has expired as previously announced the chair now declares the committee

the operator of one of the biggest gasoline pipelines in the u.s has hired a private firm to investigate a cyber attack this week that forced it to temporarily shut down the 5 000 mile long colonial pipeline which carries about roughly half of the fuel supply on the east coast the white house just releasing this statement the federal government is working actively to assess the implications of this incident avoid disruption and supply and help the company restore pipeline operations as quickly as possible the president was briefed this morning republican congresswoman nancy may serves on the house transportation and infrastructure committee and she joins me now to talk about this thank you for joining me here on this mother's day weekend giving up a little time on this saturday we really really appreciate it i have to say given your committee assignments this really seems to be in your wheelhouse it is in your area in your region this is something that actually affects your region and as the white house said the federal government is working actively to assess the implications of this incident your thoughts what are the implications here well it's very troublesome our nation's energy supply is a matter of national security and there's no doubt this is an example of how important it is and how we have neglected it and have not paid as much attention or careful attention to it whether we're talking about our pipelines or our or the grid there's not a lot of information yet as to you know what entity did this who did this why they did it that sort of thing what is your biggest concern what is the the worst case scenario and how do we begin to combat this problem that we're totally unprepared for these kinds of incidences and that they might continue to increase in the future i mean that's the greatest fear and that's why i believe that you'll see the federal government really trying to work hard and help this the company figure out what did happen we're going to have a lot of questions that we're going to want answered and how do we prevent this from happening in the future now when we look at our energy policy here in the united states one thing that i think we need to make sure we understand are clear on is that under the biden administration right now um you know we've had another the trump administration under president trump we had less dependency on foreign oil and gas and so we want to make sure that we don't increase that dependency on foreign oil and gas it's already increased under the biden administration and so that's one of my greatest concerns right now not only since biden was sworn in have gas prices gone up but what is this going to do how is it going to hit the pocketbooks of millio of millions of americans along the east coast as well you know is enough being done to protect key infrastructure you know should symptoms that control pipelines other major industry uh energy components across the country should they even be hooked up to the internet should this be a vulnerability that we are exposed to or is there some other way to manage this in this world that's really very interconnected well there's no doubt and it doesn't matter what the industry is i mean the internet is here to stay technology is continuing to develop but it's also why you see in in private in this industry the need massive need for those who are skilled workers in cyber security and this is only going to increase and education in this country and finding those skilled workers who can help us combat these issues when they come up is going to be very very important something we should focus on across the nation uh shifting gears also something that uh clearly affects your region your area there's a rather startling jobs report that just came out really a massive gap in what was expected and what has actually been shown to pass in these april jobs numbers just 266 000 jobs created it added when the expectation was it could be potentially close to a million here we are in an era where people are beginning to get the vaccine businesses are beginning to reopen the expectation was that we were going to see people getting back to work and a lot of businesses are now reporting that they're having trouble finding employees that are ready to come back and to some extent they blame these extended unemployment benefits the additional money coming in from the federal government the stimulus funds your thoughts on these latest job numbers and also the theory that some of these businesses and employers have brought forward to say that this amount of money is hurting them and not helping them get back to business it is it was disturbing it's significantly lower than economist expectations when those numbers were released yesterday and guess what it turns out when you pay millions of americans to stay home they actually do and this is an opportunity for nancy pelosi and others in her corner to push a socialist agenda they want the american worker the american people to be dependent on the federal government that's a terrible idea and we're just going to see democrats from what i can tell in news reports double down on this they think that they need to do more stimulus have more checks than out more federal unemployment to solve the problem but when you talk to people when you talk to real business owners particularly small business owners they're going to tell you the exact opposite is exactly what you said molly when uh they are desperate to find employees all of these employers and they're having a having trouble because these folks don't want to come back to work very quickly uh the governor in montana announced this week the state will withdraw from from receiving some of that federal program money and then south carolina uh following suit with plans to stop some of its federally funded uh unemployment benefits by the end of next months do you do you support that move do you think that's the right way to go absolutely support the move based on my conversations with business owners in my district and across the state of south carolina and i applaud both governors for for taking a lead on that there are other states who who i believe should follow south carolina's unemployment rate has been hovering just over four percent for many many months now and the reason that we've not been able to lower it is because the federal government is incenting incentivizing workers to stay home rather than go back to work so this is a great first step to helping our economy push it forward to get through and get over the covid19 pandemic

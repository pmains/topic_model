for five minutes please thank you madam chair mr dante it's always interesting to have you before the committee it's um interesting discussion this afternoon uh can you tell me what what spurs the rule making of cspb the different areas that they get into um uh thank you congressman it's let me answer that in terms of the long-term policy agenda and then the the near term um not quite in that order the near-term policy agenda as it applies to rulemaking really is set out by the statute um we have a not inconsiderable rulemaking agenda within uh the mortgage business is uh mandatory and carries with it a timetable that is that okay let me call timeout right there um what's what's the reason do you know or do you have any idea what the reason is for the rule making requests that has been made of you uh yes i mean the statute is relatively clear in most cases uh why is this that's the way it is why do you why does statute want you to make a rule in certain instances well i know that the deliberations and debate with respect to the statute were uh lengthy and uh spirited and uh of course congress in its discretion has chosen a number of different rulemaking mandates and we have embraced them and we are moving forward with okay speed in the course of your rule making do you do a cost benefit analysis of each rule uh we do it comes in a couple of different uh flavors one is a uh a analysis of the uh costs and the benefits and the burdens associated with the rule there's also an element that relates with particularity to the impact on relatively small uh institutions within the financial services landscape okay with regards to your respa and tila rules have you done a custom benefit analysis on those yet yes and as part of the uh proposal i mean part of the part of the reason why the document is 1100 pages long is that you know the new rules associated with tila and respa integration are like 60 pages of the 1100 pages the other whatever that is 1040 pages relate to lots of other required elements of our rulemaking including the cost benefit analysis so that's laid out in that which we published okay part of the mission of going to respa though was to create a simpler disclosure form and something more consumer friendly and yet we wound up with a three page uh long estimate the beginning and five page long estimate at the end you think that's really an improvement i do uh both to my mind are improvements uh we have been careful to reach out to a number of different have you ever done let me excuse me a second have you ever done a survey to see once how many consumers actually read those documents we conducted uh what's called qualitative usability testing before the proposal was even issued qualitative using usability testing usability it goes by a few different terms into something that is used at other agencies as well as not infrequently in the private sector to develop a the broad contours of a piece of collateral or a disclosure form so that before i get it did you ever do it yeah absolutely okay what was your what was your what was your uh finding on the rest of the forums have you done a recipe yet uh so you're referring to the general kind of difficulties that consumers have with the current form so no i'm asking you did you do the survey on the rest of the forums to see once if anybody reads them so we did conduct closet what was it was result so in general that which we have proposed is something that is easier it would appear based on the on the testing today more pages and it's going to be easier to read is that right it is if you so the mandate by the congress was to combine the telan and respa uh closing uh documents so the final truth and lending disclosure you know what the percentage is of people who actually read the rest of the documents it is a relative you would it is you would be hard-pressed i think congressman to find borrowers who sit at a closing table and thumb through do you have a figure please i i don't know though i wouldn't hazard i guess uh okay but we will be doing quantitative testing after the proposal comment period ends but we don't know how many we're going to propose a rule and we don't know how many what percentage of people actually read this stuff so therefore is there a use for it oh sure this is for most people the single largest financial transaction that they will enter if they don't read it mr dante what good is it i well congressman it is i at some level i suppose it was useful to know how the dollars in the transaction actually would flow very quickly i got one more quick question for you and following mr conseco's discussion here about verifying complaints it was very concerning to me that you indicated you did not verify all the complaints did not um go through and try and figure out if they were the legitimate complaint and didn't follow up if there was something need to be followed on why oh no this is i feel like i was not adequately clear to the extent that there are complaints that are that the consumer disputes the resolution of then we have an investigations team within our consumer response unit that will follow up with those complaints if you indicated him you didn't you just verified whether it was a legitimate complaint that they actually did business with you didn't you didn't tell him that that you actually followed up on each individual complaint to see which if there was some something there what i just referred to is our approach with respect to complaints that we receive with respect to that which we uh publish on the website we and you know that we are quite transparent about it that which we publish on the website is the non-personally identifiable information associated with complaints that we received uh with the various data fields as as we receive them it is something that will continue to populate over time but that is that is for example we have to my basic question was you get the complaints you verify that it's a legitimate complaint the person does business do you follow up on individual complaint if somebody if one individual you're talking about you keep telling me about this subset about a whole group of people that are being abused or there's a problem but if there's one individual case you're not following up on it from the discussion and answers you're giving me is that correct with a random sample of complaints that are you're giving a random sample mr dante you are not taking care of every single one of them so complaints that are resolved to the satisfaction of a consumer we will not follow up with the investigation of every single one of those complaints now what time is that thank you madam chair mr manzulo

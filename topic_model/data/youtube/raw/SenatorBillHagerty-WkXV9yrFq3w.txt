and here to talk about all of this is senator bill hagerty from the state of tennessee the brand new senator sir thanks for coming on thanks for making the time it's great to be with you rob great to be this evening all right so democrats you know we're watching this happen right now they want a welfare state and at the same time they want open borders it's a pending disaster everybody knows how this is going to turn out how do the democrats even attempt to justify this current agenda well the crisis at the border is certainly one of their own making i reached out to the biden white house almost a month ago to warn them not to do away with the mexico protocols to warn them that this would likely be a crisis to ask some simple questions will these people be tested for coronavirus as they come across the border will they be inoculated before american citizens will they get work permits how will you know if they have escaped and how will you get them back no answers as yet meanwhile you saw this play out over the weekend one of the largest most aggressively liberal bills ever passed 1.9 trillion dollars at a time where we already have a trillion dollars from previous coveted relief packages that have yet to be spent right this wasn't about pandemic relief this was the democrats utilizing a crisis to push through their liberal agenda yet again the white house chief of staff said this is the most quote progressive piece of legislation we'll see in a generation that's one of the most embarrassing pieces of gender of legislation we'll see in a generation in my opinion and i couldn't agree more but when you look at what they push you know they they want they want this border essentially open they want to be humanitarian but at the same time in this country they want to give everybody health care they want to give everybody a college education these are all mainstream democrat ideas when you put those two things together it is a recipe for disaster no other country in the world would even attempt to do something like this because you know what's going to happen it's going to be a massive flood at the southern how do they not understand that yeah well we actually tried to clean some of this up over the weekend we actually tried to make certain that illegal immigrants would not get stimulus checks the democrats blocked that felons in penitentiary right now they're going to get stimulus checks while they're in the penitentiary these are creating all the wrong incentives and particularly as you say when they when they sat there and blocked our attempt to block these these stimulus checks from going to illegal immigrants we're saying that's just an invitation to come right across the border that's exactly what's happening right now we're going to see record numbers of people cross the border record amounts of children in these descent detention facilities under a republican administration they call them cages that's what's happening it's unfolding right now yeah it's unbelievable the senate passing like you just said 1.9 trillion some of the things that it includes money for bailing out the blue states that's a lot of it a billion dollars for racial justice provisions for farmers figure out what that is 175 million for the corporation for public broadcasting 50 million for environmental justice grants there's a lot of pork in this thing you tried to send this back to committee on saturday let's take a listen our motions would simply send this legislation back to committee for three days so it can be reviewed in a bipartisan manner these motions would ensure that the legislation supports proven bipartisan programs before launching new programs or spending more money on programs that are already flush with cash so obviously that didn't happen we know how it turned out you know they say nine percent of this is actually going to covet relief how much of this bill is garbage in your opinion uh the the uh obviously the vast majority of it well over 90 percent in fact less than one percent is actually going to vaccines so we've got a real problem with this bill and you know what you've seen is something that i would have never imagined happened in america this is a 50-50 senate very closely divided nation right now and they shoved this through on a completely partisan basis not a single republican vote they didn't spend a minute in committee that's exactly the way the senate is designed to try to help improve legislation they bypassed that completely that that was what my suggestion was that was what my amendment was is to send it back to committees and let us work on this in a bipartisan basis but no way they were having none of that they just rammed it through it's it really is unbelievable i want to talk about hr one the voting rights act pass the house headed to the senate next it does a lot of things including essentially federalizing large parts of our election process something democrats love biden also issued an executive order on elections yesterday and i want to get your take on what is he doing there he's got an executive order while at the same time they're trying to push their bill through why is that they're going to attack it from every angle but the constitution clearly puts the conduct of these elections in the domain of state legislatures what the democrats want to do is federalize it at every turn they're going to loosen it continually loosen the the requirements they're even talking about not not allowing states to require photo id they want to be able to sign up by internet this is going to be fraught with opportunities for more fraud and more more or less security i should say yeah yeah as long as it's not a recall of gavin newsom i guess they don't really care about about the rules and the standards huh you have your own election security bill on the table you said this quote i've introduced legislation to strengthen the electoral college process by ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars do not support presidential elections in states that violate the constitution by failing to follow state election statutes it was a major issue this past november talk about your bill rob what it would do is it would force an audit of all the states that the federal elections that took place across the states in 2020 there were some very serious constitutional problems that took place and these problems would have to be addressed they'd have to be fixed before they'd get another federal dollar over 800 million dollars was spent on quote election security in the 2020 election and if states are going to violate the constitution they certainly don't deserve to get any of that federal money that makes sense to me it absolutely does i want to finally end here talking about puts real teeth into it yeah no absolutely i totally understand want to end on schools here jen sake today asked about when high schools might be reopening we are thrilled to have secretary cardona confirmed and he is as you know going to be hosting an education summit to talk about the reopening of schools but i will leave it to the secretary of education to determine the timeline or the path forward for high schools i guess if you're a parent don't hold your breath on high school's reopening would be the message of that right i tell you rob so much for president biden's promise that he'd have schools reopened within 100 days this has been just pathetic i think what you heard the white house press secretary say is we still have no plan that's where they are right now yeah and i i wish i could say that i'm surprised by that but i'm not we know the situation between the unions and the president and everything else it's uh it's a mess right now uh the brand new senator from the state of tennessee teachers may like it but uh and the teachers union may like this but certainly not the parents and the students it's putting us well behind yeah absolutely these kids have been out for way too long i couldn't agree more with that senator bill hagerty from the state of tennessee sir thank you so much for the time thank you rob good to be with you all right

Devil's Lake Crater Lake to deep State cops and everywhere man I've been Senator Tom Cotton has been everywhere on the campaign Trail America he is now with me welcome back Senator cotton good to talk to you where are you today good morning Hugh it's uh great to be in the Tarheel State this morning in North Carolina where I'm campaigning with Ted Budd who's going to be a great United States Senator uh from North Carolina going to help us win the majority in just 13 days yeah Senator I I spent some time with your colleague Rick Scott this morning and I think not only will Ted Bud hold but so will the Pennsylvania Ohio and Wisconsin state senator Johnson just got off I know Nevada looks very good and Georgia looks great Arizona very good Colorado hopeful Washington State possible New Hampshire turning and do you know that Rick Scott talk to me about Connecticut this morning uh lure Levy in Connecticut is a great candidate I think she can beat big Blumenthal in what's shaping up to be a very compelling year uh for republicans and the reason for that is that voters all across the country um are deeply dissatisfied with Joe Biden uh and the Democrat radical agenda 13 inflation Rising crime a wide open border American and Retreat around the world and they are ready for a checking balance even in States like Washington and Colorado and Connecticut now Senator next week you and I are going to spend a lot of time talking about this brand new book Only the Strong which is maybe the most significant National Security book ever written by a sitting elected official uh that's a serious book we'll talk about that next week but against that backdrop last night's John Federman Dr Oz debate had won national security question one what is wrong with moderate this is what Senators do you guys do National Security there was one question yeah well if you as I explained it only the strong United States Senate has actually been an important check across our history on the left's globalist ideology for instance when the United States Senate stopped uh the League of Nations under Woodrow Wilson which would have committed us to a World's Banning network of alliances committing us to go to war in far off places we had no vital National Security interest that's one reason why progressives like Barack Obama and Joe Biden now try to bypass the Senate uh when it comes to important treaties but as farther as I explained and Only the Strong Our sources of power often start here at home and one thing I want to highlight from the betterment Oz debate last night is John fetterman's misleading answer on hydraulic fracturing that's the technique uh that our wildcatters and our Roughnecks use to get oil and gas out of fields that have uh previously been unrecoverable it's what's made America the world superpower when it comes to oil and gas production but John fetterman just like Democrats in Washington want to ban it because they have intentionally waged war on American fossil fuel production this is not an accident it's not bad luck that gas is four or five dollars a gallon around the country it's an intentional Choice by the Democrats that as I explained in a little strong Only the Strong and we're going to talk a lot about it because I want people to have their eye on the ball last night there was one national security question it was uh directed uh Dr Oz very artfully turned it to the Iran deal very artfully Eric because he's talking there to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Jewish communities in particular but also to everyone concerned with National Security and Friends of Israel everywhere in the Keystone State I thought it was elegantly done of course I think maybe the moderators are localhost and they don't know what to do with that but you've been everywhere does the Iran deal come up ever because it should it's so destabilizing it's such a disaster yeah because remember the Iran nuclear deal is about much more than Iran's nuclear program uh it kind of reflected the Deep ambivalence that the progressive left has about America Barack Obama didn't view that deal simply as a way to constrain their nuclear program it did not in fact constrain their nuclear program as I explained Only the Strong Barack Obama blamed America for the Decades of tension between our country and the ayatollahs it didn't blame the ayatollahs for their Campaign Of Terror and murder of Americans for 43 years he thinks it goes back the 1950s when he wrongly believes that we somehow overthrew supposedly democratically elected prime minister and if America would simply pull in our horns and atone for our sins and appease the ayatollahs then we would be able to redeem ourselves from all the sins and we'd be able to retreat from the Middle East which is another way of saying abandoning our allies there like Israel or Saudi Arabia or the United Arab immigrants so it's much deeper than just the nuclear program Iran has it's about the Deep ambivalence that the left has about America itself that's right Only the Strong energy from a lot of these candidates it is it yeah I I came into this professional life working for Richard Nixon ghosting the real war with him and I haven't seen a book this significant on National Security in the course of an election that's why we're going to spend a couple of segments a day for the next week talking about Only the Strong so that people understand National Security is behind this election now I want to talk about General bulldog in New Hampshire I didn't give him a shot I didn't give Michelle I wrote him off well it turns out it's a tie I spent all summer in Maine watching Maggie Hassan ads run without you know because there was a Republican primary it's late it's too bad Chris Nuna would beat Maggie hasn't by 25 points but he's not running what about General Bulldog have you been up there is he going to win yeah I've been up to New Hampshire on several occasions I've endorsed General Boulder he's a great American uh he served and sacrificed for our nation and I believe he will win uh in New Hampshire in part because Granite senators are tired of Maggie Hassan being a rubber stamp for Joe Biden again she voted uh for every single Biden initiative over the last two years cast a decisive vote not just on uh passage of bills like the two trillion dollar inflation-causing stimulus they passed last year but on specific amendments that Granite Snyder's view is astonishing she voted for instance to make sure that stimulus checks continued going to prisoners people like the Boston Marathon bomber or consider the fact that she was the decisive vote on the U.S attorney for Massachusetts well why does that matter the granite Staters that the U.S attorney in Massachusetts is now a Soros prosecutor because New Hampshire like so much in the country is in the grips of the opioid epidemic and so many of those drugs are coming from Boston up I-95 in New Hampshire on issue asker issue Maggie Hassan has been a rubber stamp for Joe Biden and granted snaters know that a vote for Maggie Hassan is a vote for Joe Biden wears a vote for Don moldick is a vote to put a check and a balance in Washington well I I believe we are on the cusp of the great vomiting out of Democrats I believe it is a national referendum on a broken party and one of the things behind that is the Border I you again You've Been Everywhere I have two not everywhere I haven't done what you've done and what others have done but I've been out in a lot of states with a lot of candidates I can't go anywhere people talk about inflation they talk about crime but boy do they talk about the border and they are worried Senator cotton well they should be worried about our border 5 million illegal aliens across their Border in less than two years since Joe Biden that's such a staggering number I I it's just such a staggering number it's like all it's almost like adding to Arkansas to the country's population on top of the 15 to 20 million illegals we already had here now even if you presume every single one of them is simply coming here because they want to have a better job and find a better life for their families um which I don't begrudge the aspiration it is still terrible for our own citizens because it's going to take their jobs it's going to drive down their wages it's going to make it harder for them to find housing or for them to get their kids into a school that's not overcrowded or to get through an emergency room when their kid is sick or when they're injured but it they're not all just coming here for better jobs and a better life you many of them are coming here because they're gang members or their cartel members and drug traffickers that are unleashing crime and drugs especially fentanyl into our communities which is one reason why we had a hundred and seven thousand drug deaths last year in America and that's got probably going to happen again this year on Joe Biden's watch you know Senator last month you know even if you're not on the Mexican border every state is a border state last month 20 terrorist watch people were arrested by the border patrol that doesn't tell us how many got through they had 98 in the last year which is five times what the previous five years have done it's as though Joe Biden said that don't even bother don't even try so now let me get to the hard question uh Monday night coaching Mrs Hewitt and I had dinner with a very wired washed Insider I said well Republicans are going to win the senate in the house what will they do with it I said one thing they'll do is a Reconciliation that will up defense spending now in only this and direct it to the Navy which you write about at length and Only the Strong would you explain to people how you can actually use reconciliation to work with an infirm and and I don't know how I describe President Biden I don't know if he'll be serious I don't know what his team is it's weakness personified Only the Strong makes that point by the way people can pre-order it'll arrive on Monday Only the Strong but could you get a defense budget through that serious under reconciliation well Hugh I certainly will be working to do so as I explained Only the Strong um our defense budget now is at historic lows uh we had a small and a temporary boost during the Trump era but that really went to fill some of the gaps that had Arisen during Obama's second term but we're now uh as low as we were during the Clinton drawdown in the 1990s as low as the dangerous drawdown uh under Harry Truman right before the Korean War we have to invest more in our fighting men and women and we can use the reconciliation process which is again a way to pass something to the Senate with a simple majority not crossing the 60 vote threshold that relates to taxes and spending and obviously increasing the defense budget would do exactly that it is an urgent priority that we grow the size of our force that we complete the modernization of our fighter aircraft and our naval ships both manned and unmanned and that we can continue to invest in the kind of basic missiles and other Munitions that we need to counter China in the Western Pacific okay very last adolesfield question in the DeSantis knockdown of Charlie crisp boy that was brutal uh I felt bad for fetterman because he's ill and he's bad but but Charlie Chris had it coming to him he got tattooed by Ron DeSantis who quoted uh chief justice Roberts in Seattle School District I think number seven the way to end discrimination on the basis of races to stop discriminating on the basis of race and I thought I told Ted Cruz yesterday I want to moderate the debate or the Forum between cotton and Pompeo and Cruz and DeSantis so and any other Harvard or Yale lawyers out there to talk about the affirmative action case and ask you all yeah I think America even behind all these other issues we've talked about Americans are perplexed at what has happened to racial Harmony in the United States I think they blame Barack Obama and I know they hate affirmative action well I uh it's sort of one of the rare occasions when I do think that Justice John Roberts got it right and put it well when he said the best way to end counting by race in America stopped counting by race it's divisive it highlights our differences uh not our common Humanity it mistreats uh our fellow citizens judging them based on the color of their skin rather the content of their character is Dr Martin Luther King put it or simply on their accomplishments I believe the Supreme Court is going to put an end to it this term begin to say that governments at all levels of all kinds can no longer discriminate against anyone based on the color of their skin we are going to get to Only the Strong next week a lot because I want National Security on people's minds 32nd Senator you're a serious man these are serious times do you think voters are going to vote seriously yeah I do Hue absolutely that's one reason why you're beginning to see movement in all these states and all these districts um you know voters are simply fed up uh with the failures of Joe Biden which has brought us impoverished our our people um open our borders endangered us around the world um you know when Democrats are starting to spend money to defend the chairs of their own campaign committees or defend incumbents and districts that Joe Biden won by 10 or 12 points uh you know that a massive repudiation is coming we'll talk about National Security next week Only the Strong a big series next week on the Hugh Hewitt show thank you Senator Tom Cotton stay tuned

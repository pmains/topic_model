good afternoon everyone um on behalf of um senator brown myself welcome to uh to today's hearing this i know i just sing to uh senator brown we may be the only hearing in the senate today i don't know but uh the uh the others are dropping like flies but uh you got uh you see the two of us here you know we're serious about saving some money and uh and we uh we are for uh for our country but uh we're glad that our witnesses could be here and today and all our guests as well but today we're going to examine the challenges that our federal government faces managing its real property and in particular its reliance on space that's leased from the private sector to satisfy long-term real estate needs i just addressed a group uh over in the house side a little while ago scott and they they come from the accounting industry the auditing industry and actually do a whole lot of work as a firm to uh to uh support the gao's efforts with respect to um high-risk lists you know high risk for using a lot of money uh taxpayer money but uh we we have had a number of hearings in the past about a real estate high risk and we have literally thousands of pieces of property sent around those thousands of pieces of property that the federal government owns that we pay uh utilities for maintenance for security for that we ought to get rid of we don't use them and we also find out that there's something else that we're spending a lot of money for and that's we and the gao's been reminding us for a couple of years and that is we are have a lot of agencies that lease space for years in some cases for decades and we'd save a lot of money they'd save a lot of money if instead of leasing we'd actually buy the stuff and there's a lot of instances where it actually makes a lot of sense to uh to lease like the department of the census office you know every 10 years you do a census doesn't make sense to you know to buy all those pieces of property they're going to use once every 10 years but that's a little bit of of of a background here but there's a general consensus that our federal government has to get smarter about the ways we manage our buildings and land presidents and both parties now have made doing so a top management priority and with concerns over the implication of our deficit or national debt and mounting eliminating waste achieving cost savings in this area remains a top priority for us and and i hope for the rest of our colleagues in the house and the senate and the administration between 2001 and 2009 we ran up as much debt as you know as we did in the first 208 years of our nation's history last year we ran up what may be the largest budget deficit in our nation's history with most of here in washington are while most of us here in washington are united in our desire to find a solution to our nation's fiscal problems we're still facing an ocean of red ink as far as the eye can see even after enactment earlier this week of the spending cuts included in the legislation to raise our country's debt ceiling a wide variety of ideas have been put forward on how to reduce our budget deficit and begin whittling down our debt last fall a majority of the bipartisan deficit commission appointed by president clinton co-chaired by uh alan simpson former republican senator from wyoming and by erskine bowles former uh chief of staff to then president bill clinton they provided us along with their colleagues on the deficit commission a road map to reduce accumulative federal deficits over the next decade by some four trillion dollars and at the same time getting uh getting reform of our entitlement programs tax reform um pretty comprehensive approach bipartisan comprehensive and uh would actually not be just a like a deal uh it would actually be a solution to the challenge that that we face and they their work is uh reinforced by the gang of six three democrats three republicans and uh unfortunately in my view unfortunately president uh eventually filed the lead too late as it turned out and the leaders of the house and senate democrat and republican didn't follow it at all and that's a sad thing i think for for this country but as a result we settled uh this week for a bill that reigns in discretionary spending does little to tackle our long-term uh financial challenges and in short again it was a deal not a solution and not a very good deal as far as i'm concerned it only addresses the symptoms of our nation's fiscal ailments specifically the debt ceiling but failed to cure our serious disease of debt and deficits and unfortunately we largely put off until tomorrow at least later this year maybe early next year what we ought to have been doing right right now and as uh senator brown has heard me say probably more times than he wants to remember now but uh i said a lot and my staff certainly feels that way but i'm going to keep saying for as long as i'm around here a lot of americans believe that those of us here in washington uh aren't capable of making or taking the difficult steps that are necessary to put our country back on the right fiscal track and given what's happened in recent weeks it's easy to see why they feel that way they don't think we can do the hard work we're hired to do that is to effectively manage the tax dollars that they entrust us with they look at the spending and the tax decisions we've made in recent years and also the poor management across government and question whether the culture here is broken they question whether we're capable of making the kind of tough decisions that american families make with their own budgets and i don't like blame folks for being skeptical especially in light of the rate we've seen in recent months and the deal that we arrived at in recent days now more than ever we need to establish a different kind of culture here in washington when it comes to spending we need to move from what i have described here many times as a culture of spendthrift to a culture of thrift and this shift must involve looking in every nook and cranny of the federal government and asking this question about all kinds of programs domestic programs discretionary programs entitlement programs uh how do we get a better result for less money or how do we get a better result for the same amount of money when it comes to property management it's clear to me and others that we can get better results and we can save money federal property management has been on the government accountability office's high risk list since january of 2003 in part due to significant amounts of underutilized and excess property this problem is coupled with the fact that federal agencies depend on costly too often depend on costly lease space to meet new space requirements although building ownership has proven to be more cost effective over time not always but oftentimes the most recent comprehensive data available shows that federal agencies apparently possess more than forty five thousand underutilized buildings totaling more than 340 million square feet in space these buildings cost nearly 1.7 billion dollars annually to secure and to maintain fixing that problem doesn't balance the budget but it's a great step in in the right direction but in addition for the past 20 years geo has been telling us that we've been too reliant on leasing since 2008 gsa has at least more property than it owns and in fiscal years 2011 the the agency will spend over five billion dollars to house federal employees in 184 million square feet of private office space in addition while gsa serves as the central leasing agent for the federal government and is responsible for managing and obtaining space for agencies many agencies have obtained their own leasing authority and in doing so have chosen not to take advantage of gsa's expertise in federal real estate given that many of these agencies lack experience in performing lease procurements they often bind the government into costly long-term lease obligations that result in millions of dollars in additional costs to the federal government actually tens of millions and maybe even hundreds of millions of extra dollars in costs for example the u.s security exchange commission is in we know this from all too well but is an agency that has been granted independent leasing authority along with other some other agencies in july 2010 the commission entered into a sole source lease for 900 000 square feet of space city privately owned building called constitution center in washington that lease would have cost taxpayers some 556 million dollars over 10 years although the sec has held independent leasing authority for more than 20 years the commission's inspector general has found that the agency still lacks adequate policies and procedures for managing its leasing actions in fact this was the second time within the past five years in which the sec was involved in an unnecessary unnecessarily expensive leasing arrangement unfortunately this is not the only agency that operates this way similar in uh similarly in 2006 the fbi executed a 30-year operating lease to house employees in its chicago field office that cost an estimated 40 million dollars more than construction over a 30-year period fortunately both congress and the obama administration are united in their commitment to address these issues the president's latest budget included a recommendation to form a civilian property realignment board to review the government's property portfolio and dispose of those deemed access in an expedited manner and i think if i'm not mistaken that senator brown may have actually introduced legislation to codify that that proposal this is a proposal that my colleagues and i on the homeland security and government affairs committee had an opportunity to examine on our june 9 real property hearing and while the proposal focuses primarily on assisting agencies in the disposal of excess and underutilized buildings it does provide for opportunities to consolidate or co-locate operations which could ultimately help reduce the government's leasing portfolio i have concerns about the cost and effectiveness of the president's approach but i look forward to taking what works in his proposal in senator brown's legislation along with other ideas and introducing a bill in the fall that will help right-size the government's portfolio in a way that is advantageous for federal agencies for community stakeholders and the clientele served by those agencies clearly the momentum is building to address a widely recognized problem yet in all of our zeal to say we must be intelligent in our approach rome i'm told wasn't built in a day the federal government's bloated property portfolio cannot be unbuilt in a day we have an opportunity though to do this right and change the way the federal government manages its hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assets that said the agency shouldn't be waiting for a civilian brac to solve their problems or at least began to solve their property management problems now in an era of shrinking budgets and scarce resources it's critical that agencies come up with innovative property management tools that will identify opportunities to right-size our real estate portfolios reduce costs and achieve savings by eliminating unneeded assets in expensive long-term space before i turn it over to senator brown we just say every now and then and i'm i'm sure scott's notices we misalign incentives we have we misalign incentives in the federal government the we incentivize the wrong kind of behavior and then we get the the wrong kind of results and what we do within the federal government we incentivize a lot of federal agencies to lease the incentives are the least and with the way that we we call if you don't know if you want to buy a building or something like that up front uh even if that makes sense long term we incentivize them with the way that we score the the that expenditure in first year as opposed to leasing which could be scored for 10 20 30 years or even more and one of the things i hope comes out of this hearing today are in terms of some good discussion on how we change those incentives getting property aligned so that we not only meet the space needs of our agencies but we need to meet better need the fiscal constraints of our of our country so i look forward to this hearing from our witnesses and what we both do is you share with us your thoughts on how to transform our asset portfolio in a way that generates significant and lasting savings to the public and without i'm happy to turn over to senator scott brown of massachusetts

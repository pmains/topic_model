senator paul is recognized you know advocates of uh change are beseeching congress for federal regulation of college sports really be careful what you wish for the history of government regulation is not a benign one what starts as a soft touch may well ultimately morph into a heavy hand what happens if the democratic socialists of america win will universities become co-ops or communes will presidents and secretaries and coaches and players salaries be equalized be careful what you wish for i think it's a terrible rot and no good idea to federalize college sports the ncaa should promulgate their own rules if the ncaa needs exception from anti-trust rules to create these rules i could support that but setting federal rules for college sports is a huge mistake advocates of federalizing college sports argue oh we'll have a hodgepodge of rules and all the different states will have rules we hear this from the business community and i have opposed it steadfastly federalizing the rules is a mistake you may start out with rules you like but they may well morph into something that's intolerable the argument also ignores that the ncaa is particularly poised to promulgate nationwide rules because losing membership in the ncaa is a significant cudgel to enforce a nationwide rule on name image and likeness i would propose that the ncaa can do this on themselves but we should not involve washington we should not involve congress it is a mistake to take this away from the ncaa and those who represent the ncaa from colleges my argument is if you choose not to obey the ncaa rules and they kick you out of the ncaa it's going to be hard to get players it's going to be hard to have a division one or an accepted program if you don't obey the rules this should be left to the ncaa i don't think anybody on the committee agrees with me so i won't ask any questions and i'll only take a couple of minutes but i would suggest if we do another hearing like this we ought to get somebody on the committee who actually thinks it's a bad idea to federalize college sports and that there are is an argument that could be made for the ncaa doing this on the room thank you and i yield back my time i think senator paul's

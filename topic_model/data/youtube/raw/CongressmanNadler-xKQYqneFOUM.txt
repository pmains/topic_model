well let's bring in new york congressman jerry nadler he represents part of brooklyn and miller manhattan which were hard hit by hurricane sandy and welcome back we spoke with you yesterday i want to ask you about today though some pretty harsh words from both you and your colleagues today you were talking about the actions today as being the most callous you'd ever seen that house leadership needs to be condemned on what grounds what do you mean were you talking about those 67 gopros that voted nay are you just talking about the whole process in general well we weren't talking about what happened today we were talking about the whole process in general i mean the 9 billion that was voted today was simply to bail out the federal insurance fund that would otherwise go bankrupt next week and not only for new york and new jersey but for the whole country no it's been now 70 or so day since since october 29th when hurricane sandy hit other pla other times other disasters are hurricane katrina we passed 64 billion dollars in 10 days here we've got a major storm major damage thousands and thousands of people hurting thousands of small businesses going under threatened to go under and it's it and the action the other night delayed by a further three to four weeks any real aid coming to our region and that will mean that several thousand businesses cannot hold out and probably will go under just from that delay uh never mind the delay up until now uh and and that's unconscionable that that people that we would not vote the help that we normally vote very quickly and that would that it would be so delayed and that people are opposing it on grounds of this pork which there isn't um but they're also supposing it opposing it some i mean is it is it a geographical design i mean how divide how do you explain the fact that 67 republicans voted against this bill even well the the flood insurance there is an actual argument that can be made against federal flood insurance and that's an ongoing dispute and i'm not that concerned with those 67 people today frankly i'm much more concerned with the house leadership that still hasn't brought the full bill to the floor that could have brought it to the floor today they could have brought it to the floor today and they didn't have to wait another two weeks um and and and by not doing it the uh the other day when we should have done it uh all the work in the senate uh that worked to get that bill passed which it was has to be redone the senate's gonna be busy with the nuclear war over filibuster reform and that may delay this so we don't know when or if this is going to come through well i was going to say do you think that may endanger its passage and before you even answer that i do want to play your rather reaction get reaction to your comments made by congressman darrell isa i mean he spoke about this on the floor and he says he threatens to vote against the second part of this relief bill so let's listen to what he said the pork that we will not vote on today is in fact the pork that was in this bill from the senate and i my hope is that we will see in january 15th a negotiated clean bill that only deals with the men and women and families on the eastern seaboard that need to be taken care of and your calling from the other side of the aisle peter king says this is a thousand percent wrong so what's your reaction to this well uh ice as as he often does on many issues is bringing up a red herring uh for political reasons the fact is as peter king said uh the so-called items of pork some of them very uh meritorious but not directly relating to sandy were not in the house bill they were in the senate bill they were taken out of the house bill that we didn't vote on so that's a completely red herring to even talk about it at this point okay well gerald nadler then we are going to leave it there thank you very much and we'll be watching with the second part of that vote you're quite welcome you

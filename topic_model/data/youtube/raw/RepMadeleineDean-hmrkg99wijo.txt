joining me now is the democratic representative madeleine dean of pennsylvania she's one of nine impeachment managers for trump's unprecedented second impeachment trial she's a member of the judiciary committee and she's actually my representative when i'm in the philly area representative dean good to see you thank you for being with us uh how are you preparing because we don't have a date for when this will happen are you preparing nonetheless are you are you getting ready with your co-impeachment managers to go to trial good morning aly and stay safe we are preparing we're working every single day together and then i'm doing preparation on my own reading and writing in preparation for the the trial and the solemn duty that we have i thank you for covering this with the urgency that it requires because let's remember what happened here and mob that was incited by the president radicalized by the president for his own political gain uh attacked the capital they wanted to assassinate the speaker they wanted to hang the vice president and they hunted down members of congress these are all in violation of the president's constitutional oath and amount to high crimes and misdemeanors you said to our hometown paper the philly inquirer the first impeachment was serious and grievous and amounted to high crimes and misdemeanors against our country but this one is so much worse and you know the last one undermined american security and undermined american foreign policy it was a lot of bad things but this was just that much more direct this was an actual go storm the capital stopped them from counting stop democracy in its tracks the president incited americans to attack americans it's the saddest thing it's also an incredible constitutional crime uh as liz cheney said never has there been a greater betrayal by a president of his or her oath of office uh it's a it's an attack by americans on americans and of course it's an attack by attacking the capital on our very seat of democracy trying to unstabilize the seat of democracy in a desperate grab for power are you concerned that by the time this gets the the senate and donald trump is out of office there are some republicans because you'd need some republicans to uh vote in favor in favor of conviction who will say the urgency is no longer there donald trump's it not in office anymore what's your uh what's your guidance to them i appreciate that and my hope is that uh all the senators will listen uh with the urgency the moment requires and perform their constitutional duty uh to impeach and convict uh what i believe is if we don't do this what does that say he is not accountable for constitutional crimes what does that say to future leaders would-be leaders that at the end of your uh term when you know you're headed out of office you can go on a crime spree and the the house and the senate will not hold you accountable this is for accountability this is for deterrence this is for history uh also to prevent this president from ever holding office again and again one of the things that you said again to philly inquire is that this is a career-defining vote for these senators for a lot of them it is political calculus right being not on the wrong side of donald trump is is almost and maybe more important than not being on the wrong side of history and and i know that political calculation uh i i keep thinking of john lewis's last essay you remember when he died last summer he he posted an essay in which he said democracy is not a state is it is an act in my mind it's a series of acts and so i take the solemn duty to be among these talented impeachment members and the senators they have an act to perform they have many acts to perform of citizenship and of their oath of office so i hope every single one of the senators recognizes this is not a political decision this is absolutely your sworn oath madeleine dean good to see you thank you for being with us we'll of course watch what you and your impeachment manager colleagues are doing very closely over the coming days democratic congresswoman madeleine dean of pennsylvania is a 2021 impeachment manager in the forthcoming senate trial against donald trump

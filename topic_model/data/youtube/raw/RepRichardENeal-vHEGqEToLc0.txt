Mr Speaker I stand in support of HR 264 this bill appropriates desperately needed funds for Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service as the shutdown persists the financial and emotional drain on employees and taxpayers continues there are tens of thousands of furloughed Treasury Employees who want to work and proudly would do so but they cannot they also cannot pay bills cannot afford medical care and like us cannot understand any of this every day that passes and every minute this shutdown continues it's too long and too costly reopen the government and begin to negotiate I spoke to the Treasury secretary yesterday along with the IRS commissioner as well regarding the impact of the partial shutdown on the IRS and tax filing season I was informed that the IRS will release its contingency plan for tax filing season in the next few hours or certainly within the next day issuing refunds and coming days apparently the an effort will be made to reach that goal but it will also require a significant number of IRS employees to return to work without pay these developments are no substitute for fully funding the government and reopening the agency reminder the average refund is just under three thousand dollars that helps out a lot of middle-class individuals who will use it to pay down Christmas debt perhaps they depend upon that as part of regular cash flow mr. Speaker we do not know the full damage and cost of this shutdown but we knew going into it that somebody was going to get hurt so we should end it today before any more damage is done if a taxpayer calls the IRS right now for assistance they will hear the following quote live telephone assistance is not available at this time normal operations will resume as soon as possible but they're expected to go in to work as well to help process those tax forms the time is now to reopen the government and as I noted negotiate time has come for our colleagues on both sides to stand up and vote yes and fully reopen these agencies and I yield back the balance of my time

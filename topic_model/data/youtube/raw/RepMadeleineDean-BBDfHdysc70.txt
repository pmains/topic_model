and welcome to this telephone town hall this is Madeline Dean I'm the congresswoman from the fourth congressional district of Pennsylvania Montgomery and Bucks County's I do thank all of you for getting on the call just for those of you who are joining us and please it's it's fine that anybody joins us at any time you're most welcome on the call know that the purpose of this telephone town hall is to bring you the most recent and accurate information on coronavirus or what is known as Co vyd 19 recognizing that things are not static and things are moving quickly and recognizing the gravity of this crisis joining me on the call importantly our state county and local leaders as well as experts and practitioners I will introduce them to you in just a moment what I thought I'd break this call into three parts the first part I'll give you a very brief overview from here in Washington DC at the federal level what we are doing second and I think more importantly the focus of this call is people that I've asked me to join me on this call so that they can give us a public health overview and guidance and third and even more importantly we will get to your questions so that's the break out of the call and just to lay this up we know that this is a very serious situation just two weeks ago there were only 15 known cases in the United States and now just two weeks later there are more than 1,200 I'm not a medical expert but fortunately we have some of those on the call with us so let me begin by just giving you very very briefly here in Congress I want to encourage you to know that it's clear that there is a bipartisan and I would suggest a nonpartisan understanding of the seriousness of this public health crisis that is coronavirus evidence of that is the fact that just last week we swiftly passed in the house and then passed the Senate and signed by the president a robust eight point three billion dollar supplemental bill to drive money to States to research to testing and much more tomorrow on the floor it's literally being debated tonight in rules will be a robust I hope that's what I've argued for appropriation set of bills to make sure that we here at the federal level recognize the disturbance that this will be to families to communities to workers to businesses to our children in their schools and so we will be considering and I hope passing tomorrow that legislation so know that the federal government here in Congress we are well aware of the seriousness of this situation and taking it with that same sense of seriousness so let me pivot to the second and more important part of this call where I've been in touch with many of the people who are going to be speaking with us tonight and I'll just briefly introduce them and more importantly I'd like them to just tell us briefly their background and much more importantly what they could tell us to bring us up-to-date on the call with me tonight I'm honored to have these folks with me dr. Valerie Arkush she is the chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners she will give us an update on the county level mr. mark Ross who is vice president of the emergency management for the hospital and health systems Association of Pennsylvania Ms Meg Megan excuse me Abbott she's director of intergovernmental affairs for the Pennsylvania Department of Health and finally dr. julie gerber ding who is the executive vice president and chief officer strategic communications global public policy and population health at merck that's a that's a mouthful she's an expert from merck and very importantly she is a former CDC director from 2002 to 2009 she will be able to offer us an important set of perspectives and so with that what I'd like to do is Valerie cush chairwoman and dr. Val R cush would you mind leading us off giving us a short bio on you and just about three minutes I know none of this is is adequate time but about three minutes so that we could run through all of our experts and government leaders but could you give us a County update and thanks for being on the call Thank You congresswoman Dean I really appreciate your inviting me to join you tonight and good evening to everyone who's listening in I am dr. Valerie Kirsch and chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners I am a physician and also have a background in public health and here in Montgomery County we currently as of this afternoon have nine cases nine individuals who have tested positive for the new corona virus we are the county with the most cases in the Commonwealth right now the majority of these cases have been been able to be traced to travel either within the United States or outside of the United States to areas where the virus is particularly active we currently want to reassure the public that this is something that we have prepared for and that 80 percent of the people who get this virus will have very very mild symptoms what we're asking people to think about is the folks for whom if they do get this disease they're at higher risk of more serious consequences that includes the elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions or individuals who are in you know compromised this disease is particularly challenging for people like that because the corona virus is a new unique virus never seen before and currently there is no treatment for it this is not the flu so if you've had a flu vaccine that doesn't give you any protection and the medications that are used to treat the flu are not effective for coronavirus so we're asking people in Montgomery County to really be very thoughtful about where they go we recommended today that people cancel public gatherings and even large private gatherings and that we need to come together as a community to protect those that are most vulnerable and put our personal convenience to a second position right now and with that I'll turn back Congress on the Dean and should be happy to take questions later thank you very much dr. orcish it really is a valuable and important perspective and I've had the pleasure of being on the phone with dr. our cushion the County Commissioners all week long on this issue and I know those conversations will continue next I'd like to ask mark mr. mark Ross vice president of emergency management for the hospital systems association - please introduce yourself and offer us your perspective good evening representative Dean thank you very much for this opportunity feel free anybody call me Matt thank you thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to the constituents as you said I'm the vice president of Emergency Management for the Hospital and Health System Association in Pennsylvania we are in partnership and under contract with the state Department of Health to provide emergency preparedness and management activities to all healthcare facilities in the state of Pennsylvania we provide facilitation administration and operational support to the seven Healthcare coalition's across the state of Pennsylvania these healthcare coalition our hospitals our nursing homes have been planning training exercising together for a number of years under a program called the HPP grant which representative Dean supports which provides for healthcare preparedness around the country through that program these the hospitals and health care systems in Pennsylvania have been working on things such as weather-related emergencies disease outbreaks to make sure that we are prepared to respond to these things this is continued under the guidance of the Pennsylvania Department of Health to include regularly calls with all of our health care providers across the state to give them the latest guidance to address best practices to hear their needs port them as much as we can and to respond to this disease in the state of Pennsylvania we have a robust group actively involved and I think the key message here is for the constituents to truly follow those good practices the good hand hygiene the covering of the coffin the sneezes the social distancing if you're if you're feeling ill getting your flu shot and if you feel ill to contact your provider and not just go to the emergency department contact your provider if you need that level of care that an acute care hospital can give they will advise that and that will help the hospital's respond to any surge in patients so that that appropriate level of care will allow for our health systems to be able to respond to those that do mean to care but we are partnered we are working as a good cohesive unit and with that representative I will pause thank you very much and I'm going to pass it off I misled the group here I had the wrong name for who will be representing the Pennsylvania Department of Health so I apologize we're going to be joined by ray Barris Hance key ray I apologize for not knowing it was you on the call he is deputy secretary for health preparedness and community protection Pennsylvania Department of Health Ray I'd like to toss it to you congresswoman there's no apology needed whatsoever I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight i am rebecca schinsky I'm a deputy secretary for health preparedness and community protection at the Pennsylvania Department of Health I have dr. Sharon Watkins our state epidemiologist with me as well I did want to just make a few comments in regard to what the Department of Health has done so approximately seven weeks ago we activated our Department of Health's departmental operation center or dock to allow for enhanced response coordination some of the entities that we regularly coordinate with include the hospital and Health Care Association of Pennsylvania including your previous speaker we have a very close relationship with as well as dr. Eric Uche as we coordinate with our county and municipal health department we've also gummed up some of our testing regarding Cove is 19 at the state laboratory are bringing in by purchasing excuse me and bringing in new equipment to increase our testing capability on top of communicating with half and our County Municipal Health County I mean a school health department's we do receive regular briefings from the Centers for Disease Control Health and Human Services and we've even had outreach from the White House staff to find out what's going on with state health departments and what's going on with boots on the ground some of our bureaus including our Bureau of Public Health preparedness have been more than actually engaged since day one on this and our Bureau of Epidemiology excuse me actually provide symptom monitoring for residents returning from areas impacted by coronavirus we do that in conjunction with the federal government as well we've reached out to healthcare providers to businesses and even educational providers with information and we've also reviewed and updated our pandemic plans to assure that we're ready for the spread of covin 19 as you probably know by now on March 6th governor wolf signed an emergency disaster declaration to ensure that all the state agencies are better involved with this response have expedited resources we need to continue our focus and to hopefully cut off some of the spread the Department of Health also provides regular updates via press releases and has regular press briefings as well I think one of the most important things to remember is that whether it's through our relationship with our County a municipal health department whether it's through the other relationships we have we have prepared for this our Bureau of Public Health preparedness regularly trains and exercises with other bureaus in our department for incidents and events just like this I have often told people that in situations like this this is not the time to panic this is the time to prepare and I will say one more thing before I finish and that is this speaks to the audience congresswoman as opposed to you personally and to the audience I say please only go to those social media sites that are reputable we would counsel you to go to the World Health Organization the CDC's website or even the Pennsylvania Department of Health website getting good and accurate information will help you prepare for this better thank you ray and Sharon I thank you both for being on the call and before I introduce our last speaker I just wanted to let all of you who are listening in on the call who would like to ask a question to just give you the instruction that I think you were given as you called in which is if you will press pound three am i right with that pound three okay pound three to ask a question and I asked if you would to be brief because we have a lot of people getting in the queue and also if you can try to direct your question to one of the participants on the call if you can I recognize you might not be able to do that we'll jump in they'll jump in to answer you but again pound three to ask a question our last expert and I thank you dr. Julie gerber ding for joining us she's executive vice president and chief patient officer at Merck and a former CDC director from 2002 to 2009 thank you so much congresswoman I have never participated in a constituent call before and this is the way it should happen all the time so thank you so much thank you I thought that it might be helpful to kind of put this particular outbreak into a broader context because I was the director of the CDC when the first new SARS coronavirus emerged back in 2003 so I have a little bit of understanding about how concerning things like this are when they first emerge and what it takes to really keep the public informed but ultimately to contain the outbreak so I will be happy to take questions about that but I just wanted to make a couple points so people could understand where we are right now whenever something new emerges the first step is of course to detect it we were lucky that that happened fairly fast in China and with the testing becoming more available we'll be in a better position to do that kind of detection here in the United States the second phase is to try to contain it at its source and by that I mean all of the things that were going on in China to try to basically lock down the society and not allow the virus to spread in China or elsewhere of course it was imperfect and the virus did transmitted and leaked out of China but I believe we did buy some time because of the amazing efforts that went on there and we've been using that time to better prepare in the u.s. once it spills over to the extent that it has and today the World Health Organization stated that we are in the middle of at least the beginning of a pandemic it is important to move beyond trying to stop every single case of transmission but rather to slow down the spread at the community level and that's what the previous speakers your wonderful public health leaders have been talking about on this call we are moving across our communities to say first and foremost people really should stay home if they're sick with anything that resembles a cold or a virus infection so that you don't have any chance of spreading what you have to someone else but second we can reduce the peak of the burden on our health system by all of us taking steps to avoid large crowds to stay away from situations where we can't really contain the space around us and we have to be concerned about somebody else who might be sneezing or coughing so that kind of social distancing is very important and ultimately the sorts of measures to keep the hands clean and to avoid coughing and sneezing in anything but a tissue or your sleeve they seem old-fashioned and something we might learn in kindergarten but they are actually work and are very important in helping to reduce the spread in the community so we are working hard to get the message out that people can protect themselves and they can help protect the vulnerable people in our society particularly the elderly people who are at a special risk for serious disease but the other part of it isn't just slowing down spread the other part is making sure that we do balance that with the things we need to do to maintain our services and our safety and the security and most of all in this situation our health system so when when we can we work and we do the same kinds of measures to protect others in their workplace that we would do in any other part of our community but it is important I work for Merck and we are working we are working that West Point which is in the district we have many people who live in in the fourth District and we're balancing the need to protect our workers from participating in transmission but also we make important medicines and vaccines that are necessary for the treatment of people who do get sick so we have a responsibility to keep those materials going and people in the fire and police department the people who keep your lights on etc etcetera all of us need to get the right balance between protecting workers but at the same time making sure that our society functions safely and securely the last thing I just want to point out is it's always challenging especially when something first arrives in the community because you get bombarded with information and sometimes it's conflicting information or you're in one community that's handling the situation in one way and one county over they may be doing something different that doesn't mean that anyone's making the wrong decision it just means that local circumstances and local requirements do vary fairly dramatically at the beginning of an outbreak so you can expect differences in how different parts of the county or different communities in our region will respond to this and that's just exactly the way it should be I'll just end by saying again thank you but also it's thrilling to me to hear from someone who represents us in the federal government but also the state government and the local government all really participating in the same conversation showing the strength of our public health system and how communities come together to respond so thank you so much thank you very much doctor so we now pivot to your questions which I think are awfully important and I thank you a lot of people have gotten in the queue to ask questions we'll try to move through as many as possible for anybody we don't get to I'd ask you to please go to our website and pose your question and we will get back to you we'll talk to the experts and we'll get back to you and continue the conversation and give you information my website is Dean dot house gov Dean DEA anyhow gov I think I see the first question here from Marlene and for those asking questions by the way again it's pound three to get in line to ask a question first question from Marlene dr. Julie I was wondering I know we don't have any vaccines or any particular medicines that help with the corona virus I was wondering if someone is hospitalized how are they treating them the most important thing for someone hospitalized is because usually that means they have pneumonia is to give the kind of supportive care that helps support their airway oxygen fluids and if they develop any additional complications sometimes antibiotics are required many of the patients who are hospitalized don't need critical care but those that develop a severe pneumonia also can be cared for in the intensive care unit and of course in America we have a much better chance of patients being able to survive even when they have severe disease because we do have such excellent critical care in our local hospitals so we can count on our health system to be really able to pull people through eventually the body's immune system makes its own antibodies to the virus and it will be able to clear it but sometimes that takes longer than the fragility of the patient and and that is the reason why we do see that some patients died from the infection thank you thank you we had a question from Ronald but I think he dropped off the line but I want to ask his question anyway because I think it's a good place to begin and maybe dr. Arco she could help me here what are the basic symptoms of the virus what are people supposed to look for great question so the symptoms of coronavirus are fever cough and difficulty breathing a runny nose is not really part of this so and now that we're moving into spring and people are starting to get allergy symptoms if your runny noses is your first symptom that is probably not corona virus so fever cough and difficulty breathing very importantly if you have those symptoms we want you to stay at home and call your health care provider it's very important that you not show up without warning at a hospital or urgent center or physician or nurse practitioners office because they need they need to take precautions to protect themselves to set up an isolation room just for the good of a hospital or a hospital emergency department for instance now if you are experiencing symptoms that are severe or feel life-threatening you should absolutely go ahead and call 911 EMS professionals are ready trained they have the proper equipment they will come get you and and get you to the hospital but if you're not experiencing that sort of life-threatening type of symptom we we want you to stay at home where you're isolated from others and use the phone as your first outreach or some people do have health insurance that provide for telemedicine consults that would be great too but the important thing is not to head out and potentially contaminate others with you know without them being prepared to receive you thank you our next call a question is from Cindy Cindy your you go ahead hi I don't really know who to direct this to but to what extent are you notifying possible contacts of people who have been infected with the virus wondering if Val at the county level you could tell us what you're doing and at the state level we could learn also I'd be happy to to describe that so when we get an individual who is called a presumptive positive that means that they have had a positive test at the state level then the sample goes on to the Center for Disease Control and the they recheck it and then that becomes a confirmed case but we don't want to waste any time so as soon as we get a presumptive positive one of the staff in our county office of public health begins a process called contact tracing and they call that injured individual and do an extensive interview of every person or place that they have been since that their symptoms started and if they can remember even the day or so before their symptoms started and then our employees will call each of those contacts and they will also call those businesses so if it is a business we ask that business to close and do deep cleaning before they can reopen again and one of our office of public health staff does go by the location and just make sure that everything has been done properly so but but just friends or coworkers or things like that we'll get a call from our Office of Public Health and they will be told that they had a direct contact with someone who is a presumptive positive the Pennsylvania Department of Health has been a wonderful partner in this work and in some cases they've been taking the lead on the contact tracing there's a there's a lot of work involved in this so it's a partnership between us so the call could come from either the state or from the county thank you ah did you want to answer that from the state level I was actually going to say I'm not really positive I'm looking at dr. Watkins right now is our state epidemiologist and I think dr. R Koosh did such a good job explaining the concept of contact tracing I'm not positive we have a lot to add to that Thank You dr. Cruz and we and I would also state that our relationship with the county municipal health department's is a strong one and we do our best to commute to over-communicate as much as humanly possible that's great our next question is coming from Cameron hi my question is in regard to school closure some schools have already closed and others aren't closing and it appears how uneven which schools are closing and which aren't for example a student's day at Nash elementary was tested for coronavirus after attending the school and it's currently quarantined but there's no willingness from the school district to close so I was wondering if there's any general strategy for school closures when schools should be closed and especially as we talk about social distancing and limiting group gatherings and I could I can take that too this is valor Koosh again so let me explain what's been going on with this school but it's a pretty fluid situation so when we do that contact tracing that I just described if we learn that a teacher or student or a worker at a school has had direct contact with a presumed positive case then we let the school super the school district superintendent know and we've been a very regular concentration have had regular contact and I've had several meetings with the school superintendents so we let them know what the situation is and who the individual involved is if let's just say that it's a student if it's a student that has had a direct contact with a presumptive positive patient then that student will be asked to leave the school and will be asked to self isolate for at least 14 days then we're asking the school to close whatever division that student was in or you know whatever parts of the school that student was in and do a deep clean and in some cases they have been closed for more than one day to accomplish all of that and then they are able to reopen because unless that student starts just show symptoms and gets tested and is positive then the people at the school are not considered exposed so that's why schools are the closing and then reopening we have not yet a case of a community spread transmission in a school we only I appreciated that answer this is Ray from the state the only additional comment I would like to add on to that is that it's important to remember that as of right now we haven't had any community spread of the virus in PA and I just want to add to that I'm wondering dr. Julie do you have from your experience and expertise do you have any guidance on the school closures I think this is one of the things I try to emphasize that you will see different things in different schools and this is a very rational approach for where we are right now in the absence of significant community spread one of the things about this coronavirus that is I guess in a sense the good news is that yes we know children can get infected but they tend to have the mildest illness so while they may be sources of exposure transmission to others as this evolves they themselves are not at high risk compared to the vulnerable elderly people that I was talking about earlier so in a sense that that's a that's a blessing because this is a fairly transmissible virus and we have less concern about the effect it will have on kids the reason that schools closed for longer periods of time even after there's been decontamination is really in a more advanced stage of an outbreak when you're closing schools so that children are not in direct contact with each other and they are not contributing to the development of ongoing community transmission but thankfully we're not in that situation in Pennsylvania right now so hopefully we can avoid that but if that begins to happen I'm sure that you will see more school closures and perhaps some of them will stay closed longer Thanks our next question is from dr. Karen hi I'm a private pediatrician for our small private practice and I would just like some information of what um doctors and small practice should do as far as getting testing now that it's becoming more available in the labs because it's very difficult for us to record the positive protective equipment that a lot of the stuff is on backorder so we're unable to get some of the gowns that we need to do that so I'm just looking for some some guidance there when we're going to be asked to do this testing hi this is dr. Watkins from the state and we are hearing that comment from providers and in fact we're hearing that comment from providers nationally and so I think it's important if you're not able to do the the specimen collection on-site and we understand that many providers are not to have really worked through your public health jurisdiction whether that be the state or Montgomery County to understand which facilities in your area are able to provide that specimen collection and arrange that for you either to provide courier to the Pennsylvania Bureau of laboratories or to utilize one of the commercial labs that has come on board okay thank you this is my doctor this is Sal our fish let me give you the number to our health department because they can help if you have someone that you think really needs to be tested we can help and that number six ten to seven eight five one one seven time go 610 to seven eight five one one seven right and in terms of just legislatively we had an update here in DC last week by Vice President pence who is spearheading the effort on the behalf of the administration along with dr. Tony votchin and others in terms of masks we know we are behind in stockpile and production and stockpile of masks the Supplemental bill that we passed and I hope we will pass more tomorrow we'll begin to deal with that we had some assurance from the administration that apparently 1 million masks are very close to delivery I certainly hope so but we need to make sure that we up the test kits and also the masks that is something that we are behind on there's no doubt about that our next question is from Ricky I'm wrong Ricky's off the line next question is from Carol I don't know would answer this question but I was wondering what the death rate is for people over 60 and the death rate for people over 80 I think it's important that people in families know what they're facing in order that they can you know make their plans I don't know who would answer that this is dr. Julie and I can sort of speak broadly about this unfortunately we cannot give you the exact death rate and the reason is complicated but it's because we are really best able to calculate that on who's in the hospital and has been tested but the vast majority of people with this infection probably aren't in the hospital and many haven't been tested so the death rate of people who have been so sick that they needed hospitalization and have undergone testing is is high depending on the stage of the outbreak somewhere between two and three percent and the older you are the higher it is but that is really an artificial estimate because the the less sick people are not included in the in the proportion so in other words we're looking at sick people how many died versus of the people who are overall infected how many died and in the United States thankfully because we're so early in this outbreak we really don't have enough information to understand what it's going to look like here we have better care than in many parts of China and other places where this outbreak has been going on longer so I suspect that we're going to see a lower death rate in the US than for example in in the early days when this was first breaking in China our next questioner is Stephen even did we lose you let me move on maybe Steven will come back how about Raymond are you available is there a possibility that less government will prevent all travel overseas I'll take the first shot at that this is Madeline the congresswoman and then maybe we could get some perspective from the experience of dr. Julie I guess there is a possibility that certainly isn't being discussed at this point but I have to tell you the real seriousness with which the leadership of the Congress is taking all of this with the goal as these experts are talking about containing and mitigating as much as possible the spread of this disease just I thought I would share with all of you my personal belief and and it has shifted over the course of our experience this past week we were in caucus today and we were briefed by a professor from Harvard an economics professor from Harvard took talking about the serious economic implications this is going to have and he said I thought very aptly he said if one week ago you had said to me we're going to be closing down Harvard to our students for the remainder of the semester I would have said that was ludicrous and he said they have since done that one week later they did that and he said it was no longer ludicrous it was obvious so something that seems so bizarre a week ago is obvious and necessary now so that's my my way of saying I don't know if the government will recommend or attempt to prevent overseas travel you've seen that Italy has certainly isolated itself and I know that airlines have stopped flights into Italy but beyond that I don't know I think part of the purpose of this call is to call upon every single one of us to use our common sense and to use all the all the things we can do to change our behaviors to make sure that we're not a part of any kind of spread I'm very mindful of it here in DC when I get back to the district we have postponed an awful lot of events because I don't want to put anybody at risk that's that's my thoughts dr. Julie do you have another idea yeah this is a place where the CDC website can be especially helpful and if you just google travel advice and coronavirus it will take you to the CDC's most updated recommendations about travel and what they've done is kind of create a layering of advice so clearly we are still strongly recommending that people avoid all non-essential travel to China in Iran where the outbreak is still still a very high threat that includes now South Korea and Italy because similarly there's just widespread ongoing rapid transmission in those communities for Japan the recommendation is not for everyone but if people have chronic medical conditions or our older they're advised to not travel to Japan right now either even though there's not as much spread going on in that country vulnerable people wouldn't want to take that chance and so they're advised to defer their travel the other thing relates to cruise ships and because we've seen how how easy it is to move the virus through a cruise ship based on the experience in the harbor in Japan the government CDC is recommending that people who people defer cruise travel right now and especially those with underlying health issues or those with older age because we've seen very significant transmission and a number of fatal cases associated with the cruise ship environment that's a little bit different from air travel because even though we'll feel closer to people and at higher risk on an airplane modern airplanes actually have very good air circulation and filtration and so your risk on an airplane is very low also the airlines have all recently come out with statements about how they're doing extra cleaning and really working hard to maintain the interior of the aircraft in in good shape but the general rule if you're someone who's vulnerable because your health is not optimal or because you're older and your immune system might not be as it used to be avoiding travel right now just makes sense I really agree with the congresswoman to just use common sense and we're kind of in it I call it the reset phase where we're just trying to understand what's going on kind of pausing hunkering down a little bit while we figure out what's going to be safe and what isn't going to be safe and I think over the next few weeks it'll become clear what is going to be happening here and we may be able to revise these restrictions our next question is from Steven yes hello Steven Berta from lower Providence my question is thinking two three four weeks ahead if the government tell us to stay put to quarantine where can we get the supplies such as basic necessities water basic food if we get to that obviously not to pay any fully understand that but what if it isn't available I think it makes sense for people to make some basic plans and have food and important supplies medicines and others on hand but maybe could the county and state speak to that issue speaking from the state perspective I believe that that's a prudent maneuver as well I think that again I counsel people regularly don't panic but prepare and buy prepare I mean like canned goods dry food water and making sure you have things like that in your own personal places of residence is exceptionally important at all times there could be a potential for people who who have been infected to actually have to quarantine and that means that you will be you could potentially be spending time in your place of residence so preparing for that now would be prudent and this is valour tush in addition to that it's a very prudent if you have any special needs in your home to prepare for that as well so for instance having some extra medications on hand all of the health insurance companies in Pennsylvania have waived the 30-day limit for prescription refills so you can stock up and get a little bit of extra medication certainly if you have pets if you have babies or anyone in the home that has a specific dietary need it would be good to stock up on that now and you know we know how to do this I mean we prepare for blizzards and hurricanes and all those things here so again it's just as very common-sense preparations so that you have what you need just in case you have to stay at home for a few days it's it's unlikely that we would be unable to leave our homes at all I think the way to think about this is to reduce the number of times that you have to leave your home so you know if you know if you're one of those people that tends to go grocery shopping you know every day or every other day and just picks up that day's food you know think about buying maybe four five days worth of food just so you don't have to leave your home as much our next question is from Richard Richard are you there maybe while we try to find Richard again is Denise available I think Denise had a question here hello go ahem yes my concern was I have an elderly 93 year old father-in-law that's in a skilled care nursing home and my concern was visitation will the county stop Alki visitation so people won't be coming in and to see the acet - representative this is mark Ross I'll be glad to answer that we actually today on a call with skilled nursing homes push the latest guidance which is restricting visitation to those that are essential so for the care of your loved one for the protection of your loved one the staff that are taking care of them but we ask that you restrict that visitation that you call ahead and that if you are for some reason essentially need to go see your loved one to make sure you're well but the the new guidance is too restricted so that we can keep any potential spread out of any healthcare setting and that goes for all of the health care and mark I apologize was there anything else you wanted to talk about with the random questions that we had or the important series of questions that we had from the Hospital Association's point of view III think it is that common sense representative it is that social distancing it's not going in to a healthcare setting if you're ill it's checking using technology to visit with your loved one rather than going in and and potentially exposing yourselves or the ones that are being cared for for the staff that need to take care of our loved ones I I think that is the imperative message if we can help to mitigate the spread then our healthcare system in the region and then the state can respond to those that truly need the care and this is Madeline again speaking a little bit from personal experience with my mother-in-law in a nursing home I've been in contact with them and under the guidelines from vice president pence who across the board they have increased the standards for nursing homes as it relates to coronavirus but the common-sense approach is what I know the nursing homes I'm talking to are taking as well the medical scientific ones keeping patients in their rooms rather than having them collect in their congregate in the halls asking families to stay back if they think they are at any risk or not well and some nursing homes are restricting outside visiting so it's we know that is certainly one of the most vulnerable populations and we hope we can keep it away from nursing comes in our area and of course across the country our next call or question I should say is from Rehema yes I hi regular for link code me and my family was talking about cuz we live in a gated community it's an airborne like can we go on the elevator somebody possibly have it we're not touching the knobs at this point but palm yesterday someone did get on the elevator was you can tell he was very sick so we were like what is it airborne it is something that you can actually contract just by getting the one we're getting near a person that may have it but imagine doctors so this is dollar cash the virus has passed through respiratory droplets like when you cough so that is why there's several very important preventive measures one is we're asking everyone to work as hard as they can to keep their hands clean so keep hand sanitizer with you and wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds also don't shake people's hands don't hug people that you don't know well or where they've been and try not to touch your face which is almost impossible but if you do get the virus on your fingers and then you scratch your lip or your nose the virus can get in that way what's recommended is to stay six feet away from people like if you're in a line or that type of thing and it was when it comes to something like the elevator buttons or door handles we aren't a hundred percent sure as you've heard on this call this is a new virus and we believe that the virus will stay alive on a surface like a countertop or a door knob for some amount of time but it's not really known how long that time is so you know if you can use your elbow to press the elevator button and do something like that that's certainly recommended yes thank you our next question is from Rachel heard that there is a presumed positive case here sorry am i my life yes start your question again I'm sorry sorry that's okay so I live in Cheltenham and I have heard that there's a presumed positive case here so I was wondering if that could be confirmed and also what are the towns in Montgomery County where there are either presumed positive or convert confirmed positive cases Adela Fowler Kish yes you are correct there is a consumptive positive case in Cheltenham Township and I'm glad you asked about where to go to get more information the county has a data hub that has been up since the weekend and you can get to that by going to Moscow pa dot o-r-g so that's mo n t CR PA that orj and about halfway down the page with our County homepage you'll see something that says coronavirus update if you click on that that will take you to our data site which is being updated at least once a day and also on and you'll be able to see a Mac on that page of the townships where we have presumptive positive patients and then there's a whole host of resources right there on that page symptoms preventive suggestions what you should have in your home if you want to prepare link to advice for employers or schools all sorts of things and it is really an extremely up-to-date and a very valid source of information okay it's really helpful we will keep our website up to date for you also and also please send in any questions that you have so please be sure to visit my website as well as we update things as we're waiting for the next caller in the queue I did want to add something some of the legislation that we are putting together really an emergency fashion today tonight and we'll vote and I hope passed tomorrow deals with some of the other incredible rippling effects that this will have whether people are going to be paid when they are need to stay home so paid sick leave paid family leave what do businesses do when they have employees staying home we need people if they are sick as these experts have said to stay back to stay home but we know that many people either don't have the insurance or don't have the paid leave through their employer some of the emergency supplemental bills that we are going to be passing tomorrow will deal with those issues and will offer stimulus in order to make sure that folks have coverage for sick leave for family leave importantly also for food for the SNAP program for the WIC program we want to make sure that if schools have to close and some children many children are dependent upon schools for there are several two meals a day that make we make sure that these children have adequate food that families have adequate food we're also looking at businesses and making sure that we are supporting businesses and businesses are supporting us in dealing with this crisis and so supporting business owners particularly small business owners who may not have the flexibility and the cash to support folks staying home and paying them we as a government at least I know in our caucus we believe very strongly that we have to support businesses families children for food and for income because this can have devastating economic effects across our country with that let me see who is next Gary our next question is from Gary my name is Gary I'm a veteran from Mad your district my question is once they're going to beat match testing available because I know people could be asymptomatic and have it and I'm afraid to leave the house I wanted to be a the other day and you look like a minefield people are coughing and and I got kind of Concerned so my question is once there could be a lot of testing so we can isolate different communities there people who have AIDS great question I know that as I said a little earlier on the call as a nation we are behind in having the testing available we're working with different labs in our County and other communities to see how we can be a part of ramping up the access to testing but maybe the state could you help us there in terms of testing and then we'll throw it to the county thank you from the state perspective I'll let you know that our experiences are exactly parallel to yours as well we are coordinating with federal entities regarding increasing our number of testing kits available we also had communication with private laboratories as well as recently as today with at least two private labs who are ramping up their testing as well and we similar to what you said about the federal government and experiencing some slowdown in that regard that unfortunately does impact state testing but I want to be very clear when I say we have no backlog of tests in Pennsylvania Val did you want to add to the from the hospital's perspective and Gary I do want to say to you thank you for your service and and your question is really important we have had other veterans call with that exact same question so Val and mark seeing that the doctor may be busy I will jump in on the hospital perspective until thou can get back I we do need to comment the Department of Health has increased their lab capability since being approved to do these tests it has been remarkably helpful and I will reiterate the deputy Secretary's comments that there there is no backlog we are pushing in order to help to try to get some of our facilities approved to be able to do that testing and we also absolutely support the private testing companies coming on board to help take some of the burden off of the public health and Health System labs as we move forward with more testing in the general public and this is that I don't have anything else to add to that I'm just Secretary Lavigne and Governor wolf as well as the CDC and FDA have been working very very hard to increase the capacity for testing in Montgomery County and we're grateful for that support and mindful of everybody's time and I thank everybody who called in and the participants on the call we're going to have two more questions one from Lisa and one from Neil so I'd ask you both to hang on and then just some very quick closing comments Lisa you're next yeah it's good evening everyone I have a question regarding the 180 days that public school children are required to attend several hours ago stop no child was identified in our school district up here they are not going to close they're concerned about the hundred eighty days would governor wolf given the circumstances right now consider waiving that hundred and eighty days just for the health of everyone in the safety of the children Lisa what school district are you in spring forward report okay great I think the best thing I can tell you is that as recently as yesterday we had a six-hour workshop followed by a two-and-a-half hour tabletop exercise at the tabletop exercise were all of the cabinet members so that included various I think it was a secretary from the Department of Education what I can say is speaking to educational initiatives or what governor Wolf's mind would really be a mid statement at this point but what I can tell you is this every single option at slowing down the spread of this disease I'm controlling it is being examined wait right now by this administration and as has been echoed by others on this call we are looking out for the public's health so I can say that I can't tell you a definitive yes or no what I can tell you is that this is an extremely serious public health issue and we are taking it extremely seriously no I'm sure that the state representatives will pass your question along to the governor and his administration and I will tell you that we will do the exact same thing Lisa so I thank you for your question Neil you're going to be our final question yes if you're learning this is me Lynn Bala Cynwyd first of all let me thank you for doing this Town Hall it's been very informative and helpful and I really appreciate it for all the panelists and my my question is actually my son's question you're listening to this with my 11 year old son Benjamin and Benjamin has a question for the panel I think it would be good to for dr. Gerber Dave or anyone else who wants to address it hi I'm Ben and my question is where did the coronavirus start and why well thank you Ben it's an amazing story really but by examining the virus itself and comparing it to coronaviruses that we know about in nature it's pretty clear that the source of this corona virus originally was probably in a bat it's very similar to the corona virus that caused the outbreak in 2003 the SARS outbreak in the same family and what happens in China and in many other parts of the world that don't have good refrigeration people go to market to buy their food but because there isn't refrigeration they buy their protein from living animals and in this case the market there called live markets because it means the animals there are living instead of the kind of meat we get in our grocery stores that's in the refrigerator and so when people are in these markets handling and picking out their food or when they bring these live animals home and have to kill them at home before they're prepared for eating of course any virus or any infection that an animal has is able to be passed to the two people and usually doesn't matter because most animals viruses don't infect people but sometimes they do and it turns out that viruses that inhabit bat are especially able to inhabit people and we don't really understand exactly why that is but that's been the case with even things like Ebola and other viruses that you might have heard of so in in in the case of this corona virus probably the bat virus got passed on to some other animal that was in the market and over time people just came in contact with these infected animals and there was spillover from the animal into people and then when people had it they started transmitting it from one person to another does that answer your question Ben yes thank you Ben how old are you 11 oh my goodness I'm so glad Neil and Ben that you were our final question because that was a mighty smart thoughtful question Ben thanks for being on the line tonight it's very cool now I'd like to ask each of our participants to just make a very quick closing statement and I'll end it by telling you how we will stay in touch with you but let me thank dr. Valerie cush mark Ross ray Barron I'm messing up your name excuse me there ashan ski Sharon Watkins and dr. Gerber dings so Val would you begin the closed well Thank You congresswoman to everybody who took the time to listen tonight I just want to end by reminding everyone that we are prepared for this we were anticipating that this disease would come to Pennsylvania and to reassure one that 80 percent of the people that get this disease have very very mild symptoms you can take some very simple preparatory steps and to get more information and to stay up to date on exactly what's happening here in Montgomery County you can go to Mont Co PA dot o R G and halfway down the page there's a link to coronavirus update and that information is all there in one place for you very easy to read and digest Thank You Val vice president Ross Thank You representative for this call tonight and the opportunity to speak to the constituents want to stress again health care in this region in Pennsylvania is prepared we have been preparing for these type of things we are working together closely please use those common-sense factors stay at home if you're not feeling well wash your hands a lot sneeze social distancing and remember do not contact your provider if you are feeling ill do not go right to the hospital we want to make sure that our healthcare systems are able to deliver that world-class care that we do every single day Thank You representative thank you and from the Pennsylvania Department of Health both ray and Sharon if you're still on the line we are just wanted to say thank you both to you for pulling this together and also to your audience for calling in tonight to echo some of the earlier sentiments remember go to the CDC's website or the Department of Health webs website that's health va.gov remember we have been preparing with this just like Mark said with the with HAP with our County Municipal Health Department with all of our within will all of our bureaus here and we have been preparing this is not unexpected again don't panic but just prepare and one last thing and this goes to that young man with the last question please always remain inquisitive thank you that's absolutely right Sharon did you want to add yeah thank you so much for this opportunity I think it's always great to be able to answer questions and really address concerns of the community the only thing I would really like to say is that public health is perhaps one of the most unseen infrastructures in government and we are working daily long long hours to make sure that contact tracing and all the other steps are taken to prevent further spread of the disease as much as we can and we really appreciate Montgomery's help in that and we've been good partners as has been said so thank you again terrific dr. Gordon thank you this has been very informative for me and a reality check and I just I really admire the spirit of this Town Hall so thank you for letting me join I I think when I'm listening to the questions and understanding how stressful this is for people at the community level because they're just experiencing this for the first time I just want to send a message of confidence and reassurance to people you've heard from a really outstanding cascade of public health leaders who are on the job here your government in Washington is on the job looking out for the most vulnerable people who need food and you know help with showery support if they have to stay home being ill or in quarantine etc so everything that can be done is being done and I think all of us just have to kind of take a deep breath and realize we've been through some pretty rough outbreaks before we had a pandemic in 2009 influenza we made it through that point the early days are the hardest but if we just kind of stick together and use common sense we'll get through this one too most of us are going to sail through it without a problem and and we just have to work hard to protect the more vulnerable people in our communities to make sure that they have the same chance to have a good a good outcome from all of this so thank you for this and thank you for caring enough to participate in the town hall I think it's terrific I'll echo your words I do thank everybody for participating and I've been thinking about over the course of the last couple of weeks that there is an upside to this terrible virus it's it's a healthy reminder of how interconnected we all are and so I was really delighted to have the chance to have this conversation with all of you constituents and experts and government leaders I believe that through our interconnectedness that we can tackle this and and many and any other problem with humanity and heart and common sense and so I promise to continue to keep you updated through our website please send in your questions and I'll forward them on to experts in the field as this is a changing event day by day I thank all of you for working together for the safety of our communities and with that I wish everybody a good night thank you thanks good

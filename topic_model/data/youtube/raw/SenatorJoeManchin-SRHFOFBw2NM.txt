i want to talk about the process that we're in and the processing first of all the text will be out tomorrow tomorrow you'll have the text in full that's a week before i think we'll probably move or do anything on the cr so there'll be no ifs and betweens and guessing and assuming things of that sort that gives everyone plenty of time and and you know i i thought about this and then i've watched this whole thing unfold from all different sides i guess the old saying that politics makes strange bedfellows i got to be honest with you i've been around for a long time in state politics and federal politics i've never seen stranger bet fellas than bernie sanders and the the extreme liberal left siding up with the republican leadership in the caucus i've never seen this happen so it's uh it's come to me what i'm hearing is it's like a revenge politics and basically revenge towards one person me and i'm thinking this is not about me this is about something that bernie has never bernie has never supported anything about permitting reforms and you're facing a country today we've passed this out to you i think permitting timelines if you look at what we do in the united states five to ten years that's a minimum if you look at basically states that have our countries that have vigorous environmental over oversights one to three years one to three years and then if you look at what's happening now because of the energy crisis we have in the ukraine war you have eu is considering emergency bypassing of all environmental reviews and we don't think we're in a crisis and we're not going to do anything about it and we can and then you look here at the energy prices look what the people in america are facing right now 200 increase in natural gas natural gas increases tuna regular gasoline is up 67 percent residential electricity 15 and then look at what's happening as far as overseas eleven hundred percent increase do you all get one of these if you haven't we have them for you and this is what we're talking about what is what is what are we facing today and how do we basically get through this i'm hearing that the republican leadership is upset and they're saying we're not going to give a victory to joe manchin joe manch is not looking for a victory we've got a good piece of legislation that's extremely balanced and i think it'll prove itself in time the bottom line is how much suffering and how much pain do you want to inflict on the american people for the time i can assure you basically the longer the time goes the more the price goes up that's what we're facing in america today in energy and if we don't do something and if we don't believe and i've always said this the energy that we produce in america is cleaner and can be even more cleaner than energy produced fossil energy produced around the world so if you're going to replace the energy and help backfill shouldn't you replace the dirtiest that's produced around the world but yet you have a situation where we've been looking at other countries to do we won't do for ourselves i couldn't accept that i just couldn't accept that knowing that we can and we have the ability and we have the resources and the know-how to do it more to do it better than any place else and we refuse to do it and basically we look at inflation which is a tremendous i mean in my state of west virginia but i know everywhere in the country it's a tremendous factor in the quality of life that people have today and the quicker we can do that the only thing i can tell you about inflation only one way to get out inflation you got to work yourself out of it you got to produce yourself out of it so when we talk about inflation or from inflation reducing if you're not producing more product to put in the market i can guarantee inflation's not going down anytime soon if you're waiting for the federal reserve to put the rates so high federal rates and basic interest rates to where it just discourages you from spending or buying or doing anything i'm not in that camp at all waiting for that to happen i think we can take action so i can go home and explain what i'm doing i've always said if i can explain it i'm fine i vote for it i support it but to have an opportunity that my i know those part of my democrats the caucus and the far left liberals the bernie is so proud of we're never going to be for this i knew that this is a bipartisan it doesn't pass without the republicans and to have something that my republican colleagues and the leadership knows that's better than any pain republican you know and they'll see this when the text comes out and they know that basically what they've tried to do and i says i applaud my colleague senator capito for putting something out dropping a marker messaging bill that they support that they support it they support permitting reform how in the world you go home and explain it well the perfect just wasn't perfect enough so the perfect will be the enemy the good one you've had no movement now if you think that all just wait until we get in control we'll change everything well first of all you run the tables in 2016. you had a republican president you had a republican house in the republican senate you didn't do anything in energy permitting so if you run the tables you know you basically run the tables in 2022 in november here in a month or so you're going to have still the president united states that's not going to go anywhere and it's proven if you run the table in 2024 you can't do what you couldn't do in 2016. so when do you ever see you're going to change the permitting until we can have the american people get relief from the high cost when you take a pipeline the mountain valley pipeline nothing puts more product into the market quicker and helps relieve the shortages that we have right now that pipeline's gone from 3.3 billion over 6.2 or 6.4 billion dollars just because of the permitting process they're going through so i'm just saying we're looking at it in a reasonable responsible way take me out of it shouldn't be revenge if bernie's upset with me fine i understand that but let's look at the american public let's look at our constituents if my republican friends and colleagues and the leadership and republican party is attacking me personally take it away from me personally because that's going to be hard to go home and explain well we did this and we voted against it because of joe manchin makes no sense whatsoever none whatsoever so we're in this quandary right now they're going to vote and it's going to be in the cr okay and if they're willing to say we're going to close down the government because of a personal attack on me or basically not looking at the good of the of the country this is what makes people sick about politics makes me sick about it you know me i vote across money if it looks if it looks good i don't care what's republican or democrat idea i'm for it as long as i can explain it a lot of it makes sense a lot of my republican friends do things that i support a lot of democrat and there's things that both do that i don't this type of politics is something i can't accept this is the type of politics that makes me sick and makes american public safe and if we make the american people pay for something that we could avert and change permitting to we can cut costs down but more product in the market and reduce your prices put more product in the market whether it's going to be a gasoline at the pump or it's going to be at your home when you're paying your utility bills and helping our allies who are one hell of a war for survival if we can't rise to that occasion god help us all with that i'm done with my talking and we'll start yes ma'am has senator schumer changed his promise to you no not at all not at all so it sounds like your conversations with republicans have not been fruitful no they have been i'm saying leadership's taken a role on this and i understand the leadership and probably these are still my friends you don't anticipate getting enough republican support to break up let me just say let me just say no i i'm having they've been saying i want to see the see the see it okay uh so they're going to see it tomorrow which is way ahead of probably when we vote so they'll have at least a week probably to see it before we vote and if they're going to try to justify the perfect you know do we throw caution to the win no do we make you go through the environmental process yes we just accelerate the time the same as they do in other developed nations that's all we're doing you'll see all that in fine print tomorrow with that with that being said if they're going to basically double down after you've got 47 senators on the republican caucus i believe is that the last the last count i think that signed on to senator capito's bill which is pretty much in line with what we're doing and now they're going to say well i'm so sorry it's just not perfect enough and has joe manchin's name on it whatever the reason how do you go home and i couldn't go home and explain that and i would like to think at least 20 or 30 half or 25 out of the almost entire caucus that supported and put their name on a bill and it's always been one of their main goals to pass permitting would at least be able to say hey this is the first time we've had positive movement first time we've had positive movement and you tell me another time in your lifetime which is all of us and you know some of us aren't as young as we used to be in our lifetime you're ever going to see this opportunity again i i don't know so they'll have to answer that i think yeah um your plans to talk to are going forward and also can you answer republicans criticisms that i know many of us have heard it's been reported they say they just can't trust you and they feel betrayed from what happened at the end of the last work period with the inflation reduction act and the pack out yeah i i would like for you all to ask any one of my and i still consider everyone in my friend and we're going to work together on many things that we agree on that why they can't trust me or what i might have said that lost their trust because anything i have ever said when i was asked on the floor or whatever are you going to bring back bbb is it going to be another big bill i said ain't no big bbb's dead they know big bill you'll never see bb again that i could ever support any way shape or form i made that very clear i said but if i get a chance to do something with energy i would do it and as the ukraine war escalated what we had and what were in the world crisis right now they're in a crisis in europe we're getting an inflationary crisis and that's basically we could relieve and not do anything i said why wouldn't i do that and they said why was it so secret i never thought we'd ever get there why was i going to put myself back out to where i've been for the last on bbb and taking what i did and he said oh that felt so good i'm going to try it again i didn't i never thought we would get there because i'm looking for a balanced pass i want to make sure that we can produce enough energy to be energy independent and secured in this nation to remain the superpower of the world you cannot remain a superpower of the world if you don't have energy independence if you're depending on other people to produce your energy you will not maintain our status that was my main driving force i had a chance to basically develop and write a bill with a very competent staff that gave us a pathway to produce the energy we have in the cleanest form of fossil while we're investing in the energy of the future everyone was happy when it first okay and then they start thinking well i really don't like that part of it i really like this part of it or vice versa i'm sorry we need to have energy independence that's what i'm all about senator kaepernick she's still my i'm just she's my friend that we get we we have talked her and i have talked on she says the messaging bill i understand that i would if we had that yeah and i and she we all know it i mean basically if it was a majority of republicans and i'm putting a belt be messaging right so yeah the facts are what they are but with that you know i would hopefully that she'll see the content which she says she wants to see she'll be seeing that i wish they could have seen it sooner i'm working on it and scrubbing and getting it ready for the cr she'll see that and hopefully make up her mind that this is much better than anything we've ever had and everything we're ever going to get in the future and to come back home to west virginia i would assume that if it's in the bill i can tell you if it was the republican leadership doing what what they're what we have been trying to do i would gladly vote for it okay to go home and say we have been able to produce more energy we have a product coming out of west virginia that's going to help our country and help the world and i'm proud of all that real quick i'm not shutting the government down i'm voting for it so whoever votes against is shutting the government down yes ma'am if the government does shut down there will be people who blame you because you you push to have this included in this consumer side there's no side deal there was never a side deal this is all one it was one package we worked on from day one okay so you all have labeled this as a side deal i'm so sorry to to deflate you on this one there's never been basically it didn't fit into the reconciliation so it was separated and that's why it's in this and everybody agreed on that yes ma'am i think basically i can tell you real quick on that we do not bypass any of the environmental reviews we do not bypass those so if you look at theirs that bypass it ours that doesn't with that we just basically accelerate the time frame and i think that'll be very clear what's doing damage to the environment right now is the dirty fuel being produced around the world with no absolutely no oversight whatsoever whether it's from venezuela russia wherever it may come from the more we can put out in a cleaner fashion than ever it's ever been done in the world and we do it better than anyplace else in the world that helps replace the dirtiest that's what really helps the climate sure absolutely absolutely senator senator schumer has been very clear and direct i appreciate very much this is part of the the whole thing if you want to fight inflation if you want to basically fight the climate and if you want to reduce the prices and the pain that people are feeling you've got to produce your way out of it you can't sit back and wait for it just to happen it doesn't and that was all part of the whole conversation when we got serious about we were getting close to where we could agree on things but that didn't happen until july i mean everyone thinks that this is you know i just we just kept our our heads down and our our feet to the grindstone and just try to make something good happen so you never give up on trying to improve things the easy thing guys you all know this easy thing for me is to say no no and let's walk away and do nothing after the bbb and all that fiasco and everything went down that's the easiest thing that's not what i was sent here to do it's not what the people in west virginia expect whether they agree or not until they know more about what we're trying to do i'm willing to continue to try to improve that's all some democrats are quietly saying this could easily find its way onto the ndaa why is it the cr or nothing well the cr is the thing that we all agreed on that we felt it was the most important thing that we could do and get it done because it was a part of this entire package we put together we want to do it as quickly as possible i think there was one right here now i'll go right to you sir um are you also involved in trying to convince skeptical democrats to get on board or are your efforts mainly well i think i've had conversations with everybody i always do that and try to try to ask answer questions or thought processes you know the thing that the surprise of the bill that was passed and this was part of all one negotiation on the bill that was passed the surprise of the bill how it came forth you know there were people upset on both ends the democrats felt more elated about it than the republicans being out in the dark but i just never knew what happened that's all i can't be any more direct with you than that we never thought it would come to fruition because we had to make some bold changes when we have the crisis we have the president recognizing the crisis wanting to fight inflation everything else they're trying to do this was the most reasonable responsible thing to do and that's how we did it so i've worked with everybody yes does the white house support your bill if so have you had can you tell us about the conversations well the white house has been very supportive the president is extremely supportive it wouldn't have happened without the president's support i can assure you and they have been very straightforward i i'm very appreciative of that because everyone has done exactly what they said speaker nancy pelosi was supportive and been very supportive so let's just see where it goes guys speaker pelosi has suggested that they may strip it from the c.r so how confident are you democrats i you know what i you know i've had a great relationship with uh speaker pelosi and i trust her so we just she has to do how she handles the house and how she works with her colleagues there and i trust her to do that streamline is yes yes there is we have nothing else in the country can put that much you know we're short basically in our in our forecast for gas shortages gas supplies that we have storage we're short in this country and we're trying to help not only ourselves we're trying to help our colleagues i mean our friends abroad this one pipeline takes care of the shortages in one year we'll take care of the shortages we have in america and be able to backfill and help our allies around the world who are desperate right now for energy i'm going to have to go for the votes open okay but i appreciate everything thank you all

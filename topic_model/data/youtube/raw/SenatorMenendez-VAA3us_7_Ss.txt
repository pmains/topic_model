thank you senator menendez uh thank you madam chair uh to you and the ranking member uh deputy uh assistant secretary escobar uh i understand that you and your eu counterparts have recently urged kosovo to establish an association of serb municipalities and while this concept has its basis in the 2013 brussels agreement i'm concerned that this would lead to a republic of serbska within kosovo moreover kosovo's constitutional court has found the association concept quote not entirely in compliance with the spirit of the constitution are you concerned that such an association could lead to the destabilization of kosovo and take away powers reserved for kosovo's central government i do not uh and it we support the formation of association for many reasons one is it is already agreed to and even though the constitutional court ruled that some parts of the proposal were inconsistent with the constitution it did not say that the association itself is unconstitutional so in the dialogue within the context of the dialogue it is up to kosovo and serbia to decide how that would look so it doesn't have to be and we certainly don't want it to be similar to republic of serbs but uh we have urged and um my counterpart miroslav lichak has urged urged the kosovar government to look at models that they believe would be compatible uh with them that would not uh that would not undermine their sovereignty or their functionality as a way of allowing serbs to continue to receive health care certain benefits and education in serbian language personally i think that this effort which would unwind belgrade's engagement uh in serbian communities and offshore it to a domestic transparent institution under the control of the government of kosovo would actually enhance kosovo's sovereignty not detract from it let me ask you i'm concerned that the state of talks or lack thereof is more due to serbia's reticence to recognize kosovo's sovereignty what concessions are you seeking from serbia to justify pressuring kosovo in this way well first of all the dialogue the purpose of the dialogue is to move everything in kosovo's direction to be quite honest uh with the end result of mutual recognition and normalized relations something that they don't have already so it is not about kosovo's status but about the recognition that they are a sovereign and independent country so uh the dialogue is the mechanism and it's proven itself to be an effective mechanism in resolving differences between the two countries most recently in september uh when uh we when the eu negotiated a successful resolution uh to the license plate uh dispute with our support so with our backing and our backing to kosovo is resolute we want to make sure that the dialogue helps them move through all the difficult challenges of unwinding the two countries engagement difficult engagement to have a a common european future together well i hope that our commitment to kosovo is resolute let me ask you i've heard from many uh of serbian diaspora here in the united states about the elections that are underway there and the the lack of legitimacy the use of the government in extraordinary powers as it relates to the elections the resources that they're using that are not just their private political resources what are your insights into that that is something that we uh we openly uh express our our concern about and privately engage with the government about and there are three elements to this one is the treatment of the opposition so we believe the opposition should have uh free and fair conditions to participate in the elections second uh the media environment it is true that much of the the uh the government controlled and private media in serbia uh is very favorable to the to the current government and thirdly uh the treatment of civil society those people who engage in democratic activities to monitor elections to monitor media freedom um and to support uh citizen engagement those organizations must be treated fairly by the serbian government and not just it's not just the united states who has made this clear but also the european union the osce um and not other international organizations that have been very clear about our expectations for the april elections in serbia but as of now that that is not the case as of now there are definitely concerns about all of that one final question i may madam chair um you know uh vuchich traveled to moscow in december so you can keep guests which he got in return the russians got some contracts uh inside of serbia he was also in beijing not too long ago to discuss a free trade agreement that he's now touting in his re-election campaign it seems to me that both russia and china are making significant inroads in the western balkans what uh what are we doing to combat malign russian and chinese influences in this regard well first of all uh it is true that the influence of russia and china is maligned in the western balkans uh in the case of russia russia does not even is not even in the top 10 uh uh biggest trade partners for the western balkans um it is mostly about energy so on the energy security front we have encouraged serbia to look at alternatives to russian gas including renewables and liquid natural gas and we have made some progress there with regard to the political influence over the last year serbia has become more aligned with european union foreign policy including not recognizing crimea so we are making inroads politically on that in the case of china we have encouraged reforms and greater transparency in the procurement process that gives chinese firms and the chinese communist party a leg up over american and european uh countries but one of the reasons that we support a more integrated market for the western balkans is that if it is more integrated and more integrated with europe with f with institutional standards that match those of europe it will create opportunities for greater transparency uh greater uh openness and procurement and requirements for environmental and social impact easements that will give american and european firms the advantage over chinese in the region i look forward to following up with you on some of these issues thank you manager

yes mr. chairman I move to strike the last word all of us know that that should know that the livelihood of many of America's farmers ranchers and dairymen depend upon trade America's farmers are the most productive anywhere in the world we produce more than we can consume and given a level playing field we can compete on quality and quantity with any agriculturalists in the world I for one am a person who believes that no one no one certainly American farmers win on a trade war in California forty-four percent of our agricultural revenue in the 2016 crop was a result of export 44 percent of California's agricultural production in 2016 was a result of exports yet title 3 of this bill unfortunately from my perspective simply maintains the status quo I think we must do more here especially considering the recent back and forth over tariffs with China and other insinuations and how well I hope it goes better with the NAFTA negotiations we've seen tremendous ramifications and let me give you some examples of the ramifications of these proposed tariff increases California alone exported 2 billion dollars worth of products to China in 2016 many products pistachios almonds Y and citrus products have been hit the hardest by these retaliatory tariffs 518 million dollars worth of almonds in California producers exported in China in 2016 now face a 25% increase in tariffs this is 15 percent from before the administration began this attempted trade war that I guess are easy to win pistachios have been especially hard hit 46 percent of California's pistachio harvest is destined to the Chinese market last month we only had a 5 percent tariff this today we now have a 20% tariff these tariffs have real-world effects on farmers in my district and throughout the state that rely heavily on foreign markets for their livelihood the market access program commonly referred to as map has paid great dividends not only for California wine citrus and other products but for farm products salt throughout the country that is a fact HR 2 the bill we're looking at will have an ax consideration today makes it perfectly clear because let me read some the title within the bill Section 3101 paragraph 1 says the United States export development program significantly increased than Man for United States agricultural products within foreign markets listing agricultural export volume and overall farm income and generating a net return of $28 and added export value for every $1 invested that is a great deal $28 that we get in return for every $1 investment that's a pretty good return to the taxpayer paragraph 2 of Section 3101 continues the market access program and foreign market development program receives a combined annual funding of approximately 234 million dollars in comparison listen to this this is our totality for the map program expenditure in comparison to the European Union which allocates two hundred and fifty five million dollars annually just to promote wine alone so just to promote wine alone they put more than we put in the entire map program those findings are laid out in this bill yet the amount of money dedicated to the important program remains the same as previous years now I know the Chairman had a tough time dealing with trying to get agreement on the caps and I guess this is probably one of the challenges here but I think that this bill while it has a baseline for funding for these programs we need to continue to ensure that American producers can compete we are missing a key opportunity I think in funding for market access program and foreign market development programs the programs of proven track record of delivering results and bringing value from overseas back into our borders and so the bottom line is this I think we can and we should do better period as I said in the outset American farmers can compete anywhere in the world in terms of quality and in terms of quantity and nobody does it better than the American farmer to quote a Paul McCartney song and so I think it's our responsibility to ensure that they have the same resources and same support for trade as producers and under countries have that we compete with I yield back the balance of my time Jimmy John's back

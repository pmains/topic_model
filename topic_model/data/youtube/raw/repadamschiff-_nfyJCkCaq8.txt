>>> LET'S BRING INTO OUR ONGOING COVERAGE OF THE HOUSE VOTE TO  HOLD STEVE BANNON IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS, CONGRESSMAN ADAM  SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA, THE  CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND A  MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SELECT  COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE  JANUARY 6th INSURRECTION. I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOUR COLLEAGUE ON THE  COMMITTEE, CONGRESSWOMAN  STEPHANIE MURPHY. WERE YOU SURPRISED ABOUT THE  NINE REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED WITH  ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS TO HOLD  STEVE BANNON IN CONTEMPT? >> I WAS SURPRISED. YOU KNOW, IT'S TELLING ABOUT  THIS ERA WHEN YOU'RE SURPRISED  AND DELIGHTED TO GET AS MANY AS  NINE REPUBLICANS TO UPHOLD OUR  SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES  AND HOLD PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT WHEN  THEY IGNORE CONGRESSIONAL  SUBPOENAS. BUT THAT IS THE STATUS OF THINGS THESE DAYS. SO, I'M GLAD WE DID. THAT IT WAS A BIPARTISAN VOTE. AND IT WAS A BIPARTISAN VOTE  THAT WENT BEYOND OUR COMMITTEE. >> AT MANY POINTS IN THE TRUMP  ERA, WE'VE HAD TO PULL OUT, YOU  KNOW, CIVICS BOOKS AND  UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE PROCESS TO  US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE  HOUSE VOTES TO HOLD BANNON IN  CONTEMPT AND HOW QUICKLY IT  TAKES PLACE. >> THE SPEAKER WILL ESSENTIALLY  TRANSMIT THIS CRIMINAL CONTEMPT  FINDING OF CONGRESS TO THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THAT SHOULD HAPPEN, I THINK,  VERY SOON. THEN IT WILL BE UP TO THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HOW QUICKLY  THEY BRING IT BEFORE THE GRAND  JURY OR EVEN IF THEY BRING IT  BEFORE THE GRAND JURY. IT'S CERTAINLY OUR EXPECTATION  THAT THEY WILL. BUT THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE  CASE. HERE, THOUGH, I THINK THERE ARE  LOTS OF SIGNS WHY THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT IS LIKELY TO TAKE  THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO  MR. BANNON THEY WERE NOT  ASSERTING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE  AND DIDN'T THINK THAT HE HAD ONE TO APPLY HERE. WHAT'S MORE, EVEN IF BANNON HAD  SOME COLORFUL CLAIM, YOU CAN'T  JUST NOT SHOW UP. SO, THIS IS ABOUT AS STRONG A  CASE FOR CONTEMPT AS YOU CAN  IMAGINE, AND I ALSO THINK THAT  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO  RE-ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. SO, I'M OPTIMISTIC AND THE  QUICKER THE BETTER. >> AND IF THEY DON'T, THEN WHAT? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, LOOK, I THINK IT WILL STILL HAVE A DETERRENT  IMPACT ON OTHERS. BUT THE DETERRENT IMPACT WILL BE A LOT LESS. IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  DECIDES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO  PROSECUTE, THEN WHAT'S TO STOP  OTHER WITNESSES FROM SIMILARLY  SAYING, WELL, CLEARLY,  CONGRESS'S OVERSIGHT POWER IS A  PAPER TIGER. SO, WE WOULD PURSUE OTHER  REMEDIES. WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS  LIKE INHERENT CONTEMPT. WE'D HAVE TO LOOK AT CIVIL  LITIGATION, BUT AS WE'VE SEEN,  CIVIL LITIGATION, IN PARTICULAR, CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING, AND  WERE WE TO GO THE ROUTE OF  CRIMINAL OR INHERENT CONTEMPT  AND CONGRESS USE ITS INHERENT  POWER IF WE WERE TO, FOR  EXAMPLE, IMPOSE FINES THAT WAY,  WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO TO  COURT TO GARNISH THE WAGES OF  ANYONE WHO WAS IN CONTEMPT, SO  NO EASY ANSWERS. THE VERY BEST ANSWER IS THE ONE  WE'VE PURSUED. >> CONGRESSMAN, CAN WE SPEAK  ABOUT STEVE BANNON AS A WITNESS. LIZ CHENEY PUT UP A COUPLE OF  CLIPS FROM HIS PODCAST ON THE  EVE OF THE INSURRECTION, MAKING  VERY CLEAR WHAT HE WAS DIRECTING DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO DO  THAT DAY. TALKING ABOUT TARGETS, TALKING  ABOUT ATTACKS, TALKING ABOUT  FOCUS, FOCUS, FOCUS. USED THE WORD "MANIACAL." WHAT IS YOUR INTEREST IN STEVE  BANNON AS A WITNESS? >> WELL, OUR INTEREST IS HE  APPARENTLY KNEW OR EXPECTED  THERE TO BE VIOLENCE ON JANUARY  6th. HE WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE PRESIDENT, SO HE MUST HAVE SOME  INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE  PRESIDENT WAS CONTEMPLATING FOR  THAT RALLY, WHAT WOULD TAKE  PLACE. HE MAY BE ABLE TO SHED INSIGHT  INTO WHETHER THIS WAS THE PLAN  ALL ALONG. IF MIKE PENCE WOULDN'T DO WHAT  DONALD TRUMP HAD BEEN, YOU KNOW, URGING HIM TO DO, BANNON MAY  KNOW ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION OR  THE FUNDING THAT WENT INTO THOSE RALLIES. AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS  TO BE ABLE TO PUT HIM UNDER  OATH. SO THAT'S WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. THERE ARE A GREAT MANY WITNESSES IN ADDITION TO STEVE BANNON THAT CAN HELP US FILL IN THE PIECES  AS WELL. >> CONGRESSMAN, WE COVERED THE  IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION THAT  YOU LED, AND EACH WITNESS CAME  IN, YOU KNOW, IN A DIFFERENT  PART OF THE STORY, BUT THEY ALL  TESTIFIED TO THE SAME PICTURE OF THIS CORRUPTION, THE  RELATIONSHIP OF THIS EXTORTION  OF PRESIDENT ZELENSKY, OF DONALD TRUMP WANTING DIRT ON THE MAN  WHO WOULD ULTIMATELY BECOME HIS  GENERAL ELECTION OPPONENT AND  DEFEAT HIM. I WONDER IF YOU CAN JUST SPEAK  TO THE INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH TO THIS INVESTIGATION. ARE YOU LOOKING AT BUILDING A  CASE IN A SIMILAR MANNER, AND IS THE TARGET, THE FOCUS, THE WHITE HOUSE? >> YOU KNOW, OUR TARGET REALLY  IS TO SHED LIGHT ON EVERYTHING  THAT HAPPENED IN THE RUN-UP TO  THE 6th, ON THE 6th. WHAT ROLE EVERYONE PLAYED. THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHAT ROLE  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MAY HAVE  PLAYED, WHAT ROLE THESE WHITE  NATIONALIST GROUPS PLAYED WHO  FUNDED AND FINANCED THIS  OPERATION, AND TO MAKE A SERIES  OF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO  PROTECT THE COUNTRY. BUT LET ME, YOU KNOW, JUST SHED  A LITTLE LIGHT ON WHY I THINK  THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. AND IT GETS TO THAT PATTERN THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAD SEEN,  THE CORRUPTION IN THE  ADMINISTRATION AND THE GREATER  AND GREATER ABUSES OF POWER. YOU CAN DRAW A PRETTY STRAIGHT  LINE FROM DONALD TRUMP'S ESCAPE  OF ACCOUNTABILITY OVER HIS  RUSSIA MISCONDUCT, HIS  INVITATION TO RUSSIA TO  INTERVENE IN 2016 TO HELP HIM  GET ELECTED, YOU CAN DRAW A  PRETTY STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN,  YOU KNOW, GETTING OFF THE HOOK  ON THAT TO THE VERY NEXT DAY,  AFTER BOB MUELLER TESTIFIED,  BEING BACK ON THE PHONE WITH  UKRAINE, SEEKING ANOTHER  NATION'S HELP TO CHEAT IN  ANOTHER ELECTION. AND WHEN HE ESCAPED  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT, YOU CAN DRAW ANOTHER STRAIGHT LINE TO  HIM TRYING TO CHEAT IN EVEN MORE NEW AND DEVASTATING WAYS IN THE  2020 ELECTION AND THE  INSURRECTION THAT FOLLOWED. AND SO, THERE NEEDS TO BE  ACCOUNTABILITY, BECAUSE WE HAVE  SEEN, SO AMPLY, WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN THERE IS A LACK OF  ACCOUNTABILITY. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT  STEVE BANNON IS COVERING UP  DONALD TRUMP'S TRUE  COMMUNICATIONS AND CONDUCT AND  INTENTIONS IN THE HOURS AND DAYS AND DURING THE INSURRECTION? >> WELL, IF HE WASN'T, I DON'T  KNOW WHY HE WOULD BE SEEKING TO  THWART OUR INQUIRY. BUT LOOK, I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE  WITH STEVE BANNON. WHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE  CHAIRING THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE, THEY SUBPOENAED HIM  AS A WITNESS, AND HE REFUSED TO  ANSWER ANYTHING BUT 25 QUESTIONS THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN OUT FOR  HIM IN ADVANCE BY THE TRUMP  WHITE HOUSE. HE HAD HAD THAT KIND OF DISDAIN  FOR CONGRESS EVEN WHEN THE  COMMITTEE WAS RUN BY  REPUBLICANS. HE BELIEVES HE'S ABOVE THE LAW,  AS, INDEED, DONALD TRUMP  BELIEVES HE'S ABOVE THE LAW. BUT I HOPE THEY'RE STILL GOING  TO FIND OUT FROM THE GARLAND  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THEY ARE NOT  ABOVE THE LAW. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. >> IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT,  CONSIDERING THE PARDON. I MEAN, HE WAS PARDONED FOR  COMMITTING CRIMES OF FRAUD  AGAINST REPUBLICANS OR AT LEAST  IDEOLOGICALLY ALIGNED PEOPLE  WHEN IT CAME TO BUILDING THE  WALL. WHAT KIND OF WITNESS DO YOU  THINK HE WOULD BE IF HE  ULTIMATELY DID COMPLY WITH A  SUBPOENA AND ANSWER ALL YOUR  QUESTIONS? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD  QUESTION. HOW MUCH THEN THE FEAR OF A  POTENTIAL PERJURY PROSECUTION  WOULD MOVE HIM. HE WOULD KNOW THAT IN THE CASE  OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION  THAT HE WOULD NOT GET A PARDON  IF HE ATTEMPTED TO DECEIVE THE  CONGRESS. BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. NICOLE, I HAVE TO SAY I'M  ASTONISHED EVERY DAY THAT YOU  HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A MAN  RUNS FOR PRESIDENT ON A PLATFORM OF BUILDING A WALL THAT MEXICO  IS SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR, AN  ABSURD IDEA TO BEGIN WITH, HE  BECOMES PRESIDENT, MEXICO  DOESN'T PAY FOR A WALL, THE WALL DOESN'T GET BUILT, HIS PAL,  STEVE BANNON, AND OTHERS START  RAISING MONEY FROM HIS OWN  SUPPORTERS TO BUILD THE WALL AND THEN THEY STEAL THE MONEY FROM  HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THEN HE  PARDONS THEM. IT'S JUST A GROUP OF COMPLETE  GRIFTERS. AND IT TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY  THAT ANYONE WHO LED THAT GRIFT  COULD RUN FOR ANY OFFICE IN THE  FUTURE. BUT IT IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF  JUST HOW DANGEROUS I THINK IT  WOULD BE TO LET THAT MAN  ANYWHERE BACK NEAR THE OVAL  OFFICE. >> WELL, THIS IS EXACTLY WHO  THEY ARE, AND IS THIS IS -- JUST AS A FINAL POINT, THIS IS WHO  202 OF YOUR REPUBLICAN  COLLEAGUES VOTED TODAY TO SIDE  WITH OVER THE RULE OF LAW. >> YES, IT IS. >> OVER THE -- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM? >> YOU KNOW, I WROTE ABOUT THIS  IN MY BOOK. >> I KNOW. >> WHAT TRUMP DID TO TEAR DOWN  OUR INSTITUTIONS WOULD NOT HAVE  BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT SO MANY  ENABLERS IN CONGRESS, AND THEY  CONTINUE TO ENABLE HIM AND  ENABLE THE BIG LIE, WHICH IS  UNDERMINING THE FOUNDATIONS OF  OUR DEMOCRACY, SO STUNNED BUT AT ALL, AGAIN, NOT SURPRISED. >> YEAH. SHOCKED AND STUNNED BUT NOT  SURPRISED IS SORT OF THE NAME  FOR THE TIMES IN WHICH WE BEV. CONGRE

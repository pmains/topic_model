it's probably one of the most selfless acts one human can do for another we're talking organ donation and south carolina is stepping in to do what it can to better protect the rights of donors a bipartisan effort is being championed by charleston congresswoman nancy mace and state representative for berkeley and dorchester counties joseph jefferson jr it is so good to see you both good to be here and thank you for for having me on today absolutely congresswoman maybe you could tell us a little bit more about hr 1255 better known as the living donor protection act of 2021 right well at the federal level this is legislation that we're working on in a bipartisan manner imagine that this is great great progress we're seeing in dc but people are offering up their organs to save lives and they're being left behind without health care and so the question is what can we do to protect those individuals who are giving literally a piece a part of themselves to save somebody else's life and we want to ensure this legislation that donors don't that they will not lose their jobs for taking time off to say for instance donate a kidney for example to somebody in need we want to make sure that this legislation prohibits a life or health insurance company from discriminating against an organ or tissue donor and so these are just are small parts that can make a really big difference when it comes to saving lives lives of others not only in south china but across the country as well absolutely representative jefferson so it's kind of hard to even imagine that someone would have to fear losing their job for making such a selfless act you yourself you have raised your hand and said i will be a donor as well maybe you can tell us more about that well first of all you've got to have some degree of um humanity in doing this and of course the need is always great and of course i found out years ago that if there's any group of people that's really in need of kidney transplants donors it is it is the african-american community uh it is startling to me that there's so many of us who are sick and of course this is really really uh noticeable during this pandemic uh the amount of people who are sick if there's anything that we have learned is the fact that as a result of this pandemic that so many people have died as a result of poor health care and of course uh we all know that in south carolina we've been trying to get medicaid expansion act passed for some time so maybe this is a godsend maybe now we will be able to see something done but i can't help but applaud uh the donors as well as the recipients but more specifically the donors because they're the ones who have to remain in the hospitals almost as long as the recipients so ultimately we want to make sure that they're going to receive the same kinds of uh welcoming back if you will to their jobs once they have donated their kidney or whatever the case might be without any repercussions or not being terminated as a result and this is what we're trying to do absolutely and congresswoman south carolina does a pretty good job at registering organ donors nearly two and a half million people have that heart symbol on their driver's licenses more than 1200 south carolinians waiting for a life-saving transplant so so the the need is there people are answering that call part of this legislation it also refers to some life insurance questions because there are possibilities that these life insurance companies will deny someone a policy based off of the fact that they have made a donation which is again very hard to imagine right and we want to make sure this legislation that we that oregon donors are not discriminated against when it comes to life or health insurance and so that's one of the provisions within this bipartisan legislation and then in terms of disability insurance as well so should someone become debilitated how does this protect them right well that's that's the whole point of it is to put these protections in to protect them uh from being discriminated and their insurance policies as well but also the other thing that this legislation does is it protects them from losing their jobs so someone shouldn't lose their job because they're an organ donor yeah most definitely how many other states right now currently have this protection south carolina not too far behind it sounds like right i'm not yeah joe might know the answer to that based on our state level legislation what other states are doing all right let me let me ask representative joe yeah what we've just done we've just done some research and we're finding out that it has not been introduced in the state of south carolina yet but i have called and is now being researched and yes it wasn't but it will be unfortunately it won't be uh implemented until the beginning of our next session which won't come until january but in january we're gonna walk the house and we're gonna get on the side of the aisle and try to make sure that we have everybody on board because it's needed and the other thing that i'm proud of is because i'm on the lci committee which is labor commerce and industry so this bill will probably come to my committee so that's going to be a of great help as well we will look forward to all the progression that is to come on this issue i want to thank you both for joining us thank you so much for taking the time

me start again with this uh thank you madam chairman and and the um let me just kind of remind people about this uh the trump administration was listing during last spring was this thing was unfolding so despite all this unrelenting criticism that's unfounded the trump administration actually ordered a billion vaccines from the five companies that are represented here today a billion that that's enough to vaccinate every american uh and then some across america and now chairman degette brought up a good point and she said very clearly in their opening remarks but the rollout has been slow so my question back and we've heard from dr nell i'm curious from dr hogue did you explain uh or maybe give me some insight from your perspective does the international supply chain impact the base of manufacturing in the vaccine from your perspective dr ho no sir it doesn't we have a completely separate supply chain we've established in the united states in partnership with the federal government uh and they are completely separate and all of the u.s supply chain is delivering for the us government okay thank you let me let me switch gears here substantially last year during 2020 we had about 400 000 people die from coven across the country but at the same time we had over 80 000 people die from substance abuse uh now that that's that's a horrible number to think about 480 000 people dying unnecessarily but and and the ratio is five to one between deaths of drug overdose and coving but the american government has made an absolute commitment and i'm proud they but they're spending 750 times the amount of money to deal with covet as they are on substance abuse it even though the ratio is only five to one or is it five to one it's 750 so and we also know according to johns hopkins it just came out with their study that said the seven day rolling average for daily deaths has actually been decreasing in america during this period of time so uh but at the same time drug overdoses have not been they're continuing to rise vivitrol has been a proven treatment we know about that numbers of you that know that's a competing product right but the supply and demand has made it difficult to get so thank you thank you for stepping up the world when you when we needed you for covid developing a vaccine but i want to know whether any of you are is equally committed to solving this substance abuse problem getting us a treatment the equivalent of a vivitrol that we might be able to deal with it because as i said the covet is going to go away but not the drug abuse so can any any of you want to chip in and say your companies are doing something on that apparently from here let me thank you for the question um one of the things that i would say is that we manufacture naloxone injectable naloxone which is an antidote to certain uh opioids that can cause you know death and have serious effects and we work very closely with the federal government to make sure that we continue to supply that to states and emergency but i'm trying to stop it from the beginning not treat it afterward after the effect so let me let me flip back to the the covet issue uh you you all began at the beginning when chairman paul just he opened up the testimony by trashing president uh trump former president trump and and the bible administration has been calling for unity but the rhetoric has not been matched the words uh the president has actually said there's been no distribution plan and the vice president said that the cupboard was bare when they took office they were starting from scratch well quite frankly the coverage should be bare it's not meant to be on shelves in washington but in people's arms so if there's no distribution plan that that they're alleging how did over 60 million doses get out to the public and for us in west virginia we're now at a rate where nearly 20 of the population of west virginia has gotten at least one shot and 10 has been fully vaccinated so uh i don't know how this happens without a plan so dr nettle uh you put you on the spot here do you agree with president biden that there was no plan and with vice president that the cupboards were bare what i can say is that j and j very much appreciates the collaboration we've had and we continue to have with the federal government it has certainly been an important contributor to allow us to move forward at the pace we have to potentially bring forward a vaccine that's that's under consideration for emergency use this week thank you gentlemen

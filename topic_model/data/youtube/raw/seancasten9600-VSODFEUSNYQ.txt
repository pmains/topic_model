thank you madam chair and thank you all for a long day the want to start just with a statement that I think is obvious but but all of you do a wonderful job and I appreciate your work to minimize the risk of loss to your Equity Capital while still honoring your obligations to shareholders to maximize return if any of you disagree with that statement please chime in but but I want to start just because I want to focus on risk in return um two years ago Mr Diamond Ms Frazier Mr Moynihan and Mr Scharf in a senate Banking Committee Senator Warren asked you and you all I believe essentially acknowledged that you were quote using new tools and services to gouge climate gauge climate risk to your portfolios could put the question all of you but I want to focus on you Mr Sharp because I think you have the largest mortgage book in the two years since are you changing your you're lending your diligent standards for properties that are exposed to climate risk wildfires forest fires are you you've had two years to gauge those risks have you changed your lending standards in those regions uh Congressman it's uh it's something that we talk a lot about and um we've always factored some of those risks into the properties that we financed and so it continues to be something that we talk about whether or not we've specifically changed the magnitude of that that I can't answer right now well and and I don't I don't mean it as a critical question there's been some data suggesting that there's there's a disproportionate flow of those mortgages to to Fannie and Freddie in those high risk areas and if if you don't know off the top of your head we can follow up offline but there's been a lot of reporting on that and I'd like to see the data because it's obviously a concern if we're moving risks onto the taxpayers certainly go back and look at the difference um shifting to the the return side of the question um Mr Diamond this is a I think this is a dumb question but you'll I'm sure you'll tell me if it is would would you support legislation that compelled you to preferentially invest in industries that were struggling to attract capital I would not okay I assume that would be your answer I ask that because the over the last 12 years the entire oil and gas CNP sector is running at about a seven times multiple and next era Tesla First Energy all of the sort of leading Lights of the clean energy space are running at 10 times that number for the most part and yet we are seeing a lot of my colleagues suggest that we should prevent the financial sector from investing in areas that are getting high returns out of some completely bastardized theory of what capitalism whatever that means the the State financial officers Foundation a right-wing backed group is intentionally promoting that they are pushing State legislation across the country and as recently as July West Virginia's Treasurer announced that he was canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts to five banks including yours and Wells Fargo I think you said that their analysis was disconnected from the facts I think Wells Fargo said that she disagreed with the decision subsequent to that Federated Hermes has announced that they are no longer going to fund this group as of a few weeks ago JP Morgan and Wells Fargo were both funding the State financial officers Foundation it's not listed on the website anymore are you still providing resources to this organization that is spreading policies that are encouraging you to invest in places that are struggling to attract capital I don't know the answer we'll be happy to get back to you and I'll look at it if I can okay Mr sharper is Wells Fargo still supporting the State financial officers Foundation I don't know the answer but I'm glad to take a look at it can can either of you commit while we're here that you will not fund continue to fund an organization that is spreading disinformation that is blocking the capital sector from freely allocating capital I won't convince I read something but if that were true we probably would cancel it Mr Scharf I agree with Mr Diamond okay well as we look at their website today the only people supporting this are are groups with active agendas I want to see you continue to minimize Equity risk I want to see you continue to earn shareholder returns and and I want to leave a better planet for our kids than the ones that our parents left to us and I would hope that you can all work together with us on that thank you and I yield back

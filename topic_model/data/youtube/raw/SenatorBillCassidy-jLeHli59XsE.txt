senator cassidy hey thank you very much um mr hempstreet the capital requirements to build this sort of hydro and to maintain it as well as the kind of energy lost required to use some of your electrons to transport the water to the top what does that do to your cost per kilowatt hour of a of a wind farm for example if you add that cost not just upon the turbine but also that which has to inherently be attached to it in order to help with the intermittency yeah i think um certainly the you know the efficiency of these type of projects of any storage project there's going to be losses you know on the inside on going up and going going back down so we see you know efficiency about 81 80 78 so there's an energy loss of course in any form of storage so that you know increases costs of course because we're not able to capture everything so if you will increases by roughly 20 percent the cost of energy before you get to the capital requirements correct right i mean you're going to have to see that much of a spread yeah in terms of the price uh and then how much is the capital cost going to add to it you're presuming that you have to pay for the capital cost with the price you charge for the electricity i mean the cost of these projects is typically on the order of between three to forty five hundred dollars at kw today so the high capital cost has been an impediment for pump storage and so again when people speak about the how cheap when can be once installed uh but if you amortize the expense and if you take the diminution and the energy efficiency uh what does it do to the business model absent a tax credit or a whatever well we know that uh we know that these type of resources are going to be important for meeting the lively in terms of the macro economics of of you know all these resource decisions you know in uh in totality you know it's really not something i'm i'm super familiar with sounds great i'm gonna move on not to be rude but just because i have a limited time and maybe we'll do a qfr to allow you to research it um mr nilsson um hey man you're the uh like uh the objective guy here uh is lithium going to crowd out uh what mr wiley's talking about i mean like it's gonna fill up the room and like uh by the way mr wiley i look forward to our announcement in louisiana spoiler alert we've got the river we've got the railroad we've got use we've been handling steel and iron for a long time so so i look forward to that ribbon cutting thank you very much sir east of the mississippi river st james parish perfect i got a 200 acre site for you mr nilsson um is the kind of uh kind of uh you know oh my gosh it's going to crowd out because everything's lithium going to encroach upon their ability to get market share uh you know there definitely is a history of um of technology lock-in we we can see in a variety of different sectors you can think about um the qwerty keyboard for example there's no particular reason why we use a qwerty keyboard it was the one that that became the dominant technology um that certainly could happen with lithium-ion that's more of a standard it is than a product though uh no i mean there's no reason we have to use quarter keyboards i i get that yeah yeah so it's going to distinct but i don't want to waste time on that oh well this the same thing could could happen with lithium-ion which is why the department of energy's programs to support demonstrations of new technologies to give those a chance are so important investors are not going to be pouring a huge amount of money into big manufacturing projects unless they have relative certainty that the product is going to work at scale and you know i would love ted also weigh in here but that's why it's important for you know governments to engage in private public partnerships to help get those technologies going so you can have that proof of concept and then the private sector can come in and scale technologies up okay then i'll ask you this but the others can be uh and i'm limited time which is why i'm not going to you on this mr wiley let me ask about i understand that there is a issue with storage related as well to the interconnection can you get the grid to kind of accept this battery influx when you may have limited capacity on your power lines i'm probably not explaining it well but you're not in your head as if you know what i'm saying so can you speak about that obstacle if you will to getting it into the grid yeah the the interconnection queue all all new energy generation projects have to go through a process where they do an analysis to see what the impact will be it's definitely a big challenge it varies a lot on a regional basis uh right now the average time for new generators to connect to the grid it's 3.7 years that's been increasing over time some places like california the average time is eight years that you wait in the queue to know whether or not you can connect um so california which is attempting to go to all electric vehicles by 2035 therefore needs to expand it wants to get rid of fossil so it needs this capacity it takes eight years uh on average just waiting to know how much it's going to cost yes and then how much longer does it develop and to deploy well then it'll take another two or three years after that for the construction operations startup um and right now there's 421 gigawatts of battery storage in the queue nationwide about half of that's tied with renewables and we're probably only going to be able to build about 20 percent of that um in the end unless we work on the interconnection queue ferc is working on this uh there there was a unanimous uh notice of proposed rulemaking they sent out um a few weeks ago so i'm you know happy to see that there's bipartisan action on this but it's absolutely a crucial um crucial problem we're going to be putting out a paper on this i'll send it to your office to be clear it's not just the cube but it's also the transmission capacity that can absorb the generation from that which is occurring as well as the and so you not only have to permit this you have to permit the increase in generation capacity yeah that's correct so just you may not want to take this if i may have 15 more seconds uh it seems unrealistic that california is going to have both the storage and the transmission in order to go to an all-electric new car fleet in 2035 and you just give us timelines that would push optimistically those at the front of the queue into 20 uh 12 years roughly 10 years somewhere between 2032 and 2034. do you think it's reasonable that california will have the capacity to address all their new electric vehicles by 2035 is that one for me yeah um i think it will be a challenge and permitting reform will be really essential for accelerating uh development of clean energy in california oh that's kind of a dodge but i'll give it to you well it'll be it'll be a huge challenge they have a lot of state-specific regulatory requirements that slow down the development of new tech sequa the california environmental quality act is a big issue so right now they're not on track to hit those that's which is partially why they're keeping diablo canyon online things like that

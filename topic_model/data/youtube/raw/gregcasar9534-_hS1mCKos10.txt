i am a sexual assault survivor um and i started for advocating for rights and survivors in austin texas when i was 19. um in 2015 after my case was extremely mishandled by austin police department and the travis county district attorney margaret moore deciding to look into my own sexual assaults and wanting to understand what happened to me at a different level hoping that i could process them at a different level and what i quickly realized was in order for me to understand what happened to me um i had to understand how the system was working or to say it differently i i quickly unders i quickly understood that you know part of what happened to me was was how the system was working and um through that journey found out about the lawsuit and found out about the struggles that many other survivors had in reporting their crimes and it was one in which for many years i thought something was wrong with me in my case and it was the reason why i wasn't able to move forward with it and then i learned about so many others that had so many more um uh i don't want to use the word severe because it's not a comparison but but cases that had a lot more evidence that weren't moving forward either um and i quickly realized that there was there was something more at hand speaking out like a really hard thing to do yeah um what do you think got you to the place where you decided that's that you wanted to do that honestly it was like a breaking point for me i mean i had been trying to push back um you know no one was listening to me i was just like this 19 year old that had all my power taken away from me was so hurt and scared and confused and i just needed people to know that i needed someone else to help me um whoever that was and right if this phase is if we were to name it if it was a chapter in a book it would be like just discovery right like understanding all the the how this system works with the issues kind of the people impacted um and how you know i think it's it's a true kind of uncovering of um of an issue you know and that we'll always be learning about um what do you think being a city that actually achieves justice survivor for survivors would would look like we have a such a long way to go um and i think that to be honest the survivors that are advocating for change and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have actually spoken on this so much more eloquently than i than i can i'm so grateful for their um for their leadership and for um speaking out on something that that was so traumatic i think there is so much more we can do around providing trauma-informed care around ensuring that that survivors have everything that they need to start healing from um from the very beginning that was so scary okay so like just like putting taking yourself out of like a victim shoes and just thinking like how intimidating our system is and then remembering the trauma that victims have experienced the compounded generational trauma that a lot of the victims have faced and then the injustices of our system and so if i have been a victim of sexual assault and i have gone through the um very uh invasive space of going and getting a forensic exam completed i don't think that everybody understands like exactly what that exam entails and how invasive it is and then to be told that there's not enough evidence or then to be told that they can't find my kit or then to be told that it's gonna take years and years before i'll ever see that abuser in court and i want to live i want to live my life i want to close this chapter i want to begin healing i want to move on and put this behind me right but there's still that open wound until there is any justice i mean it's six years of my life coming to a close um and it was hard i mean i dropped out of college like all of those things and wanting to quit so many times and i didn't so i think i would definitely tell myself that's worth it and to keep going and that i've learned so much about myself through this process and found really great people in my life now and yeah i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't change a thing about it as as horrible as it was as you know i will always have ptsd in some form i it is so much better now you know i've really done a lot of healing and a lot of therapy um one of the survivors that i that i spoke to about their interaction um with with with sworn officers um she was not a small person she was a larger woman she was a full-grown adult and um when she was providing evidence um for her case um she was given a standard the standard thing that they that they give people to put the evidence in and it was a ziploc bag this big and she said i i can't fit my clothing i can't even fit my underwear into a bag that size it's thoughts like that if you are a survivor of sexual assault and you go to the police department and you have to sit down with a police officer who's questioning and asking questions like well what were you wearing well how much did you have to drink things that make you really question whether you did something wrong when you're in that room you want we want to make sure that the room has soft lighting and that it has a comfortable couch and that maybe there's a blanket so that the process feels comfortable and doesn't make you feel be victimized or traumatized all over again those are some of the things that we're talking about when we're talking about trauma-informed care i think that there's a lot of people that kind of are silenced about rape and sexual violence other piece that's so hard is that we have so much stigma about sexual assault and sexual harassment that so often people don't want to come forward and talk about it and that could be for a panoply of reasons right they think that it was their fault or they um are embarrassed or they're not really sure what happened so often we get people calling and saying i don't know if this was sexual assault or not there's also something where you're worried about getting the person who hurts you in trouble and that might be because you go to college with them and you don't want them to get in trouble or you don't want their friends to think you're getting them in trouble um that might be because you share a life with them and they're the parents to your children um so there's a there's a whole vast set of reasons why people might not come forward but what that means is that people aren't um processing they're not getting the support that they need and i would just really encourage people to start um to talk to someone and to make sure that they're getting what they deserve um after an unwanted sexual experience so i still believe that much of our um city in any city in this nation doesn't really understand what it's like to report um sexual assault and when they find out and really understand what that looks like um they're often just as appalled as any of those of us that went through it and so there's great work to be done there yet um not just for systemic changes but for the lived experience of of the individuals that have have gone through it themselves have gone through assault i haven't had folks to talk to and there's there's so many angles to it it's just not the the survivor's perspective and experience but there's perspectives and experiences of our family members there's also a lot of dialogue that needs to occur around our perpetrators and why it is that we have such a problem nationally with this issue um what's fostering that and what do we do about that when i got in this space one of the questions that i continue to ask is where are all the men and these conversations and knowing that you know roughly 90 of the perpetrators are men we can't solve this issue without their involvement but it also is really tricky because i think it's very difficult for men sometimes to move into the space without feeling like they have fingers being pointed at them so how are we able to break down those walls and talk about what it is that's happening in our society that's happening across genders in many cases um so that we can move forward and actually work towards solutioning um because i don't believe that we've gotten there thus far i have to go on a soapbox for just a second i think the other huge issue facing our society is consent and not teaching people about consent um i have a nine-year-old boy and um there's a there's an acronym called fries um the uh acronym fries in relation to consent um fries freely given revocable informed enthusiastic which is obviously my favorite and specific so that's the fry's acronym that helps us know what consent is in our house thank you for that i really appreciate being able to spend the time with you thank you so much and thank you for having these conversations we really appreciate you um the reality in this space is not pretty um i i learned about exceptional clearance when the rest of the city learned about the issues of handling of exceptional clearance within our police department and i learned that i was one of them you know during that time as well um and something else that i think is important is that this is not just an issue with austin this is an issue that's existing across our nation um but you know i've i've learned not just about sexual assault and what it looks like in our community but what it looks like in our police departments um in our da's office um and and how um i've had to learn a little bit about how politics work um in this regard um and that that hasn't always been um easy either it was interesting because i think if you're in the field a long time you know you assume that things are you know like really normal and even though they're terrible you get used to like a certain way that things are and i think that you know there was people kind of especially the women's commission because they're not in the field that were shocked by it and i think that was really helpful for me kind of be tip step a little bit outside of that kind of day-to-day as an advocate and be like yeah that actually you know it is horrifying i know that when i when i started out i thought awareness was the issue um and one thing i've had to learn is that it's not just about awareness um it is awareness for some but not for all um i i'm a data person and so i was pretty astounded when i saw the numbers when i first started digging into things and learning that two and five texas women will be survivors of sexual assault is pretty shocking to me um and you look at the numbers and i i think i don't know if i've heard you say some of these things before which is really i'm so glad it makes me so glad that we can have the conversation because it sounds like two things that were holding so the rape kit backlog had existed before the lab it closed right for years and sometimes i've wondered what things kept that there so hidden and it sounds like you kind of talk about on the one hand people having sort of low expectations for leadership and then new people hearing about it getting involved sort of setting higher expectations and then another thing being folks not wanting to stir the waters too much because it could hurt folks but then that can maybe further the disrespect you know did people ever put it back on y'all that you were doing the wrong thing did you question it i mean talk about that process i mean we had a chief you know we had leaders um in government that told us that you know now now survivors aren't going to report because of you know speaking out about this and and and i and i think that it was um it was a great public conversation to have about okay you know is exposing systemic harm and systemic issues on the people that speak or is that you know something that's really on the system and i think that was the first time i like interfaced with hostility it's like who doesn't want to like make sure rape survivors are doing okay like it was just a shock to me but then i was like oh so you don't i guess we gotta play hardball um so it was it was interesting to be in a situation where we were being blamed what what message would you want to uplift to so that folks in austin could hear it the biggest message is just please start by believing please um whenever you encounter someone who tells you that they have had an unwanted sexual experience whether it's someone touching them inappropriately at work or someone that they went out on a date with acting in a way attacking them sexually whatever it is start by believing that doesn't mean that you don't verify but it means that you start by believing and you listen and you're really a support system the second thing is that um we talk a lot about this trauma-informed care and that is part of the starting by believing but it's also sort of trauma-informed care is a way of ensuring that every step of the way survivors are asked what they need they're listening to you know i think there's a we talk about in sexual assault like the you know outcry witness or first person someone tells about their assault is so important to someone's mental health you know um and long-term healing so i yeah i just wish that people realized how frequently it happens and know how to talk to their loved ones about it you know i was blessed to have an amazing support system in my life with my mother but that's not typically the case and so i wish that from the vulnerability that i gave that people were allowed to have conversations with survivors in my life to help them move forward or to reach out and make the first connection to therapy you know to do little things like that that help with the healing um you not quitting um i think inspires a lot of other people to never quit and so yeah i um i just am so in awe of you and really appreciate everything you've taught me you know this uh i really started out in some of this work hearing your testimony and i think is a big part of the reason that um a lot of us have learned what we've gotten to learn so i really appreciate that and thank you for getting together and talking with me thank you i appreciate it so much i mean it very much feels full circle to me that the first time i spoke out was essentially to you i felt like you were the only one listening and so to have had you actively been a part of it the whole time and now for it to end um where what does the work look like going forward for our community because obviously you can't just stop with with the lawsuit and so what do you think moving forward looks like yeah um you know it's it's clear to me that we've taken our current lawsuit as far as we can um and i do believe that there need to be movements after us that continue to push on things um i know for me personally and i i want to move into a different space i think of having dialogue with those that are wanting to have the dialogue you know talking in community as you know how we spend our time i think it's just a continuation of the conversation you know how do we keep people coming together and talking about this so that the conversation can continue so that there is more dialogue and more movement forward because without that we won't see the change that's needed

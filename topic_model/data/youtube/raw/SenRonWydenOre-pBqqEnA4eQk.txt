whether by purchasing handmade jewelry from etsy a sweater from an independent retailer on ebay or some vintage vinyl from a portland record shop millions of americans each year utilize the internet to purchase products from online retailers next week however the united states senate is going to consider legislation the Marketplace Fairness Act that forces internet retailers to collect the taxes for states that they have no presence in when I look at this bill I see three major problems first if passed the Marketplace Fairness Act will force an online company to collect sales taxes for every other state city and county in the Union a huge huge burden on new and innovative Internet companies and a fundamental violation of the principle of no taxation without representation second the Marketplace Fairness Act could very well be called the shop mexico shop canada bill there's a major loophole in the bill that imposes a new tax collecting regulations on american internet companies but none at all on foreign internet companies that sell goods and services to consumers in american states with sales taxes the bottom line if you're a wholly overseas retailers shipping into this country the Marketplace Fairness Act gives you a leg up over American employers and the third problem is the precedent that internet companies have to enforce laws established outside their legal jurisdictions this precedent is going to give other countries like China and the EU the green light to seek to impose their laws on our internet businesses those laws would go way beyond taxation into even more fundamentally unamerican notions like the censorship of free speech restrictions on commerce and limitations on political or religious activity all of this is most certainly not a recipe for the innovation that you and I have championed I'm trying to flow the March to a vote I can't stop it outright myself the internet once again needs your help to push back against this unprecedented effort to apply local laws to a worldwide media that hasn't worked in the past and it's not going to work now

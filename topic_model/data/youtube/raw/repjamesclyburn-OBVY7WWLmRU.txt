much to thank my friend for yielding their time speaking out against the Vietnam War in 1967 dr. Martin Luther King jr. implored we must move past indecision to action we must find new ways to speak for peace if we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion might without morality and strength without sight not the king's words are just as apropos today President Trump in order and significant military strike against authorization for or without seeking authorization or even consultation that Congress has brought us to the brink of war the constitution of this great country gives the solemn power to declare war to the people's representatives in Congress not one person in the White House whoever that might be with this resolution Congress has acted to uphold our constitutional responsibility if the President believes military action against Iran is warranted this resolution and the Constitution require him to make the case to Congress and receive authorization mr. speaker are truly regret that we find ourselves in the position we are today the Trump administration's policy toward Iran abandoning the nuclear deal rather than building on it while escalating tensions instead is an unwise application of American power might and strength the strike against generals suleimani a bad man who no American mourns drags us closer to another long dark and shameful corridor to an unnecessary war I urge the adoption of the resolution now a year back the balance of my time

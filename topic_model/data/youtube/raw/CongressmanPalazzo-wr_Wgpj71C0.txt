hello this is congressman stephen palazzo i join you to discuss something that has impacted your life and mine i want you to know that i share your outrage over the prices we are paying as a result of president biden's anti-energy policies we aren't just paying with our wallets we are paying the price with our security as well this white house inherited an energy independent nation if the president has simply done nothing americans would be better off than they are now sadly he chose instead to do quite a bit and all of it bad for the american people gas prices are already up nearly 50 percent and haven't slowed down these prices will continue to rise as the white house squashes domestic production this anti-energy policy is problematic and hypocritical too the president has condemned american oil while encouraging the communist russia nordstrom 2 pipeline while promoting the success of our enemy he ripped apart the keystone pipeline a massive means of job creation and affordable fuel when president biden canceled the keystone pipeline he made america reliant on the middle east for energy and one fell swoop he took from americans to give to our enemies when we rely on foreign adversaries to supply our energy we are left at the mercy of our enemies leaning on nations like iran they use energy as a weapon leaves america in a position to be targeted and makes our nation more vulnerable than ever before president biden didn't just kill our sense of security when he crushed the keystone pipeline he is also responsible for killing eleven thousand jobs now he has set his eyes on eliminating offshore production jobs near our home in the gulf of mexico offshore oil and natural gas production supports twenty thousand jobs in our home state alone if joe biden fulfills his campaign promise to squash national gas leases over 150 000 jobs in the gulf states alone and nearly 55 000 additional jobs around the nation will be lost forever president biden will have to answer to hundreds of thousands of americans whose jobs were killed by his decisions at a time when he caused prices to rise to an all-time high added up these figures equal a stark lack of concern from the white house when the safety and livelihoods of hard-working americans is at stake please know that your concerns are heard and i'm proud to join my republican colleagues in the fight to lower prices create american jobs and protect our national security it is an honor to represent you in congress and to fight for south mississippi and washington may god bless you and your family during this tough time and may god bless america

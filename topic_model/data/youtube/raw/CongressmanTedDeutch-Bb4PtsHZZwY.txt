Carol Willick Hren Elena petty meadow Helena Ramsay Alec Schecter and Peter wedding they are the surviving families of the 14 students and three adults who were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas nearly one year ago in February 14 2018 their pain and their loss is real and it is immeasurable because their loved ones were gunned down and it does not matter where that shooter was born I want to recognize them today because in the year since that awful day they have done everything that they can to make American communities safer from gun violence each family in its own way to improve law enforcement response to warning signs to get weapons of war off our streets to expand access to mental health to develop safer schools demand background checks on all gun on all gun purchases stand up to gun corporations that control state legislatures and want to protect their profits and not protect American lives the Parkland families have done all of this in response to their grief they never signed up for this they would do anything to change this they don't owe us their service and advocacy they don't know us anything Congress failed them we didn't do our job today the House Judiciary Committee is finally holding a hearing on gun violence a crisis that kills 40,000 Americans every year and what I want to ask my Republican colleagues is it's still too soon is it too soon to talk about taking action to stop gun violence because that's what I heard after Marjory Stoneman Douglas but it was already too late as we start this important work madam chairman I ask unanimous consent to enter statements into the record from Fred Guttenberg Toni montalto and stainless parkland Patricia and then while Oliver and changed the ref and March for our lives without objection alia thank you for being here your classroom was attacked at MSD but at March 4 our lives on March 24th you spoke to hundreds of thousands over a million people in DC and at other events around the world and you said I'm not only here to speak about school shootings I'm here to speak for the urban communities who have been speaking out about this way before February 14th student survivors like yourself and like the March our lives advocates have been some of the strongest voices for change over the past year you've met with young people from around the country tell us what you've learned in the meetings and the discussions and the friendships he's developed in places like Miami and Chicago and Baltimore Los Angeles and cities that face daily gun violence I noticed that you know it's it's hard to have these conversation but you know we have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable and I noticed having these conversations there's always an elephant in the room and that's the margin the urban communities nobody wants to talk about how to combat the issue of gun violence in urban communities when black and brown youth are the number one impacted youth by gun violence so that's one thing that I noticed and I've just been working tirelessly to share my platform that I didn't ask to have with those marginalized communities because their voices are just as important as mine and my colleagues are from parkland and they are oh and thank you for thank you for using your voice to help lift up the voices of so many madam chairman after February 14th the Florida Legislature passed bills to increase the minimum age for rifle purchases 21 and past extreme errs protection orders states and local governments all around the country have taken action finally finally the House of Representatives is about to act away you said during your testimony you said I ask that you give my generation a chance the important message today as I see it from this seat looking out at this crowd is that you don't need to ask for us to give you a chance your leadership and the young people who are here today and who have been energized around the country are providing the leadership that is making this happen we're going to pass background checks because it's supported by over 90 percent of the American people and it can help save a life and it's true chief if only one life is saved

the people here today and this crowd should know is that just as they're not going anywhere and will remain in this issue on this issue in fight because it is the fight for their lives we will not stop either thank you madam chair I yield back my time [Applause]

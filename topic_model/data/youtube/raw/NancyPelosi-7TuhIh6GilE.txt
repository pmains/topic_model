recognizing me I raised up at this point of order that HR 558 contains several potential unfunded mandates that would burden the state's burden private insurance companies and burden women I am also raising this point of order because it is a powerful vehicle to register my concern that this bill is a misguided ideological distraction from what should be our top priority getting people back to work and protecting working families who've been hit hard by economic circumstances it is so clear to me that in spite of what our colleagues may say across the aisle this bill is not about public funding for abortion it's really crystal clear madam Speaker that the Affordable Care Act already explicitly prohibits federal funding for abortion it reaffirms the Hyde Amendment it even includes the Nelson amendment to ensure that there's no commingling of funds HR 358 would bring back the infamous world of stupak pits but this it adds even more restrictive language to the proposal this bill would essentially ban insurance coverage of abortion in health care exchanges not for women who are being publicly a funded or subsidized through the exchanges but even for women paying with their own private dollars madam Speaker in addition HR 358 would create a system that plays Russian roulette with pregnant women's lives when they enter a hospital this would mean that any Hospital could refuse to perform and emergency abortion even if a woman would die without it without violating the federal law designed to prevent people from being denied emergency medical care it goes even further by paving the way to allow state's refusal laws that are not limited to the provision of abortion services but to any thing that would be considered controversial mid for sti's birth control services screening services and counseling and with that I would yield time to my good colleague from California representative sphere I thank the gentlelady from Wisconsin

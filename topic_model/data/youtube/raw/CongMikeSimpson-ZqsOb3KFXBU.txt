effective effective piece of legislation the ESA 2018 species have been listed 21 have been recovered 2018 listed 21 recovered effective some of us would question it and we could have long discussions we could have long discussions about the Graywolf which you keep mentioning the Reagan the Graywolf was reintroduced it was extinct in the Northern Rockies it was reintroduced as a non-essential experimental population that's how it was reintroduced not under the esa under that provision of the ESA but not as an endangered species non-essential experimental population so we could discuss much of that for a long time but I appreciate what my friend and colleague is trying to do with this amendment but this amendment frankly does not get us there what this does is allow the courts to force the service spend funds to list species and critical habitat but it does not appropriate the funds does not appropriate the funds the service will have no choice but to rate other firms funds from its resource management account which is already decreased by 146 million dollars twelve percent in this bill so in effect this amendment piles of additional 24 million cut on the Fish and Wildlife Service these cuts will hurt constituents and every of every member in this room I think the Fish and Wildlife Service is carried more than its fair share of cuts in this bill and I cannot support it but to emphasize what I said at the beginning during this debate the esa has not been reauthorized for 20 years during the mark-up in the subcommittee mr. dicks said well we just we've continued to fund it in the bill for 20 years without reauthorization that's not the answer that's the problem we need the resources committee to get busy with the stakeholders who refuse to come to the table and sit down and talk about reauthorization of this bill and the only way I can think of to do it is to force the issue and that's what this does this is a shot across the bow and as I said in the beginning twenty-eight percent of this bill is in unauthorized areas areas buns programs that have not been reauthorized we need to get people to the table to sit down and talk about common sense reforms I don't know of a Republican or a Democrat that is opposed to the Endangered Species Act reform make it work better yes I think everybody agrees with that and in fact when this came to secretary and he made his press release when our when our bill was originally released while he doesn't agree with what we're doing here he did say yeah we can make that we can make the ESA more effective and make it work better in terms of protecting species and making sure we get them delisted that's what we're talking about unfortunately there are people right now who benefit from the way the Endangered Species Act is interpreted and used and it is not used anymore to protect species it is used to control land and water that's what the Endangered Species Act is about now that's what it's become that's why everything is done in court it needs reform how else do you get people to the table except put some pressure on to do it and as I said this is not just a shot a shot across the bow with the ESA other programs that have not been reauthorized within this bill need to look at what we're doing here because we'll be right in the bill again next year I would oppose this amendment told my colleagues would also

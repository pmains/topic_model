so when you look at this and if it doesn't go for a vote tonight or they push this back and it becomes a next year event um is it even possible that it could be taken up next year i think anything's possible especially going into the midterms and seeing how bad virginia and new jersey were quite frankly for democrats a few weeks ago in those elections i wrote this off the table a few weeks ago i said there's no way that they're going to do this and yet they continue to push these progressive and socialist policies this particular buildback better plan really should force aoc to put her tax the rich dress back in the closet i mean there are all sorts of things in there for the rich and it's surprising that they're pushing this through given how bad of a year they've had with crisis after crisis with the administration so far it's shocking well

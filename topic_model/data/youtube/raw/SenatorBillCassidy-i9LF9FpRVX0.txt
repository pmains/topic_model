senator uh bill cassidy noah the republican of louisiana the senate finance committee member man oh man he he was raking the treasury secretary john illinois with the kohl's yesterday kind enough to join us today senator she was more or less saying uh it's very good to have you by the way that uh look uh i i'm not a botched on on the transitory nature of all of this but uh she's the only one saying that uh at least in the administration i don't know what good it would do now for the president to acknowledge the obvious but i don't see anything going out there being put out there to ease this what do you think you know what was clear yesterday they don't have a plan it's to hunker down and to hope the storm passes over but to do nothing proactive i say that because fuel prices which you just highlighted are a major major driver of overall inflation now if you ask them what they're going to do about the high price of fuel at the pump they talk about decreasing tariffs on solar panels made in china that is absurd one is not connected to the other yes when we have electric vehicles 30 years from now everybody having one in their garage it makes a difference what about now they need a plan for now it's unclear in fact it is clear they do not have one so between that and hoping things sort of subside on the energy front and now this word that the administration is looking to remove some tariffs on chinese goods to ease the the price pain for those americans who want to buy those goods is that enough i think it is obviously not enough so instead of helping u.s producers produce more north american oil and gas creating better jobs for americans more money in your pocket to pay those higher prices we're going to help out the chinese economy this is not a plan this is a illusion of a plan what we need is something which addresses head-on the fact that we need greater supply of oil and gas not just for us but for folks overseas with the better jobs that come with it and that will begin to ease the pressure upon inflation not some kind of band-aid that you might call reducing a tariff to help the chinese economy so you know the president is going to be going over to los angeles today senators you know there's uh you know some of the americas uh we know that mexicans won't be there so i i don't know if it can be a productive summit especially what's going on at the border without the mexicans what do you think you have to ask about that and by the way if we're going to stop people coming across the border we need to stop them at the mexican guatemalan border to your point how are we going to make that progress unless the president of mexico is there to collaborate if they make it to the border of u.s and mexico that border's so long it's going to be very difficult to defend let's stop them further south we can do that they can do that they need that help amlo not being in los angeles makes that more difficult to achieve real quickly senator while i have you i know i'm pig-ponging here but i always enjoy when i get you on to get your thoughts on this there's talk that progress is being made in these gun talks between democrats and republicans chuck schumer extending these negotiations are you optimistic we can have a deal i am optimistic there is a sense in the room that we wish to accomplish not a sense in the room that we uh are going to our corners and not talking it'll be something which respects a law-abiding citizen's second amendment right but it is also something which addresses the issue of people who are mentally troubled are people who are hot heads are people who somehow are getting weapons and causing terrible crimes let's take care of the law abiding but also let's address the issue of the non-law abiding i think we'll get there so when it comes to those under the age of 21 having such weapons um what do you think i don't know one there's a court case out of the third or fourth circuit which suggests that it's unconstitutional to deny them access uh so without going into that that does represent a complexity we're trying to get something which can get 60 votes or hopefully more on the floor of the u.s senate and then pass the house of representatives that's our goal if something gets us there that's under consideration i'm not sure that would be there got it senator bill cassidy good catching up with you appreciate it be well

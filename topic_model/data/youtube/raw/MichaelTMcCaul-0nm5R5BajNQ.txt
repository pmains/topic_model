welcome back in just a few hours the house set to vote on a border bill that will reign in the president's power to give illegal immigrants amnesty but does the bill go far enough to address the border crisis joining us now as the chairman of the house homeland security committee congressman michael mccall good morning chairman tomorrow everyone's set to take recess there do you believe that this will actually get accomplished everyone's going to leave with something sign sealed and delivered well the house is going to do this job this is a crisis that demands action and leadership and we will provide that today in several ways one a message of deterrence we're going to change the 2008 trafficking law which basically says that if you come into the united states from central america you'll be treated just like we treat the mexicans uh with a very swift uh removal from the united states back to your country of origin you know back home in the humane way and secondly deploying the national guard you know the governor of my state has already activated the national guard but it's the federal government's responsibility under the constitution to pick up the tab for that so we will be deploying the national guard all throughout the southwest border as a border security measure i think those two things you know the 2008 tweak is important because that will stop the flow coming into the country once we send them back they will stop coming in sure 2012 the president has this dream act if you got brought here by your parents as a young child you can stay you're not going to be deported 2008 looked at sex trafficking was misinterpreted now the senate has their own version it has 2.7 billion in it yours has 650 million in it you're going to do your thing and amend those laws but we're going to what we're wondering here as americans what's going to get done what is harry reid going to do with that well i hope for once in washington we can be responsible and lead in the time of crisis and solve problems and that's what we're doing you know as house republicans on our side and the monies appropriate by the way go towards detention and removal and repatriation back to their countries no new money it all comes out of the fema disaster relief on you mentioned that the daca the 2012 executive action that in my judgment uh circumvented the congress we're going to reign that one in as well with the vote on the floor reign that in so that this president can no longer do that the surge really started in 2012 when this executive action sure was put into place exactly uh it was about two hours ago we had the governor of the great state of indiana mike pence on this program congressman and he was talking about how he discovered through the news that hundreds of these illegals were being dumped in his state the government didn't tell him it was the news media here he is listen to this we have obligations as you mentioned it's about back to school time in indiana but there's also potentially health other welfare issues that we be need to be prepared to deal with in the fa i mean it's just completely unacceptable that we read about this in the newspaper spiriting people around the country and not informing state governments and local officials about about their placement or long-term placement with private individuals or with institutions is not the answer well why is it chairman the federal government isn't telling state governors who are going to be on the hook for school and welfare and food and stuff like that that they're sending these kids there i think it's totally irresponsible and i've had this conversation with the secretary of homeland security why aren't you telling us where you're putting these children because the governors need to know yeah uh the county officials need to know this will impact every members district across the nation and i think to mike pence's point you know under state laws we have to we are required to educate the children uh in these cases the children i've seen uh quite frankly their native dialect is an an indian dialect it's not even spanish uh they would be put into a special ed type class translators yeah new class this is this is why we need to stop the flow that's why our bill i think is is is the answer to stopping this crisis and stopping the flow of these kids coming into the united states all right well it's going to pass in the house let's see what happens in the senate sir thank you very much for joining us live from dc thank you thanks for having me all right coming up

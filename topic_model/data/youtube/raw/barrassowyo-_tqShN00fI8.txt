i'm john barrasso united states senator from the state of wyoming we are here at the southern tip of texas the front line in this battle for the border and the number one reason many of us came and joined by senator cruz and senator cornyn is to thank the border patrol agents the men and women of this nation who put their lives on the line every day to protect our nation and who are receiving not the help or the thanks that they should be getting from the president of the united states in this administration the president is quick to condemn them for doing their job well he refuses to do his job of protecting the border from the invasion that is coming in from this southern border president biden has created a crisis in this country a humanitarian crisis a criminal crisis a national security crisis ted talked about specific cases one after another after another the numbers the big numbers are hard to fathom three million encounters with illegal immigrants probably a million more that got away and it's not just those numbers it's the amount of drugs that are coming in weapons and take a look at the weapons in terms of the confiscation by our agents it's the drugs that are killing americans they talk about the amount of drugs that they were able to seize but there's a lot of drugs that aren't being seized and that's why right now the death rate from fentanyl illegal narcotics in the united states is an all-time high the number one cause of death in america today for adults under the age of 45 is drug related and so much of it fentanyl coming across this southern border from mexico to the united states and the money that is coming from this goes to the goes to the gangs goes to the cartels we talked to the border patrol about their budget the amount of money of budget for the border patrol here for the whole year is very small compared to what the cardels are able to make every week through smuggling of drugs and smuggling of people and yet the democrats and joe biden turn their back look the other way refuse to see the tragedy that they are bringing to our country as a result of their policies now from wyoming has wyoming been impacted every state has been impacted all of america is now a sanctuary city our death rates in wyoming from fentanyl has tripled in the last two years and joe biden still hasn't been here he actually hasn't been to the border since 2008 and that was just a drive-by i would say to the president of the united states get back to america show up right here talk to these border agents listen to them they know what we need to do to secure the border you have an obligation and a responsibility to do that and start today

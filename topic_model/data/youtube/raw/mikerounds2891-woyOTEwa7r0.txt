i want to go now to republican senator mike rounds he sits on both the senate armed services and the foreign relations committee and has been briefed regularly throughout the crisis senator i really appreciate your time i want to start with you where we are right now um uh well matthew chance is literally standing but it editorially here uh what's going on in kiev the siege the russian forces right outside uh the city lined up uh these next hours president zielinski saying could be the assault this night will be very difficult is exactly what he said do you believe that he is right that we are now in these hours where we see the fate of the capital this would be consistent with the reports that we've received for the last several weeks the indication was it would take several days for the very large russian army to overtake and basically get in to give along with some of the other major cities it doesn't mean that the fighting would be over but it does mean that they would have in hand or at least they would be able to get into the capital city which which is not a good sign we've been warned that that could happen fairly quickly just because of the size of the russian force what i don't think people knew for sure was how much of a resistance our ukrainian allies or friends would put up and it appears right now that they are doing everything they can to defend their homeland they are and you know that we've seen here senator you heard matthew talking about the 18 000 guns given away in keeve to anybody who wanted to fight on the streets the molotov cocktails um i have met here so many young men some of them spend a lot of time shooting they all have guns there's no limit on the number of guns you can have here they all plan to fight in an insurgency i know if you just heard the man i met today a reservist he showed up said he's going to destroy the russians in his country but i've also senator met people with no training or just getting limited training and suddenly they're being trained in bazookas they're being trained in mines they're being trained in molotov cocktails everybody has a willingness to fight and and it is unbelievable when you see that passion have you been surprised by the ukrainian military and the ukrainian people and their willingness to fight to physically fight with deadly weapons in these past few days no look what what they're what they're experiencing right now is their own 9-1-1 you remember the feeling in america when we were attacked by terrorists now you have a cold calculating killer on their border and threatening themselves threatening their their government threatening their their children their relatives uh they have no choice but to stand and fight and uh not look what we need to do though and where we can make a difference is we can begin our programs of continued uh defensive weapons uh offensive weapons uh we can provide a lend lease program look we're not talking right now about sending in our troops into ukraine because we don't have a legal authorization to do so but we can most certainly provide them with lethal weapons to help defend themselves i think the american people understand freedom and they understand what it means to defend your country that's something that we all have in common with ukrainians yes indeed and let me ask you one quick follow to that that i think is very important now obviously it's clear there will be no u.s troops on the ground in ukraine that would be a direct war between two nuclear superpowers but when you talk about providing offensive weapons at this point in the process or do you have any fear that that could also provoke a direct attack from russia and perhaps a very much bigger and more horrific war than the one we're seeing now right now with the attitude that vladimir putin has been putting forward anything is possible he clearly has been cold and calculating and he clearly feels that in that geographic region he has the upper hand i think he's going to be surprised at the amount of resistance but i think he's also going to be surprised at the solidarity that members of nato are going to express and other members of the soviet uh other members of the european union are going to express and look what we can do right now is to express as strongly as we can our support but even more than that unilaterally there are some things that we can do to to limit his ability to wage war we should be creating as much energy in this country as we possibly can natural gas should be should be not only created but we should be exporting it as quickly as possible same thing with petroleum products we have to get europe out from underneath the control of vladimir putin and right now that means taking away the gas station which is russia right absolutely thank you very much senator i appreciate your time

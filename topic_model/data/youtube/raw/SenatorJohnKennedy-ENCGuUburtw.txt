mr president the senator from louisiana is recognized thank you uh mr president mr president uh i rise today on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleague senator bill cassidy the last i know this has been true for states besides louisiana but the last 18 months from a weather perspective in louisiana has been a a fantastic impression of hell we've had three hurricanes um we've had depending upon you how you define them probably ten different heavy rain events and when i say heavy rain event i mean that doesn't sound very serious i can assure you it it was when you get 6 8 10 12 inches of rain in a short period of time you're going to flood i don't care if you're living on pike's peak you're going to flood the water's got to go somewhere and of course we were part of the bad debilitating freeze as well that also hit texas very hard my people mr president are very resilient and uh they're tough but they are tired um most americans when they think of a natural disaster at least in connection with louisiana think of hurricane katrina and certainly it was a bad one i was there we never would have recovered without the help of the american people and uh i i i will never be able to thank the american people enough for putting forth their their uh their their hard-earned tax dollars to help us recover as these new hurricanes and rain events and freezes impacted probably close to a third maybe 40 percent of my people the worst part of it but not not the only part that was hit hard was southwest louisiana at last count about one thousand hundred thousand excuse me one hundred thousand homes were uh were damaged flooded or blown blown over um they're still running the numbers the damages are in the billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars and my my people need help and the purpose of my bill today is to authorize help for them my bill today and senator cassidy's bill today i as i said i apparently have senator cassidy as well would authorize 1.1 billion dollars to to help my people recover now i want to emphasize mr president some people when they think of flooding in hurricanes they think of wealthy people with second homes with multi-million dollar dwellings on the beach that's not what i'm talking about i'm not putting down anybody who has a nice expensive beach house but that's not we're talking what we're talking about in louisiana the people that were were hit by these uh weather events through no thought of their own or just good honest middle americans who get up every day and go to work and obey the law and they pay their taxes they try to do the right thing by their kids their biggest investment is their home and and many uh completely lost their home many of them had flood insurance but it didn't co many of them had homeowners insurance and both but it just didn't cover uh their losses completely so we're talking about middle america here and i want to make that uh that clear now um mr president i'm sure you're thinking and because i know you well and you're you're you're a smart man um okay we spending 1.1 billion dollars here where we're going to get it well i come to to you today with a problem but i come to you today with a solution um i don't want to digress too much but at one po as you know we're trying to build out 5g in america and 5g operates through radio waves through the air called spectrum and the fcc is in charge of those radio waves and a couple of years ago the fcc and those radio waves by the way belong to the to the american people the fcc licenses them out to uh to companies to use in uh in wireless communications a few years ago the fcc was about to give away what's called the c-band spectrum these these particular radio waves that would allow for 5g to be to become reality in america and a number of us objected we said you know you you don't own these radio waves american people on these radio waves why are you giving them away and after some lively discussions we finally turned the fcc around and they decided to auction those radio waves to the highest bidder they brought in 80 billion dollars 80 billion dollars and i'm very proud of that that money is sitting in an account in the department of treasury senator cassidy's bill and my bill would authorize the use of 1.1 billion dollars of that 80 billion dollars in cash to be to be used through community development plot grants to help my people recover and mr president i can assure you i wouldn't be here today asking for this if my didn't people didn't desperately need it they're hanging on they're hanging on um with every ounce of strength they have but they're human and as i said they're tough but they are they're tired for that reason mr president um on behalf of senator cassidy and myself as if in legislative session i ask unanimous consent senate proceed to the immediate consideration of s-2359 which is at the desk i further ask that the bill be considered red read a third time in past and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table

Thank You mr. chairman we've been talking about human rights and trade this morning and ambassador Kirk what I've learned on the trade side over the last few months is that when trade agreements are negotiated industry advisors sit in a far stronger position than virtually everyone in the Congress for example an industry advisor from the motion picture association can sit at their desk with a laptop enter their username and password and seen the negotiating text of a proposed trade agreement virtually no one in the Congress virtually no one in the Congress has the ability to do that how is that right well senator I want to make it plain but it's not just industry but it's represented visors they have security clearances and by virtue of that and they represent a broad range of interests from both industry environmental groups business groups it is a broad representation to make sure that we have their views on our trade policies we go for it every member of Congress any member of Congress that wants to see the text of any trade agreement that we are negotiating has the ability to do so as long as we do so in a secure and environment that's private so I mean I would only offer that that one clarification that any elected official in this body has the ability to see those same texts as any of our clear advisers mr. ambassador I don't know of any instance where you go in to trade negotiations these pivotal negotiations that are key to creating more good-paying American jobs without the expertise of your staff is you've correctly noted these are technical issues and we're not allowed to do that that's why I'm saying that these advisors are placed in a far stronger position I gather you don't think that's a problem I do and colleagues here in the Senate on both sides of the aisle do senator burr colleagues on this committee Democrats and Republicans think it's a problem and I know time is short and I just want you know i'm going to stay out until we get this corrected Thank You mr. chairman

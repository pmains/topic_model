Thank You mr. chairman thank you both for being here and also thank you for your service general cofrin you you stated that f-35 is the quarterback of our fighters fighter aircraft and you also said that by 2040 you want a eighty twenty percent dominance of the air wing by the fifth-generation fighters like the f-35 and in all my time on House Armed Services Committee we had a lot of discussion about the need to invest in more of fifth-generation into our current fleet but then also to start investing in sixth generation aircraft certainly because our competitors on a global scale the Chinese are pushing into the sixth generation themselves so I'm a little bit confused how will funding the f-15 x.x affect your goal of this dominance given that a sustained defense budget is not guaranteed moving into the future yes ma'am thank you so first I'll just I'll say that the f-35 as just I describe it is the quarterback of more than the fighter force it's the quarterback of the penetrating joint and when you look at the investment in that we are making in this budget in penetrating capability you'll see a hundred and thirty five billion dollars of investment but then but that is that is that is f-35 plus B 21 plus other capabilities that were plus space capabilities that all are required to penetrate enemy airspace and be able to watch the enemy so first and foremost the f-35 which is why we are not backing an inch off of our program of record and maintain the f-35 because it is the quarterback of the joint team that we need the challenge we face as a near-term challenge our analysis indicated though to be able to drive aircraft age to a manageable level and to be able to do the missions that we require we have to procure 72 aircraft a year to do that there's four aircraft that we have to fly in the fourth generation capacity wise into the 2030s and that's the f-15 see the a-10 the f-15e and the f16 three are going to be capable of flying into 2030s one is not going to make it so the f-15 refresh only to give us the capacity we need as we make that transition from 2080 to 80/20 and we find ourselves in this position again because as the chairman mentioned when the decision to cancel the f-22 occurred we're supposed to have 1,100 f-35s right now we have less than 300 so we're faced with we're faced with the situation we have right now and as the secretary I looked at the cost estimates and f15 refresh using the investments that the Saudis and the Qataris have put in that line to replace the f-15 see as long as we don't impact the f-35 line was a reasonable choice so you're refreshing that the Charlie model f-15s and they're going into the e X then you what's the projective lifespan for the refresh model into the future you're seeing into 2030 yes ma'am actually longer the the model of the e.x model has got a 20,000 hour service life expectancy and without effect would your future requests are going to be for the number of 35 ma'am if we if if if we ever get to a point where we are trading f-35s for a 15s let me tell you that's a bad choice the f-15 is not an f-35 it will never be an f-35 we are just you know in the flying business week you know we described things as runway behind us and runway ahead of us the room the decision that was made on the f-22 to put us in a place we're in is runway behind us I can't effect that the secretary and I can only affect runway ahead of us and what we need is we need the capacity and we've got to get 272 aircraft a year and we've got to look at the cost projections to be able to make an affordable decision going forward understood also airspace about altitude above you and gas on the ground behind yet right last year it was reported that more than 126 military installations or sites and their surrounding communities rely on wells or ground water sources that contain dangerous levels of - chemical compounds that are tied to birth defects and certain cancers known at pea Foss and P fo US secretary Wilson how many Air Force military installations may be threatened by dangerous levels of P Foss and P foes do you know ma'am we have done a hundred and ten detailed site inspections we have looked at 297 total locations so so we've done the detail of those of the ones we did so we did an initial look and then and in that initial look we identified 21 installations where we need to do alternative water supplies so there is a immediately alternative water supplies to make sure that people have safe drinking water we then go back and do a more detailed site inspection and we have done 110 detailed site inspections of a total of a hundred and eighty nine I think active facilities we also do some on on locations that were bracht what about the ones that are on air guard that whose active Guard Reserve okay thank you you've ever seen the

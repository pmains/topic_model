Democrats are not afraid of border security they are not afraid of keeping this country safe and I will continue why do we have 11 million people in this country illegally either because they cross the border illegally or they overstayed their visa if we're doing a good job in this country to protect our border why do we have so many people who came into the country illegally because well right now because they're desperate because my Union okay but right now it's El Salvador it's Guatemala it's gang violence it's a civil war it's it's hunger it's fear but traditionally we are a country that has benefited from immigration we are stronger because of our immigrant roots we are stronger because immigrants have come to this country and helped build this country it's the entrepreneurialism as the innovation so for the 12 million people that are here we need comprehensive immigration should the Democrats be proud of the fact that they've helped enforce the border or happy over the fact they like immigrants what press even if they're illegal a year no let me be clear what President Trump has done is confuse the issue there are two parts of immigration there's the border security part which is to to fight against cross-border terrorism human trafficking gun trafficking and drug trafficking that's the part we will all fund that is the part that we have to continue to make sure actually get the Reese what about just poor Mexicans who want to move the United States chunk of people he'll address that but the second half are people who want to come here because they're seeking asylum that's where President Trump has gone off the rails that's where he has been inhumane and frankly he's been frightened frightened of immigrants and refugees he's been a coward

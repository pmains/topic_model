hi this is congressman luke tomorrow with another edition of blaine buzz thanks for joining us this week i just want to give you a quick update about what's been going on during the august recess here we've been busy out on the road talked to lots of folks had a small business forum or two that we discussed a lot of issues with small business folks and issues are coming back uh similar to what we've had all during of the course of the year regulation red tape the overzealousness of government regulators you know tax policy is a big issue we're going to continue to work on those things and listen to folks hopefully bring those those stories back to washington and impress on how we've got to find a way to relieve this problem that's sitting here and causing a lot of uncertainty a lot of stress on small business folks especially one of the things that we're probably also going to try and work on here a little bit is the farm bill toward the end of september with the drought that we've had it's been a big issue obviously to our farm communities we were state fair last week that was the topic of discussion obviously as well farm bill disaster uh funding is top of mind for our agricultural folks of course agriculture's number one industry in our district so it's something we're going to have to really focus on and hopefully get something passed here shortly with that we're continuing to look at the issues toward the end of the year here and hopefully come september when we get back in session we'll be able to do some things and work on those issues but quite frankly i'm not all that hopeful but we'll we'll keep pushing and trying to get something done we need to add certainty to people's lives and their businesses and that's what we need to try and work on but until then uh if you have something don't hesitate give us a call we expect to uh have some good news for you hopefully when we get back we'll start working on some issues uh right now it doesn't seem like the senate wants to help us out but maybe while they were away on break here they were hearing from all of you like i've heard from you and maybe they'll come back and change their minds go back to work thank you take care we'll see you next week

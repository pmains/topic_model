FOUR DECADES. IN AN ATTEMPT TO COOL INFLATION. >>STEVE HEARD THIS MORNING FOR DCS COUNCIL CHAIR AND WE EVEN HEARD A LITTLE BIT AGO FROM SENATOR TIM KAINE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF DCS >>CRIMINAL CODE. LAST HOUR. WE SPOKE WITH THE COUNCIL CHAIR. MENDELSON WHO HAD THIS MESSAGE FOR >>HIS FELLOW LAWMAKERS. MESSAGING AROUND THE BILL IS SO IMPORTANT, AND IN HINDSIGHT, THE COUNCIL DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB MESSAGING. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMPARISON SHEET THAT SHOWS WHERE WE ARE ON DIFFERENT CRIMES WITH OTHER STATES OR THE COMPARISON SHEET THAT SHOWS WHERE THIS PILL WAS , IN TERMS OF WHAT JUDGES ARE ACTUALLY DO IT. >>ALRIGHT SO THAT'S PART OF HIS TAKE THE HOUSE, OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE FIRST TO APPROVE A RESOLUTION TO SQUASH THE REVISIONS, AND SO WE WANTED TO GET THEIR TAKE ON IT. AND JOINING ME NOW IS HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP TOM EMMER. CONGRESSMAN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. THANKS FOR JOINING US. THANKS TO HAVING ME THANKS FOR HAVING ME STEVE ANYTIME, SO IT'S INTERESTING. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO COVER THIS FROM AS MANY ANGLES AS POSSIBLE TO HELP OUT OUR DC VIEWERS, AND WE JUST HEARD THERE FROM THE COUNCIL CHAIRMAN IN D. C. WHO SAID QUITE HONESTLY, WE MADE A MISTAKE IN OUR MESSAGING HERE THAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE MAYBE WE ARE SOFT ON CRIME. I KNOW THAT'S BEEN YOUR ARGUMENT YOUR COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS WHAT IS YOUR WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? FIRST OF ALL ON THE BILL ITSELF AND THE MESSAGING. HE DID MAKE A MISTAKE, NOT JUST HAVING MESSAGING BECAUSE THE MESSAGING IS A RESULT OF THE ACTUAL BILL , WHICH REDUCES AND OR SIGNIFICANTLY ELIMINATES CONSEQUENCES FOR EVERY CRIME IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER, STEPHEN THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT IT THE CRIME IS ON THE RISE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND QUITE FRANKLY, ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THESE ANTI POLICE, PRO CRIME, OR I GUESS SOFT ON CRIME POLICIES THAT IT. I DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, AND THE D C COUNCIL DID EXACTLY THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THE MESSAGING. IT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO MESSAGE AND THE LIKE IT OR NOT, THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. CONGRESS STILL HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SO WE BROUGHT A RESOLUTION TO UNDO THIS. WE NEED TO BE TOUGH ON CRACK. STEVE PEOPLE WANT TO BE SAFE IN THIS COMMUNITY. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED. THAT PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY, ALTHOUGH PRETTY INTERESTING. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER , THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THIS AREA, SHE AND 172 OF HER COLLEAGUES JUST TOOK A PARTISAN VOTE ON THE SIDE OF THE CRIMINALS, AND I THINK THEY WERE PRETTY SURPRISED WHEN JOE BIDEN WHO EVEN KNOWS HOW BAD THIS CHANGE THE CRIMINAL CODE WAS SAID HE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SIGN THIS RESOLUTION COMING OUT OF THE SENATE NOW IN THE HOUSE. WERE YOU SURPRISED BY JOE BIDEN DECISION THERE? I ACTUALLY KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT DECISION. WHAT WOULD HAVE SURPRISED ME IS THAT THEY CONTINUE THIS PARTISAN APPROACH THAT ANYTHING REPUBLICANS PROPOSE IS BAD IN THIS CASE. LOOK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EXERCISE OUR SUPERVISION. WE HAD A DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUE WHO'S ACTUALLY ASSAULTED IN HER APARTMENT HOUSE THE DAY OF THE VOTE. SHE OF COURSE, VOTED IN FAVOR OF THIS RESOLUTION. AGAIN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER IN 172 DEMOCRATS THAT VOTED AGAINST THIS. THEY'RE SIDING WITH CRIMINALS AND PRO CRIME POLICIES. INSTEAD OF GETTING TOUGH ON CRIME AND PROTECTING THE VERY PEOPLE WHO VOTED TO PUT THEM IN OFFICE. I WANT TO BRING THIS BACK TO D. C FOR A SECOND. WHAT ARE THE OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT THIS IS JUST AGAIN? RESPONDING TO WHAT THE COUNCIL CHAIR SAID TO US EARLIER THIS MORNING, HE MADE THE ARGUMENT. TAKE IT FROM WHAT IT IS, AND I'LL GET YOUR RESPONSE TO IT. HE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT WELL. YES THIS CITY IS REDUCING CRIME IN SOME PLACES, INCLUDING THE CARJACKING PENALTY. THERE ARE VERY FEW OTHER CITIES THAT EVEN HAVE CARJACKING PENALTIES AND HE THREW OUT COMPARISONS TO OTHER STATES, INCLUDING ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES FROM TENNESSEE. THAT EVEN THE REDUCED PENALTY WILL BE STRONGER THAN IN SOME OTHER STATES. DOES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO YOU? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THE MESSAGE THAT THE D C COUNCIL IS SENDING IS THAT WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS TO CRIMINALS. STEVE I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I COME FROM MINNESOTA. WE HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM IN MINNEAPOLIS AND DOWNTOWN ST PAUL, AND IT'S THE SAME ISSUE. YOU GOT TO BE TOUGH ON CRIME. YOU GOTTA HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES. YOU GOTTA PROSECUTORS WHO ACTUALLY WILL ENFORCE THE LAWS. REMEMBER THE REASON WE HAVE GOVERNMENT? THE REASON WE'RE CIVILIZED IS BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS AND THEIR PROPERTIES IN IN THEIR PROPERTY AND THE D. C COUNCIL. THEY DID NOT DO IT IN THIS CASE, STEVE THAT'S WHY CONGRESS ACTED. THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SIGN THIS. AND QUITE FRANKLY, THAT'S WHY ABIGAIL SPANBERGER SHOULD BE ANSWERING TO THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR CONGRESSMAN 11. LAST QUESTION FOR YOU. THIS IS THE BIG ONE FOR MOST OF OUR VIEWERS, AND WE'RE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE OF DC HERE WHO WATCHES FAITHFULLY EVERY MORNING. I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHING IS GOING TO ARGUE THAT THEY WANT MORE CONTROL OVER CRIME AND YOU SEE SOMEONE LESS CRIME RIGHT? EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CRIME IN THE CITY. ONE THING THAT A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IS THE OVERSIGHT COMING FROM CONGRESS RIGHT NOW, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE THE OVERSIGHT. BY THE WAY. THE LAW IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW, BUT THE QUESTION THAT WE GET FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE IN D C IS ARE YOU GOING TO EXERCISE THAT MORE OFTEN NOW THAN YOU HAVE IN THE PAST? ACTUALLY YEAH, STEVE, I THINK THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THE D C COUNCIL DID SOMETHING THAT QUITE FRANKLY, IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO SECURING THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THIS IS WHERE CONGRESS SHOULD ACT IF THEY KEEP DOING A PRO CRIME POLICIES IF THEY KEEP TRYING TO PUSH THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS WILL TAKE ACTION. BUT THIS ONE'S PRETTY CLEAR. STEVE LEAVE. THEY VOTED FOR SOFT ON CRIME POLICIES, CONGRESS ACTED AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES HOW BAD THIS IS, WHICH IS WHY HE'S GOING TO SIGN THIS RESOLUTION AND OVERRIDE THE D. C COUNCIL CONGRESSMAN. WE AND BY WE I MEAN ALL OF OUR VIEWERS AS WELL. LOVE TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED INSIDE THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. APPRECIATE YOU, STEVE . ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. THA

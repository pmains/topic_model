representative tracy man thanks for joining us how are you this morning hey good morning doing well how are you guys good doing real good thank you appreciate it so a couple of big topics obviously uh what got passed the infrastructure bill but first we'll take a look at these mandates and uh definitely some pushback going on including uh governor laurie kelly you know just y'all know i strongly oppose them i just think you know the government's provided a vaccine they provide information about the vaccine it's now time for free americans free kansas to decide if it's right for them the federal government has no business mandating vaccines it's um wrong policy and should not be happening and i think we got to remember you know this is multi-faceted meaning some of the mandates that have been issued from the byte administration have been for federal employees some have been for federal contractors some have been for health care facilities most recently and the one that's getting a lot of news coverage right now is for employers who hire more than 100 people so it can get confusing because there's a lot of moving parts here but um but but that's you know that at a high level that's somewhat of what's going on right now osha and the paperwork they've put forward and under the rule businesses would have to choose to force a vaccine on their employees or pay a fine and some of these are pretty hefty thousand dollars so so let's talk specifically about the the mandate that impacts people in employers greater than a hundred so the mandate was issued a few weeks ago it then goes to osha who will enforce it to write the rule or basically the regulations on how that will play out and then the omb or the office of management and budget prints that you know reviews and then prints that rule publishes it well that rule got published end of last week it was uh wednesday or thursday of last week and so then the following day and about in the rule that they um published said the fines for employers that don't comply would be up to fourteen thousand dollars per offense think about that it would go into effect early january i think it was january the 4th now um it was immediately uh you know in in court you know people filed lawsuit to block the mandate and that happened by a whole series of state attorney generals also by some private businesses as well the good news is on so those were issued friday saturday the fifth district court of appeals put a stay on the mandate so although that's just for the fifth district where kansas is not in the state that they issued um would apply to all public businesses now in that in what the court did on saturday they give department of justice to the end of the day today to then respond to that stay so i realize we're weighing the weeds but that's exactly where things sit legally right and that doesn't affect uh like federal employees because because the federal government can mandate their own employees what to do is that correct correct that's been um challenged legally i've been very outspoken about this on the floor of the house and committees um we voted we've introduced legislation to prevent it you know but but so far that is still in place now the the federal government like public and like private employers if this does go into effect should have to provide a waiver for medical reasons and for religious reasons but so far the federal vaccine mandates for federal employees is still in effect it's kind of clear on this it it is not the vaccine that i see people have problems with it's the being mandated to do it if there was a mandate somewhere that said as americans we have we each have our responsibility to protect ourselves and protect others from the spread of covet 19 that's a mandate that makes sense because now you have different alternatives that you can use whether it's wearing a mask whether it's social distancing whether it's different kinds of treatments but that's really the heart of this isn't it i mean we've got the federal government mandating one specific course that while it works for many uh we know for a fact it doesn't work for all well yeah and at the heart of it in my view is freedom in other words there's an inverse relationship between the size of government and our freedom as government grows freedom shrinks as as freedom grows government shrinks and we see how government has just grown exponentially in its size and this intrusion in our lives and in my view that's what this uh really comes down to i mean the bottom line is cove is not going anywhere uh we now have a vaccine and and people can choose whether to get it but we've got to move on we've got to figure out as a country how do we how we move forward through this pandemic because we're going to have future variants i believe and we've got to keep moving ahead because we can't continue to stay down and we can't continue to infringe on people's freedoms sure sure but putting this aside because that's major but boy we we we beat some of the stuff into the ground so much we know we we know where everybody stands on this and now we're looking to see where it plays out but also over the weekend uh uh they call it a major victory for the white house the infrastructure bill and that's great and that's fine but is it really just a victory a name only because this is far from a done deal uh well well a couple things so i think what you're leading to the past is the infrastructure bill exactly 1.2 trillion dollars which i didn't want to say the dollars because i couldn't remember yeah yeah yeah 1.2 trillion dollars now there's the infrastructure bill and then it has been linked to what they call what we call the reconciliation bill okay um or the build back better um it gets confusing because there's there's all these things thrown out there the buildback better or the reconciliation bill started off at 3.5 a whopping 3.5 trillion dollars that now is being negotiated um is down to 1.75 trillion dollars but it's still way way way too much money i strongly oppose it so those things have been linked the infrastructure bill passed at 11 o'clock on friday night uh it all kind of blurs together because i was on an airplane home um you know the saturday morning early but but that did pass and understand um you know there's tons of stuff in that bill that are not that's not infrastructure there's billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging stations billions of dollars for climate change research you know a lot of things that aren't roads bridges true infrastructure that's why i oppose it as do the majority of republicans as well well does that bill still have a lot of social programs in it which none of which would be considered infrastructure um it has some social programs in it um not nearly as many as the next train car coming down and again these have been working together which is the reconciliation or the buildback better the buildback better is more what they what's being referred to as human infrastructure which is just nonsense well these are these are government programs to get started that it's a nice term because unnecessary everybody likes the term infrastructure so if you just use that word and throw a human in there then it throws everybody off but now that this is this is where it's at what's the next step for the for the for the first infrastructure bill what well the first um that that is that um has been signed and is into law so the senate had passed the first version of that and now behind the house had said on it and now the house had voted on it they passed it and signed it on saturday so that's a done deal what's next is the reconciliation or buildback better or human infrastructure i refer to the build back better bbb is bad bad bad because guys it will you know add trillions of dollars to our debt this is where you have all the talk of increased taxes originally they try to put in their um things like having the irs monitor bank accounts all of those things are in this next big bill that they're working on i've got to be honest with you i i i from that bill i couldn't decide who was running the government whether running the running the white house whether it was president biden or whether it was bernie sanders well remember that that bill that comes out um you know it started in the senate and the chairman of the senate budget committee is bernie sanders well there you go that that kind of there there you go so that's why you know that they kind of tells you a lot of what you need to know about the size and magnitude of that legislation who he has repeatedly said that 3.5 trillion dollars is not nearly enough um you know which is just okay do you see a trim down of this thing before it gets any farther down the track tracy well it's it was started 3.5 trillion it got trimmed to 1.75 trillion and you know the whole question is what will your more moderate democrat house members agree to and what will senator manchin and senator cinema on the senate side agree to senator manchin said his top line was 1.5 trillion here's what i have to remember those guys it's possible to decrease the top line you know the the whether 1.5 trillion 1.75 or whatever by starting all of the same programs but just looking at them at three years or five years instead of over 10 years so you've got to look at not just what is the top line number or the cost projected but also what programs are getting started um the under the underlying programs and what will they end up costing regardless of how long the bills for if that makes sense

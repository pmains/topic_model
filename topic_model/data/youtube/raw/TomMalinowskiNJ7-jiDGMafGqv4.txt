thank you so so much for uh holding this hearing and for having me um i'd like to use my time today on behalf of the seventh district of new jersey to urge reinstating the full state and local tax deduction um as you know last congress we passed the bipartisan restoring tax fairness for states and localities act to eliminate the salt cap and thank you again so much for your support in that effort unfortunately the senate majority leader buried that legislation in his legislative graveyard so this year as some of the tax cuts from the 2017 tax bill begin to expire we have a chance to right this wrong to put it succinctly any tax reform body any tax reform package this body takes up must include a restoration of the salt deduction the pandemic and the economic crisis make that request all the more urgent now in my district over 53 percent of taxpayers took the salt deduction when it was last available the typical family in new jersey lost around 9 000 in deductions due to the cap in my district the number is sixteen thousand dollars how do we defend that one argument that's been made is that these are mostly wealthy taxpayers and that's simply not true in new jersey the teachers are firefighters they're small business owners their young families who are purchasing their first home seniors who want to retire in theirs according to our society of certified public accountants in new jersey more than 60 percent of their individual and family clients making under 200 000 a year were affected by the cap how do we justify this when so many others who are actually wealthy benefited so much from the 2017 tax bill how do we defend it when the effective corporate tax rate in america has dropped to 12 as a result of that bill when large profitable corporations like zoom report paying absolutely no taxes now there's another argument made and this is one of the hardest of all for my constituents to stomach and that is that the salt deduction is some kind of special subsidy for high-tech states one that taxpayers in other states shouldn't have to pay well the reality is that the state's hardest hit by the salt cap are also the states that give the most to our federal budget while getting the least back depending on what estimates you choose new jersey gets between 79 and 91 cents back from the federal government for every dollar we send in taxes in these days of massive deficit spending there is no federal deficit from the point of view of new jersey now we don't mind helping kids in other states get a better education or helping folks around the country get better healthcare or contributing to our national defense by supporting bases in the south or west because after all we are one country we are all americans we all benefit from those things but what my middle class constituents do mind is politicians from those states then taking away one of the only benefits we got in the federal tax code and then trying to justify it with the argument that they don't want to subsidize us now finally i just want everyone to think about what our state and local taxes support in new jersey they mostly support education for our kids we make these contributions that's what they are contributions to ensure that every child in our communities has an equal chance to succeed and now those contributions are being taxed everybody gets hurt by that in my state and all around the country not just the people who lost their deductions mr chairman at every public event i hold in my district no matter the topic no matter how urgent the crisis we are currently facing with covet my constituents continue to ask me about restoring the salt deduction they want to know when congress will fix this injustice so i implore the committee to make it a priority in this congress to restore the deduction to lift the cap provide real relief to middle-class taxpayers in my district and across the country thank you again so very much i yield back

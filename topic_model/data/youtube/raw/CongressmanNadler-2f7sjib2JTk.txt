ding statement Thank You mr. chairman the events that have led up to this hearing are totally unacceptable a Monday of this week you notified us of this hearing without the 7 day notice required by the rules on Tuesday you started our committee markup more than an hour late again again without notice to the minority then you allowed mr. Jordan to offer an amendment to a resolution of inquiry that was patently non-germane and then you stood out of view of the cameras in the hallway just off the hearing room while the majority voted to overturn the ruling of their own chair that the amendment was not germane on Wednesday you dropped all committee business to interview Peter struck who had already volunteered to come in for an interview before he threatened him with a subpoena today we meet so that the majority can criticize the Deputy Attorney General to his face largely about his failure to produce documents that you know he cannot produce we will take a break so that we can go to the floor and vote on a so-called resolution of insistence based on the Jordan amendment from earlier this week a measure that is without precedent without the force of law and clearly a pretext for move against mr. Rosenstein that the majority has already planned and what is the great emergency that justifies this last-minute hearing why is the majority abandoned the rules and traditions that govern civility in the house the tired story of Hillary Clinton's emails of course plus a few conspiracy theories about this special counsel when President Trump and his administration were actively separating families at the border ripping children out of the arms of their parents and causing untold suffering to thousands of families that did not merit an emergency hearing by this committee and now the thousands of children are still separated from their parents with no clear plan from this administration for reuniting these families where is the emergency hearing on that issue we know that Russia after successfully interfering with our 2016 elections is actively working to disrupt the upcoming elections as well we are told this by all of our intelligence agencies the former national security adviser testified that our intelligence agencies despite this have received no instructions from the White to protect the integrity of our election system have we scheduled an emergency hearing and that matter for that matter have we conducted any oversight at all an election security on the family separation crisis and the administration's failure to protect dreamers on the Justice Department's radical decision not to defend the affordable care act in court on the Supreme Court's recent decisions to undermine voting rights and workers rights on the president's ongoing conflicts of interest and clear violations of the emoluments Clause of the Constitution or in the myriad other pressing issues within our committees jurisdiction no as with so many issues this committee stays silent but on Hillary Clinton's emails sound the alarms despite an inspector general's report that in more than 500 exhaustive pages demonstrates conclusively that the outcome of the Clinton investigation was not affected by any improper biased political or otherwise we're wasting precious committee time to chase Hillary Clinton yet again the Republicans seem desperate to prove that there was some sort of Pro Clinton and anti Trump conspiracy within the FBI when in fact the overwhelming evidence shows exactly the opposite virtually every action criticized in the inspector general's report director Comey's July announcement is public comments on the Clinton investigation and refusal to confirm the existence of the Trump investigations and is October decision to announce publicly the reopening of the Clinton email investigation ultimately harms the candidacy of Secretary Clinton and the newer to the benefit of Donald Trump and no one will deny that fact but I guess we shouldn't let facts stand in the way of a good manufactured emergency according to the Republican memo for today's hearing today isn't also an opportunity for members to consider quote the Justice Department's compliance with the committee's March 22nd subpoena close quote a subpoena that was not issued in compliance without rules and therefore cannot be enforced even if it were a properly issued subpoena the fight over document production seems to have boiled down to certain documents that the Republicans know the Department of Justice cannot turn over much of it evidence rule to an ongoing criminal investigation the scoping documents outlining specific lines of inquiry in an ongoing criminal investigation and the identities of confidential human sources still working undercover in the field and that of course is the whole point as part of their coordinated and determined effort to undermine the special counsels investigation Republicans are requesting documents they know they cannot have if they somehow find themselves in possession of sensitive documents that go to the core of the special counsels investigation and if past practice holds those documents will end up in the possession of the investment of the subject of the investigation namely President Trump and shortly thereafter on Fox News and if the majority is rightly denied they will do their best to undermine the credibility of the Department of Justice the credibility of the Deputy Attorney General and by extension the credibility of the special counsel they were likely tried to hold mr. Rosenstein in contempt some have even threatened him with impeachment they may argue that he must be removed from his oversight role over the special counsels investigation this is an investigation that might remind my colleagues that has already yielded five guilty pleas and that has led to the indictment of 20 people so far the president and some of his closest advisors are under investigation for having participated in a criminal conspiracy with a foreign power against the United States that is an emergency the president could practically confessed to lack the president practically confessed to Lester Holt on television that he obstructed the investigation into that at conspiracy when he said that he fired former FBI director Comey because of quote this Russia stuff with Trump and Russia close quote that is an emergency but is that the subject of today's emergency hearing no or of any emergency hearing no it is not I know that this has been a hard week for the majority I know that it must be tempting to change the subject and rally the base with cries of Locker up but we do not have the luxury of hiding or voting present at this critical juncture for our democracy we cannot hide from our responsibilities we cannot hide from our obligation to conduct oversight of a corrupted Minister we cannot hide from our constitutional duty to protect our elections from foreign interference or to stand up for the rules and for our domestic institutions and for the rule of law and we cannot hide from our responsibility not to interfere with a proper investigation I ask my colleagues to consider this question as we proceed when the special counsels work is complete when the enormity of what he finds has been laid bare how will the American people judge your actions today I yield back the balance of my time

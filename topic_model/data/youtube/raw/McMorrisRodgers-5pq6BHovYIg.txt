thank you thank you thank you to a great leader on the appropriations committee and i appreciate you yielding i rise in opposition to the bill though while it contains many partisan poison pills and reckless levels of spending there's a glaring omission funding for the long-term storage of nuclear waste safely storing our nation's existing and future nuclear waste in yucca mountain is of paramount importance eastern washington pioneer pioneered some of the most important breakthroughs in nuclear technology of the last century at the hanford site near tri-cities washington and their efforts are critical to continuing the development and the expansion of nuclear power in the next century however this important work came at a cost today more than 2 000 tons of spent nuclear waste and millions of gallons of high-level waste await disposal at the the hanford site which is why it is so necessary that we move forward with the yucca mountain site and properly dispose of the nuclear waste in eastern washington and from the sites in 38 other states across the country the united states has led the world in nuclear energy innovation and continued advancements in this important technology will be essential to meet our clean energy needs and maintain our global leadership in the 21st century failure to move forward with the yucca mountain site jeopardizes our ability to continue to innovate in the future and is unfair to the communities who have dealt with the cost of housing nuclear waste for the past 50 years i'd like to end by thanking congressman shimkas for his years of tireless leadership on this important issue whether shepherding legislation through the energy and commerce committee and through the house prodding the appropriations committee to act or leading delegations to see yucca firsthand no one has been more dedicated to solving the nuclear waste issue for our nation's communities let let's help him finish that fight by working on a bipartisan long-term solution to our country's nuclear waste and i yeah i yield back the general lady yields back the gentleman from oklahoma reserves and the gentlelady from new york

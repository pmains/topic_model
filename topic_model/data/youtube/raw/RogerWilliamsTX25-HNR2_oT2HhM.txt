and one of the loudest voices toward defunding is austin area republican congressman roger williams this week he's been about that and other issues including the 2016 race if there's no appetite to cut expenses in America let's cash flow America representative roger williams wants to implement his small business owner views in the government in a world where big companies get bigger he wants to cut taxes to focus on the little guys well there's a tremendous amount of small businesses that are that are closing you take the banks for example cuz graze the economy is in texas we've had 117 banks closed in texas he's up for reelection in 2016 and is running on his jump start America program which cuts income taxes corporate taxes payroll taxes and capital gains taxes in the hopes of repatriating money held overseas by businesses that's going to bring jobs back we never had so we're gonna put more people to work the tax cut with the most progress is his bill to cut the inheritance tax passed out of the house three weeks ago and it's gone on to the Senate his district includes fort hood which has seen its fair share of cuts from sequestration when lawmakers couldn't agree a few years ago and there's more to come we've got to get sequestration out of the military this can be one of my prime concerns when we get back but aside from that sequestration works for other agencies but doesn't work for the military we have to have the strongest military in the world if we don't the world's going to implode and right now we're going down from a million-man army to four thousand man army or navy is going to nineteen seven teen levels a lot of our airplanes are not flying because it can't get parts what's happened our military the last six years is a tragedy and we've asked the military taking trillion dollars in cuts to help balance the books this is wrong right now this next cut could affect Fort Hood about three thousand more troops they've already taken their cuts they've done a great job in managing their cuts but there's a point it's got to stop and I want to stop it we're gonna have to change the law to get the military out of sequestration but that's what we need to do like many Republicans he's against the recent deal with the rocks probably the worst deal we've seen since Neville Chamberlain when he came second world war two after talking to Adolf Hitler forever this is a bad deal I've had a chance to read it it does nothing for America it does everything to empower our enemy Iran

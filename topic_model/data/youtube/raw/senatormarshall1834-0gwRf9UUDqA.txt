okay thank you madam chair and again thanks to the secretaries for being here to talk about the intersection of health care and education something that's near and dear to so many of us if we talk about uh the the highest causes of death for your students for our students it's accidents or trauma suicide is number two homicide is number three cancer might be going up or down depending which age group we're talking about but focusing this morning for me is on the emotional health and and the impact on the suicide rates from covet as well as our policies that's what i want to focus on on today and especially what our mandates do to the emotional health of our children i turn to the conversation of natural immunity just for a second look i've seen the data all the moms out there have seen the data on natural immunity and i'm telling you these mama bears are going to protect their kids they don't see the benefit of a vaccine for something their children are already immune to and there are risks associated with the vaccine and don't get me wrong i've had the vaccine my parents the vaccine i hope my parents get their boosters soon i'm in favor of vaccines but when we're talking about our children and those ones that already have immunity i think that many americans have have concern about this and the emotional impact if those kids get kicked out of school because of this mandate i think you both would acknowledge that getting kicked out of school has a huge stigma to it and if if this is my question for you both yes or no if the cdc would acknowledge natural immunity and a child has antibodies would you consider excluding them from the mandate let me say that again if the cdc would acknowledge natural immune immunity and a child has antibodies would you consider excluding the child from the mandate secretary cordona yes or no thank you senator this issue requires more than a yes or no i know states and local districts are the ones making decisions around masks and men vaccines and i'll rely on them what i've done because i'm not a medical doctor is rely very heavily and that's what my question is so if the cdc acknowledge it and a child has antibodies would you support excluding that child from the mandate think of the emotional impact of that child being kicked out of school for something they're already immune to and the suicide rate secretary becerra can you answer the question yes or no senator you'll be disappointed senator to know that you're i was about to say you're going to be disappointed to know that it's not a yes or no answer because science doesn't act as quickly as you'd like on those answers what i can tell you is that we have looked at the science we have looked at some of the studies in the data and for example in the state of kentucky uh with regard to children there was a study that showed that for those uh actually individuals not just children people who were unvaxed who had had covet showed that they were twice as likely to be reinfected with covet than those who had been vaccinated yeah so we can argue about the studies all day and i'm a physician you're a lawyer and you probably don't want to go down that road because i'm telling you the huge majority of the studies show that natural immunity is better than the vaccinations a huge majority and let's not talk just about getting the virus let's talk about hospitalization about morbidity and mortality and your job neither your jobs is to decide what if what if the statement is true that i'm saying that that natural immunity is better that's up to the cdc so my question was if the cdc would acknowledge it and a child has antibodies would you excuse them from the mandate but we we need to go on i'm very concerned about migrants coming across the border carrying infectious diseases as well probably over 3 million migrants have come across the border illegally legally and many of which are children i'm very concerned about not just the covet and the variance they're bringing but but tuberculosis haiti has the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the western hemisphere measles mumps as well and what are you two going to do to to aid us test those children before they get into our schools and b to make sure that they get their immunization secretary becerra senator great question and we do as you know have jurisdiction over some of those migrant children who are unaccompanied and we have jurisdiction over them once they're turned over to us by customs and border protection we make sure that no child is placed in any setting whether it's in our congregate care or in a licensed care facility or in the hands of a responsible custodian without first making sure that they are free of covet and they've had a vaccination and so we make sure that no one whether it's a u.s citizen or anyone coming into this country can infect someone else and i'm sure you're measuring that's that somehow some way secretary cordon anything to add to to students entering to our school systems that have not been tested or properly immunized all students including non-citizen students have access to meals to education and any healthcare needs that they have to make sure that they're healthy but there's a huge difference in access and it actually happening right i mean we have to be just overwhelmed right now our systems do our schools do with these children 12 000 haitians recently have been turned into the united states and i want to share compassion and love with those folks i've done mission work in haiti i've been to the border i understand the the humanity of all this but i also don't want my grandchildren exposed to tuberculosis let alone new variants of coven thank

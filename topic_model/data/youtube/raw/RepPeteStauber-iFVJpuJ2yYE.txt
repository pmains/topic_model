Kalish hmm finally mr. kotas maki you're recognized for five minutes as well well I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to come here and speak my part hello I'm Jerry cordis Mackey I'm the owner of London Road rental Center in Duluth Minnesota and superior Wisconsin I started my business knew I did not buy an existing business I started February 1st of 2002 my business has 10 full-time employees and 20 seasonal employees we have grown from nothing to about a two million dollar volume of the two and a half million dollar inventory in 17 years the bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 had a huge impact on how I'd appreciate my equipment I use section 179 in bonus depreciation every year this is one of the tax laws that's really working for me and for all small businesses I've came to DC many times and lobbied hard to make this permanent I've been able to grow my business my company faster because of it and also our economy has grown continually because when I buy equipment like excavators and skid steers it creates a lot of jobs in the u.s. thousands of other small businesses use it just like I do I'm kind of addicted to it I either spend the money or have to pay a lot more taxes because I do not have the depreciation built up to write it off this has really helped me grow my business faster and continually the job cuts Act of 2017 saved me about 72 hundred dollars last year with health insurance going up another 10% this year and the commercial auto insurance going up 30% the money was used up fast we really needed that tax cut to help cover and maintain things we are an S corp so the pass-through tax cut that came through was very important to small businesses like mine the rising cost the health care and the fact the Affordable Health Care Act took the health insurance away from most of my employees we used to have a thousand dollar deductible and the employees could afford that not the premiums have doubled and the deductibles went to $6,000 the employees do not have the ability to cover that $6,000 deductible so basically they do not use their health care plans simply put the Affordable Care Act has been a disaster for small business we chase the insurance changes every year and it's a real hassle to keep up with it it takes a lot of time and energy trying to do the best for our employees balancing cost with benefits I feel I've been successful despite the government not because of it things like the celery employee pay issue caused a lot of issues I had to change my pay structure for my management people because of the threats of fines and such and then it was defeated or went away that issue cost me a lot of time and money the amount of regulation we have to deal with this huge we have three pickup trucks we use for deliveries most of our deliveries are within a hundred miles at almost all of our within 25 miles there we are in two states the businesses are about eight miles apart all of our drivers have to be 21 because 18 year olds can't cross that state line they can drive 200 miles in either state but they cannot drive across that imaginary line between the two just the point of interest an 18 year old can vote and he can go to war but he cannot drive across a state line it's insanity at work there are so many regulations just the DoD as an example with drivers records drug test trucks and truck inspections daily and annually the cut it's a huge cost to keep up on into track and then there's the trailers you have to do the same thing to them we rent a lot of different types of equipment and there's ANSI standards OSHA requirements and scaffolds ladders lifts very few people to understand that ladders are almost outlawed now in this country by OSHA then there's the new OSHA silica and dust regulations the reason I bring this up is we just don't need to know them for us we're supposed to educate our customers about them the tier 4 diesel regulations that went into effect for emissions they're driving up the costs and making it really tough to maintain our trucks and equipment and very expensive to our new diesel trucks are no longer reliable like Diesel's were known for they're continually in for repairs emissions repairs and in Duluth we have winter not tear for friendly at all like the one from Maine probably runs into that same issue I've lived the American dream my wife and I have worked hard for many years to get there we have jumped through hoops and have learned things I thought I'd never know we collect sales tax for 14 different municipalities that we collect federal taxes also we collect child support and court judgments for our employees my wife works full time to keep up with the taxes and the human resource training and records for our little business keeping up with the changes in HR and the tax is a job in itself something else to think about remember small businesses your tax collectors we do not get paid to do it we don't not get trained to do it but if we make a mistake we sure get punished for it in my time as a business owner I think I've heard there's a hundred and thirty seven different federal agency is making rules for us to follow then you have Congress in the courts we need to simplify this complicated system in the non and stop any non elected border agency from passing any rule or law we elected you to make the decision not the bureaucrats if it doesn't have enough support for Congress to pass it it shouldn't be a law or a rule I spend a lot of time working to keep up and keep these unelected bureaucrats and these agencies happy this is one of the largest burdens on my small business and all small businesses they touch every part of what I do every day and I don't even have enough time to touch on the employee issues and problems that we're currently having thank you very much I'll answer any questions thank you very much sir and with that I'm gonna start by recognizing the ranking member mr. Stuber who has a constituent who's going to be carrying out the opening prayers on the House floor so we're gonna let him ask questions first Thank You mr. chair so Jerry you had that was well stated you and I have talked about those those unelected which you referred to as bureaucrats putting legislation that affects small businesses and what you and I have talked about and which this committee understands 99 percent of our economy the small business and we as a small business owner myself for 29 years there's ups and downs or struggles but what we need to do is make sure that when we put legislation forward that we understand the consequences and it has to be a positive a net positive for our small businesses so I've got just two questions actually three and the first one you alluded to it in your statement but did the tax cut and Jobs Act have a positive effect on your business yes it did a very positive effect you and what was the state what did you say your savings was seventy two hundred dollars and then the second question is you've been what would you say if you had to pick your number one roadblock to be successful in relation to the federal government what would be the number one roadblock that that's a gigantic thing - I don't currently and it goes back to what what we're battling with with the employee issues is this 18 verses 21 and the Department of Transportation rules and it's it's a huge hindrance we have a young gentleman that's 19 years old now he's been driving trucks in Wisconsin or he has to start in Minnesota to do it because he can't cross that line and this young guy can drive a trailer as fast backwards as he can forward after doing this for years but he can't drive across that crazy line and finding people in that crazy line for the for the listeners here is the bridge between Minnesota to bridge Wisconsin yeah long bridge you know so that and it and again taxes is the other big thing the amount of money that we spend every year with depreciation with an accountants and with planning for the tax you know and it goes back to that that 179 has been great but I'm addicted to the spending because I have to wear I have to give the money to the government so that's a choice I make which granted has been great for the economy it's been fantastic because every year now I spend more money every year I project what I'm gonna grow I project how much I spent last year and you know John Deere Moline for you know autumn Moline Illinois they love me we've got a lot of yellow big steel out there and then the last question Jerry you know you have you commented that you have come out to Washington and testified several times from your perspective what can we as a committee work on to make sure that small businesses like yours thrive balancing all these regulations against cost every time these regulations come up there has to be a formula in there to understand the fact that it costs us so much money and somehow as they go forward and all of these other Department of Transportation OSHA all these as they're having their meetings outside of you again if there's a way to regulate them to make it that they have to bring stuff to you to get it passed instead of just them making the rules and making the changes and you know even their ability to tax is totally wrong because you're my congressman I elected you to make these decisions and to make these things I did not elect them so yeah Thank You mr. Coors Mike I can say that you know we've been here you know several months now as a freshman and I really appreciate this committee talking about some of the exact same things you had mentioned about the repercussions of legislation or the repercussions of legislation by unelected folks its rulemaking that really kills us it's not just legislation its rulemaking agreed and we've talked about that as well so I would just want to in closing Jerry I want to just congratulate you and Kathy on that American dream you're living it you're you're employing people and I want to say from from our perspective of Minnesota's eighth congressional district you have been a steward of small business and you understand it and of course your affiliation with the National Federation of Independent Business they understand small business too and we appreciate that so so I think a couple of seconds left we have go ahead a thing on the health care issue what it did to taking it away from my employees the sad story oh and my mechanic crashed his ATV and we had the thousand dollar deductible he was able to take care of that in one year with the six thousand dollar deductible and this guy makes close to $50,000 a year he's not super poor he's not wealthy that would devastate him we need to figure out how to fix this health care issue that's just for small business to offer it has become such a burden and I don't want to just turn my employees over to government-controlled health care it's something that I don't see working Thank You mr. Cortes meki and I appreciate your attendance back to you mr. chair thank you

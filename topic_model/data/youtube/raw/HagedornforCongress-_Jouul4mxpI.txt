this issue of Obamacare is a clear contrast between the left in the rightness country and President Obama and people like Tim Walz and these others that are running for the seat have have done anything to service to the American people we have a lot of folks in this in this district who were promised you can keep your keep your doctor you can keep your plan you're gonna save twenty five hundred dollars a year all lives most people would be happy if their if their premiums only went up twenty five hundred dollars a year let alone saved a lot of people spend in 10 20 $30,000 a year for premiums with deductibles so high the insurance is worthless now what's the answer in the left the left a single-payer Obama on steroids even more government control and if you want twenty five percent tax hikes waiting lines rationing that's a great answer if you don't want the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota to continue to thrive that's a great policy and that's where the elect is I'm on the other side repeal this Obamacare get rid of it and then we have to conceptually move this country towards free-market health care and what that means is using pre-tax dollars for people that go out there and purchase their health insurance or just their medical care have transparency and cost so people have something set up to go out there and shop for their routine medical care and then get back all of this works backed up by catastrophic coverage we need health insurance to mimic insurance that we have for auto on home and everything else and when we get to that type of system it will work and when a federal government gets out of it with regulations and taxes like that medical device tax and everything else we're going to have a better country again and people will have more money in their back pockets to spend on other more meaningful things

with us now from Capitol Hill Democratic senator from Virginia senator Tim Kaine and Washington Pulitzer prize-winning columnist and so she added for the Washington Post nimbus in DC political analyst Eugene Robinson senator Cain what or what threshold do you think the president needs to cross as far as proving the need to take action against Assad militarily to get enough members of the Senate and the house to go along with this resolution well you know Joe I think that the threshold question that we're here to wrestle with we have classified briefings today than foreign relations committee meetings today armed services committee meetings tomorrow I'm on both the threshold question is getting all the Intel to make sure that the chemical weapons were used in fact by by the Syrian government but it seems very clear to me based on what I've seen that that was the case and once that case has been made you know this isn't Iraq are there weapons of mass destruction know they have them and they've used them and they've used them against civilians are you you're supporting the president's efforts right I I think we have to take steps to show that the use of chemical weapons against civilians has a consequence if they make the right decision to go to Congress with this Joe he absolutely did I gave a speech in July on the 40th anniversary of the passage of the War Powers Resolution of 1973 a floor speech in the Senate and I talked about the sloppiness that we've allowed ourselves to get into where presidents overreach and do things without congressional approval and then Congress intentionally avoids responsibility for going on the board yes or no about military the president needed to do it constitutionally but more importantly if we're going to put service men and women in harm's way they have to be able to count on the fact that the nation's political leadership is unified behind them but if they go in on a president to order with members of Congress griping about it it's completely unfair just to be clear though the President did have the constitutional power to strike and then come to you within a reasonable period of time right that is correct but if he were to do that with all the Austin you need to come to us first we're not sure what we want to do how do you know again how does that make the servicemen and women that we're asking to potentially risk their lives fee right when they the political class can't unifying behind the mission okay we've got Cokie Roberts with us and she has a question Koki yeah senator you talk about the political class being unified but we're unlikely to see much unity in the congressional debate first of all what kind of harm can that do but secondly what's your threshold here does the Senate have to have 60 votes to pass this do you see a filibuster coming and is that possible to do you know that they're there might be an effort by some on the other side to filibuster but you know I remember back Cokie when we were debating Chuck Hagel I think there was a sense for the approval of a secretary of defense there was sort of a strategic filibuster for a couple of days but then wiser heads prevailed and said we shouldn't be using the filibuster technique to block the Secretary of Defense when it's such a critical position there will be some jousting procedurally but i do believe based on the discussions I've had with Senate colleagues i was on a number of conference calls with them Democratic and Republican last week dryer to the president making the decision about coming to Congress I think you'll see a strong congressional support because I think we still care about the International principle that you don't use chemical weapons against civilians Vladimir Putin may not care but I think members of America the American Congress do care and will care Gene Robinson senator Kerry you've got a one group of senators who both mostly Democrats probably who really want to constrain the strike and have it be a one-off and and there's a group with John McCain and Lindsey Graham who really want a more expansive perhaps a longer strike that hits more targets and that really affects the war are we going to have the Senate or or even the house trying to run a war and is that not a recipe for disaster gene I think yeah it to your question it would be a recipe for disaster to try to micromanage my view of the Constitution is Congress has to be involved in the initiation of military action but presidents the commander-in-chief and you've got to give the president some latitude in terms of implementing the congressional decision to initiate military action that said I think there are some very appropriate questions that we need to ask and even potentially put into the authorization that we're authorizing military action for some finite period of time we've seen that the authorization done in the aftermath of 911 is still being used 12 years later as an open-ended authorization so putting some duration in place putting some requirement that a president come back for additional authority for example before any boots would be on the ground the White House has said there won't be boots on the ground in this operation that's probably pretty important to specify in an authorization so we shouldn't run the you know run at the commander-in-chief and the military needs to run it but some appropriate limitations that's a good senator we've got three people that still have questions for you only 45 seconds this is lightning round Tina yes senator do you think it could have been a tactical mistake for the president to say that he was whatever the vote he was going to do this could do this anyway because doesn't that actually risk offending Congress and making them feel they're just part of a kind of Student Activities Committee that you know that what's what's the point of risking that vote right if you're a congressman whose own constituency doesn't want you to do it I think that that's a very questionable legal position but I don't think that Congress is offended we're we're here now in committee meetings were taking this responsibility in the solemn way and I don't think that's going to be a factor in how Congress talks all right Donny congressman worst case scenario Congress will to know that's not going to happen but if it does president still goes ahead anyway I don't think that's going to happen I think the president I believe that he's made a precedent-setting move that we need to boot move back to the way that Jefferson and Madison and all the framers intended this you bring Congress in because it's in the Constitution but you also bring Congress in because we can't answer as men and women or civilized about see increased up to founding fathers in the US Constitution Harold Ford final question people argue that this is strengthen the opposition are those were going after the Middle East do you think the Syrian government has been strengthened by this delay US senator I think they can run but they can't hide we're going to be stronger as a nation if we do this with the President and Congress having debated it before the public and decided to go for it we're stronger by following this constitutional principle all right lightning round completed senator Tim Kaine you advance to the next rounds of lives thank you Joe you Joe you didn't even give me trouble about Virginia Tech I feel very successful you no way didn't Virginia Tech actually I thought their defense held Alabama hundred yards and you know we had four big place just for big place without this for big plays Virginia Tech could have won the game you guys have a good team congratulations thanks man tight senator good luck and the jeans stay with us

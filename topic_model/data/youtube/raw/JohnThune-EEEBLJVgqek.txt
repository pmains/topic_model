we are joined Now by Republican senator John thune of the great state of South Dakota who is also the Senate minority whip and Senator we mentioned that private moment I want to get into some of the the topics of this address but also the tone because there were public moments of disagreement we're not used to seeing at a State of the Union uh the president was called a liar a couple times there were some outbursts about whether he was the blame for the fentanyl crisis there were definite Rocky Horror Picture Show Vibes at various moments here and before we get into the content I'm curious what you think the American people should take away from what they saw last night well I think Tony what you know they saw obviously was a president people could characterize it as a soft launch for his uh re-election campaign there was a lot of red meat that he threw out there and uh the reaction in the chamber was probably pretty predictable Democrats were very uh boisterous in their support and Republicans of course uh not so much and I think that uh you know again the the tone of State of the Union speech is at least in my you know the modern modern era in which we live politically there is more I would say activity in the chamber probably there used to be but you know I think that's probably characterizes a little bit of the change in our politics I mean people are a lot more uh you know they get out there a lot more outspoken and I think the State of the Union speeches are perhaps a good example of that Senator David begno here good morning to you there were some moments of bipartisanship right the president mentioned more police resources and he recognized the family of Tyree Nichols and there were a lot of Republicans who clapped and stood for that are Republicans ready to work with Democrats on police reform we are and I very much hope we that we could get something done there you know there was there were attempts made in the past several attempts made in the past as recently as 2020 which eventually sort of fell apart but we've got a great leader on that issue Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina has done a lot of good work on police reform and he really tried to push that issue forward and in the end it was the Democrats who walked away from the table so yes there is there are I think about 70 to 80 percent of the issues around police reform are things that both sides agree on so what we ought to try and do is find that common ground and see if we can actually execute on on getting some reforms across the Finish Line I think the opportunity is there and I hope there will be the the will on both sides to to put it together you know Senator on this question of the debt ceiling there was a a moment and this was one of those call and response moments uh where the president uh criticized some Republicans for wanting to make cuts to Social Security some changes there uh he's referring to a proposal from Senator Rick Scott someone who I've actually talked to on this subject uh but just to you know be abundantly clear for the American people where does your party stand on cuts to Social Security and Medicare Tony I think uh what you heard last night is you know both sides agreeing that there aren't going to be cuts to Social Security or Medicare I do think however and the debt limit is a good place to do this is to is to actually realize we got a 31 trillion dollar debt it's not going away we spend more than we take in every year and you can't solve all that just by raising taxes which is you know a lot of what the president proposed last night you actually have to figure out how do we strengthen these programs and and that doesn't mean you have to cut things but there are a lot of younger Americans today who understand that if something isn't done they're not Social Security is going to be around for them I mean if you you're talking about huge cuts in this program not too far down the road when it goes bankrupt if we don't do some things to make it stronger and make it viable not just for current Generations but also for future generations of Americans and there are things that are out there there's a proposal out there right now which is bipartisan Bill Cassidy he's got half a dozen Republicans half a dozen Democrats on Social Security reform and it does it in a way that strengthens the program avoids those steep cuts that would occur in the future and and I think it's you know that's the kind of thing we ought to be talking about because both sides have to agree we can't sustain this you can't have 31 trillion dollars in debt and climbing every year and I think the president if he wants to this could be a real Legacy issue he could come to the table and it's going to take presidential leadership to do something big and consequential like this and I think Republicans would meet him there yeah we'll see what happens strengthening the country for the future is what it is all about a gentleman of the Senate uh Senator John thune thank you very much thanks Tony thanks guys

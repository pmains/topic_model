the Democratic leader miss Pelosi gentlelady from California is recognized for one minute thank you very much mr. speaker i rise in opposition to the rule that is on the floor today because the voting for this rule is a vote to abolish Medicare here we are once again after the public has spoken so clearly on the subject of wanting to have Medicare as a pillar of health and economic security for our seniors the Republicans saying we're going to double down not only did we vote to abolish Medicare increasing costs for seniors lowering benefits and get while giving tax breaks to oil companies and corporations for shipping jobs overseas not only have we done that once but we're going to do it again today on a day that we're going to swear in a new member of Congress a reminder that all of us takes an oath of office to protect and defend and this bill build that this rule comes up on Homeland Security undermines the ability to protect and defend the American people so this is a double women whammy it's a threat again to the health and economic security of our seniors and those who depend on Medicare and it is a threat to the safety of the American people I heard I heard my colleague he talked about purgatory and rapture and the rest and is original and effective presentation and it reminded me what we always say when we talk about a budget that it should be a statement of our values what is important to us should be reflected there our budget proposals we had one of the leadership of Chris Van Hollen that was heard and voted on by the floor a number of weeks ago Republican budget that is on the floor today in the form of misrule our windows to the soul with who we are as public officials and this rule today which deems passage of the Republican budget is a window to the soul of the Republican Party in this house of representatives that it would put in it would put oil companies giving big tax subsidies to Big Oil would put corporations that ship jobs overseas we give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country while it says to seniors no more Medicare for you you're going to pay more get less and weaken the middle class at the same time weakening the middle class because of abolishing Medicare and weakening the middle class because of what it does to education for our young children and making college more expensive for nearly 10 million young people in our country is that an investment in the future I don't think so but it's really important when we talk about our soul and our values and our what our priorities that we note that a vote for this bill is a really a serious assault on the middle class people are concerned about the dignity of our in retirement of our seniors that are concerned about the education of our children they want to the deficit we must create jobs growth in our economy will help reduce the deficit this bill doesn't none of the above so again it's about what we believe in and Mr Speaker I have to give you credit for this the Republicans are true to what they believe in they do not believe in Medicare and they are voting today to honor their beliefs to abolish Medicare that has been a consistent message over time it is reinforced here today I urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule and no on the underlying bill with that I yield back the balance of my time gentlelady yields back gentleman from New York Thank You mr. speaker I just feel it's necessary to again correct the record that what we

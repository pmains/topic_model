judge i'm still uncertain about your answer can the united states supreme court on its own admit a state to the union senator as i answered the constitution of the united states this is a real simple question can the united states supreme court on its own admit a state to the union i understand the answer is no okay thanks appreciate that do you think the federal judicial system is systemically racist senator uh i have had as a sitting judge for 20 years i have had cases that come before me involving allegations of racism i have presider over those uh but i'm asking about the federal judicial system is it systemically racist well senator judges apply the constitution and laws and we cannot if you're asking about if judges are racist or the judicial system itself uh we apply the laws but we do not a judge cannot take race into consideration well but do you think the federal you know what systemic racism is i mean it comes up every day now and in america and uh do you believe that the federal judicial system is systemically racist well senator you've been a part of it yes i can give you an example that uh the congress and the sentencing commission i appreciate an example i'm just trying to get an answer do you believe it's systemically racist senator that that's a question i i cannot answer you're a sitting federal judge right now i am a sitting federal judge how long have you been a federal judge 20 years and you haven't you've heard these allegations that that all our institutions are systemically racist and after 20 years you haven't drawn an opinion senator i can tell you in my court but you don't have an opinion about whether the federal judicial system is systemically racist after 20 years senator i have to say no you think it's not or you don't have my experience in my experience wait let me understand your answer you think it's not systemically racist or you don't have an opinion no i don't have an opinion after 20 years that is correct and you want to be on the court of appeal senator yes okay all right what's your definition of justice justice senator uh to me uh means that the law is applied equally to all individuals regardless of race sex uh position uh and that all cases are held heard by a fair and impartial judge fair and powerful jury and that the laws are applied equally okay how do we know what what what is your your barometer for deciding whether a law that's being applied equally is just well on as a judge i have cases that come before me individual cases i'm not asking about a case i'm asking about philosophy how how do how do you just personally look at lawn and determine whether that law in your judgment is just well it is it is not for a judge to determine whether a ju i'm not asking justin as a judge i mean skin uses a person i'm trying to understand you as a person well senator my whatever understanding i have if a law is just or not just i have to apply that law uh i know let me stipulate that okay let me stipulate that i'm not going to ask you how you rule on a case and i know you're going to file a precedent okay you you always i get that how do you personally look at a law and decide whether it's just or not pretty basic well senator that is not the role of a judge to determine what law is no but it's the role of a human being i'm just trying to get to know you do you have a personal definition of justice well senator justice in my particular case i know it's plot equally but how do we know law is just or are unjust in your opinion well senator i i i mentioned i have to apply the laws as they stand and i have to okay let's move on judge i don't think you're going to answer um do you think let me ask you about crime you've sentenced people yes senator do you think uh crime is a disease that needs a cure or do you think it's anti-social behavior that deserves punishment senator as a judge and i've been sentencing felony defendants for 15 years as a us district judge uh i've always followed the sentencing statute and i'll stipulate that and i have but but i'm asking you about if a person commits a crime do you see it as a disease it needs to be cured or do you see it as anti-social behavior that that merits punishment senator each individual defendant has to be sentenced to division i have had individuals who are anti-social and when you look the pre-sentence reports you sentence them accordingly you have career offender criminal uh you have other individuals who have judge i can't i can't vote for you if you want to answer my questions i hate interrupting you but these are these are pretty basic questions that i would expect somebody who's been on the federal bench for 20 years to have thought about the senator's time has expired judge if you wish to respond you have that opportunity senator i as a judge every time i sentence an individual and i do this on an individual basis i consider the nature of defense aggravating factors mitigating factors the person's individual personal history his criminal record and also consider the sentencing guidelines and i apply that exercise on a case by case individually thank you mr chairman uh i'm going to talk to our judicial nominees and and i'm going to stipulate up front to save you time and me time um that you're going to follow president okay um council um tell me the test that the united states supreme court uses to overturn its precedent counselor thank you senator kennedy for that question as you know my practice has primarily focused on civil matters for the past 28 or 30 years i have not had occasion to deal with a case where it would go to the supreme court where the issue of overturning its own precedent would be an issue but they are obviously far and few between okay um you don't know the test sitting here today uh senator i could not articulate that for you okay that's cool um let's talk about a a pretty famous case um that we all learned in the first year in law school tell me uh the importance of mcculloch v maryland senator uh i went to law school 30 years ago i've practiced law for 30 years in many different areas for both plaintiffs and defendants in state and federal court and i've not come across that case that i can recall uh and tell you it's holding as i sit here today okay well if you're if you're going to if you're going to be on the federal district court bench you're going to come across the issue of uh universal or nationwide injunctions uh what's the legal basis for a universal injunction senator i'm aware of the current discussion in the public domain about the propriety of district courts issuing nationwide injunctions i've not encountered a case in my practice in state or federal court where that's been an issue i think as a nominee it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the propriety of that issue since it's currently being litigated i'm not asking about the propriety i'm just asking you do you know the legal basis for it well senator i know that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and are supposed to be restrained in taking action and decide only the issues before them involving the parties before them and the issues and i think it would have to be a rare exception that an issue before a district judge no but we know both know universal injunctions are issued and if if you issue a universal injunction and you're asked by one of the litigants well why did you do that judge what's your legal basis what are you going to say well senator as i said federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and i think it would be extremely rare that as a district court judge but what's the legal basis counselor well i'm just asking you what the legal basis is for a universal injunction well senator i think as a district court job if confirmed as a district court judge i would need to have jurisdiction and believe i had appropriate jurisdiction okay let's move on you're not going to answer it um tell me the holding in marbury versus madison marbury versus madison is one of the pinnacle uh decisions about the judicial branch that as you mentioned earlier every law student learns in law school yeah what's the holding in terms of affirming that the judiciary is the interpreter of the constitution okay um what what rule does the supreme court follow in determining whether an admissions policy of the university that uses uh race as part of the admissions prop up process is constitutional senator my understanding is that race would qualify the application of strict scrutiny um and in cases the supreme court has addressed this issue they have found that um while they do not while quotas are not constitutional that race may be uh a factor that's considered if there's a legitimate irrational purpose for it okay um let me let me just ask your personal philosophy on a couple of things um do you believe that uh that crime is a disease that we should try to cure or do you believe that it is any social behavior that should be punished senator my practice over the past 28 years has been in the civil arena i have not had occasion to practice um criminally i'm just asking your philosophy i'm not asking the law absolutely but i will say that from i have seen an as a human being as you referenced earlier i think that that's a very complicated question yeah that's why i ask you i think there are many factors that would play into any case of any particular crime or defending can you tell me what you believe senator i don't know that i can say one way or the other what i believe is all about i'm sorry have you thought about it i i can't say that it's something that i've given an extensive amount of thought whoa i think it's very complicated thanks uh mr chair

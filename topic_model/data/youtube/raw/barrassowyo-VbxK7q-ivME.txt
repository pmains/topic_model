joining me right now is a member of senate leadership he is a wyoming senator john barrasso senator it's great to have you this morning thanks so much for being here great to be with you maria thank you so before we get into this new spending and tax package let me get your thoughts as a doctor you are a orthopedic surgeon as well as a leader in the senate your thoughts on this reinfection with kovit that president biden is facing now well it's certainly a concern we want the president to fully recover but we do know that people who have been reinfected have higher health risks going forward health risks of long-term covet and health risks in terms of heart lungs even neurologic issues and bigger problems with fatigue so we hope that the president doesn't fall into that category we want him to recover fully absolutely we are praying for that for sure let me get your take on the agenda senator last week your colleague on the left joe manchin agreed with senator chuck schumer uh to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more and raise taxes to pay for it were you blindsided by this well i know joe has been working on this but let's take a look at what happened last week we saw economic numbers continue to come out we saw the president's poll numbers continue to fall he's at historic levels he's pushing for the life alert button because he's fallen and he can't get up and the problem with what manchin and the democrats are proposing here is the american public is having a hard time keeping up they just can't do it you can't afford a full tank of gas you can't afford a week's worth of groceries and what manchin and the democrats and the president are now proposing are the two cardinal sins that you don't want to do when the economy is in such a dire situation number one is they want to raise taxes in the middle of a recession now i know joe biden says it's not a recession but if you google recession it's a recession two-thirds of the american people believe we're in a recession they're living it the other is they want to do massive government spending they have a 725 page bill and it's over a billion dollars a page at the time when we're at 40-year high inflation this is going to make inflation worse yeah i want to get your take on this 80 billion dollars to double the number of irs agents as well but you're mentioning the 369 billion on energy and climate efforts only in washington can you come out with more hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and call it an inflation reduction act senator we know how inflation got stoked we have the inflation timeline right here consumer prices are up 9.1 percent uh in the last reading and they were 1.4 percent when joe biden walked into the oval office how is it possible that your colleagues are voting for something that will likely uh make inflation worse do you believe inflation gets worse as a result of this i believe inflation gets worse the experts who are looking at it believe experts believe that the inflation will get worse and this is false advertising by the democrats this is the last big wish a dying wish of a party that knows they're going to get shellacked come november they have all the spending and the taxes in this that they've been trying to get there's no guarantee that it's going to get passed and we can talk about that in a second but the things that are in this look this is the parade of horribles from last year they are hiring 86 000 additional irs agents that's not just to go after a couple of big companies they're coming after families farmers small businesses and what do they want to use the money for they're going after energy producers so they can give subsidies and pay people to buy electric vehicles these are going to go to rich people this is going to make the pain at the pump worse it's going to drive up inflation and it's going to hurt the economy even more maria yeah it's just incredible does it pass i know that you've got a week back at work before you go on recess in the senate what's happening this upcoming week and how will senator cinema take on this well you make the important point here that uh senator cinema hasn't i know she felt blindsided by this and she is a spine of steel she's not going to easily be twisted the interesting thing is that joe joe manchin has bought into this there are things included in this bill that last year he called shell games and smoke and mirrors and accounting gimmicks so i'm not sure what chuck schumer promised him but i think he's going to regret making this decision to sign on to this every republican is against it because we know it is going to burn a deeper hole into the wallets and the savings accounts of american people in terms of will this past they need all 50 democrats on board and in the room maria and what we know is that due to covid and due to surgery with some of the democrat members they haven't had 50 senators show up for work in well over a month so this is far from done well i mean i think you make a good point but if it doesn't pass is it just pure luck i mean let's face it senator your colleagues continued to disappoint uh on many levels did the republicans get duped again that's what kim strassel wrote in the wall street journal this week i know you saw that op-ed but they introduced this new version of buildback better under a new name just hours after they get the chips bill passed you did not vote for the chips bill what is going on with your colleagues handing the democrats a win when everywhere you look there is another blow up when you have a wide open border and they refuse to acknowledge it what's wrong with your colleagues well number one is you know i did not vote for that bill i thought it spent too much money and focused on a specific uh industry but no i never trusted chuck schumer i knew he was going to continue to try to put together some reckless tax and spending bill to the final moment of the final day of the fiscal year so i knew he wasn't going to stop no republican should ever believe chuck schumer with regard to the bill that passed there are republicans and democrats who know we have a specific problem with china i say never again can we be dependent on china for medicines for materials for important minerals never again they're trying to get it a problem i just think it didn't provide what we needed to do to prevent china from from stealing our trade secrets i've been on the conference committee for that bill the votes were there i'm not surprised it passed what i am surprised is that the joe manchin is signed on to chuck schumer's bill i'm not surprised that chuck schumer will continue to tell people anything that it will help him go very very liberal with his agenda well senator i guess what i'm asking you is shouldn't the republicans be doing better at this point look everywhere whether it's inflation whether it's wide open border of foreign policy disasters like afghanistan china he refuses to call an adversary only a competitor and look at the congressional generic ballot and the congressional vote preference that we have here democrat 41 percent republican 44 shouldn't the gap be wider shouldn't republicans be winning and shouldn't it be a a an assumption that the republicans take over not just the house but the senate as well why these numbers in your view well i'm very optimistic about the elections in november it's still a hundred days away maria this is going to be a rejection election the american people are going to reject the democrats and joe biden because of the things that you just mentioned crushing inflation chaos at the border crime in the cities this is a reason to eliminate and to remove and to defeat all of the democrats who are on the ticket we need to take the majorities so we can stop this reckless agenda radical agenda that the democrats have we need to get back to the job of of building the economy not building the government which is what the democrats want to do we take over the senate i'll be chairman of the energy committee and we will go ahead what go ahead now you take over the i'll be chairman of the energy committee and we will put on joe biden's desk bills that will actually bring down the cost of energy by drilling and getting the permits to do the infrastructure we'll hold this administration accountable real quick i want to get your take on why your colleagues voted for the chips act was it because the liberal universities want more money and and how do they explain that this administration wants every accounting and everybody's account they want to know anytime you take 600 out of your account or have a transaction of 600 wasn't that the proposal in the initial build back better well there are a couple of things there look i have great concerns with china and this is the new battlefield of the 21st century it's not just weaponry it's information as china tries to be the military the the economic and the technological superpower of the world we can't stop we have to continue to work to stop them from allowing that to happen that's what our focus needs to be and we have members that have been working to do that i think this bill didn't accomplish it the other issue you're referring to the taxes these yep i mean in terms of their their build back better i mean they're coming after everybody with raising taxes that's who they're going after families and farmers everyone in an effort to pay for liberal things that i think are going to make the economy worse it's going to make inflation worse deep in a recession these guys look like what they're doing the democrats are trying to do is get to double dish double digit inflation we want to get inflation down their proposals actually seem to raise it senator thank you very much for being here and for your leadership senator john barrasso

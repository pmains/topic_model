joining us now is the chairman of that subcommittee Texas senator Ted Cruz you know you're you're not running for president and you know we haven't seen you in years senator I mean even we still recognize you with that beard though we know who you are good to smell you and you're welcome to come to come down to DC or Texas and I'll join you any morning of the week we always love having you senator obviously great to have a hearing but when are we going to know the findings from the black box would it be better if we knew everything before you have a hearing well sure look there's a process the hearing today is the is the first hearing that we're holding on this to do what we can to ascertain number one and what happened three hundred and forty six people died and two separate plane accidents the early reports the early indications are that the causes of those accidents were similar that it may well have been a malfunctioning angle-of-attack sensor that caused this this new technology on the 737 max what they call the EM casts to adjust the pitch of the plane downward and ultimately to dive it into the ground taking 346 Souls we need to know what happens what we know but another major area of inquiry is the process of certification of the 737 max to begin with there have been multiple reports that Boeing itself was deeply involved and embedded in the certification process and from from the Committee on aviation in space we want to know how boeing how private companies are involved in the faa z' certification process is that process why didn't that process catch this problem if this was the cause of the accident and what needs to be done done number one to make sure these planes are safe to fly and number two to make sure that the oversight and regulatory system is preventing and catching these malfunctions before they occur senator with something as high-tech and complicated as one of one of these aircraft today how could get the fa possibly try to figure out how to certify it without the help from the company that manufactured I don't understand how that well I'm just wondering is there any and I've seen anyway at Ralph Nader on at this point is there some type of anywhere you're looking some type of implied malfeasance from any party in this whole process in your view look there is very potentially malfeasance here we don't know when we're not going to jump to conclusions but we need to see what the evidence holds we have right now a two planes in a period of five months that that according to the satellite data had very similar erratic altitude changes and and one of the issues of inquiry also is when this change was made why was it not better reflected in the pilots manuals why was it not part of the pilots training imagine for a second you're a pilot or an Ethiopian plane you're flying a jet you think it's just like the 737 that you've flown for years except suddenly the nose starts going down and you don't know why because there wasn't a signal to tell you that a computer system has suddenly started steering the plane down on the old 737 if you pulled back to the yoke it disengaged the stabilization system on the 737 max you pull back the yoke and it didn't disengage so these pilots are pulling back the yoke they're pulling out the manuals trying to figure out what on earth is going on with this plane and all the meantime it's going down and down and down that's not an acceptable outcome that's not an outcome that is putting the safety of the flying public first Center and yes yes the company should be involved but it is not the FAA s role to be handing the decision of certification over to the private company the private company had economic set incentives not to require any more training because that that drives up the cost but if you've changed the system substantially you've got to make sure the pilots are trained adequately to ensure the safety of the flying public senator you it's a very good summary of everything we've heard to this day to this state and a good stance I think on how you come at this my question is do you know anything about the new software fix that supposedly being rolled out that will potentially allow the 787 max aids to go back into the air does it have anything to do with what you just described where if the pilot actually tries to pull up on the on the throttle that it would disengage the system so I don't know the details of the software fix I what has been reported in the press that part of the software fix is that it will analyze there they're two of these angle-of-attack sensors and it will analyze when you have contradictory data coming from those two that seems like a positive adjustment at the end of the day though you've got to have the pilots knowing what's happening with the plane and with the ability to correct it if the plane is steering down towards the ground and they don't have the ability to fix it that is a major problem and so I hope this software fix it enables us to fix the problem but we need to be sure that this plane that pilots know how to operate it safely and and and so I'm gonna wait and see I think the FAA is it takes its job seriously I called for grounding these planes before the FAA acted and I'm glad that the FAA did act because look at the state of Texas we have tens of thousands of jobs that depend on airlines we have millions of Texans and Americans including you and me and all of us who get on planes every day our family gets on planes every day and we need to have the confidence that we can buy a ticket on an airplane and you sit down that your safety is gonna be protected Oh in this country it seems like maybe you'd have a better chance of being totally confident I'm just wondering can the FAA and Boeing sign off on every airline and every pilot in every country in the world I mean we have enough trouble with our federal agencies not knowing what they're doing with one another how can we possibly know whether EcoP and air brought its pilots up to speed as mandated by by Boeing's guidelines or the FAS got how do we possibly know that listen from the dawn of air flight there has been a governmental role in a regulatory role ensuring that planes are safe and and there are legitimate roles for government regulation I think that's clearly one of them you may well be right that that in the United States we've got a greater assurance of safety that's certainly what I've heard from the leadership of airlines and then I'm sure it's true that they have more vigorous pilot training that's one of the things this hearings gonna try to get after is is listen when Boeing is selling these planes where we've seen these accidents so far have been Ethiopia and Indonesia what what training what manuals are the pilots being given look Boeing is providing that and you can't expect a purchaser of a plane to know everything that's new at the end of the day it's the seller of the plane who has an obligation to explain if you fundamentally changed the operating system you do have an obligation to explain that to the pilots who are going to be flying innocent passengers in that plane senator Airbus just want a big order from a couple of Chinese airlines are you concerned that Boeing is gonna suffer lasting damage from this including these hearings look there has long been politics between Boeing and Airbus and then listen as an American I hope that Boeing prospers and thrives and creates lots and lots of jobs continues to create lots and lots of jobs here in America but but but but aside from from from that battle between these two companies there is a basic obligation we've had two crashes on the same planes within a few months that appear to be caused by very similar similar mechanical malfunctions we need to prevent that we need to keep people safe that's the responsibility of government of elected officials and then we're gonna let the marketplace take care of every faith Boeing can compete and compete well in the marketplace but we need to make sure that we're keeping people safe in the air at the same time did you I see you voted present yesterday on that senator what what is the present what does that mean afraid to take a stand what happened there you know it really is a remarkable thing yes yesterday the vote was 57 noes zero yeses and virtually every Democrat voted president I didn't I not only did not vote president I know that now with that beard that's what I see at the record straight and you know what if there'd been an option of voting hell no I would have voted that instead of no yeah I was gonna go on well no as the head of the Committee on aviation and space you think we're going to land on the moon in the next five years I think we are going to land on the moon whether five years is technologically and scientifically feasible that's going to be a question ultimately for NASA and the scientists and engineers to determine but we have a clear objective to go to the moon and the moon is just a way station Congress has passed into law legislation than I authored bipartisan legislation that makes clear that the long term objective of NASA is to go to Mars to land and and that the first boot that lands on the red planet will be the boot of an American astronaut the moon is a way station to test the technology to get to Mars I think that's important but but but I also think it's important that NASA keeps the big picture of going to Mars and continuing America's unquestioned leadership in space that they keep that front and center and real quickly yeah you know the other while we're here while we have you how much of the Moller report should be released and do you think that there's anything to criticism from Democrats that bar is somehow Trump's guy and willing to I don't know he's got a long molar has a long career I'm starting here his character impugn by the people that that held him up in such high regard before but it you think bar would would would consider the administration's wishes first and go against what what he thought with his own integrity what do you think look I've known bill Bar for 25 years he has four decades of principled service public service he has a demonstrated commitment to integrity now the question of how much of the report should be released I think all of it should be released if the country has gone through two years of national trauma the public needs to be able to read that report read it in its entirety that's the right decision to make I hope that's the decision the Department of Justice makes but I also think you know you're seeing immediately Democrats and some in the media pivoting we're number one they're no longer concerned about criminality you know I did one of the sunday shows with Jerry Nadler from the house who was saying well you know crimes are what Bob Butler was looking at we're looking at broader issues and the Democrats are going to continue attacking the president non-stop for the next two years and I believe their ultimate destination is impeachment that they intend to impeach him and it doesn't matter what the evidence is it doesn't matter what the constitutional standard is and high crimes are misdemeanors they hate the president we're gonna see these attacks coming from the media what about the ACA you've never been a fan is that a smart move you know the the all the good news for for the administration and then all of a sudden to go back to where they're gonna have a target about on their back about pre-existing conditions and everything else and in the elections coming is data is that smart to go back to ACA now with 20/20 and insight or what do you think would you have recommended that well listen the devil is in the details and it depends what the administration tries to do I think there are still millions of Texans millions of Americans who are hurting under Obama care who've seen their premiums skyrocket average family's premiums have gone up over five thousand dollars a year so I believe we still need to finish the job and that means repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a system that allows more competition more choices and lower premiums so that so that more families can afford health care and we can do that while protecting pre-existing conditions now you're exactly right there are a lot of pitfalls and perils that if the GOP ends up in a bidding war with Democrats for who can provide more socialized medicine I think that would be a very very bad mistake so I hope we don't have Republicans going down that road but if we're expanding choices expanding competition and lowering premiums that's a good road to be going down what do you think I just I guess I go back to can you make that point again what you were saying just about the prices going up and tying that to what the lack of a lack of a lack of competition in the field is that what you think happened sure sure look at the at the end of the day economics 101 a if you want prices to go down you want more choices more competition more options what Obamacare did is it created fewer choices less competition less option in a great many counties across this country there are one or two health care providers in the Obama care market and the consequence of that is people have seen their that their premiums skyrocket I hear every day from Texans who say I can't afford health insurance under Obama care and I'll tell you who's really been hammered by that is young young people have seen their premiums go up hundreds of percent sometimes thousands of percents that's why our premiums because they were forced to be carrying this and forced to go ahead and pay in that was going to be struck down anyway actually that's not right so the reason young people were paid higher premiums is the way Obamacare works is it takes young healthy people and it jacks up their premiums and uses that money to cross subsidize other people that's kind of how insurance works in general and insurance prices roll before Obamacare came along too so with respect that's not actually how insurance works insurance typically works where you don't just simply force people to cross subsidize you pay based on your your demographics and whether you're likely to get sick I understand some of that health care insurance was out of control before Obamacare so that's not insurance that that is simply taxing and redistributing and by the way which is the people that you're taxing the young people hold on a second the people that you're taxing the young people are are typically less wealthy you're taking money from people who are less well care well health insurance was out of control before Obamacare came along how do you fix that if that was under a complete like free-market look that there are no doubts that there have been challenges in health insurance for a long time but we want to see as health insurance policies that are affordable and also that are portable one of the major fixes if you look at the problem of pre-existing condition I agree many of them across state lines well but we don't have that I mean that Obamacare doesn't give you that and what that means it is where a lot of people ran into problems is is if you lose your job tomorrow you don't lose your car insurance or your house insurance or your life insurance why should you you lose your health insurance you ought to be able to take your health insurance from one job to another job to another job and that solves much of the problem pre-existing conditions where just like your car insurance it you have it rather than being tied to employment and it's an accident of history that health insurance comes with unemployment I want to get to Kramer but we got ten seconds I'm just going to ask you real quickly you were part of that slim narrow field of Republicans I'm only 18 now that we've got you know I need exponential notation for the Democrats but intense I think they're 672 Democrats running in 10 seconds who would you worry about in terms of running that that would be formidable and who do you wish would get the nomination if listen I worry about all of them I I think what the the election is going to be all of the energy all of the passion and the Democratic Party is on the extreme left to my mind the top tier is Kamala Harris baitoey Roark Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren I think it's likely one of those four will be the nominee I think they're all coming from the extreme left and what's dangerous I think the 2020 general election is a coin flip I think it's 50/50 and we could very possibly nominate an avowed socialist that's dangerous for this country I'm working hard to prevent it but I think that's where we are electro got some Austin creep down intestines don't know what's gonna get it together would you I'm in a great state of Texas what's happening that well apparently running against me and losing is is something of a launching pad for running president hey you get anywhere close to defeating you makes him a giant senator anyway good good to have you on today always a pleasure and I hope to see you soon let's get down now to the New York Stock Exchange

Madam President I'm glad to be finally here today's talking about the final conclusions we've reached on the appropriations bill generally but specifically the labor and Health and Human Services and education appropriations bill we're now a bipartisan Congress Democrats in control on one side Republicans on another and on this side of course we always have to have 60 people to go forward on these bills so we generally have had to have a bill here that would appeal to enough Democrats to are enough Republicans to make this happen but we've we've come to conclusion on what is normally the hardest bill to negotiate it's about 30% of all the spending after you take defense off the table defense half of the discretionary spending then you have 11 other bills that have the other half of that spending and this bill has 30% of that half it has lots of things that you could decide you could argue about and frankly lots of things that would just say if we can't all be happy about this we won't move forward which would mean you wouldn't move forward this is a bill where Sarah Murray and I and Congressman Cole and Chairman Gloria on the other side had to decide if we were going to have a bill or not and we decided we were going to have a bill we decided at the end of the process with some help from others that we wouldn't have things in the bill that hadn't traditionally been there well this is the place where much of the language that we debate in the appropriations bills occurs of what can happen and what can't happen things like the Hyde Amendment has been in the appropriations bill for a long time and it's in this one other things that have not been there for in the past are not there and that was one of the things that allowed us to move forward again he had one body control by the different party who had to come to bipartisan consensus and I think we had there are lots of competing programs some of which we're all for but maybe not maybe our priorities are different and in fact it could be that we just have more priorities on one side than the other but these these programs range man president from workforce training to early childhood education to infectious disease control that's a pretty big span of things to try to come to conclusion on and then from our colleagues we had 7800 different requests not necessarily requests that would be considered I want you to spend this money in my state but 7800 requests has said we think this this program should be increased or this program should be decreased so with all of those requests and that broad span we came together with a bill that I'm gonna vote for tomorrow and look forward to voting for tomorrow it's not exactly the bill that I would have done if I'd have been doing it by myself but by the very definition of both democracy in the Congress you don't get to do these by yourselves and the bill that will reflect the priorities of both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol in invest in those priorities that we expand medical research something been one of the things have been at the top of my list is the chairman of this committee to take this moment to where medical research is so critical where we know so much more than we did about the human genome so much more than we knew about Meo therapy just five or six years ago this is a topic that wasn't it wasn't on the radar screen of treatments now for many cancers it's one of the first things you think about does it work if we get this person's body focused in a way that the it fights back this cancer that's trying to overcome it and often that produces a great result now that wouldn't have been happening five or six years ago so medical research the opioid epidemic is one that we deal with in this bill investing in high quality early childhood care and early childhood education and education generally in this bill trying to make college more affordable with things like Pell grants that not only work for people who don't have the income to do this without some help our government has decided but also now work year-round for about the third year where once you get started you can keep on going if you've got a pattern that's working and we spend a lot of time in this bill and in the last year talking about what do we do and this this growing economy where more people are more jobs are available than people looking for work what do we do to better match the people looking for work with the jobs available and even more importantly how can we anticipate that that will happen in the future so for the fifth straight year after twelve years of no increase the National Institute of Health in this bill against a significant increase in additional 2.6 billion dollars which increases them in the last five years over forty percent again at a time when this investment can mean so much to so many people we specifically targeted the investment toward Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's and dementia the thing that taxpayers pay the most on to help and taxpayers don't pay nearly all of the costs that families have with Alzheimer's and dementia the president's childhood cancer data initiative is here precision best medicine combating foreign threats to research addressing the facility's backlog on the campuses all those are here our investments in NIH are making a difference for families and making a difference we hope for the future that NIH based research has helped raise life expectancy has vastly improved the quality of life for many Americans as lowered health care costs very much dramatically decided in some health care situations how either invasive you need to be or how much pain has to be involved and getting you headed in another direction but also by the way on the opioid front understanding that the complete elimination of pain is not necessarily a good thing unless you're sure you're going to be able to deal with that pain medicine and that that moment later the bill fully funds the president's request to do everything we can in the next ten years to eliminate the HIV epidemic it would have been hard to imagine five years ago or ten years ago saying we'll be in sight of vaccine and eliminating HIV as an epidemic problem in our country we spend money on that but we have fully funded what the President and others believe would be necessary to achieve that goal we spend twenty billion dollars a year right now and direct health expenditures on HIV prevention and care our goal in the next ten years would be to reduce the number of new infections with HIV by at least 90 percent every year third the this bill the FY 2020 bill continues our commitment to opioid the opioid epidemic providing money to do that providing money for prevention for education for research and for treatment as well as recovery programs in this bill Madam President we put new flexibility in for the opioid epidemic to where those things that you may go to after you become addicted to opioids like meth can also qualify for the kind of help that people need who are trying to escape their addiction to pain medications or other other things that they have become critically linked - this bill includes new and substantially expanded investments in headstart in high quality early childhood care programs that provide more flexibility to school districts to use the limited resources they have whether that's title 1 if you're a school person to know what that means or title 2 supporting effective instruction state grants IDE a the the ability to help people with disability education issues impact aid in communities that either have that have significant federal investments in military bases or national forests or things like that these are all things we deal with in this bill we also target STEM education including to focus on computer science this is a bill that we also trying to bring a focus for young people to make more quickly understand what the options are out there clearly the college path that has been so pervasive in the last two decades isn't the right path for everybody and even if it's the right path for everybody if it doesn't hurt to go to college I'm the first person in my family to graduate from college if it doesn't hurt to go to college it might not necessarily get you a job unless you know what job it is you're thinking about as you put your college life together but even that might not get you the job that you really would like to do what that job does and so part of what we're trying to do here is connect people earlier with the opportunity to do that if they do go to college we are increasing Pell grants for the third year in a row by about two and a half percent we're increasing the programs that so-called Trio programs that with people whose haven't had members of their family go to college before helps you get ready for college thinking about what you need to do to be the first person maybe in your family to go to college helps you stay and how to stay in college because nobody in your family can give you the exact advice you might need to have to stay and how you can get prepared to get a job out of college and not have the kind of loans you can't afford to pay back and then Madam President there's something I call the Lost Decade I've talked to so many people in the last two years who are about 28 years old and the story all over and over again was so similar I went to college for a year or a semester and then a series of jobs that were not too hard to get but didn't lead anywhere they're landscapers or uber drivers or bartenders or whatever else with no sense that that was a career and not the underpinnings that you'd like to have and then finally in your mid-20s somebody tells you or you figure out on your own I've got to have something that can support me the way I'd like to be supported can help me with the family might have retirement certainly has benefits we're trying to do what we can to be sure that that focus comes earlier as you begin to think about what do you like to do what do you find fulfilling let's let's talk about the jobs that are out there whether it's STEM education or health services and let's talk about the difference in being a nurse practitioner and being a doctor let's talk about the difference in being a doctor and a specialist let's talk about where the job opportunities are as physical therapy occupational therapy or a health tech all those things are weight of a great career if you know what you're doing and if you miss that launching point frankly if you miss that 10 years that lost decade it's pretty hard to ever catch up like your seatmate at school who understood what they want to do and maybe had no more resources than you and no more capacity than you but they get an extra 10 years on you in preparing for the career they would like to have the work they'd like to do and where that might lead them the president's really been focusing on apprenticeship programs apprenticeship good way to see firsthand to learn firsthand but also to see firsthand what you want to do whether it's an apprenticeship program or a community college or a traditional college or skills you learn in the military that you should be able to immediately transfer into a into a a private sector non military opportunity we need to spend some time on that and some money on that and this bill does bill continues to try to do what we can to be looking carefully for reducing fraud reducing waste seeing that tax dollars are spent properly and a lot of them are spent right here in this bill we prioritize programs that really will provide benefit we hope to large groups of our country the bill reflects compromises on both sides but people send a hundred different people to the Senate and 435 different people to the house to vote and to make decisions that reach conclusion this bill does that all twelve of these bills that will vote on in the net sometime in the next three days Madam President do that it allows us to defend the country to meet the obligations that people have asked the government to look at for them and hopefully to do that in a way that produces real results

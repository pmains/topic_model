thank you very much mr. chairman again thank you both for your service and for being here today mr. Malloy first I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the efficacy of our Security Assistance United States spent about 20 billion dollars on the Iraqi military between 2003 and 2011 of course then faced with a marching Isis in 2014 an army of quarter million just seemed to melt away since 2014 we've spent another five billion dollars and so the logical question is what are we doing differently this time around to assure that the same outcome doesn't repeat itself but I mentioned in my opening statement another concern which is that when we were there one of our top commanders talked to us about the difficulty of getting large amounts of short-term money out the door we appropriate on an annual basis we have given significant amounts of security assistance and it worries me that it seems that many of our military top military people there are spending lots of time spinning their wheels just trying to get as much money out the door as quickly as possible because they don't know whether it'll be there the next year leading one of these individuals to say to us we'd rather have a hundred million dollars over ten years than one hundred million dollars in one year so that we could engage in long-term projects so Mike my question is what are we doing differently this time what's that what were the top-line things were doing differently and is there a danger about not having a longer-term commitment here so that we can do longer-term military and security investments rather than just speeding money out the door yes sir so I would point out that in 2008 when we had 140,000 troops there were spent a hundred fifty billion dollars a year and now in 2019 we're spending fifteen billion dollars for me it still sounds like a lot of money because it is but it's important to see that we have a trend in the right direction when it comes to expand sure's of taxpayer money I would say one of the difference when we saw the collapse of the of the military the Iraqi military in 2014 - and we saw how they performed more recently 17 18 19 one of the things they had and that's why I highlighted in my opening is the enable enabling component of the US military it is it is a game changer when you have air support conducted by the most effective air force in the world and we have advisors it can actually assist them on the ground and give them the confidence that their it'll they'll be there in the height of the battle I really do think that in my estimation is the game changer when it comes to the specifics of the spending as you requested I think I've heard that a lot when it comes to government spending everywhere that there's a requirement to spend everything at the end of a particular fiscal year and that often times people spent and I think that's a legitimate issue that you raised which also includes in a place like Iraq from my perspective everything we're trying to do now is move more toward the economy of Forces which I've already highlighted we are but also to a normalization so we we've established an sto debt and and we are moving toward a traditional country team model where the sto dad answering to the ambassador now ambassador to ler and we will start standardizing and modernizing and normalizing our our spending as we do that we're doing that with the Kurdish pesh MERGA right now and we obviously are going to be doing that when it comes to the rest of the Iraqi we can solve that problem partially Congress can do a multi-year authorization it's still an authorization subject to appropriation but we can at least provide some of that certainty and I would encourage our community to look into that ambassador Paula sure I wanted you to address something else I brought up in my opening statement which is a report over the weekend of really concerning reports suggesting that the embassy in Baghdad is down to 15 functional political staffers helped me understand the the conundrum I laid out in my opening remarks which is how do we maintain our political mission inside Baghdad if we have pulled so many of our personnel can you confirm that we are down to 15 functional political staffers in Baghdad and if we were able to maintain a full diplomatic corps there during the height of the Iraq war in the 2000s why can't we do the same today the report from this weekend suggest that this is a permanent decision that we that state has made a decision that they are going to keep these low levels of staff for for a time uncertain and so given that report I wondered if you could clarify some of that for the committee today of course first I'd like to maybe go back just a couple of months to early May where we faced a very serious specific credible threat stream against US personnel in Iraq and that threat stream has not diminished it's still there so that was the reason that embassy Baghdad requested authorization go to go to ordered departure status and the Secretary of State approved that on May 14th this is a temporary situation order departure is something that is done in 30 day increments we constantly evaluate the situation looking carefully at the threat information that we have and the personnel on the ground and to make sure that we've got the right right fit and the secretary just renewed the ordered departure status on July 12th for another 30 days I would prefer not to go into specific numbers of personnel that we have on the ground in this open setting but I'd be very very happy to brief you later I would note again though that this is just a temporary decision we have not made any decisions to permanently withdraw staff we're constantly evaluating the situation and it is certainly our hope that we are able to have a maximum presence on the ground in order to achieve all the important objectives that we have you know with that was certainly without getting into classified threat assessment I I think it's I think it's hard to suggest that the threat is higher today than it was during the height of the insurgency and the fighting in and around Baghdad and so well I would never I can guess security decisions I would hope that if there is a long-term decision made to have lower levels of staffing there that we start to think about how to increase security so that we can return to some level of political functionality because if we don't if we maintain a dozen or two dozen political staffers there it is an invitation for Isis to re-emerge because we are not there helping the Iraqis do the hard lift of political reconciliation that ultimately protects our interests against the future rise of Isis or a follow-on organization and so I understand how sensitive this is because you're talking about the lives of American personnel there but the risk of a long-term political withdrawal from Baghdad it could in the end costs as many American lives as we are saving in the short run and it's just something I hope that the State Department is contemplating thank you mr. Chairman I may have a few if we have a second round as well thank you very much mr. chairman I'm trying to sneak to quick ones in here mr. mole Roy you you described the militias as sort of belonging to two categories and ambassador polish I referenced the same there's the group that enjoys popular support in Iraq in part because of the good work they did against Isis and then there's the group that is directly aligned with Iran and and that's not how I understand it I understand there to be a Venn diagram in which there are groups that have broad popular support and there are groups that have very close relationships with Iran and those two circles overlap in big parts and one of the concerns that I heard when we were there is that by forcing this choice with the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization we are in fact pushing some groups that exist inside the overlap to Iran because those groups perceive the United States again to be a relatively short term player and partner Iran's going to be around forever and so by sort of pushing this question in front of many of these militias that are popularly supported and have relationship with Iran we are actually working against our interests by pushing more of these groups towards Iran they are not making the choice to align with us would you disagree with that assessment I fully agree with your assessment that it's it's a little squishier that there there are overlapping circles and this is it's an important question that the Iraqi government is grappling with and that we're grappling with as well what is the best way to encourage good behavior from groups that fall into that that middle area there are several PMF groups who now have political parties and they have members elected to the Council of Representatives and so how how could we encourage those groups to become good actors instead of bad actors so this is an ongoing policy debate within the administration it's something that we're grappling with but the intent is to do everything possible that we can to strengthen Iraq's sovereignty and its capacity to withstand threats to its sovereignty both internal and external so you've hit I think on on one of the hot-button issues that we continue to deliberate and and it's very much on our minds and I'm not speaking to either of you here I think the administration has essentially already deliberated on this question and has made a decision with respect to the designation of the IRGC that makes all of your jobs much more difficult lastly the mr. McGee's ask one question on stabilization to build on senator Sheheen's question I just have a hard time figuring out the math here and again this is this is a question of finite resources but the estimate is that the rebuilding of places like West Mosul you know are in the 80 billion dollar range when you look at all of the work that needs to be done inside that country and yet we're appropriating about 250 million dollars a year and we've got commitments from other partners that get that number up to maybe about a billion dollars a year I just don't know how that math works if we're putting the other a billion dollars a quarter of that is our money which by the way represents about one quarter of one percent of the US defense budget how does Iraq put together the dollars to rebuild parts of that country which are literally rubble today because again if they don't rebuild then it's part of the political impetus for Isis to emerge is the rest of it all on on them or is there hope that bigger numbers ride to the rescue from outside of the country there was the Iraq reconstruction pledging conference or and perhaps that name isn't accurate but it was early and in 2018 where there were significant pledges from key Arab countries from the United States perspective we've been very focused on immediate stabilization needs getting the essential services back on providing humanitarian assistance working on justice and accountability all of the measures that are required to allow people to come home and yes there are huge infrastructure needs that exist but I think one way to address that would be to also push forward on the economic reform agenda because a lot of reconstruction or a lot of construction writ large development can be done by the private sector if there's a better business environment I mean there's serious money that could be made in Iraq it's it's a wealthy country in terms of its resources in terms of its human capacity so that's why we're also putting the effort on the the regulatory reforms that will be required to create a more open inviting business environment because Iraq is a statist economy still this is a very heavy legacy from the Saddam Hussein era so whatever we can do to transition the Iraqi economy away from that heavy status focus to a more open market approach I think will be better yes Annie Romney noted they don't help themselves when they continue to reject offers from Western companies Western energy companies to help them get a better return on on their rate of investment and fossil fuels so appreciate that answer Thank You mr. chairman

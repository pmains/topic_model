either when you look at what's happening at our border you're looking at what's happening with human trafficking right here in Houston Texas where I'm the congressman for congressional district 38. you look at what's going on right here in our community and this has absolutely nothing to do with race and when you become the boy that cried wolf like the left has become and everything is about race that it actually weakens those times when race is an actual issue so what my goal is going to be on this committee is to make sure that we don't allow them to use race as a scapegoat for everything and let's get down to brass tacks as to what's important to the American people and how can we fix some of these issues that's happening at the border that's killing people every single day of course and when you say things that are killing people you're talking about fentanyl uh to the to the Democrats they made it very clear yesterday that most of the seizures of fentanyl in coming across our Southern border are at the ports of entry and it's it's stuff in cars being driven by Americans and relatively they said for the most part it's pretty much zero for the people who who are trying to travel and come into the country between the ports uh do you buy that absolutely not the cartels have full control over our Sovereign border right now there are funneling Fentanyl and they are killing Americans at a rate we have not seen in the history of this country enough fentanyl has poured into our country to kill every single American five times we know better than that but they're also working at Cahoots with China That's providing the fentanyl to the cartels that are now killing our young people that's the bottom line and they can try to tell us whatever they want in filibuster and say that you know it's not about that and that we're racist and that we're xenophobic but quite frankly we have the truth on our side as long as we are willing to tell it and I think we're going to do just that over the course of the next few months on this issue

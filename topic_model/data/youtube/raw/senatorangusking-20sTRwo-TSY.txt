mr chairman perhaps i can i can take that uh that's a really good question the purpose of the national cyber director is planning and coordination not operations so the chain of command between the uh the between cyber command secretary of defense and the president would not be interrupted uh that's not the the purpose of this uh of this new office in the executive office of the president we want this person to be accountable for the coordination but does not would not have an operational role also a piece of it is planning as we've been talking about and coordinating planning throughout whether it's in siza in homeland security or in other in nist or wherever it is in the in the federal government but i think the specific answer to your question is we're not talking about operations for this position but uh coordination planning and budget coordination this this person would have an oversight over the budgets of the various agencies not a veto but a recommendation and a certification through the omb process again the whole idea is to bring some level of of uh i guess i'd call it just sensible organization because right now there's nobody in charge but uh to answer your specific question uh it's still cyber command secretary of defense president united states thank you for

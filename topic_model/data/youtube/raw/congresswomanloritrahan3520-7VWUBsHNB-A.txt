i'm congresswoman laurie trahan and thanks for tuning in uh if you've attended one of my facebook live discussions in recent weeks you've noticed that we're talking a lot about how covid19 is impacting normal operations and a lot of different aspects of our lives that's why we're here today to talk about one of my most important duties uh nominating the best and brightest from our district to our nation's most prestigious institutions of higher education our service academies i consider this responsibility to be one of the greatest privileges i have as a member of congress and i take the nomination process very seriously while your grades class rank and test scores are a crucial part of your package i believe it's absolutely vital that we do everything we can to find students who are rich in character and leadership with unwavering enthusiasm and determination and driven by a unique commitment to serve our country and fellow americans now if it weren't for the current health public uh the current public health crisis we'd be doing a couple of events across the district promoting our nomination process and making sure that students applying for the academies know what information they need to submit to us in order to be considered but like we've had to do with a lot of things in recent months we're pivoting to this virtual discussion instead so i'll briefly describe to you what my office's nomination process looks like uh in the age of covid and then i'll turn it over to our outstanding guests who will talk about their respect of a cat what their respective academies require and answer some of the questions that you all submitted before our discussion so to be considered for an academy nomination you must submit all of the following a current photo official high school transcript that must be sent from your school directly a resume of extracurricular activities uh an essay stating why you want to attend a service academy 500 words or less and a minimum of three letters of recommendation the deadline to submit your completed packet is october 31st uh so we don't have uh too too much time we've gotten a lot of questions about how we're handling sat and act scores this year and while we normally require the submission of unofficial exam results when you submit your nomination request we understand that many of the opportunities to take these exams have been postponed or cancelled because of the pandemic that's why your nomination packet will not be considered incomplete if you do not submit test scores before the october 31st deadline however if you do take the sat or act test before the end of the year we are asking that you submit the unofficial copy of those scores to our office so if you haven't submitted your completed packet already you can do so by emailing us at trahan academies at mail.house.gov or by mailing all of the documents we just discussed to our local office for more information you can visit the service academy nomination page on our website at trahan.house.gov in applicants who submit a completed nomination file will be eligible for an interview in november or early december nominations will be announced in late december or early january and we will be conducting virtual interviews via zoom this year so we can ensure everyone's safety during the ongoing covid19 pandemic so with all of that out of the way it's my pleasure to now introduce our panelists who are here to talk about their respective academies and what you need to do to apply successfully our first guest is major jay kim the northeast regional commander for west point's directorate of admissions he was born in seoul south korea before immigrating to the united states when he was nine years old major kim enlisted as a combat medic in the united states army following 911 and eventually received an appointment to west point where he graduated in 2009 in addition to his bachelor of science and economics he also holds a master of business administration from georgetown university major kim welcome thank you congratulations it's a it's my honor to be here and thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk to and just kind of talk about the opportunities at west point and really all the service academies percent terrific well we look forward to hearing from you uh our next guest is lieutenant lauren schmiegel an admissions counselor for the united states naval academy a 2014 graduate of the u.s naval academy lieutenant schmiegel went on to complete both nuclear power school and naval nuclear prototype training command since then she has also served as the assistant chief engineer aboard uss normandy where she participated in a historic deployment to the arctic circle and sustained operations in support of operation inherent resolve welcome lieutenant schmiegel thank you very much i'm very excited to connect with candidates from your district and talk more about the naval academy terrific and last but certainly not least our third panelist is lieutenant colonel joshua carroll the u.s air force academy liaison officer for our region lieutenant colonel carroll graduated from merrimack college and received his commission out of rotc in 2005 serving in active duty for eight years before attending duke university's law school he is now a part-time reservist at westover air reserve base and a full-time attorney at robson gray in boston lieutenant colonel carol welcome thanks for having me yeah you probably heard from my bio i'm not a academy grad but i'm hopefully here to help you so that you have you can you can make it make that leap so there's multiple paths uh to becoming an officer um in the military and um the academy is a terrific one and hopefully i can give you some information and help you get to your goal thank you terrific all right now let's get to some of the questions that folks have submitted in advance of today's event so this first question could be answered by all of you or one of you but it's not to anyone in particular i'm wondering if you can take a minute or two to briefly explain how covid19 has impacted the admissions process for your respective academies and what folks can expect to experience as they move through the application process major kim why don't we start with you okay thank you so we understand here um at west point that covert has a an outside impact on everybody and especially when it comes to things like sats a.c.t so we have gone to and i know the naval academy has as well we've gone to this test flexible um kind of program where we still are highly encouraging all applicants to take the sat act um we our application deadline is january 31st and i know navy you push it to i believe the end of february february 28th but um we would still like to see candidates continue to sign up for tests and contempt to take the test now if all else fails then we have other things in mind so like you could potentially have your candidate evaluated with the with your psats uh or if you absolutely cannot take any test whatsoever there are also other options where we can kind of figure out different ways to evaluate your file but the testing is a big issue and also the candidate fitness assessment we understand with the social distancing and needing to have someone administer that in close proximity and that's why we are our volunteers are a lot of them are willing to help with that but i'm just making sure that you are starting with enough time especially when it comes to the dodmer qualification so dobner is the department of defense medical examination review board they do medical qualification for all the service academies in rotc because kovit is so it has kind of thrown the system for a loop we recommend starting that process as early as possible and if you do it for the naval academy it also transfers to us so um getting started early and trying to be aggressive with the process is what i would recommend great yeah i mean i'll go ahead go ahead i was just going to chime in on the naval academy i know major kim had mentioned some different parts regarding the naval academy we really very much aligned with west point um our application deadline has been extended to february 28th for our test flexible the way that we define it at the naval academy um so you hear that term test optional out there there are several universities and colleges that are test optional this year what that means is a student can say i'm not submitting standardized test scores and and that's it um test flexible for the naval academy what that means is if you don't have an opportunity to take that test or maybe you've only taken it once you you haven't performed up to the standard that you want to but you're not able to retake it we understand we're not going to penalize you for that but as part of our test flexible policy we ask that you provide written documentation as to what your situation is why you couldn't take those tests and how you've been affected um aside from that though i do realize that there are so many different situations out there right now different states are handling things differently schools within the same district are handling things differently there are things out there that i may not have even heard of yet as an admissions counselor for example a school just contacted me last week and they cancelled all of their ap courses so the main goal that we are looking for to come out of this environment it's definitely a learning experience for all of us but as a candidate please be fully transparent through this nomination process through the application process please be fully transparent with us so that we know what your situation is what hurdles you're facing and we can address those as a team makes sense okay lieutenant colonel yep uh and i understand that people are in you know various um years in the admission cycle and you know maybe you're tuning in you're you know a freshman or sophomore maybe you're a junior maybe you're a senior the air force academy has actually pushed their deadline for um standardized tests to the act standardized test date which i believe is february 6 2021 so you can we'll accept tests as late as 6 february you know we'd like to get tests before december but just be in communication with admission liaison officer like myself or admissions counselor and just kind of explain the circumstances you know under no circumstance should you be taking a test if you're at risk of getting cobit or um you'd expose others so you know these are things that we're taking as a case-by-case sort of basis but um you know the bottom line here is we're willing to adapt we're really trying to work with the candidates um you know things like the candidate fitness assessment standardized tests physicals um you know these are things that you know in unprecedented times we understand that and so we don't want to preclude anyone from applying to the academy because of you know certain circumstances that come up at school or um within the family so just just realize that you know what's coming from the top the air force academy is everyone's being very flexible and accommodating and you know uh we will we will find a way um to to make sure that you get evaluated kind of in a holistic way um if you know you are missing something great great that was all very uh important and valuable information so thank you uh major kim this next question is for you last year pre-covered i was able to host a number of students and their parents in my office when they dropped off their nomination packets so my team and i could answer questions in person an interesting thing i've noticed is that folks aren't always fully aware of the wide array of educational opportunities after graduating from a service academy can you talk about the different opportunities available to go to graduate school either directly after graduating from west point or while in the army sure i'd love to that's a great question because there are so many opportunities to attend graduate school within the military structure so outside of from directly from west point we have something known as the west point scholarships program where we prepare our cadets who are looking to do things like attend um apply for the rhodes scholarship the marshall scholarship or the the fulbright scholarship we prepare them and mentor them to ultimately uh go out and compete for these scholarships and we do pretty well we typically um with rhodes scholarship we are the fourth ranked uh school in the nation so that's after like harvard princeton schools that have larger undergraduate bodies than us but every single year we send about 100 of our students directly to these these different types of scholarship programs so i mentioned roads but we also have these technical scholarships where you earn a master's at mit so the lincoln laboratories and the draper scholarships um we also send a lot of cadets to medical schools so because we are the largest the armed forces we send a good chunk of our class about two percent um to different medical schools so this past graduating year we sent students to yale stanford brown ucla medical school directly after graduation but the option is also available for uh for you after spending a couple years on active duty to attend graduate school like before i took this job for west point admissions the army i was selected to attend uh graduate school fully funded by the us army and that's pretty common thing so you have the opportunity to kind of go grab your hair live the graduate school life and while still getting paid a salary and that's really great opportunity i think that exists that people don't know of though the military and the army is continually looking to help you improve and grow and education is a key part of that so if you are looking to serve i mean that's a big benefit i believe terrific terrific um that's so helpful uh the next question i have uh is for well not i have that was submitted to us is for uh lieutenant schmiegel extracurricular activities are certainly uh important components of an application that we look at when considering who to nominate for a coveted spot at our military academies but this year i'm finding that i'm having to take into consideration how covid19 is impacting many of those options for students to participate um in activities outside of the classroom can you just talk a little bit about how the naval academy admissions board is taking into consideration how covet has a student's ability to participate in those activities absolutely and i know it's a big concern for a lot of these students because they were anticipating being captain of a spring sport or being captain of a false board and that fell through or even those summer programs that you were going to take advantage of as a student maybe you were accepted into boyce state or girl state those are really big accomplishments um and they should definitely be recognized and so at the naval academy on our application we actually have a spot for applicants to annotate everything that has been affected by coven and we encourage again i'm going to encourage that transparency we tell candidates write everything so even if you don't think it's an important thing to us i guarantee you it probably is especially in this environment so many situations out there it's important that you even if you think you would have been captain during the fall sports season throw that on there it's important for us to not only see what was canceled and what was missed out on because of covid but be able to see what your goals were that maybe you couldn't necessarily accomplish so we are using that space on the application and then obviously in the actual admissions board itself we are very thorough as it is but now with all that transparency and all the additional information that students provide to us because of this covet environment we are truly going to be scrubbing every single application line by line so the more you can give us the better that's great and it's great that you've allotted space uh for that i wasn't actually thinking that you know by being transparent you're also exposing you know what your goals were which is an important input into these applications okay lieutenant colonel carroll last year my team attended a candidate fitness assessment in chelmsford and met with students and parents to discuss the nomination process with many schools going entirely remote or currently in a hybrid environment students may not be able to arrange for a qualified person like a pe teacher to conduct their candidate fitness assessment are there more opportunities for students applying to the air force academy this year to take their cfa yeah so that's a really great question and um the air force academy has actually just adopted a new policy so admissions liaison officers like myself and admissions counselors and advisors are now allowed on a case-by-case basis to administer the cfa um however candidates should have exhausted all other kind of avenues and methods before you know approaching an halo or an admissions advisor you know we still say the candidate should try to get a pe certified teacher obviously if they're you know not in school that that's more difficult or a non-family member who's in the military um or even you know if they're applying to another academy um another academy service rep who are also you know voluntarily doing that there's still some um you know protocols that need to be in place you have to make sure that because we just don't want to make put anyone at risk so you know the administrator um whoever's giving the test and the student they both have to certify that they haven't been within kind of high covert exposure situations in the last couple of weeks and then the uh candidate also has to bring an assistant with them so that's someone kind of in their um covet group who'll be holding the feet during the sit-ups you know helping them with a pull-up bar we do a basketball toss um and so they have to they're the ones touching the basketball the assistant and the candidate that the test the tester um administrator doesn't doesn't do any of that stuff so um yeah so this we've expanded this is a big thing we get a lot of those kind of questions um you know your your local halo or admit um uh advisor is allowed to um administer those so just kind of reach out and see if there's one in your area that can help out great great um well i want to thank you all uh for answering those questions that were submitted you know before we conclude our discussion uh it always happens that's you know uh there's maybe something that someone hasn't thought of uh so if you have anything else that students and parents need to know as they navigate the application process for your academy this year or if we haven't covered something already that you think is important uh to flag for folks tuning in please let's use this time to give those parting thoughts yeah so um you know i tell all the candidates to go to academyadmissions.com that's the air force academy's website and they've done a really good job of staying up to date with all the cobit kind of new policies and the frequently asked questions questions that have been asked here and right outside are all there as well so that's just a really great resource if you have a question that's probably already been asked by another person on that site so i would go there as kind of your first initial matter and then if you can't find questions obviously reach out to someone like myself or or a counselor but um that's that's kind of like i just steer everyone um too because it changes kind of i check it weekly and it changes almost like day to day um in terms of what the academy is accepting now it's been it's been mentioned but you know just staying in touch with all of us we understand that you know this is not a normal year and we're we're we're all working through this together but we can't help you uh resolve issues or we can't unless you kind of stay in contact with us so that's just something having open lines of communication not only directly with the admissions office but our field force volunteers i know maybe called blue and gold officers uh air force clubs and halos but just having those lines of communication and let us know whatever is going on because ultimately we are all here to help all the candidates get through this process as best we can and like that's our job like we want to help and we want to see young men women serve this country so yeah we're here to help and so please stay in touch with us thank you and i just ask that as a candidate as students you don't let the covid environment dictate whether or not you apply to a service academy i've talked to several candidates already that are considering withdrawing applications from service academies just because they're scared that because of their situation you know lack of ap courses lack of extracurricular activities that their application isn't going to be as strong please do not let this environment dictate that thinking um put everything you have into the application and leave the rest up to the admissions board again like everyone has said communicate with us be transparent with us and the rest will take care of itself i couldn't think of a better piece of advice to leave folks with i want to say thank you uh to our outstanding panelists for taking time out of their busy schedules to join us today and answer these really important questions while kova 19 has certainly changed a lot in our lives over the past seven months it hasn't altered our commitment to making sure that the best and brightest in our communities have a shot at attending uh the most prestigious institutions in our country you know those who attend u.s service academies will receive a world-class education rooted in uh learning leadership discipline and communication skills necessary to become an officer in our country's military so as we've heard today the education attained and the skills learned over the course of enrollment are invaluable in a limitless number of career pursuits both for those who are looking for a career in the military and for those who enter the job market after fulfilling their service obligations so before we say goodbye i'll just reiterate once again for those interested in applying that the deadline to submit your complete application packet to our office is october 31st and if you have any further questions about the nomination process be sure to visit the nominations page on our website at trahan.house.gov and i've also included a direct link in the comments section for those looking to find out more information here so thanks again to our incredible panelists your answers were so helpful and i want to thank all of you for tuning in this afternoon stay safe uh and stay healthy take care thanks

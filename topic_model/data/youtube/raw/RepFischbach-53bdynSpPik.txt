welcome back everyone to the 2021 virtual farm forum joining us next is minnesota representative michelle fischbach we caught up with her yesterday fischbach is a member of the house agriculture committee and is ranking member of the house agriculture subcommittee of commodity exchanges energy and credit thanks for joining us oh i'm so happy to be with you today so to kick things off how are things going in washington dc you know they're very busy um we're doing well though i've got uh we've got we've put together a great staff we've got uh nick who we stole from emer congressman emmer's office we've got david fitzsimmons chief of staff and so and actually i will just say we have benny anderson as uh as the district director so and please always feel free to give us a call but things are going very well you know we're having committees and we're um we are putting things on moving things onto the floor don't all don't agree with some of the things we're doing but we are moving things forward so we know the house is expected to vote on the 1.9 trillion dollar american rescue plan act this week what does this new aid package mean for agriculture you know it will be if we just passed it out of rules we we got the senate amendments back and we dealt with those in rules today and we'll probably uh vote on that in a couple of days on the floor maybe even tomorrow but you know there isn't as much relief for agriculture as i would have liked um i think we should have done more for ethanol we should have done more of the direct kind of um and more targeted relief there's a lot of things that are not covered related in the bill and so i really have concerns and when we are spending 1.9 trillion dollars on something it should be targeted and it should be actual coveted relief and so i i do oppose the bill and did on its way out and will uh will it now that it's back in the senate because i i do have concerns about adding that kind of money to the deficit when there's already a trillion dollars sitting there that's went unspent um from the last coveted relief bills and in addition to that you know the president by executive order stopped the cfap payments and we should be putting those through so it's a very it's a it's a it is it's not the kind of covered relief that i think that we need to be doing right now um like i said lots of stuff that has nothing to do with covet in there well and then i wonder about the already existing um covid relief that's out there that has yet to be implemented i think farmers still waiting on usda to implement some of that aid that was passed in december do you know how soon maybe have you got a sense in washington d.c how quick that could be implemented no you know we're still waiting on those on the meat processing uh they put together the money for the meat processing in that december bill we still don't have the regulations from usda on that and like i said the cfa payments have been stopped so and there's like i said a trillion dollars of unspent government relief from the last bill and so we really need to um be looking at that and making sure we're expending those dollars before we put another 1.9 in once this covered 19 pandemic is addressed we understand climate change will be a top priority for the biden administration how do you see this impacting agriculture you know i'm very concerned about that we did have a climate change hearing no legislation but an informational hearing on the ag committee i think it went four or five hours it was very long committee hearing but i'm very concerned because we've got to make sure that if we're going to be doing um any if we're going to be imposing things on to the farmers we need to make sure they're voluntary we need to make sure that they are incentive based and we need to make sure that the the the farmers are getting credit for what they've already done farmers have already done so much and so they need to have a seat at the table and be able to explain those things that they've already been doing um regarding you know sustainability and things like that so that's something that i'm very concerned about we will continue to watch that we don't have anything of the exact uh proposals yet but we will be watching it and hopefully um making some very good changes and suggestions to um to those there appears to be a lot of partisanship happening in washington d.c what do you see as the path forward for working in a bipartisan way on some of these key issues well i think we what really needs to happen is that the chairs really need to step up the chair particularly the ag committee really needs to step up and start including republicans in what's going on and including the um the stakeholders groups and so it's not just about republicans having it put it but it's about those stakeholders groups it's about the farmers it's about the farm bureau it's about the farm union being able to have input on what's going on and that's one thing so far we didn't see that on the covent relief bill unfortunately that the stakeholders were really uh talked to about what was going on there but i'm hoping that the chair does step up and and that we um that we get that input that we need to have yes thank you uh we understand you're also the the new chair of the house agriculture subcommittee of commodity exchanges energy and credit under that category where do you see you know the priorities for agriculture where will that subcommittee focus its priorities well i think one of the things is is it it has the broadband under that and and i will correct you although i would love to be chair i'm the ranking member um but thank you but you know i was going to take the title while i had it for a few minutes but um but one of the things that falls under that that subcommittee is broadband and so we're very concerned about making sure that we've got broadband across the seventh district rural minnesota is that if if the pandemic did nothing else it showed us the need to make sure that we have good broadband across the district you know in those rural areas and that that's good you know that's good for our rural communities our education our health care agriculture uses it you know uses the internet and so we need to make sure that um that we get that done and so that's one of the priorities on that subcommittee for me is making sure that we are working on that and not just oh i'm sorry you're just getting it not just getting it to the the cities but getting it to people's doors and that's the real that's the challenge in closing comments i wondered what would you like to share with farmers in your home district well i'm i'm very excited very humbled first of all to be elected and um happy to to be here serving the people of the seventh district and the farmers of the seventh district and and i really want to make sure that they feel free to call us and contact us uh if there's anything that they need or they see we could be doing better so please you know that conversation is very very important to me and just make sure that they reach out if there's anything and we'll be reaching out to and making sure that we um that we have that relationship thank you once again we've got minnesota representative michelle fischbach i'm kara hart here on the red river

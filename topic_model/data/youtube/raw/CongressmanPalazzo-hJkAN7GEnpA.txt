congressman Palazzo thank you madam chair I would like to start by expressing my thanks to all the members of the Appropriations Committee on both the house and the Senate for your hard work and while I believe we should have loved to finish consideration of the bill prior to the end of the hundred 15th Congress and avoided the partial government shutdown I know that everyone around the table is ready to put pen to paper and to avoid a second shutdown and come up to a solution that we can all accept let's make no mistake the American people are watching us heck the world is watching us to see if we can come together and govern responsibly and work towards a solution and at the risk of repeating much it was already been said and my mind we have three goals to achieve and all that although the details may differ between us right now I hope we can come to a consensus we must secure our border we must address the humanitarian crisis at our border and we must keep the government open I believe that we all have come here in good faith and feel confident that the solution is here elected officials of this country must be willing to find that solution and madam chair before I yield back I would like to just expand on what Senator Hoeven said you know he wants he I think it'd be a great idea to hear from the professionals have them the lifetime professional people in the front lines that know this issue better than anybody in this US Congress and hear from them but if we can't get them to come to us why don't we go to them why don't we go to the border and see firsthand ok our Laredos on my list and and see first and I'd hope I'd hope the chairwoman would approve such travel and and do it sooner than later so we can get to the people's business

Hey everybody! This is Cori Bush,
your candidate for US Congress for Missouri's First District. 
Our campaign has a huge need for poll workers. The poll worker is the person
that has the duty of making sure that every
single person that shows up to a particular polling place
knows about Cori Bush for congress. They might not have seen the television ads
or heard the radio ads; they may not have seen a sign or
poster. You can hold that vote and help change this election, so we're asking you
to show up for the Cori Bush for Congress campaign.
How can you do that text the word "poll worker" to the phone number 314-370-2929. Simple as that just text" poll worker" to that number and we will get you all signed up. Alright, we need poll workers can you bring help? Yes,  I  tell you what, if you want to bring
more people with you that's great, we have a bunch of polling locations, we
have a lot to do, and it's just one day. So if you show up for me I will work
hard for you

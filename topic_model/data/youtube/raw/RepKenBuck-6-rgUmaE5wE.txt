so Google has a monopoly on speech over 90 on search over 90 of the United States how are they allowed to do this well uh Tucker they do it uh you know we know that in in uh June of 2020 they changed their algorithm to benefit Joe Biden and disadvantage Donald Trump we know that um so many conservative uh newspapers and media sites are buried on page 10 of any Google search and the views that they want to espouse that they want to promote are are found at the top of the page and so it doesn't surprise me at all that they are protecting one of their other corporate Giants what I don't understand is that Google is a monopoly acting contrary to American law you're not allowed to have a monopoly they have one Congress allows it I'm sorry to say this Congressman there are a lot of members of your party who look the other way or actively defend it I don't understand why there aren't more people like you in the Republican Party saying No this is wrong and it's illegal yeah actually the Democrats are leading on this issue uh beyond what what the Republicans are willing to do and it's unfortunate there are great Senators like Mike Lee who is an advocate for antitrust reform there are other uh folks in the Senate and there are some in the house but we have an uphill battle with our Republican colleagues to get this job done with big Tech without you know giving away and alienating lifelong friendships perhaps but I mean it does feel like Google spreads a lot of money around the Congress is that your perception uh these four giants Amazon Apple uh Facebook and Google have spent over 150 million dollars in a two-year period um in races around the country as well as buying off think tanks and on the right and left in in Washington DC so they are they are throwing a lot of money at this issue yeah I noticed that and it shows well we appreciate your leadership in this Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado thank you so much thank you

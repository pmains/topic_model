i want to welcome one and all for joining us this morning uh as soon as we have 11 members present we're going to have a short business meeting some of you know senator capito knows as well the government printing office apparently made a mistake after we had passed out and reported out our water infrastructure legislation two weeks ago and as a result we need to simply uh do again what we did two weeks ago and that's to report out those bills and i hope we'll do that uh in short order uh once we have 11 and then we'll get back to our business that's that's before us to uh today um i'm going to start until we have 11 i'm going to start with a statement and and ask invite senator capito to do that as well and if we have 11 people appear magically we'll break and do the vote today's hearing is special for a variety of reasons one of the reasons is because it has the longest title i've ever seen in 20 years in the united states senate the title is long-term solvency of the highway trust fund lessons learned from the service transportation system funding alternatives program and other user-based revenue solutions and how funding uncertainty affects the highway programs that's it that's probably the longest acronym there's probably a great acronym in there somewhere probably several of them center capital but i'm not going to take our time to figure out what it is um i want to thank senator capito i want to thank our staff our staff and all of you for helping us helping us put together today's a hearing and we especially want to welcome marva's our witnesses some of them were here in person and some of you are joining us virtually i um center capital and i have been informed that our rh our water legislation and i want to thank again senators capitol lumber columbus oh gosh cardin wicker others who helped the work make that legislation possible for us reported out unanimously two weeks ago my thanks to all of you who supported it and uh we are informed by our leadership that uh that legislation very likely will be on the floor uh pardon do we have 11 oh that's great all right in that case we'll we'll just hold off for a moment on my statement and uh my staff informs we now have majority my ranking member tells me we have uh we have the number that we need we're physically present able to vote therefore the senate now considers s 914 the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure acts of 2021 first we'll adopt the bipartisan carpet capital amendment number one just as we did last month i moved to adopt the capital substitute amendment center capital and i've agreed to do this by voice vote is there a second all in favor say aye all opposed say name the eyes heaven um i now move uh that the committee report asks 914 the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act of 2021 is a minute is there a second it's been moved and seconded all in favor say aye aye aleppo nay unanimous consent that the business meeting record reflect that s 9 14 as amended was reported by the same 20 to 0 vote as when the committee acted on march 24 2021 and i further ask that our staff be allowed to make any necessary technical and conforming changes to this measure is there objection hearing none it's awarded so now we'll return to our hearing and my francis thank you for helping me get through that land in my field all right um so i mentioned i just mentioned longest title i've ever seen and a piece of legislation frankly one of the most timely and i think interesting uh hearings that we're going to have in some time um uh i mentioned we hope and expect to have our water legislation out on the floor uh a week from now and uh i think we're gonna have a vote today on another nominee out of our committee the nomination of brenda mallory who came out of committee on bipartisan vote and she's been nominated to be the chair of ceq and i understand that somebody told me earlier today that uh 13 past ceo and epa appointees 13 past republican ceo and epa appointees including a former ceq chair and four different republican epa administrators publicly phrased an urge to her confirmation they include bill reilly christine todd whitman michael levitt steve johnson and james cavanaugh and she's also been endorsed by i think since last we met by the us chamber of commerce so i would ask that y'all keep that in mind when when we vote later to to today i um might know in the senate uh i some of us i knew uh when i got here uh jen menhoff and i'd served together in the house um a couple of others that served to we did like uh job schumer and i dick durbin and i uh a number of us who served together and one of the people i did and one of the main things i decided early to do in this in the senate is to for the folks i never met didn't serve within the house didn't serve as governor i decided to spend just to go have a cup of coffee with them in their offices and so i'd ask one after the other after the other and make my rounds and one of the last people i asked this was a guy who sat right behind me on the senate floor his name's ted kennedy and i told him what i was doing getting to know people i didn't know and he said why don't you come to my hideaway we'll have lunch together i said really and he said yes two weeks later we were in his highway we had lunch together and one of the things i asked him uh ben was i said why is it always republicans why does all these republicans want to be your co-sponsor on your uh their big bills why is that and he said these words he said i'm always willing to compromise on policy never willing to compromise on principle think about always willing compromise and policy never willing to compromise on principles so i want to start this hearing thinking about um we're going to have to compromise on service transportation legislation as we go along with our colleagues on the committee and in the senate and in the house and with the administration but there's some principle i hope we can agree on that we won't go very far far away from and one of those is that roads highways and bridges in this country are in bad shape something needs to be done about it and we are among the most responsible people for making that happen the second principle is that climate change is real we need to combat it we need to adapt to it we need to build back better we need to focus on resilience with all the extreme weather that we're facing third principle will grade the things that are worth having are worth paying for some people describe me as a recovering governor i'm also a recovering state treasurer it was a treasure the state with the worst credit rate in the country when i was 29 years old and i've always believed the things that are worth having are worth paying for and the last principle i hope we can adhere to is those who use our roads our highways our bridges have a responsibility to help pay for them now there are in my state and i'm not sure but in your states but in my states there are a number of major pay fors for rhodes highways bridges gas and diesel tax vehicle registration sales taxes when people buy vehicles driver's licenses the 800-pound guerrilla forever has been a gas and diesel taxes for decades and but i would add to that the times uh are changing and um i i don't think uh center staff when i was here yet but uh guys about a dozen or so years ago sheena with the detroit auto show she was kind enough to introduce me to mary barrow who's i think just about to become ceo of gm and the one of the gm products that that year was selected i think is the car of the year it was a chevrolet volt volt chevrolet volt interested with a hybrid um got 38 miles on a charge 38 miles on a charge and after that you know your traditional hybrid yawn gasoline and but anyway it was the car car of the of the year that was then and i went out uh during the recess while we were on break with uh my oldest son and we went out to buy a vehicle to replace my 2001 chrysler town and country minivan which has almost 600 thousand miles on it and uh we drove among other things the chevrolet bolt it gets uh 300 miles on a charge we also drove a ford mustang it gets over 300 miles on a charge ford is about to put out an f-150 pickup truck all electric and uh i thought i'd never see the day that we'd have an electric f-150 truck but it's a top-selling vehicle in the country as you know gm says um they're not going to be uh uh selling building and selling any gas diesel private vehicles after 2035 they're going to phase them out ford is expected to match or better that tesla we drove some teslas uh during the break one of them's a y model it gets 350 miles on a charge uh there's another vehicle that uh that we took a look at that gets over 400 miles under charge and uh that's uh it's not not everybody's into uh electric uh we've got um folks at toyota have a whole division of their company that's uh called uh mirai that's japanese for future and they are focused on fuel cells fuel cells hydrogen and fuel cells the waste product that comes out of that combination is water the water you can drink gm and honda are partnering up on fuel cells as well and there's a south korean car company hyundai apparently has a whole division of their company that focuses on fuel cells use hydrogen and they're expected to use a lot of it in the years to come gas and diesel or revenues our traditional bread and butter for building roads highways bridges maintaining them are not going to dry up and go away overnight uh we're told that the average year number of years vehicle has on the road is about 15 years so we're going to be using gas and diesel for some time but buy less going forward i think with steven stills buffalo springfield who once uh saying that something's happening here just what is ain't exactly here clear um but uh i think it's becoming clear what's going on and we have the opportunity to get ahead of it or to get behind it we need to craft a transportation uh bill service transportation built that enables us to get in front of what's happening here and uh the question is what will the next generation of vehicles that are will they be built here will be designed here manufactured here sold here or they built other places around the world will he help us in the battle against the climate change or not and will we look uh this adversity in the face of climate change and all and instead of just finding despair find opportunity and my hope is that we will find opportunity and it will seize the day and part of that is figuring out how to uh build the service transportation system of the future in ways that affect resilience uh climate change and our need is to move ourselves and our goods around the country and the cost of a cost-effective safe and climate friendly ways so with that i would ask unanimous consent that my my written statement be uh be inserted for the record i welcome everybody again this is a i think enormously important enormously important hearing and will help us to see the future more clearly and be ready for it thank you

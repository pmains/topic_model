us colleagues the bipartisan infrastructure law created the protect program to fund projects that improve the resiliency of our service Transportation infrastructure I was proud to author language that added wildfires to the list of natural disasters relevant to resiliency Improvement Grants under the protect program made vegetation management practices and transportation rights of way eligible for grant funding and prioritizes resiliency Improvement Grants for addressing the vulnerabilities of surface Transportation assets with the high risk of failure due to the impacts of wildfires clearly something that's increasingly common in California as well as in your state mayor Romero so my question is to you as the Tucson region faces continued Wildfire threats why are the resources at the bipartisan infrastructure law provides essential to improving the resiliency of our service Transportation infrastructure from wildfires and other natural disasters and climate vulnerabilities thank you Senator Padilla and thank you for adding wildfires wildfires to the list of natural disasters in the protect program the City of Tucson benefits from having two incredible national parks on both the east side of our of our city and the West boundary of our city and we have beautiful mountain ranges surrounding our city we have seen wildfires in our mountain ranges and become dangerously close to to homes to Residents in our city at the same time we must address Wildland Urban interface issues including risk of fires floods and mudslides and their potential impacts on both private property and public infrastructure this is why the City of Tucson supports the inclusion of the protect program in the bil it will help ensure that our infrastructure can stand up to such events to protect Life Health and property um specifically in Tucson we have where Center for Logistics in our region we're 60 miles from the Mexican border we have rail we have air we have uh Interstate that connects our entire state from Tucson uh commercial activity and supply chain shipments moved through Tucson every hour um and therefore infrastructure failures in Tucson due to climate change can negatively impact National Economic and security interests so the cost of these failures can be significant so we need to make sure that we're putting that resiliency on our infrastructure so that we don't have to pay billions of dollars to repair we need to be able to protect beforehand yeah and I appreciate you uh highlighting the sort of supply chain impacts not just you know local geography you but once you're impacting supply chain and Logistics of goods movement addition to people's movement then we're all feeling it uh indirectly my next question is in the area of flexibility and delivering emergency relief projects under current regulations the Federal Highway Administration is allowed to begin clawing back emergency relief funding if projects do not initiate construction by the end of the second fiscal year following the year in which the disaster occurred now while states can apply for extensions provided in one-year increments for delays caused by the need for extensive environmental evaluation litigation or complex right-of-way acquisition the Federal Highway Administration has previously denied such requests for a number of projects to repair disaster damage uh to help ensure communities that are impacted by natural disasters have adequate time to utilize federal funds to repair their transportation infrastructure I led a bipartisan letter earlier this year urging dot to update emergency relief program regulations to extend the construction start deadline by two years question is actually for Mr timing why is this proposed update important to ensuring State Departments of Transportation have practical requirements and a reasonable period of time to carry out their significant and often complex projects to repair a transportation assets after a disaster well thank you for that question Senator we are hearing from several States and we've seen this over the last you know five to eight years that several states are getting into this situation where the post-disaster recovery is such a complex effort that they need additional time Beyond those two years to be able to uh be able to plan and permit the project in a way that makes them for the most sense for that specific situation so we certainly support your efforts to extend that timeline to four years we think that that's the best approach this two-year approach may have worked well 20 30 years ago but given the changing nature of how complex these recovery projects are given climate change and some of the other challenges that we're seeing I think an extension is is absolutely appropriate I do want to also mention uh take a moment to mention we really do appreciate your support for 3011 the uh the the the the legislation that would give States the flexibility to use arpa funds for transportation projects and to cover those cost increases associated with inflation so thank you for that I appreciate that acknowledgment I understand it came up earlier in the hearing and we're still trying to get it done thank you Mr chairman Senator thank you and

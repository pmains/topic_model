Mr President at the end of last week I joined several of my Republican colleagues to travel down to our Southern border it was my second visit to the Border during the bite Administration my third overall my first during the bite Administration was almost exactly two years ago after board and numbers started to soar in the wake of the president taking office and I have to say unfortunately little has changed since my last visit thanks the fact that President Biden spent the first two years of his presidency refusing to even acknowledge this crisis much less actually address it we are still facing a disastrous situation at our Southern border I talked to border patrol agents who spent two years dealing with record-breaking numbers of illegal immigrants and are still looking for support from the Biden Administration that never seems to come again and again border patrol agents told me that not only do they not feel supported by the Biden Administration they feel like the Biden Administration has actually impeded their ability to do their jobs just let us enforce the law One agent told me something that was echoed by other law enforcement officers that we spoke to and to give you just one example we heard from the individual in charge of the border for the State of Texas who told us that they have a number of panels for the congressionally mandated border wall that are ready to go into the ground the state of Texas in law enforcement Personnel would like to install these panels to help them stem the flood of illegal immigration at their own expense expense of the state of Texas but the bite Administration has so far refused to Grant the permissions needed to do that now I can only imagine how much harder the jobs will get when the bite Administration ends title 42 border policies coming up on May 11th I was also stunned to learn that that President Biden supposed borders are vice president Harris has never spoken to the borders are for the State of Texas or to the leadership of the border patrol down there that's right the person who is supposedly in charge of addressing the chaos at our Southern border has never spoken to the individual in charge of Border issues for the state that makes up the greatest portion of our Southern border or to the border patrol leadership in the state Mr President from his campaign on President Biden was fixated on distancing himself from the immigration policies of his predecessor and satisfying the open borders caucus that makes up a huge part of today's Democratic Party so much so that I in his first week in office or so he repealed somewhere on the order of 94. 94 executive policies of the previous administration with respect to the Border the moment he took office he set about dismantling those policies of the previous administration without apparently taking even a minute to think about what his actions or what effect his actions would have well we know now what effect they had President Biden's actions declared to the world that the United States borders were effectively open and we've seen two years of record-breaking illegal immigration as a result this President January President Biden finally and I say finally began to take some steps to address the crisis at our Southern border including re-establishing versions of some of the border security policies he did away with on taking office predictably even the mild steps he's taken have garnered criticism from open borders Democrats who apparently think that border security and Border enforcement are somehow uncompassionate well Mr President you know it's uncompassionate the kind of lacks border policies we've had over the past two years that have encouraged individuals to attempt to illegally cross our borders that encourage individuals to pay huge sums to dangerous individuals to cartels and Smugglers for a legal Passage that have exposed unaccompanied children to the hazards of extreme weather and criminal activity or exploitation by sponsors once they arrive in this country at least 853 people died attempting to cross our Southern border illegally in fiscal year 2022. the highest number ever recorded that's a lot of lives lost Mr President there's nothing compassionate about the policies that encourage them to attempt The Crossing Mr President I think many people think of those attempting to illegally cross our border as economically disadvantaged individuals from Mexico or Central America but the truth is that U.S Customs and Border Protection apprehends individuals at our Southern border from all over the world some from hostile countries one law enforcement official I spoke with said that the number of Chinese Nationals attempting to cross illegally in the real Grand Valley sector has increased by 488 percent year over year 488 percent now I have no doubt some of those were individuals merely hoping to relocate from communist China to a land of freedom but it's equally possible that some were hostile agents of the Chinese government and that's a serious security concern in fiscal year 2022 Customs and Border Protection apprehended 98 of individuals on the terrorist watch list attempting to cross our Southern border that's an average of one approximately every three or four days and that's just the individuals Customs and Border Protection managed to apprehend there have been at least 1.2 million known godaways which are individuals the border patrol saw but was unable to apprehend since President Biden took office that's in addition to the four almost 4.7 million 4.7 million people that they actually did apprehend trying to come across our Southern border since President Biden took office and it's more than possible that terrorists or agents of hostile Powers have been able to make their way into our country undetected while our border patrol agents have been struggling to deal with the record-breaking number of individuals coming across the border illegally Mr President the chaos that we've been experiencing at our Southern border is an invitation to dangerous individuals from terrorists to drug cartels our nation is currently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis which is largely being fueled by fentanyl traffic across our Southern border and I'd be very surprised if the flow of fentanyl into this country isn't being facilitated by the chaos at our border our current fentanyl crisis is also a good reminder that illegal activity at our Southern border affects every state in our country I've talked to sheriffs in South Dakota about as far from our Southern border as you can get who are dealing with fentanyl that has been trafficked across the border from Mexico last year Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead estimated that 90 percent 90 of Fentanyl and methamphetamine in our state state of South Dakota comes through Mexico and across our Southern border 90 percent as president every state is a border state and record-breaking floods of illegal immigration at our Southern border aren't just a problem for actual border states like Texas and Arizona they're a problem for every state in our country it was President for two years the byte Administration has been missing in action at our Southern border and well I'm glad that President Biden is finally at least half-heartedly acknowledging that we are facing a border crisis I want to see him follow through on actually enforcing our laws and doing what the border patrol agents are simply asking enforce our laws he has all the authority he needs to secure our border and he owes the American people nothing less Mr President I yield the floor

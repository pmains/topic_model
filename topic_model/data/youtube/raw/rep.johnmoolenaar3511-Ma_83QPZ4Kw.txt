gentleman from Michigan is recognized for two minutes like to thank the gentleman for Nebraska for yielding the time and Mr Speaker I also want to thank chairman Brady House Committee of ways and means and also congressman Paulson and congresswoman Nome and Congressman bloom an hour for co-sponsoring this bipartisan legislation I also like to thank the gentleman from Michigan for his comments this legislation today before the house HR 5452 will improve access to health savings accounts for Native Americans who choose to receive care at Indian Health Services facilities by ending an unnecessary penalty against them currently Native Americans are not allowed to contribute to their own health savings accounts for three months after receiving care at an indian health service facility these accounts can be a useful tool for families to cover the cost of deductibles co-payments and coinsurance however current policy prevents this ability for Native Americans in the three month waiting period limits their access to services that can help with treating high-risk health conditions this common-sense legislation eliminates the waiting period so Native Americans don't have to wait to save their hard-earned money to make their own healthcare choices and to receive treatment from Indian Health Service doctors today's legislation advances a bipartisan patient-centered solution to an unfortunate government created problem it will benefit all Native Americans who use hsas and I'm glad that we can eliminate this unfair federal penalty against them I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation and I yield back

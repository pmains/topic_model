well it's nice to see you and thank you everyone for just spending a few minutes with us here today i know you all have had an incredibly busy school year so far um really since march things have been totally upended um and you all have been doing a fantastic job at meeting the moment and ensuring that our kids can continue to receive a good education all across new hampshire so i just want to thank you for what you've done to look after the health safety and well-being of students and your fellow team members at your schools clearly this year presented a really unprecedented challenge and despite the years of experience of our educators and administrators there's really nothing in the professional training that would have prepared you for everything that you have faced since march no playbook for this there wasn't a binder on the shelf that you could just pull off and uh you know dust off and turn to to find the road map um you really had to create it while you move forward and our administrators our educators uh maybe more than any other profession had to fundamentally change how they operated nearly overnight to make sure that we had safe learning environments that remote and hybrid learning could be stood up um with limited resources um and so we have continued for a number of years to ask you all to do uh more with uh less at your disposal and certainly you have done that throughout this pandemic and i'm just so grateful for the job that you have all done um i think we owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude and we need to match that with action in washington that's going to provide the support we need here in new hampshire to make sure things can move forward in a way that um disruptions to our education environment and to learning is minimized as much as possible we did pass a major relief package recently that was signed into law by the president two days ago there are some important provisions in there including some money that's available for different educational programs but i think we need to continue to fight for the kind of direct support for states and municipalities that wasn't a part of that piece of legislation i'm worried about our budgets over the long term and making sure that our communities that are seeing a disruption in revenue right now that our state has the type of support we need from washington to make sure that critical services especially education can continue to move forward so that's something that i hope we can address in the new congress next year i think that we all were happy that a relief package finally got through and got signed into the law but it's not everything we hope for and we're going to need to continue to refine and redouble our efforts over time to make sure that we can weather this storm and ensure that our communities are strong and well equipped to deal with a whole range of issues including and especially uh taking care of our kids and making sure they have the resources they need to continue to learn and to continue to thrive um so with that i'd love to just open it up to a little bit of conversation and maybe you all could give me a little bit more of a sense of what you've been going through in your role um and uh then we can sort of have a little a bit of back and forth so maybe amy gene i can start with you and um if you just want to tell a little bit about what's been going on uh at your school um and uh you know how things have been going these last few months i think that would be really helpful

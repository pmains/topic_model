Thank You mr. speaker as a nation supporting our veterans must always be one of our highest priorities this pray these brave men and women who willingly and selflessly put their lives on the line while defending our country deserve the highest quality of life and care once they return home according to this Suffolk County Veterans Service Agency there are 80 3254 veterans who live in my home county of Suffolk with the highest population of veterans by County in New York State and one of the highest populations in the country there is a significant need for increased care options for our veterans in Suffolk there are so many options of quality care for veterans but too often their choices are limited quality care can also come at great expense in an effort to expand access to care for our veterans I recently introduced bipartisan legislation in Congress HR 2460 which would ensure that seventy percent or more service-connected disabled veterans are able to receive Adult Day Health Care a daily program for disabled veterans who need extra assistance and special attention in their day-to-day lives it comes at no cost to the veteran and their family because the program is defined as a reimbursable treatment option through the Department of Veterans Affairs this legislation has strong bipartisan support in Congress with over forty five co-sponsors including the entire Long Island congressional delegation my bill will greatly expand this great option of care for veterans on Long Island and across the country just last month on April twentieth 2016 the house Veterans Affairs Committee hosted a hearing of the Subcommittee on health regarding my bill and on April 29 2016 the health subcommittee held up a markup favorably forwarding my bill to the full committee for full consideration for for being sent to the House floor for a vote working with my colleagues in the house and various veterans service organizations I will continue pushing to get this bill passed out of committee and earnest to allow this bill to come to the house floor this year while serving the New York state Senate I secured the funding necessary to create the PFC joseph dwyer program a peer-to-peer support program for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury PFC dwyer from Mount Sinai New York served in Iraq and received nationwide recognition for a photograph that went viral showing him cradling a wounded iraqi boy while his unit was fighting its way up to the capital city of Baghdad sadly after returning home and struggling with PTSD PFC Dwyer died in 2008 created in his honor the Dwyer program was initially launched the counties of Suffolk Jefferson saratoga and Rensselaer since 2013 a program has expanded to over a dozen counties across New York earlier this year I introduced bipartisan legislation in Congress HR at 4513 that will expand the dwyer program on a national level so that every veteran in the US eventually has access to a peer-to-peer support group this bill has strong bipartisan support including the entire Long Island congressional delegation I will continue working together with them and others in the fight to expand into our program additionally on the east end of Long Island working closely with the Peconic Bay Medical Center in VA I secured an East End health care facility for veterans and their families at the conic bays manorville campus after so bravely serving our country this facility provides an important new option for veterans increasing access to care for those who live on Long Island's east end while still allowing them to continue receiving the services in ongoing treatment at the VA hospital in northport there's so much more that Congress can do to improve the quality of life for our veterans I will continue working to ensure that my bills that previously passed the house are signed into law including HR 1569 to protect the benefits of deceased veterans an HR 1187 which will eliminate the loan limit that the VA can guarantee for a veteran congress also must continue to reform the VA wherever it under serves a veteran a recent series of USA Today articles reported that VA supervisors in multiple states instructed employees to falsify wait times they must be held accountable this is a slap in the face of our vets just last year the house took a step forward by passing the VA accountability act of 2015 HR 1994 legislation I co-sponsor that would make important reforms to the VA system which will provide the necessary resources and flexibility the VA needs to hold poor performing employees accountable well I believe that the VA has 99% of employees generally caring about the work they do and wanting to help veterans we must always ensure that the other one percent of those who are not acting in the best interest of veterans are held accountable our veterans deserve only the highest quality of care at our VA facilities fighting for our veterans who fought for us always has been and will always be one of my top priorities now continue working in Congress to improve our veterans quality of care in any way that we can thank you and I'll yield back time

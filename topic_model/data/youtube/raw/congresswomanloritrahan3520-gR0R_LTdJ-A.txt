madam speaker i rise in full support of the equal rights amendment and to debunk some of the nonsense being spout spouted by my colleagues across the aisle this legislation is not about special rights it's not about preferential treatment and it's not about erasing sex differences it's about finally guaranteeing equal rights plain and simple critics of the era know that or at least they would if they actually read the legislation it's right there for all of us to see and i quote equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex period everyone in this capital has a mother and some of us are blessed to have daughters this amendment is about them it's about completing the work of generations of women before us who marched for full equality and it's about finishing that journey so that the next generation will experience another nothing other than full and fair rights under the law i urge my colleagues to give our daughters that chance join us and pass this resolution

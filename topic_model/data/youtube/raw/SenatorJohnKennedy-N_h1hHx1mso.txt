whoever is advising the president on crime and i don't know who it is but whoever it is his his secret service name ought to be butthead i mean why has chicago become the world's largest outdoor shooting range why is it safer to walk down the streets of mogadishu than new york city [Music] crime is not up as the president seemed to indicate today because of inadequate background checks crime is up because many not all but many members of the president's own party believe in defunding the police they ran on it and in many cities they've done it crime is up because many members of the president's own party want to turn cops into social workers crime is up because many members of the president's own party think all cops are racists including apparently the african-american police officers crime is up because many members of the president's own party think that when a cop shoots a criminal it's always the cops fault but when a criminal shoots a cop it's always the gun's fault now most people in america know that and we're not going to get in in control of this crime situation until we do three things until president bob does three things number one fund the police give them their money back number two let cops be cops let them do their job now if if if they misbehave if they don't follow the law punish them hold them accountable like we did with derek chovan but most cops follow the hall and number three we're going to have to do what mayor giuliani and mayor bloomberg did in new york city and we're going to have to do it in all the major primaries we're going to have to bring back stop question and frisk and apply it in a racially neutral manner it is perfectly legal it has been used for years chief justice earl warren wrote the opinion in 1968 a case called terryv ohio that says it is perfectly legal to stop question and frisk if you do it in a racially neutral manner and until we do though i mean this business of the confusion from the press conference and this business of background checks and i i mean it's just drivel and i think most americans know it let me let me ask as as you see crime in all of these cities and and you see uh for example we just had in new york an announcement that all the people that were involved in arson all the people involved in looting people we we have videotapes of them doing these committing these crimes none of them are going to be prosecuted you have defunding the police you have dismantling the police and you have no bail laws taking over in the country i don't know senator i'm just a simple guy i'm just a little talk show host i just don't see any of that ending well i like to ask people the question if we dismantle defund the police what are you going to do if god forbid somebody breaks into your home late at night senator i i'm pretty sure that you have a plan i know i have my plan uh i'm not going to be counting on other people to protect me in my life but most people don't have a plan and many people aren't capable of even even following up on a plan if they did have one well how can i put this you remember you remember how you felt you remember how people panicked when they couldn't find toilet paper imagine how they're going to feel when they can't find a cop and that's where that's where we're headed here this attitude among many not all but many of my democratic colleagues that we can we can have order without justice that we can have order without law enforcement uh is is nonsense i don't know where it came from um unfortunately i don't know why but there are people in this world they're not mixed up they're not confused they're they're not sick it's not a question of whether their mama or daddy loved them enough they're just anti-social and society's got to be protected and we've got to have cops to do it

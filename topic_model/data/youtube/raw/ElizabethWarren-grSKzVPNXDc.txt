the unemployment numbers are devastating more than 30 million Americans are out of work Food Pantry lines are stretching for miles more than 2,000 people are dying every single day and communities of color are especially hard here so here's something I want to make clear the point of staying home for two months was not just so that millions of people could lose their jobs it was Tobias time so that we could create a huge response to this crisis so where is it we need a real plan for widespread testing and once everyone is getting tested that's when we stand up a program to monitor who is actually sick and who needs to stay home it's called contact tracing and we're already doing in Massachusetts we need a manufacturing operation to make supplies for testing kits and no mr. president it is not just swabs that we need it's very sophisticated actually testing contact tracing public manufacturing these are health policies but they're also economic policies you don't just reopen an economy by tweet you reopen an economy with sound public health measures and once we have that we need to get serious about getting our economy back on track the last time the country saw unemployment numbers like this we had a president and a government with a plan that's what we need today starting with meaningful fast health to struggling families that means canceling student loan debt increasing Social Security payments extending unemployment benefits and protecting small businesses so they can keep people employed instead today we have leaders who treat this crisis as a public relations problem federal government rose to the challenge and this is a great success story when we're finished with the virus we will win we will win we can't just claim victory and hope that the virus magically disappears we need a government we'll do the work to keep Americans safe and secure and to build back an economy that will be resilient and work for everyone that's the leadership we need to elect in November and that's what I'll continue to fight for

hi Senator Mark Warner again reporting Saturday from Capitol Hill the fifth day I believe or fourth day of the impeachment trial we heard the opening comments from the president's lawyers today I'm anxious to hear what they'll have to say in there longer presentations they tried to present some of the counter arguments to what the house manager said came away with a couple of questions that one why did it dozen either Trump appointees or career old career civil servants literally put their jobs in jeopardy because they were so concerned about the tenor of the call between President Trump and President Solinsky from Ukraine and I don't think they've answered that again I want to hear from them on Monday and Tuesday I also want to hear if they're going to really put forward the proposition that it was Ukraine not Russia that somehow intervened in 2016 as somebody who spent a lot of time on that issue that's a really big rock to push up the mountain and in my mind at least and then I come away as well the president's lawyers has access to the president's closest advisors his chief of staff secretary of state other top political appointees of mr. Trump they have first-hand knowledge of what happened you if they could come in and swear and testify that the president did nothing wrong and there's here the explanations of the dozen that would counter the dozen trump appointees and career civil servants in terms of what the House Democrats presented that would be very valuable to me and I just don't understand why they're not willing to present those witnesses and unless those witnesses can't come in and take an oath and then testify in a way that would clear the president so I guess the good news is at least it's been fairly worn out at least last couple of days we get the rest of the afternoon off and tomorrow's Sunday off we'll all be back Monday I'm gonna be listening very closely to the president's lawyers then we're going to have question time again I hope when we've got you know I'm sure at the end of this whole process they'll still be outstanding questions and what again bothers me is that there are witnesses and other documents that could clear this up why shouldn't all of us and for that matter the American people get a chance to see those witnesses and see those documents for the rest have a great weekend and I'll see you back on Monday

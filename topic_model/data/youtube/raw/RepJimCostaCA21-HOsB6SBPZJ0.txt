Mr Speaker I rise today as a concerned American concerned because our country stands at a crossroads and foreign policy and history I might add in recent days we've seen this administration cynically abandoned our Kurdish allies in Northeast Syria and opened the door to a Turkish invasion these decisions were made without consulting our allies our distinguished diplomats and regional experts like ambassador Jeffrey's much damage has been done and yesterday President Putin and air Dewan have signed an agreement I believe that harms American interests in that part of the world hundreds of people have been killed tens and thousands have been displaced dangerous eisah prisoners who have been killing and wounding Americans are now on the loose threatening and increased international terrorist actions in Europe and the United States and this is a real threat turkey's actions have shown that to be a dangerous actor on the international stage but it's not the first time we must immediately impose meaningful sanctions to show our commitment to a stable international order and a rule of law and turkey must understand that clearly the international reputation of the United States has I think been deeply damaged as chairman of the transatlantic legislators' dialogue I know our European partners asked me all the time they asked me these days are we together do we share the same values of the rule of law of democratic freedoms the United States should never ever end up standing alone the past few days also reminds us of another injustice that must be rectified in 1915 the Ottoman Empire embarked upon a systematic deportation of one and a half million Armenians these innocent men and women children became the first first genocide in the 20th century yet as I stand here this morning the brutal atrocity has still not received official record by our government that it deserves and Turkey turkey outrageously continues to ignore the voices of the survivors and the descendants around the world many of these survivors settled in my district in the San Joaquin Valley where they've lived and where they've raised their children in the blessings of liberty and they've made it in the American Way but this is not justice the road to justice begins with full recognition of the Armenian people suffering both Turkey in the United States immediately should recognize that the Armenian Genocide occurred as the European Union has done I am proud to support House Resolution 296 which over the objections of Ankara would establish permanent US recognition and ongoing American remembrance of the Armenian Genocide that's the right thing to do I call upon my colleagues who have yet to publicly endorse this bipartisan resolution to join me with over 110 co-sponsors and calling for a long overdue passage by the United States House of Representatives mr. speaker the horrors of the Armenian Genocide can never ever be undone words alone cannot comfort those who suffered not dried tears of another mother who lost their children or grandmothers by acknowledging the suffering of the victims through the official recognition of the Armenian Genocide we can at least ensure that future generations will never ever forget this atrocity to mankind

Mr Speaker I rise today to thank starbucks and their new program called the upstanders series for recognizing Baldwin Community Schools and Baldwin and the Baldwin promise promise the upstander series was created by starbucks to showcase uplifting American stories I believe that Starbucks found a uniquely inspiring story to tell when they highlighted Baldwin Michigan Baldwin Community Schools was designated as a Michigan promise zone in 2009 meaning that every child who attended school in Baldwin has a tuition-free path to a college education earning this designation took commitment and sacrifice from the entire Baldwin community in order to be designated the village of Baldwin had to privately fundraise over a hundred thousand dollars well Baldwin looked within for those donations and even though cated in the Lake County the 22nd poorest County in the nation and where more than twenty-four percent of the residents live below the poverty level they not only hit their goal they exceeded their goal in fact they raised more than a hundred and sixty thousand dollars than what the goal had been the people of Baldwin and their commitment to the community and one another and more importantly future generations truly is exemplified by this story and I'd like to thank starbucks again for what they have done to highlight that this is really what community and West Michigan is all about I want to thank them again for creating this series and then recognizing Baldwin and sharing that story with the nation and with that I yield back

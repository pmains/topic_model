meantime wesley you've been spending the last few weeks visiting oil and gas companies across the country to discuss the challenges these companies and the industry are facing under joe biden yet here's what he said yesterday about quote unquote the transition on gas listen and when it comes to the gas crisis uh we're going through an incredible transition that is taking place that god willing when it's over we'll be stronger and the world will be stronger unless we lie in on fossil fuels when this is over wesley what was your reaction and your reaction for the average american who's struggling right now to just fill up their tank when joe biden says the pain at the pump we're all feeling is an incredible transition well he's got his words wrong it's not about energy transition it's about energy addition i've been traveling all over texas i've been in the permian basin i've been in midland i visited new mexico or we're going to go to pennsylvania we're also going to go to the midwest and look at some biodiesel in iowa look the bottom line is this it's an all hands on deck approach to fulfill the energy needs of this country and what i am seeing from all the brave men and women across this country that provide energy for us every single day that allow us to put gas in our cars that allows to turn our lights on that allow us to stay cool in this texas heat that's crazy right now is because they sacrifice every single day for us to be able to have it we need more of them and this administration is trying to kill our industry but we are not going to allow that to happen

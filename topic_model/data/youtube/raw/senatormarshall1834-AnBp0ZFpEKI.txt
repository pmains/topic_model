president biden's runaway train of spending is just getting started after a two trillion dollar covid relief bill he's now looking to spend another two trillion dollars on infrastructure how do we slow down this wild spending how do we deal with a crisis unfolding at the border want to bring in kansas senator roger marshall to discuss he joins us live good afternoon to you senator thank you so much for taking the time to join us you know i want to talk to you specifically starting a little bit uh with this spending because look as i was telling our four members of congress before the war in afghanistan the war in iraq that was less than the over four trillion dollars we spent under president trump to deal with the response to covet now we're spending another two trillion for president bailey now he's opposing another two trillion on top of that you know at some point people do realize this money has to get paid back one way or another right joe so first of all this is the grab your wallet tax bill they're using the label infrastructure but there's very little infrastructure in there just for instance there's only about 110 billion dollars for traditional roads and bridges 110 billion but there's 170 billion for electric car chargers so we're going to spend 70 percent more on car generators they're going to put a car generate electric car generator on every street corner they want to put a wind turbine in every backyard and a solar panel on every rooftop so this really should be labeled the grab your wallet green new deal uh so little bits of infrastructure so it's a it's a it's a misnomer and just very sad for our for our country's future well really i'm glad you touched on that we're going to talk about this little later in the show but you know it seems as if the big ideas for president biden is to kind of retrofit yesterday's solutions and hope that they'll work in the future you talked about you know where the money is being spending in this infrastructure build that has very little infrastructure in it the same way we had a covet build that had very little covid in it how do we get people to understand that the objective is not always as important as the actual methods because even if you look at something like our railway infrastructure uh you've got high-speed rail in china you've got high-speed rail in japan and in america we have an amtrak accela that just skips some stops the average speed being somewhere around 65 miles an hour when we could be having people get from places like south dakota to texas in the matter of a matter of hours or minutes talk to us a little bit about how we need to have a 21st century looking infrastructure plan and that is not what's occurring right now right so if we're going to borrow another 2 trillion dollars from our grandchildren what's the best way to spend it that's the way i look at most every problem is is how it's going to impact my grandchildren i'm more interested in that than i am what the twitter feed is going to say after we finish this particular show so what are the long-term solutions that we need for this country and you know you're starting to describe them certainly we need our roads and bridges updated high-speed internet is going to be very important for future generations i'm all for investing money in that some type of a of a transportation project that's going to get people from from houston to los angeles from houston uh to to great bend kansas i'm all for those types of things as well got to figure out how to pay for them and keep prioritizing them as well but what we what won't work is if we keep moving our policy towards a green new deal that's unaffordable it's going to drive the price of gasoline at the pump that's going to drive up the cost of of electricity for folks trying to heat their houses as well so um we got to keep our eye on the ball they're going to keep coming up with these misnomers america's going to have to look and see what's actually in the bill i want to shift our eyes down to the southern border obviously the by the administration and their allies in the media keep trying to find ways to lay the burdens of the crisis at the feet of president trump meanwhile we've seen a three-fold increase of children in detention centers we've seen border crossings go from around 36 000 in february of last year over to over a hundred thousand uh in february reported those numbers that we have how do you know what hope do we have number one at actually staunching some of the bleeding that's happening at the border and then two finding some type of bipartisan agreement to make sure that we can secure the border and also deal with the immigration crisis that has plagued this nation for far too long well certainly that's up in many ways to what the president and leadership on the democrat side wants to do for for me it all starts with securing the border we've had legislation on the house floor twice we voted on legislation uh 25 billion dollars for president trump's securing the border as well as fixing a legal make we want to make sure we have legal merit-based immigration so we've seen what that legislation looks like but the democrats want this problem they're not even willing to recognize that there's a crisis right now by all measures the situation today three to five times worse than it ever was during president trump but they're not going to call it a crisis yet but i've been to the border three times this is a humanitarian crisis it's a health crisis it's a national security crisis so it starts with recognizing that there's a challenge that there is indeed a crisis there and it's also any type of long-term solution we need border security right so it's so frustrating to fly over the river and see these miles and miles of wall that's been built but still in in many cases there's a gate that needs to be placed there yet about every you know 20 30 miles there's a big gate and what we're seeing is people are being paid to quit working so someone from the federal government has asked the general contractors to stop working money that's been appropriated to finish the wall is not being used so you know to answer your question is i think that that we need the democrats to need to agree that border security is part of the solution here now to that point you know the senate used to be what people called the most deliberative body on the planet uh now it seems as if we're getting closer and closer to that type of food fight you would find in the house you know how do we just get back to the senate being in a place where we can call balls and strikes where we can deal with the priorities of the nation that are maybe in some ways disjoint from the politics that keep us divided you know what do we need to do to deal with this humanitarian crisis we have at the border the security crisis that we have at the border but also all of the things that are facing the american people right now to ensure that they know uh that they were taking care of our number one priority which is to keep the american people safe in their homes right so you know president biden campaigned on on having a moderate policy but instead all we've seen come out of his administration is an extreme radical socialist policy right so i think when you're farting when you're starting so far to the left it's hard to find some spot in the middle that you can work towards um i i just think that the what the president what president biden and his folks don't realize is they do not represent majority values that i still think the super majority of americans want a secure border they want election integrity uh they want their second amendment we want our god-given rights uh protected and our constitutional rights protected as well so i think somehow we they got to start a little bit closer to the middle for us to be able to even have this conversation uh and so far there's just been nothing no one has reached out from the president's office or from from senator schumer's office over the republicans to say hey give us some input typically uh you know we got what four trillion dollars of infra of a covered relief done on a bipartisan basis we've done infrastructure legislation in the past on a bipartisan basis but so far really no one's reaching across the aisle and to some extent it depends on the majority majority of folks to reach across the aisle to the minority one more reason but we need the filibuster is to force the majority party to reach out and work with the minority for long-term solutions well to that point you talk about things that all americans should be able to agree on most americans you ask them today they want children back in school most experts when you talk about is it safe for our children to be in the schools all the experts across the board seem to be in alignment of the fact that the school is actually one of the safest places for children to be during covet whether you're talking about the increase in suicide rates where they're talking about the low rates of transmission all of those things lead us to making sure we want to have kids in school democrats basically fought tooth and nail to prevent us from having any clawbacks in that covid bill that would have made sure that states that took money had an obligation to open the doors to the schoolhouses you know how do we in spite of that make sure that we're providing our children with the education they need when the data shows us that virtual learning has left many children far far behind yeah joe young all those are great points you know number one is we're going to lose more children and youth from suicide from overdoses then die from the covet virus and that mental health crisis that has been created by shutting down the economy and by shutting down our schools and really we knew this back in april and may of last year and i was talking about it then uh so it's so it's not surprising it's very frustrating i think for all practical purposes the seasonal flu is worse on on youth than than this particular viruses as well so there's really no excuse now there's no excuse at all and let me just pause and say thanks to all the teachers that did get out there and then have had our students back in school i know my community colleges across the state of kansas all of their students have been in person this semester and i think at this point i can say that every school district in the state of kansas majority of those kids are back in school as well uh we're almost to herd immunity i really i've been predicting since thanksgiving time we have heard immunity probably by april or may and i think we're going to make it so we need to keep investing in schools education is the great equalizer of opportunity i still believe in this country that that anybody can be anything that they want to be i'm a first generation college kid that's got to live the american dream and education is one of the pillars and the basis for that american dream absolutely it is that silver bullet that allows people to have that better outcomes than the previous generation senator roger marshall thank you so much for joining us sir god bless we'll talk to you soon thank you

Thank You mr. speaker I grew up in a small town and in Kansas and perhaps the most respected person in the city was our family physician dr. Norman over Overholser dr. Overholser had delivered my brother my sister and of course me he'd saved my life he'd saved many people's lives by the time I was in ninth grade I knew I wanted to be a just like dr. Overholser I worked hard and with the support of my family and friends was able to get into Medical School by the time I was a second-year resident I was supposed to decide what type of position was I going to be go back to February of 1987 and our if we had our first baby a little girl named Lauren and the second she was born the moment I heard her first cry I said this is what I want to do I want to deliver babies the rest of my life so as an obstetrician for the next 30 years every day I got to see 10 20 40 sometimes 50 pregnant women it was a great experience and there was some very special visits that I really looked forward to those with those moms their first visit for a first-time mom was always a special moment the moms came in they had a twinkle in their eyes and they may have been throwing up for three or four or five days already but there was still a sparkle in their eye and excitement and sometimes I would get to do a sonogram at that first visit and believe it or not about a month after conception you can see a baby's heartbeat they would come back at about 12 weeks for their for their next visit and by then there nazia was improving and we could hear a baby's heartbeat on the Doppler for the first time they came back again at about 18 weeks and I would ask him do you feel the baby move yet and again the moms eyes would Sparkle that they're feeling that baby move and I would notice when I would touch the mom when I would touch the baby the baby would push back and if there is maybe a brother or sister in the room but that brother or sister spoke I could feel the baby move I could I could actually hear the heart rate increase of that little baby inside that mom and then of course later on the favorite moment of my entire life was always getting here that first cry of that newborn and give that baby to a proud mom and dad so those are great times mr. speaker I'm often asked when when do I think life begins and I hope you can relate to the stories I just shared that I don't have any other choice but to believe that life begins at conception and that those babies are people and they deserve our respect and our protection mr. speaker this week we'll be welcoming 200,000 people to Washington DC in the March for life and I want to especially salute some students that are coming from Beloit Kansas and Concordia Kansas like many students they'll be riding a bus for 24 hours and I'm so proud of them I look forward to seeing them and just appreciate their efforts and putting their actions their words into actions mr. speaker is a doctor of over 25 years I've delivered thousands of babies and I certainly understand the responsibility I have as a member of Congress to protect the life of the unborn in the last two years this house thanks to a Republican majority has passed countless bills to limit abortion in taxpayer subsidized abortion and prohibit abortions of unborn babies over 20 weeks unfortunately these bills never made it to the President's desk today the United States is one of seven countries in the world one of seven countries in the world that allow babies old enough to feel pain and survive outside the womb to be torn limb to limb the list of seven includes China North Korea Singapore Vietnam and a list of other human rights offenders at our nation this country should not be proud to be part of each year more than 600,000 abortions are performed across this country costing our country precious lives the fact is only one in seven Americans one in seven Americans support legal under all circumstances Roe vs. Wade and still Congress refuses to act over the course of my first term I made it a top priority to fight for those who can't fight for themselves and I'll continue to do so abortions are an injustice to the unborn and are a complete disregard for life Congress should prevent taxpayer money from ever being funneled into or immoral organizations like Planned Parenthood and finally put an end to abortion I will unpoliced and with the children with these babies who do not have a voice of their own to fight I yield back

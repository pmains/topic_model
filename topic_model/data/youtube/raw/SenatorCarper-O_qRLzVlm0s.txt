NOT. MR. CARPER: MADAM PRESIDENT, GOOD AFTERNOON. I RISE THIS AFTERNOON TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING TODAY, INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022. A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS THAT THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT REACHED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS LEGISLATION, I COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF RELIEF AND OF JOY, AND I AM NOT ALONE IN FEELING THAT WAY. I FELT RELIEF IN KNOWING THAT AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND YEARS OF HARD WORK FROM VOLUNTEERS, FROM ACTIVIST, FROM POLICY EXPERTS, FROM LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY AND SO MANY OTHERS WE FINALLY HAD BROKEN THE LOGJAM ON MAJOR CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY LEGISLATION. I FELT JOY IN KNOWING THAT WE WERE ONE STEP CLOSER TO DELIVERING A MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ONE THAT WILL HELP REDUCE INFLATION AND CREATE GOOD-PAYING JOBS AT THE SAME TIME. MY BELIEF IS THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS AN ANSWER TO OUR PRAYERS FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE, FOR OUR NATION, AND FOR OUR PLANET, AND I MIGHT SAY A LOT OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SITTING UP HERE, WE HAVE A BUNCH OF OUR PAGES THAT ARE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THEY ARE FOR THE MOST PART RISING JUNIORS AND SENIORS, AND THEY REPRESENT -- THEY REMIND ME A LOT OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN IN MY FAMILY. AND FOR FOLKS, A LOT OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND THIS IS FOR YOU. THIS IS FOR YOUR GENERATION. THIS IS ABOUT KIDS, OUR GRANDCHILDREN, OUR NIECES, OUR NEPHEWS. THIS IS FOR YOU. AFTER ENDURING A DEADLY GLOBAL PANDEMIC FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND RESULTING THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURBULENCE FLOWING FROM IT, THE TRUTH IS THAT FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING. THEY ARE HURTING FROM THE HIGH COST OF HEALTH CARE. THEY ARE HURTING FROM RISING LIVING EXPENSES AND ENERGY BILLS. AND THEY ARE HURTING FROM EXTREME WEATHER THAT'S COSTING US IN TERMS OF DOLLARS AND OF LIVES. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEAR WHEN I TRAVEL HOME TO DELAWARE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT. I DON'T LIVE HERE. I LIVE IN DELAWARE. GO BACK AND FORTH ON THE TRAIN. A LOT LIKE A GUY NAMED BIDEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR. AND NOW ALONG WITH SENATOR CHRIS COONS AND -- WHETHER IT'S A SENIOR ON A FIXED INCOME WHO IS STRUGGLING WITH THE COST OF LIFESAVING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR THE YOUNG PERSON LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S PRONE TO FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS, MANY DELAWAREANS OF ALLAGES ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. THEY ARE PLEADING WITH -- OF ALL AGES ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE AND ARE PLEADING WITH US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SCIENTISTS ARE PLEADING WITH US TOO BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. FOR YEARS THEY WARNED US TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO SWITCH TO FOSSIL FUELS TO AVOID A FUTURE OF UNRELENTING EXTREME WEATHER. NOW SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US IT'S COAD RED FOR HUMANITY AND FOR OUR PLANET. WE'RE ALREADY EXPERIENCING A CLIMATE CRISIS FOR AMERICANS IN COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL, FEELING ITS IMPACT. MOST NOTABLY IN THE FORM OF EXTREME HEAT, WILDFIRES, AND FLOODS. AS I SPEAK HERE TODAY, NEARLY 100 MILLION AMERICANS FROM TEXAS TO MAINE ARE UNDER HEAT ADVISORIES, A HUNDRED MILLION. THERE ARE ALSO MORE THAN 50 WILDFIRES RAINING ACROSS THE WEST BURNING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES IN STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA AND MONTANA AND IDAHO AND ALASKA. JUST LAST WEEK CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODS IN EASTERN KENTUCKY, NOT FAR FROM WHERE MY MOP SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HER LIFE -- MOM SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HER LIFE. THOSE FLOODS HAVE TRAGICALLY CLAIMED 37 LIVES. WE KNOW THAT THESE DEADLY EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WILL ONLY GET WORSE IN THE YEARS AHEAD WITHOUT COORDINATED ACTION, WITHOUT COORDINATED ACTION. AND WE KNOW THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WILL SUFFICIENT THE MOST IF WE FAIL TO ACT. THE BEST SCIENCE AVAILABLE TELLS US THAT TO AVOID THE WORST IMPACTS OF GLOBAL WARMING, WE MUST ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT'S REFERRED TO AS NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN THE YEAR 2050. ACHIEVING THIS WILL NOT BE EASY. BUT IT IS ACHIEVABLE. AND I AM BY NATURE, AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL TELL YOU, I AM BY NATURE AN OPTIMIST. I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. AND OUT OF GREAT ADVERSITY COMES GREAT OPPORTUNITY. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF ALBERT EINSTEIN. HUGE ADVERSITY HERE. ALSO GREAT OPPORTUNITY. AND I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF PASSING GREAT LEGISLATION THAT WILL CHANNEL AMERICAN INGENUITY TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS, LOWER COSTS FOR FAMILIES, AND FIGHT INFLATION. NOW, HOW WILL IT DO ALL THAT? THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT INCLUDES NEARLY $370 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY PROVISIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, IT WILL BE THE MOST AMBITIOUS CLIMATE LEGISLATION TO EVER EMERGE FROM THIS BODY. AND IT DOES SO BY NOT RAISING TAXES ON PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME IS UNDER $400,000, FAMILIES UNDER $400,000. AND IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT IS NOT INFLATIONARY AND THAT IS FULLY PAID FOR AND OFFSET. WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE OF THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL CLIMATE LEGISLATION? WELL, ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS FROM ENERGY INNER VISION, SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE WHO WORK ON ISSUES LIKE THIS, ACCORDING TO THEIR ANALYSIS, PARTS OF THIS LEGISLATION WILL REDUCE NET GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY A LITTLE BIT OVER 40% BY 2030. AND AS PRESIDENT BIDEN MIGHT SAY, THAT'S A VERY BIG DEAL. HE MIGHT SAY IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. THIS LEGISLATION ALONG WITH ACTION FROM EXECUTIVE AGENCIES AND STATE AND LOCAL ACTORS WILL PUT US WITHIN REACH OF OUR -- MEETING OUR NATIONAL TARGET OF CUTTING EMISSIONS IN HALF BY THE END OF THIS DECADE. IN ADDITION TO SLASHING EMISSIONS FROM -- ACROSS OUR ECONOMY, THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALSO UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL OF AMERICAN CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY AND CREATE GOOD-PAYING JOBS THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY. IN FACT, IT WILL CREATE A TON OF JOBS. ANALYSIS FROM THE POLITICAL ECONOMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST PROJECTS THAT THIS LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE DEBATING WILL HELP CREATE NINE MILLION JOBS OVER THE NEXT DECADE, NINE MILLION OVER THE NEXT DEDUCTED.  -- OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE BENEFITS AREN'T JUST LIMITED TO EMISSIONS REDUCTION AND JOB CREATION. AS THE NAME OF SUGGESTS, THIS LEGISLATION WILL FIGHT INFLATION, LOWER COSTS FOR MANY AMERICANS. AGAIN, ASK HOW? FOR STARTERS, THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WILL HELP HOMEOWNERS STAVE UP TO $220 ON ELECTRICITY COSTS. ACCORDING TO AN ANALYSIS BY THE RESORRIESES FOR THE FUTURE -- RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE. THIS LEGISLATION ALSO INCLUDES HUGE HEALTH CARE SAVINGS FOR FAMILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, ON AVERAGE MEDIAN-INCOME FAMILIES WILL SAVE UPWARDS OF $1,000 ANNUALLY. $1,R POCKETS. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT OUR SENIORS DON'T FACE FINANCIAL RUIN PAYING FOR LIFESAVING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS T DOES SO BY CAPPING PATIENTS' OUT-OF-POCKET CAPITOLS IN THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AT $2,000 PER YEAR. THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WILL HELP STRENGTHEN OUR TAX SYSTEM TO BEST ENSURE THAT EVERYONE PAYS THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE GOT DECENT CONSTITUENT SERVICES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. I DON'T CARE WHETHER IT IS MINNESOTA, DELAWARE, SYSTEM OTHER PLACE, THE IRS JUST HASN'T HAD THE RESOURCES, PEOPLE, THE TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE GOOD CONSTITUENT SERVICE. WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO GET THEIR RETURNS FROM LAST YEAR AND THEIR REFUNDS FROM LAST YEAR. THAT'S JUST TOTAL LIT UNACCEPTABLE. OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS WE'VE REDUCED BY A QUARTER THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO SERVE PEOPLE THROUGH THE IRS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE PROGRAMS IN THIS BILL WILL HELP CREATE JOBS, LOWER COSTS FOR MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES AND FIGHT INFLATION, ALL WHILE ADDRESSING THE EMINENT THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND DOING SO IN A WAY THAT LEAVES NO COMMUNITY BEHIND. IT'S PROOF THAT WE CAN DO WE WILL AND DO GOOD AT THE SAME TIME. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ENVIRONMENT APPEARED PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD 0 OUR $41 BILLION TITLE PRIORITIZES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS ENSURES THAT ALL COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BENEFIT FROM OUR FUNDING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND REDUCE AIR POLLUTION WHERE THEY LIVE, WHERE THEY LIVE. AS PART OF THAT COMMITMENT, WE PROVIDE $27 BILLION FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY TO CREATE A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AND IT WILL HELP LEVERAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN PROJECTS THAT COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. WITH OVER 40% OF THESE UPVESTMENTS GOING TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE CLIMATE IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE HUGE. REMOVING THE EQUIVALENT OF SOME 15 MILLION GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES FROM OUR ROADS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. WE ALSO PROVIDE $3 BILLION IN COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO STATES, TRIBES, AND MUNICIPALITIES AND TO COMMUNITY-BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS FOR FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS CLEAN AIR ANDEMPT POLLUTION IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. OUR E.P.W. TITLE ALSO PROVIDES SOME $3 BILLION TO HOPE REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS FLOWING FROM OUR NATION'S PORTS. DOING SO NOT ONLY CLEANS UP THE AIR IN NEARBY COMMUNITIES. WE PROVIDE MONEY TO REPLACE POLLUTION-EMITTING VEHICLES WITH ZERO -- SAVE ON THEIR ENERGY COSTS. I WISH I COULD DISCUSS THIS AFTERNOON EVERY PROGRAM IN OUR TITLE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, LET ME SHARE WORDS ON ONE PROGRAM. OUR FIRST EVER METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAM TO REIN IN EXCESS METHANE PROSTITUTION FROM THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. WHY DID WE CREATE A PROGRAM TO REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS? WHY WAS THIS IMPORTANT? METHANE IS MORE THAN 80 TIMES MORE POTENT THAN CARBON DIOXIDE AS A GREENHOUSE GAS. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN. METHANE IS MORE THAN 80 TIMES MORE POTENT THAN CARBON DIOXIDE AS A GREENHOUSE GAS. THERE'S GUY WHO USED TO BE A BANK ROBBER BACK IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION. MY FRIEND FROM IOWA PROBABLY REMEMBERS WILLIE SUTTON. NOT PERSONALLY. BUT HE ROBBED A LOT OF BANKS BACK IN THOSE DAYS. HE FINALLY GOT CUT. STANDING BEFORE THE JUDGE, JUNK SAID, MR. SUTTON, WHY DO YOU ROB BANKS? HE RESPONDED FAMOUSLY, THAT'S WHERE MONEY IS JULY. WELL, THERE'S HUGE REMISSIONS. THEY OUGHT TO BE CAPTURED, THEY CAN BE CAPTURED AND THE FUNDING WE OFFER HERE WILL HELP THAT TO HAPPEN. WE DESIGN THIS COMMONSENSE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE $110 I 5 BILLION TO HELP BUSINESSES INVEST IN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TO REH. REDUCE POTENT METHANE EMISSIONS. IT RAMPS UP YOU A FEE OVER TIME FOR EMITTERS THAT FAIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ASSISTANCE. ALL TOLD WE EXPECT TO RAISE ABOUT $6.5 BILLION -- THAT'S BILLIONS WITH A B, TO OFFSET THE COST OF OTHER CLIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN THE TITLE OF IT OUR COMMITTEE'S BILL. YEARS FROM NOW, YEARS FROM NOW FOLKS ARE GOING TO GATHER HERE ON THIS CHAMBER AND THEY'LL LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE HAD BEFORE US, WHAT WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH AND WHETHER OR NOT WE MADE A DIFFERENCE. I HOPE THEY WILL JUDGE US FAVORABLY. LET ME JUST SAY IN CLOSING, MADAM PRESIDENT, TWO WEEKS AGO IN -- ENGLAND, REPORTED A TEMPERATURE OF 105 DEGREES. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE AIR CONDITIONING IN MOST PLACES IN ENGLAND. THE TEMPERATURE THERE, 105 DEGREES. AND THE SAME WEEK THAT THE TEMPERATURES ARE 105 DEGREES, FOLKS ARE TRYING TO RUN -- WHAT IS IT? -- A BICYCLE EVENT, THE FRENCH BICYCLE EVENT THAT'S SO FAMOUS. AND THEY COULD NOT RUN PARTS OF IT BECAUSE THE PAVEMENT WAS MELTING AND THEY HAD TO PUT TONS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WATER ON THE ROAD SO THEY COULD RUN THE FRENCH BICYCLE RACE. DOWN IN LOUISIANA, I'LL CLOSE WITH THIS. IN LOUISIANA, THEY HAVE PROBLEMS, THEY HAVE CHALLENGES FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. HOW SERIOUS ARE THEY? WELL, EVERY SIX -- OR EVERY 100 MINUTES IN LOUISIANA, THEY LOSE A PIECE OF LAND TO THE OCEAN FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. EVERY 100 MINUTES, THEY LOSE A PIECE OF LAND THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD. THIS WEEK WE'RE SEEING INCREDIBLE HEAT, INCREDIBLE DROUGHT FROM THE WEST COAST TO THE EAST COAST, PEOPLE SUFFERING, SUFFERING IN SOME CASES INJURY AND DEATH, AND WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WITH THIS LEGISLATION. AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT A LOT OF FOLKS WHO NEED JOBS IN THE YEARS TO COME WILL HAVE A GOOD-PAYING

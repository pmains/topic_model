i've been writing a lot of notes and the first thing i want to say in response to the question earlier about um the emissions of ships bringing natural gas from russia to the northeast rather than piping it from pennsylvania let me just tell you um this gets to the heart of one of your issues mr eberhard and that is um let's produce more american natural gas and american energy because according to the national uh energy technology labs at the department of energy they're according to their data vladimir putin's or natural gas emits about 50 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than american natural gas if we did nothing but displaced russia's natural gas with america's we'd be doing a lot for workers a lot for our country and a lot for reducing greenhouse gas emissions secondly i want to get to this issue the the real issue of the moment and that is the cost of climate change overreaction which i think leads to cut stems from from the first point chairman brown talked about the the awful ceos of american companies that are making record profits if the price signals coming from the administration and from liberals in charge of this place were different if they were different wouldn't those profits instead be investments in creating jobs and cleaner energy here in the united states mr eberhard uh uh absolutely senator so uh you know in your your first point about the russian natural gas i just like to add that the carbon intensity of oil from venezuela is twice what it is from american oil and there's you know various other countries like that the carbon intensity from the u.s oil is lower than nearly anywhere else in the world so again um you know in addition to the environmental costs and the the transportation costs the carbon intensity is lower so if the ultimate if the ultimate goal is to reduce carbon intensity and we're gonna you have the energy demand anyway we're not gonna affect supply or we're gonna we're not gonna affect energy we're gonna affect supply we wanna use american energy first anyway uh secondly to your point i think that you know we want more investment in america we want more jobs in america and we do it better cleaner safer and it's closer so to me the logic would just dictate to you know focus on doing the best we can with the natural resources we have in america and trying to do it in the cleanest way possible center well let me follow up then with with this question um [Music] because chairman brown also in his in his opening statement referenced if america doesn't lead china will to which i say exactly that's my concern and so if we don't lead is china then if we lead with with sec regulations for example that further burden american energy are we to assume that china is going to also increase their regulate regulatory scheme or is russia going to increase its regulatory scheme so that they can you know follow the lead of the united states of america i mean does that is that how global markets work absolutely not senator and i think to think that would be naive look all this esg investment scoring whatever we're we're handicapping the international competitiveness of american companies and i and i think it's still advised look these companies in charge they don't have an esg score that's going to negatively impact their banking relationship their relationship with the government or anything you know china iran saudi arabia venezuela these companies care about or these countries care about profits and they care about bringing in hard currency they don't care one iota about the environmental impact of what they're doing nor do they care about what it does to you know what it does to their local consumers we have higher standards in america and we have a better outlook on on balancing the environmental damage and the environmental cost with the jobs and the economy of what we're doing again the only country even close to the same standards as us as canada places that you mentioned senator have absolutely no incentive to focus on the environment while extracting the natural resources since we're talking about discrepancy of standards mr butterworth do you think that the workers in china and the workers in russia are treated this as well as workers in the united states i'd have to look at their agreement that's a joke no really i i can't answer that but um i know i know we follow we follow uh agreements and uh uh our folks are treated well here in this country well then let me help you the labor standards in russia and the labor standards in china are not as good as the labor standards in the united states of america so i i'm for an all the above like many have said um and i'm for an america first not an america only but an america first agenda that takes care of workers and the environment and i think we do it better than anybody thank you mr chairman thank you senator kramer thank you for taking notes for my opening statement it's a whole new concept

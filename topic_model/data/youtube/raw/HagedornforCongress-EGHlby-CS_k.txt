it is a pleasure to be here I'm excited to be here tonight because this a lot we've been working for several years now moving this ray forward I love talking about the issues senator Nelson thank you for running thank you for being here I look forward to a spirited debate on the issues and the things to come as you might remember now last race in 2016 we were close forty-nine point six percent of the vote we were so close that if only 61 people in each of the 21 counties flipped from Tim to Jim we went and I found Washington helping promote our conservative solutions that we believe in and there wasn't meant to be but in spite of the fact that we ran so close we didn't quite make it to what happened you know we decided that about a year ago and that's when this election started was a year ago for 2018 they said you know what we're gonna keep going just like John Klein up in the second District we're going to go three in a row Colin Petersen up in the seventh we're gonna go forward a robe Newt Gingrich and so we kept at it because we thought walls we have walls in our sight and lo and behold guess what happened Dib decided he was going to leave the race to go run for governor we feel pretty good about elbowing him out of the way of making this the best Republican takeover opportunity in the country now what's happened since then that puts us in even even stronger position to win this seat well first and foremost walls is out the Democrats have lost their advantage of incumbency and many of those advantages flip to our campaign because we've been working the district for four years now so name ID connections things like that experience with debates we're in a very good spot you know what else is different we've raised over $400,000 thus far with a quarter million in the bank that's a lot different because we only spent 350 last time and then it comes to unify the Republican Party and that's what we've been doing we have endorsements at the highest level of government people like Tom Emmer the National Republican Congressional Committee Deputy Chair in in isola prominent icons like Rudy Boschwitz Congressman Gill glutamic who used to hold the seat state senators and others across the district state act and activist just like you and we appreciate all this books us in a position to win the seat and why is that so important well the Democrats are out there seven of them and they're running around front liberal each other they want to resist the president replace the president offers a great contrast with my campaign the purpose for my running for Congress folks is this I want to be a conservative reinforcement in the US House of Representatives led by the Republicans to partner with our president to make the big changes necessary to keep moving our nation in this right direction keep America safe to make America prosperous to protect our god-given rights to sustain agriculture in our southern Minnesota way of life I stand for positions along the line many of them will talk about those solutions tonight I look forward to a spirited forum thank you

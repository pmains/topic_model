well there are a couple pieces of anti-piracy legislation working their way through the Capitol Hill process as we speak the author of an alternative to that legislation is Senator Ron Wyden a Democrat of Oregon who joins us on the communicators senator Wyden first off what are your issues with the protect and the sope anti-piracy legislative pieces both of them are essentially using a bunker buster bomb when what you need is a laser beam look there is no question that there are some bad actors out there there are people who sell tainted viagra or fake Rolexes or movies they don't own as far as I'm concerned got a handcuff them but these bills go way way beyond you know that and particularly they do a tremendous amount of damage to the architecture of the Internet I mean basically what they do to turn websites into web cops mean basically you'd have a web sites trying to monitor enormous you know amounts of data you know YouTube alone gets like 24 hours of content you know ever every second it would be impossible to monitor nobody really even tries except for the Chinese in the Iranians so saying that that there they go too far for you what is your alternative proposal that you and representative darrell i so republican of california have proposed what we do is offer an approach that's built around the proposition that we're essentially dealing with international commerce here and we've got an agency that deals with physical goods the international trade commission and we think you use the same kinds of principles when you're dealing with with digital goods and those principles are essentially transparency consistency and due process for example there are hundreds of federal judges who are issuing opinions with respect these issues they widely diverge you don't see that sort of thing at the International Trade Commission and yours your act is that what does so called the open act and it cuts access to foreign rogue websites engaging in counterfeiting when they engage in it willfully and then we take a follow the money approach so that when you see somebody who is willfully engaging in these kinds of copyright infringement you know practices you basically cut off the money visa paypal on the like and also their ad networks you also use the trade laws as you talked about to restrict the rogue sites how is that different from the SOPA and the protect at the SOPA and protect acts the essence of them is they start meddling with the domain name system and that is the fundamental architecture to the net not only is it bad in terms of social media and business opportunities and the like it would do a whole lot of damage to our effort to try to deal with cybersecurity mean everything our country is trying to do in cyber security is built around the current internet architecture and I think you're going to see substantial opposition probably very soon from the national security community because we are hearing there's growing concern there well we should also introduce Gowtham to guess who is our guest reporter this week on the communicators thanks Peter senator Wyden you discussed your objections to PIPA and SOPA based on some of the concerns expressed by web companies but we've also heard some very broad concerns from civil civil libertarians free speech advocates people concerned that this bill would lead to censorship and I believe you have cited some of those concerns can you explain them please the two bills beyond the question of damaging the domain name system they really do implement a censorship regime and it could be as simple as as a as a discussion board the language that's used here to kind of trigger the various efforts to deal with the content owners is incredibly broad it talks about facilitating copyright infringement that could be practically anything now i have to tell you and people don't know this i'm kind of sympathetic with the content you know folks my late father was a writer and an author so all the time i can go to websites and i can see his books quoted a great length without citing him and the authorship of his publications that doesn't mean that i'm going to rush out and pursue a whole lot of approaches that particularly would start chipping away at the domain name system which is fundamental you know architecture of the net but what this does the domain name system and linking I think will damage a lot of the openness and what I think is the appeal to all we've got great concern about income inequality in this country the internet is the place where you do something about it you have a good idea you can get it out around round the world not just the light interest proponents of SOPA argue that they are not asking for any type of censorship but rather they are asking for laws that apply in the physical world to be transferred online regarding stolen property and intellectual property violations can you explain exactly why asking Google Bing or another search provider to delete a link to copyrighted content would be what constitutes censorship in your view my view is is we ought to go after the willful infringers and we've outlined in the open bill specifically how we do that which is to cut off their money if you try to get internet service providers search engines and others into the censorship business there's no way it can possibly work and it would in my view a lot of the innovation that we need in our country it also is a policy we've rejected now for 15 years going back to the fight against smut and it was literally 15 years ago it was clear we were all horrified at some of the really ugly material that was getting in the hands of our kids and at that time the Congress was just starting debate you know Internet policy and there were two approaches that were offered one was by the late Senator Exxon it was largely to try to set up the kind of censorship regime that you're describing the other is the approach that I and former congressman Chris Cox offered on a bipartisan basis which said look let's do everything we can to empower parents in the private sector with shelters and other kinds of tools to weed out some of this horrible material that was going to get two very young children otherwise but let's not hold the intermediaries liable for some content that they relieve presumably wouldn't have even know much about most of the time and it's often said that the fact that we weren't holding intermediaries libel is what caused the growth of social media and a lot of these websites over the last 15 years there's a better way to go and for more than 15 years starting with section 230 of the Communications Decency Act the law that I wrote we have rejected that approach as you said Google in particular has come under fire during this debate basically as a gatekeeper to the Internet at the hearing they were the only witness that testified against the sofa act in the house and they were really the target of criticism from lawmakers who repeatedly reference their ability to find pirated content on the Internet why do you think Google is specifically become sort of the face of the opposition or the target of this legislation and do you think that your colleagues in both the House the Senate understand the nature of the search business well enough to make those sorts of determinations well obviously the Senate in the house are just getting familiar with these issues copyright the law the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and like I guess you could say it's not on the lips of every single member of Congress but this debate is really not in my view about the big powerful companies this is often been framed as a debate between Silicon Valley and and Hollywood so this is not primarily about Google and Facebook this is about whether we're going to have Pro innovation policies so that we'll have future Google's and future Facebook's and when you look at these bills you can take the mental proposition about the American dream which people call two guys in a garage you pass these bills and you're going to have perhaps two people in a garage but you're going to have a whole upstairs full of lawyers telling them whether or not they can open a website that is not going to be good for innovation this is c-span's communicators program we're talking with Senator Ron Wyden a Democrat of Oregon about his bill which is called the open act online protection and enforcement of digital trade acts legislation and it is a different version of what we have been talking about the SOPA and the pipo or the protect Act which our Senate and House bills and they're very similar now the Stop Online Privacy Act sponsored by Lamar Smith who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the house cuts access to foreign rogue websites engaging in counterfeiting uses the Justice Department in federal courts to restrict rogue sites focuses on foreign sites and leaves existing law to block domestic sites engaging in counterfeiting and piracy and advertisers and credit card companies must stop doing business with rogue sites senator Wyden the difference there seems to be you're using the ITC and Senator Smith and I'm sorry representative Smith and Senator Leahy's bills would use the courts what what is the problem with using the quote first of all the single biggest difference between the two bills both of them acknowledge that you ought to go after the bad actors were engaging in copyright infringement our approach the open bill does not involve censorship and it doesn't involve dismantling the domain name systems we believe that so much of the growth in this country and our ability to innovate and the social media sites and the ability for folks to communicate depends on the architecture of the internet being preserved and strengthened that's what it's going to take to deal with these cyber threats and that's why the national security community is so concerned about the PIPA belt and the soap SOPA bill and that's the single biggest difference yes we do think that this fundamentally a question of you know international commerce rather than narrow legalistic you know issues that ought to be brought up in the judicial system but the single biggest difference is we do not dismantle do not undo the fundamental DNS system the architecture damage linking that sort of thing and i also want viewers to know because we haven't talked about it i put a hold a public hold on the senate bill in december of 2010 had I not done that it would have passed right at that time because people weren't aware I've also put a public hold on the Senate bill that was passed late in the spring of this year I've made it clear that I will filibuster with every ounce of my strength against this bill I have not done that before but I think this is very ill-advised legislation both from the standpoint of what it would do to innovation what it would do to entrepreneurs what it would do to small businesses and I think you will see growing concern from the national security have there been companies that have endorsed your legislation a number I mean certainly a number of the technology firms have been very interested in our bill is newer and that's one of the reasons why I hope that the Senate schedule will not immediately go to the PIPA bill so that we'll have a chance to walk through four colleagues what our legislation is all about there's a great deal of interest on our approach as well in the house of Darrell Issa's aloft grant jared Polis a big bipartisan collection of thoughtful Representatives but they haven't had enough time to really walk the house through it and i hope given the concern that has emerged over the last week or ten days we'll get that time as Google and the googles and the bings of the world endorsed you large lesions yes they sent a letter saying that they favor the the approach I'm sure if you ask them they will say they're looking at you know various and sundry details but again for viewers and listeners there's no debate here that copyright infringement is a serious you know question we've got a system for dealing with it now it's called notice and takedown Digital Millennium Copyright Act it's not perfect there are ways in which on a bipartisan basis we can improve on it that's what the open legislation is all about but the big difference the fundamental difference between our bill and the other is that we would not do all the damage to the architecture of the Internet we would not tamper with a domain name assistant we would not start a censorship or blacklisting program we would not turn websites into web cops and just to make it clear that lamar smith the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the author of the SOPA legislation has been invited on this program as well gowtham to guess of the hill now you referred to some of the political support for your legislation obviously protect IP has considerable support as well we saw it passed the committee sign and Commerce Committee fairly with bipartisan support and you threaten the filibuster first of all do you believe that the bill as it now stands has a strong chance of passing the Senate and secondly can you speak to the support for the bill very strong from the entertainment industry the retail industry do you think they can be convinced that the open act is the correct solution we know that we are up against one of the most sophisticated and savvy and powerful lobbies in the United States and they've been at it a long time they poured millions of dollars into their various and sundry lobbying and campaign efforts and frankly we know that our side is going to have to fight above our weight this is going to be a tough battle but if you look at what's happened in the last couple of a couple of weeks certainly well over a million Americans that signed petitions against these these bills and people are coming to understand what some of these issues are all about regrettably some of our opponents have a long track record of defending outdated business models were essentially business as usual it was not very long ago when the head of the Motion Picture Association said that the VCR was to the movie industry what what the Boston Strangler was to women home alone and that was just a preposterous kind of comment because the VCR made a tremendous amount of money for the movie industry now we've seen a lot of heated rhetoric from both sides in this debate as you just reference but we've also seen an unprecedented level of public engagement in intellectual property issues tumblr Mozilla Wikipedia we're seeing web companies really mobilize their users to voice opposition to both protect IP and sofa why do you think the public is still engaged on this and have you been hearing from the public in large man I I have and I think it I think is fair fair to say that copyright and trademark issues which historically would not exactly be household words you would not have people Cuba thing about copyright law around the kitchen table people really have followed this and they followed it with growing concern because they're there is an awareness of the stakes I mean we had a big debate about you know network neutrality for example this goes way beyond network neutrality and in fact this goes to the architecture of the internet and not just whether once you sign up for internet service provider you get to go where you want you know when you want this is a question of whether in the name of dealing with a serious you know problem just like the challenge was with smut you know 15 years ago are you going to do something smart that really goes in and attacks the problem with with a laser beam or are you going to do something does an enormous amount of collateral damage and I think if these two bills the alternative bill sopa and pipa were passed in his present form they would do a great deal of damage senator wyden your former colleague Chris Dodd is now head of the motion picture association of america and on the different side of the issue he's strongly in favor of sopa and pipa have you talked with him about this legislation well of course under the ethics you know laws he's not you know allowed to you know communicate with legislators I see him from time to time you always look very can't talk can't talking it's in a sense you know too bad because he has been a coalition builder in his years as a legislator and I think there's a real opportunity to try to bring those who have tech savvy and you know the content creators and say let's try to come up with something that makes sense all around the fact is their products to do that if you look at products like Netflix and iTunes and services and the like these are ones that show you can be successful and have innovation and and content and that's the kind of thing that I'd like to try to promote what is it about Oregon several oregonians are very involved in tech issues you senator former senator Smith as head of the National Association of Broadcasters Greg Walden on the house side as a Republican from Oregon well we're we're freedom folks we liked the First Amendment we like to be able to communicate we like to debate and we're pretty in gallah tarian we like everybody have a shot not just the moneyed interests and that's what the internet represents course congressman Walden that small radio station for quite some time Family Center smiths representing the broadcast I can tell you what happened in my case is when i became Oregon's first in the united states senator in 1996 i said look I'm gonna do everything I can for the forest products industry and our traditional kind of industries but I said in addition to that I'm going to try to find some new opportunities for us to really lead and innovate and it always kept coming back to technology for example I'm now the chairman of Senate Finance Committee on international trade I think the Internet is the shipping lane of the 21st century so I'm very interested and anxious for example to promote the export of our digital goods center thing and I have introduced a bipartisan bill to do that as well so if you look at the areas i focused on authoring the Communications Decency Act so that we wouldn't hold the intermediaries a libel and and damage innovation i wrote the internet tax freedom bill in effect twice of the digital signatures law which people who are viewing and listening often used when they're in effect signing real estate documents and now a group of us were involved in the y2k legislation i've tried to look at policies that would ensure that we do no harm which is why i'm concerned about sopa and pipa and all the damage that would be done to the domain name system and then try to lay out a strategy for tapping some of the opportunities like digital trade Senator Ron Wyden Democrat of Oregon who is the author of the open act anti-piracy legislation thank you for being on the communicators

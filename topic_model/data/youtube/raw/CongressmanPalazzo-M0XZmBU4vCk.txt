thank you madam chair this bill sadly comes up short as a member of this subcommittee i feel a direct responsibility for the national security issues this bill doesn't provide for we're experiencing a failure of policy not personnel i visited the border a few months ago along with some of my colleagues and we met plenty of hard work and border agents catching and processing illegal aliens but agents are being stripped of the policy tools that allow them to turn migrants away now this bill before us strips them of the funding that allows them to carry out their basic missions our physical border isn't the only thing being thrown to the wayside in this bill our maritime border and the u.s coast guard that protects it isn't prior prioritized either year after year we sit in hearings where we thank cbp ice coast guard and other dhs entities for all the work they do but year after year we sit in markups where we stretch them thinner and thinner we ask them to do more with less this administration is pushing policies that create open borders and encourages illegal immigration the american people are footing the bill the funding priorities in this bill put illegal immigrants first and the american people's safety and security madam chair we must work together and craft a bipartisan bill that secures our border with immigration policies that prioritize american workers protect our national security respect the rule of law and grow the middle class i yield back

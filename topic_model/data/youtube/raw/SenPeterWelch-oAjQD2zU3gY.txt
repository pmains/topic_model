>> THE CHAIR IS PLEASED TO  RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE VERMONT  DELEGATION. MR. WELCH, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED  FOR THREE MINUTES. >> WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS OF  TEXAS, BUT I APPRECIATE THE  RECOGNITION. FIRST OF ALL, DR. BURGESS THANK  YOU AND MR. GREEN, THANK YOU. YOU'RE TAKING TIME TO FOCUS  ATTENTION AND DEMONSTRATE THE  URGENCY OF THIS CHALLENGE. SECOND, THIS SO AFFECTS US ALL. I MEAN, IT'S HEARTBREAKING. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S A RED DISTRICT OR A BLUE DISTRICT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR VIEW IS ON THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF  GOVERNMENT. THIS IS HURTING PEOPLE IN YOUR  DISTRICT, DR. BURGESS AND MR.  GREEN AND IN MY DISTRICT AND MY  COLLEAGUES HERE. IN VERMONT, OUR GOVERNOR  DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE STATE OF  THE STATE ADDRESS TO THIS  EPIDEMIC IN 2014. AND I REMEMBER AT THAT TIME MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ASKED THE  QUESTION, PETER, ISN'T THIS  GOING TO DO BAD THINGS FOR THE  REPUTATION OF VERMONT? BUT THEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHAT  HE WAS SAYING WAS TRUE IN THEIR  OWN STATE, IN THEIR OWN  DISTRICTS. SO YOU FOCUSING ATTENTION ON IT, MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU. THAT'S STEP NUMBER ONE. I CAN GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS  IN VERMONT. OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROBLEMS  WITH INDIVIDUALS INCREASED FROM  24 IN 2012 BY 80%. HEROIN WENT FROM 913 IN 2012 AND INCREASED TO 3,488. EVERYONE OF THOSE STORIES IS A  STORY OF HEARTACHE. I GOT A LETTER FROM A MOM WHOSE  27-YEAR-OLD SON BECAME ADDICTED  TO HEROIN. HE WENT FROM BEING A FULL-TIME  WORKING PERSON TO BEING OUT OF  THE STREET, HER HAVING TO CALL  HER DAUGHTERS SAYING THEIR  BROTHER MAY SOON BE DEAD. ALL OF THAT IS REAL AND ALL TOO  VIVID. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE. OUR JOB IN CONGRESS IS TO COME  UP WITH SOME POLICIES THAT ARE  GOING TO HELP PEOPLE HELP  THEMSELVES. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW  SUGGESTIONS OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE TO HAVE FULL FUNDING FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE  ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT. WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE MONEY IN  ORDER TO ALLOW OUR COMMUNITIES  TO DO THAT WORK. TWO, WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE  RESEARCH INTO ALTERNATIVE  TREATMENT. I'M WORKING WITH MR. McKINLY TO  TRY TO GET THE COMPREHENSIVE  ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT, TO  FIND BETTER ALTERNATIVES TO  TREAT PAIN. THREE, LET'S ALLOW FOR PARTIAL  FILLING OF OPIOID SUBSCRIPTIONS. FOUR, LET'S SUPPORT THE RECENT  ACTION BY COMMISSIONER GOTTLIEB. HE'S DONE SOME GOOD THINGS. HE'S TRYING TO GET MEDIATE  RELEASE OPIOID MANUFACTURERS TO  FOLLOW A MORE STRINGENT SET OF  REMS

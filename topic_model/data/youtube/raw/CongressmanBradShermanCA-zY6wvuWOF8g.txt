on the program a Democrat from California that's a little you're a Hillary supporter I believe you've come out and endorsed Hillary a little bit close isn't it with Bernie Sanders what just two points behind look I'd love to think California is going to matter the fact is this race is already over if Hillary were to lose every race starting tonight by 20 points she would still have a significant edge among the pledged delegates the overwhelming edge among the super-delegates and she'd be the nominee but tonight she's going to win a lot of states she's going to win states by 20 points and when she comes to California she's going to win just as she did in 2008 but whether she wins by two points or loses by two points may help your ratings but will have no effect in Philadelphia no we need it you won't help the ratings I bring it up because that's an awfully close thing and Bernie Sanders I think by staying in and remaining so close to Henry in that key race I think he wants to drag her further to the left come convention time now am I wrong well that's what many of his supporters are saying the fact is Hilary has core principles and those principles are solid progressive principles or I wouldn't have endorsed her so I don't think she's being dragged to the left I think she's a solid progressive and will continue to be and yes California has a lot of Delegates but they're all proportional so if you win California by one point where you lose California by one point that's fewer delegates than Guam has so you know three delegates one way or the other is not it's the Republicans that are going to drive your ratings because they have a real contest that's true now I want to get back to Bernie Sanders supporters Oh Democrats in general I've got a pole it was on USA Today that shows thirteen percent of Democrats could vote for Donald Trump they say they'd vote for Donald Trump over re Clinton that's quite a number you surprised no because at this stage people in a primary gets so hyped up that they just say I'm from my side that primary I'm going to tell the pollster that I won't be there for the other candidate and then they come home during the process but when you look at the polls about Donald Trump at how many Republicans would not vote for him hey one of the Koch brothers may not vote for him what I I think I think yeah it's forty percent of republicans say in the polls they would not vote for Donald Trump that's what you're right that's what they say I'd be happy to lose I wouldn't be happy to lose thirteen percent of our vote but picking up forty percent of their vote puts us in pretty good shape congressman before you go can I ask you this do you think that in my lifetime I'm in my 60s I will ever see a Republican elected to statewide office in California you know I keep keep going to the gym and you've got a shot and because we have quite a number of statewide offices that you don't focus on a lieutenant governor and elected insurance commissioner we had a Republican elected insurance commissioner during your middle-aged years and will we may we could have ended up with a California State Controller who was a Republican so um the ant the answer is if you keep going to gym you will see it but you may not see a government you won't see a governor you won't see a senator but if you really care about whose treasure of California keep working out i do care about it and I will keep working out comes from brad Sherman Democrat California thanks for joining us sir always a pleasure thank you okay breaking news

all right thank you everyone for joining us for tonight's call we have just under 700 people who have rsvp'd to this so we'll see how many end up actually being able to get on to that getting on i'm lisa mandelblatt i am congressman malinowski's director of community outreach and want to welcome you all here i'm going to be moderating tonight i always found the beginning of the school year to be exciting and angst provoking but no year is quite like this year to say the least the questions of how and if schools should reopen this fall whether your child should attend school in person and how as an educator you can do the job that you love while protecting yourself and your loved ones are ones that have no easy answers congressman malinowski asked us to create this roundtable to create an open dialogue and to hear directly from experts and stakeholders you will have in about a half an hour you're going to have an opportunity to ask your questions directly to the panelists so please if you have a question put it into the chat box we will try to get to as many of you as possible in the time that we have and now i'm pleased to introduce our panelists sean spiller who is sean is the vice president of njea the mayor of montclair a parent and a high school teacher in wayne yoona kim yuna is the president of montgomery elementary the mom to two daughters and the licensed clinical social worker and dr mike caraggio dr mike is a practicing pediatrician in clinton he is on staff at hunterdan medical center and he was named as one of new jersey family's favorite kid stocks and without further ado i'm going to turn this over to our congressman congressman tom malinowski thank you so so much lisa thank you everybody for joining us this evening um this is an incredibly important topic right now uh for reasons i don't need to explain to anybody on this call i really hope that this is a helpful and interesting conversation uh for everybody it's also a difficult topic because we're all very very anxious about it i've been i've been speaking over the last several weeks to parents to teachers i've spoken to literally dozens of school superintendents and principals to try to get their views and to see how i can help them and i gotta tell you my main takeaway from all of that we'll we'll get down to the details of how we're to run the school year but my main takeaway from all of that is i just wish that we could shut down this country for three weeks or whatever it takes do it properly this time if we really cared about our kids and about the safe opening of schools that's what we would do like every other well-run country in the world has done unfortunately that would require more bipartisan buy-in than we have in these divided times when people are still arguing even over wearing of masks unfortunately there are just too many folks um not so much in new jersey but in other parts of the country that were much more eager to open up bars than open up schools and so here we are with covid 19 still spiking in many parts of the country again we're doing better in new jersey but we're connected to everybody else so we're affected and we are faced as the school year approaches with almost an impossible set of choices because there's no way to do this in a way that is going to create a perfect experience for everybody i've been focused on what i can do as a member of congress to to try to make those choices a little bit less impossible so most important thing that congress can do is to provide the resources that we need you all know that we are in a pretty high stakes negotiation right now between the house the senate and the white house on the next coronavirus bill and one of the big sticking points is that a lot of us including me are insisting on a generous package of relief for our state county and local governments in part because we're going to need it for our schools whether we go virtual whether we have some in-person instruction whatever we do to do it safely to do it right it's going to cost more money at the same time as our state and local governments are burdened by all kinds of other expenses related to covet 19. so that's something i'm fighting for um and any bill i'm confident if we get to an agreement any bill is going to help new jersey and all of our communities with this problem so that's number one i've been talking to the governor a lot about the decisions that he has to make and they're very very tough decisions but one thing that i stress to him is that if we have any in-person instruction at all in the state of new jersey we've got to make sure that we allocate our limited coronavirus testing resources so that we have rapid tests available for school personnel and for for students because you know people are going to want to get a test if they feel under the weather and if they have to wait 10 days to get a test result then there's nothing we can do that's almost useless there will be mass chaos and enclosures if we reopen anything so that's one of the things a practical thing i've stressed um with him as well as the need for more clear guidance to our schools and school districts because our educators are the experts on education but they are not public health experts and i don't think that that it's fair to be asking them to be making public health decisions or to expect that each and every school district in the state of new jersey is going to be making different decisions based on science that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me and so those are some of the things that i have been working on some that i am directly responsible for particularly the resources from the federal government and other issues where i can be an advocate for you with our state and and local authorities um whatever we do this is going to be a very very difficult year i have some personal views that i've developed as i've as i've listened to experts and talk to parents and educators but i recognize there are multiple valid views about what we should do that people hold very very passionately and this will be a chance for folks to express those views and to ask questions to get good information from experts who can give you the best possible guidance about how to do this right for our kids this fall and going forward so i look forward greatly to the discussion and to taking any questions that you may have directed at me um and why don't we uh why don't we get started lisa okay great so um i guess we'll start i'll start with you yoona and i'll ask each of the panelists to help us out here with the answer so can you tell us what concerns you're hearing from your network your your fellow pto parents parents in the schools um and how are you helping people make these decisions of what they should do it's such a loaded question to start out with nothing you think so first of all i just want to thank you for the opportunity to join on this discussion i do want to give a shout out to jenna huntley who i think is on the call she is my co-president at the pta with me and i cannot do this without her and just for the record to state that our montgomery elementary school pta does not have any political affiliations with any party just to put that out there so in terms of what we're hearing i mean i think what we're hearing here in montgomery is really similar to concerns that are all around you hear the whole range of parents who feel really strongly that the remote learning was not helpful to their children they really need to be in physical school have contact with their teachers and classmates to the other extreme of you know how can we do this safely we are sending our kids to school trusting that they are going to be safe for those four to six hours that they're gonna be within those buildings and with just all the limitations of what's happening like how can we trust that this is really safe i think one thing that's evident is that people have very strong feelings about where they stand and i think with the ever-changing situation it's hard to get a good grasp on how to even plan i feel for all the school staff and administration because it's constantly changing same thing for you know the community and the parents um everyone whether you are a two working parent you know no one's working in the house one person is working we've been in a society where we realize would be like come september the kids go to school you know they're in school from something like eight to three and so we are so used to this routine and to be kind of hope thrown from it in the midst of all the other changes that are going on it's just really really unsettling um in terms of what the pt is doing i think you know that really depends on the community depending on the role of their pta one of the things that we're trying to do here in montgomery is to help facilitate some of the communication because i think everyone could agree that over communication at this point is key and the more information we have and the more the parents feel that their concerns are being heard and they could understand the planning process um the less anxious we can be so that's the major way we're trying to figure out how to facilitate as well as you know what can we do in terms of financial support to our schools great thank you so much uh dr mike what are you hearing from me i know this has been a big topic for your patients yeah i think i've seen concerns regarding you know the sample of what happened in the spring a lot of parents felt that the remote learning uh was not ideal and i point out to them that if you just went to work on a friday and we're told when they come back on monday okay you gotta have a plan in place and i try to explain to them that that is not ideal for either side a lot of my patients who have special need needs kids obviously are concerned they want that socialization they also want that individualized type of care that that um that child needs okay and of course i have uh like any uh anybody else a lot of two working parent families you know how are they gonna manage this how can a child go to school half a day a week and you know and then how do they maintain jobs and who's going to be responsible for after care and things like that and medically i think you know when you start seeing what's going on in the news recently what's going on in the south about you know an increase in the number of cases and children obviously that's in the back of their mind are we gonna mirror that same uh um same phenomenon that's happened happening down south so that's most of the performance all right thanks and um sean i know you must be this you must be working on this 24 7. i've heard a little about it right yeah yeah yeah no question well first also start with just a couple shout outs i know there's a ton of educators listening so thank you sue davis so many others so thank you for being on i know um but uh you know specifically of course as educators there is no one that wants to be back in the classrooms with our students more than we do and i think part of this process it's been so important when schools were charged with trying to develop safe in-person reopening plans um we were right there making sure that our voices were heard making sure that you know from busing the kids to you know feeding the kids to giving instruction you know we were part of those conversations to make sure we could try and come up with something uh where we could do it safely but i think something that um you know both the previous panelists noted that i think is so important what we don't want to have happen which happened last time was literally exactly that that on on a friday you know you're told you know see you monday and then by by later that afternoon you're told by the way we're going all virtual and you've got to figure it out and we have districts you know person by person using different platforms trying to communicate in different ways um you know just just a real uh val you know valiant attempt to do something that was as constructive as possible and no surprise there it's coming from the best educators in the nation uh but difficult to do right and i think from an experience from a parent perspective uh you could see why it could be frustrating if it's so varied you're not exactly sure what the expectations are you're not sure of the technology yourself or how to help your student your son or your daughter with it um so because of all that i think as we've been working through this process we've reached a point and i think it's become clear at this point when we've heard from our administrators the ones who were asked to come up with these plans they have come out on record saying we are not ready we have joined them to say look at this juncture we need to better prepare for a distance learning different distance teaching experience to start the year that way we're not you know running right up against this you know we also saw what happened when the governor at the last minute had to change from in-person dining and not do it and the chaos that causes and understand why he did it right he's following the science he's following the data but we can't do that again where our educators find out on a friday that come monday you know we're going virtual again so now is the time i think to invest in the technology in the work uh the tremendous work that has to happen for the experience that our students have and that our parents have is not one where they say i'm not so sure you know that was as best as it could have been or was right for my student if we put that time in now we're going to be able to give that quality experience it's not going to be the same as in person we all wish we could be there but at least it's going to be an experience where it's a quality one and our kids and our staff are safe because you know i don't think we're there yet yeah we've got a lot of work to do so thank you all so much um so i've heard people say that we can shop at target you know why can't kids go back to school does someone want to tell me why there's a difference well i know i just spoke but if the others don't mind this book starts off right now um you know they're they're i i've heard that myself but there is such a distinction that i just can't help myself and that you know we all we're all familiar now as we you know try and work through this of you know you need to go shopping you need to get out there you've got to put a mask on you've got to enter the store et cetera and do your shopping but there's a lot of key differences in many instances you're in for a short period of time you are you know properly distanced and you're an adult and you can follow those rules all right you can you know then exit and and make sure you're in charge of of cleaning your hands and doing all the pieces that we instruct right now let's look at a school right in a school you've got kids of all different ages who are coming in and let me just reiterate their kids so their ability to follow all these rules you know maybe some can better than others they're going to want to talk to their friends be with their friends hang out with their friends they're going to be passing each other in the halls and hanging out and doing all the things that kids do and then from an educator perspective we're going to be sitting in these rooms with them for hours right with these students uh you're in situations i look at you know the infrastructure that we have in our buildings these are not like a supermarket with this you know blowing hvac unit and you're comfortably situated it's a sweltering classroom in many instances the windows can't be opened because of school safety reasons uh so the ventilation we're talking about can't happen the the systems that are in place can't filter the air i mean there's just so many differences that it is not the same thing at all and you know i get that people think you know we can get back to some new normal it it we want to do that for schools as well but we just don't have a lot of infrastructure pieces and we also have to factor in that kids or kids uh and they're going to be coming in contact with adults who are with them for hours on end i used to substitute teach in elementary school so yeah i'm sort of trying to picture any of this working and it's it's terrifying um kids are kids and and people are people and we sort of gravitate towards one another and i think that's just human nature so i think you know that's the big difference here versus just running in and picking up picking up you know diapers or something um dr mike i have a question for you um can you speak to how parents teachers staff members should evaluate their decision regarding in-person instruction from a public health perspective yeah i i tell my parents you know and many times i have parents come in or grandparents come in i ask almost anyone what's the model what's what kind of model is your child returning to and i do some exploration of what what their family is like what's the extended family one of the questions i ask is do you have a parent or a grandparent that lives at home with you so i get them to look at their their bubble toe to speak who are they going to be exposed to um because in my business the kids the touristy don't get real sick with coke they tolerate it okay they can get real sick but generally speaking they may get an asymptomatic illness they may get a mild cold or cough but they still have it the less likely the younger they are to spread it for some unknown reason but they can spread it and so i always look at you know from a public health standpoint we want to try to protect everybody and if we don't protect the children the children become the source of infection for others that's the difficulty i see and i especially see that when dealing with daycare and preschools for example because good luck keeping a mask on three and a half year old good luck trying to teach him to cough into his hand and watch his or her hands so that's the challenge i see i make sure they know that you have to plan for the possibility that your child may be exposed and if so what does that mean for you what does that mean for your household all right so thank you both for answering my questions um i hope i answered some of the folks who are listening some questions so but what i want to do now is actually open this up um folks you can uh just remind her if you've got questions please put them in the chat box we're gonna they're coming in fast and furious so um try to get to as many as i can trying to group some of those as if i can um so our first question is going to be um christina faragalia i'm sure not pronouncing that correctly close enough christina you had a question about the digital divide yes so um and actually i think i represent probably not so much the digital divide group but i'm also the parent of two children with an iep and so that's another divide but i'd like to focus uh the group on the digital divide um which i'm familiar with because of my volunteer work um with the new jersey coalition for inclusive education you know we know new jersey has like the probably the largest uh differences in school district uh resources and and we have some significant differences in socioeconomic groups across districts so while some families may be really well positioned to support their learners with you know because their district provides laptops and you know they have like 5g wi-fi or you know 15 routers in the house some other um you know we've heard stories um through our through our organization of uh students say for example in jersey city um where there was attrition and and the districts lost contact with some of the students you know the day after uh in march so we're just wondering what if anything because we are expecting that many districts will go to at least a partial hybrid model can be done to support um some districts in new jersey and families in new jersey that may not have access to laptops and wireless appropriate wireless signals so that they can distance learn and i think that's like just the first barrier that we have to cross thank you um congressman i know you're working on something along these lines you wanna yeah so starting with the big national picture we we still have all kinds of chunks of this country um including in our overall very affluent congressional district where we do not have um good high-speed internet access for everybody i know that's just one piece of this puzzle but um one of the things that we're trying to do in this bill that we're negotiating uh is um is to uh fund uh the provision of a high-speed broadband to under-served communities throughout our country many of them are rural communities in our district you know my district stretches out to warren county hunterdon county phillipsburg area has has these difficulties but also underserved urban districts um and so hopefully we'll we'll be able again to deliver some resources from the federal government that will help the state of new jersey close that digital divide um then there's the the issue of uh of equipment that the schools can um can provide uh to their kids and unfortunately that's not a problem we can solve entirely by throwing money at it um i've you know i will probably hear more from our educators about this but just in my conversations uh with school superintendents uh what they're they've told me is we still have a bunch of districts that don't have all the chromebooks for example that they would need for uh for all of their kids and it's not a money problem it's that they're just on back order there's such a crush of demand for these devices because the whole country and frankly the whole world suddenly went to virtual learning that a bunch of schools aren't going to get their deliveries until november or december and i had my staff go to work on this like is there a way to ease up on the regulatory requirements um do they have to buy them from approved companies can they just go on amazon and buy chromebooks i you know we personally went on amazon and and on a bunch of websites and indeed like you can't get five or ten of them without you know being told five six months so there is a huge supply chain problem there that um that uh we're gonna have to find some way to deal with fortunately i think most of our kids in this district uh maybe the overwhelming majority have what they need but that's not good enough because we don't want anybody to fall through the cracks especially if we go to especially for districts that will go to a full virtual model you know what are you seeing in your district um similar there's definitely gaps in availability um it was interesting you know we always take a like wanted list from the teachers at the end of the year in terms of gifts and in the beginning and everyone's lists include even things like disinfectant wipes and you know the irony is we'd love to get it for them if we could like if someone could actually just find it and yeah i think the supply part is really really challenging because i remember in the spring when we went digital virtual i was trying to find a webcam for one of the computers at my house that we just never really needed to use ever before and to find one was almost impossible and i ended up having to i think put a message on a local facebook group to see if somebody had an extra one laying around so yeah it really is um really really challenging um you know in montgomery they were i think able to provide the equipment to those who needed it and we made it work for the spring on a more long-term basis it becomes a lot more challenging i mean this is i think one of the ways that pts and ptos can get involved to help somebody support but again like we have limits in terms of actually finding these things too and sean what do you what is any answers yeah i think the the problems were rightfully identified you know starting with the congressman that it's just it's just difficult to get what you need uh you know big kudos uh certainly to the work that governor murphy and others have done i know senator ruiz and many others at the state level have have tried to either you know help districts or help through public-private partnerships to get devices in kids hands to get wi-fi where needed uh but even when something like that happens it's exactly like the congressman noted you know when you dig down you find okay well the state has secured some public private funding for some of these things but the districts still have to go out and get the devices themselves or get some of these things themselves and they're just not available right so we have both i think a short-term and a long-term issue um these inequities have existed for quite some time this is only this pandemic has only highlighted them you know in the short term we've got to try and get devices in kids hands enough of them per family right when kids are trying to work at the same time on something wi-fi you know available of course we've got to do everything we can you know cut through regulations as we're noted you know cut through different any obstacle we can and then i think in the longer term and and something i'm sure that the congressman would be looking into you know treating wi-fi and internet as a utility making sure everyone has it as access you know doing doing some more infrastructure work so that as we go into the future and we face other challenges uh we address these things at the core and quite frankly address some of the equity issues that have existed for a long long time you're here we need to treat it as a right because covet has taught us we can't live without it so speaking about equity c carlson has a question about why students and teachers can't get tested but athletes can so see carlson you're up hi first of all thank you for having this forum where we can kind of talk through some of these things but we're walking into a situation blind there's gonna be you know when you look at the statistics the odds are in a school even with half of the people coming in there's going to be somebody in that building the first day of school that's going to have covid and we have no knowledge of who that is like it makes no rational sense to me in the united states that we don't have a system where we're all going to be tested before we walk in the building which that's not 100 either but it would be a great starting place yeah i'll i mean i'll i'll take that um look i don't know if there's going to be somebody walking into the school on the first day who's got coven but i can guarantee you there's going to be somebody walking in with a sniffle or a cold or they're feeling a little bit under the weather and given where we are right now like anybody with any kind of symptoms in a school situation is gonna to be tested because we want to be safe we want to be sure and the good news is it's really easy to get a test in the state of new jersey the bad news is that it takes way too long to get the result back so once you get that test in all likelihood you just have a cold right but once you get that test you've got a quarantine you have to act as if you have coveted 19. so if it's a teacher that teacher's got to stay home for eight nine ten days who's going to teach his or her class um if it's a student you then got to have contact tracing and who did they expose other kids in the class you can imagine the chaos that will ensue if you have any in-person instruction and we don't have rapid testing available so what how did we get here well because we have limited testing resources in the country and most of them are being taken up right now by the states that didn't take this seriously enough and and you see what's happening in texas in florida and uh and mississippi and and midwestern states where you know this is what makes me angry honestly and and so the labs are besieged with samples from people who think they may have coveted mostly from those states and so it's taking longer we do have some more rapid options so in the state of new jersey rutgers university for example has developed a saliva test it's really easy to administer and they've been getting the results back 24 to 48 hours but they can run maybe 30 000 tests a day and so the question is who do we allocate those to well long-term care facilities that's obviously really important and so that's one priority population prisons because people are housed together right that that's a priority population what i've been saying is if if we have in-person instruction in the state of new jersey we need to be treating schools as a priority because our school personnel are going to be front line workers who are risking their health to provide a vital service and our kids and our parents need to be assured that if somebody gets sick we know right away whether it's covet or not so that is within our power to do i think especially since i doubt you know i doubt there will be i think there are a lot of districts that will be virtual and so this won't be an issue um and whatever decisions made there we just we have to allocate those testing resources to our kids as if they are our number one priority which they should be so this is a question for anybody so if we did we got those testing would the test be done by school nurses or would people have to then go to their primary care physician or to a testing site um well i would i would defer that question to um to our doctor in the house i don't think it would be done uh in the school although the saliva test if that's made available is quite easy to administer what what do you think well i can only speak for the model we have so you know my practice has capability of testing kids unfortunately it's somewhat insurance driven if it is one lab we can get result back in the day and if it's another lab it can take up to four days the dilemma is if you look at the symptoms that can be a result of comet cough cold sore throat vomiting diarrhea rash you can make an argument almost any sick kid that i see in the coming months the parent is going to want a covet test and the other thing is um we at least in hunter and county although they have some testing sites they don't welcome children you know or if you go to cvs you have to be 18 years of age and so we become the gatekeeper you know for the testing uh because right now my county only the family doctors and the pediatricians can do the testing in children not aware of any of the schools that are going to be testing but i'm not privy to what you know all that has gone on in the schools yeah so we we are getting more testing resources to the counties from the state that's something else we've been working on um so you know hundred and county for example i've been talking to hunterdon medical center about this and they they have very limited capability for rapid tests but that's going to increase quite a bit in the coming weeks because of a grant that they're getting from the state using the federal money the cares money that we provided so you know it's getting better but i think i just start with the principle if we're going to do this it's got to be a priority for testing um and it's not for me to work out the modality right that's up to public health experts to do it right but my my part in this is fight for the resources fight to make it a priority sean any insight into um what would be going on in the schools no uh certainly part of the issue right i mean how would you handle the testing piece i think uh both the doctor and the congressman spoke to it it's um you know a little bit of a quite a bit of an unknown there and how it would happen right and also i think there's a concern about being tested more than once whether or not your insurance would cover it congressman is anything being done about that yeah well insurance will cover or should cover um testing if you're symptomatic but i think the questioner also posed well posed the question of whether folks should be getting regular tests right you know get tested once a day or once a week um just the general school population and that is not covered by insurance um because you know you can imagine let's say amazon wants to test all of its employees once a day well they should probably pay for that um i i think you know again it depends on what we end up doing with the schools open or closed but because i think we should treat it as a a critical public service um staffed by front-line workers i i do think we should have special provisions um that make testing as widely available as possible uh including if necessary requiring insurance companies uh to pay for more regular tests but again all that depends on how much of the system is open or not we'll have to see and i i will just look while the the testing piece itself i think has been spoken to uh something that was noted you know something you know to congressman i think is something we would have to be aware of the fact that the second somebody goes for testing the second it'd be an educator or student goes that they have to quarantine there's going to be a natural in some cases tendency to not go if you might not be feeling well because you don't want to be out 10 days till you get your result or whatever number of days or you know there's just a lot of challenges with that yeah yeah i mean i think this piece is a common theme that's discussed amongst the parents too like even the parents who are choosing to send their kids hybrid you know one of the things that we've heard was if the students show any type of symptoms it's going to be presumed that it could be coveted until proven otherwise so in essence like with the fall season of the flu season coming up kids get sick all the time so you know in our family you know have two daughters and one we're gonna send hybrid and one we're gonna keep virtual because of their ability to keep you know social distancing and the ability to maintain their masks but i imagine as a working parent even my daughter who my older one who i'm gonna send hybrid i'm just anticipating that as the fall season happens as kids sniffle as you know fevers happen there's just gonna be numbers and numbers of kids that are being sent home i can't even imagine what the nurse's office will look like right because typically in a non-coveter kids love the nurse's office so you know with limited space so it's it's like it's such a daunting path that i think from the parents perspective who we don't we are not part of the regular discussions within the school and i'm not saying that we should because these are obviously high level detail planning that needs to happen from the administration side but it does leave you know i think all the parents kind of uneasy of like what if like how is this going to all get managed right yeah they do those frequent flyers who love the nurse's office a week ago they returned 30 000 kids to school and this week they have over over a thousand in quarantine already so i'm batting down the hatches yes so i'm gonna we're gonna get turned to a new question this one's from uh gina gibbs and she has a question about tax relief credits for working parents um gina go ahead hi gina i'm trying to unmute your phone right now um i'm not sure if there's anything on your end that you're able to do gina i can read gina's question let's do that okay i'm going to read gina's question she said with regard to the new relief package what level of consideration has been given to any targeted tax relief or tax credits for working parents who are required to pay for supplemental child care or education support due to changes in what the public schools are able to offer under the circumstances uh we just passed a big child care bill in the house of representatives actually two child care bills that that try to address um all of the the problems that that we've encountered in in keeping that option alive and affordable um obviously it's more expensive to provide um anywhere close to the same level of care and attention and service because kids have to be more distant groups have to be smaller um a teacher has to stay with one group of kids for the whole day um stay with his or her pod in effect um and so again like we're gonna need more resources here and also you know we we do tax credits and other forms of assistance for um for parents as well in this legislation and it's part of that negotiation right now um where you know as you know uh my colleagues and i in the house are going for a very big bill um and so far the white house has been unwilling to entertain uh much in the way of compromise we we've offered to meet them more than halfway in terms of the ultimate cost of the bill and we're still not at a point where they're willing to contemplate that um and this is going to be one of the big big ticket items um you know i was i'll tell you my my my bias after multiple conversations on this issue is i'm very skeptical about reopening stuff uh in person um but then i i spent this morning speaking to uh folks who run the head start program up in dover in morris county and you know they've got three and four-year-olds from families that are almost in every case two working parents often holding down more than one job each and you know they do an amazing job and they try to do their best with virtual kindergarten and preschool um in uh in the the spring months but like you know three and four-year-olds aren't going to be sitting on zoom all day so the best they can do is is give the parents a kind of lesson play plan but the parents aren't home and you know so particularly for kids of that age with working parents um if we don't really focus on resourcing adequate child care um whether it's pure child care or or a preschool kind of situation we're going to see a lot of kids particularly from lower income families falling behind in in these months and so i'm i'm anguished and aware and and and thinking about what we can do particularly for that population anyone else have something to add to that sean anything the teachers can do to help with i think that's the challenge of this pandemic i mean there's no there's no good answer to a lot of these pieces um you know there's it's just it's so difficult you know you see these tough decisions being made all the time in a lot of different spaces um you know i've watched again more broadly our governor kind of handle it i think very well compared to a lot of others but oftentimes you know it's a it's a situation where you're making a choice and you've got to be driven by the health you know the health factor right you've got to be driven by that only in that all the other pieces are so challenging as well i think i've heard him say a number of times if we don't get that right we'll never get all the other pieces you know back we won't get or it'll be way later when we get them back so i think we all keep struggling with that because um you know it's not a great solution thing you know oh no problem we'll just do blank you know every single thing has an impact and in many cases it's not a it's not a good good situation but um you know i think we've got to just make sure we're doing everything we can to do something safe that's the the core right and we do have really creative wonderful teachers that i think with the right resources can will rise to the challenge um so thank you for that question oh gonna our next question is gonna be from to um from lauren ceremony she has a question about uh minimum standard of protection for educators lauren are you on yes go ahead thank you so much first i wanted to thank the congressman for having this forum for us um here's my question should there be a minimum standard of protection that we as educators should expect from our school districts school districts in order to ensure teacher safety in the classroom such as plexiglas shields on desks etc um sean mike actually uh any of you i think would have a perspective on this i'd love to hear it well i can't i can't think hasn't to plexiglas because you know that you know that's a resource not available to anybody but i think that what you hear over and over and over the most important thing is masks by far and your hand sanitizers clicking into the classroom cleaning out the classroom but the masking and masking correctly is uh is by far which is what's going to keep any individual set i think that has been proven over and over and over again as a theme you hear over and over and over again okay you know certainly i defer to the doctor on that and uh you know but i'd certainly also note as educators being asked to be in these confined spaces you know poor ventilation all these other pieces i think you almost have to treat it like the healthcare professionals where it would have to be a grade of ppe that really could protect educators because every student potentially could be could be carrying um you know the virus so uh difficult to make sure you're you're providing that uh and i think that's the challenges the state is having for sure and i don't know if the state is looking at that's one thing we do is um if we bring a patient into a room that has a fever and could be a covation we close that room down but we will put a hepa filter in there we either have to filter we have to bring close that room down for an hour without the filter we only have to close that exam room for about 10 minutes so that's a resource that perhaps could utilize in classrooms but obviously this costs i'm gonna go on a limb and say most schools don't have that right now whatever that was but uh you know in all in all seriousness you're right these are the kind of things that we're gonna have to be you know looking at i know every district right now is supposed to be tasking you know like a a room an isolation room right that that schools have but but what are they equipped with right how long you know can you have between one student the next student what if you get two that come down to the nurses off at the same time go in isolation rooms i mean it's just you know limitless challenges that of course once you start looking at each issue yeah i would just now i know my only take on this um is that these are public health decisions and they shouldn't be made by educators you know school superintendents principals teachers and we need a common standard for the state because you know otherwise we're gonna have parents and teachers in montgomery looking at what's happening in hillsborough and saying well they're doing it differently so does that mean we're doing it wrong and and so the decisions that are based on science and public health i think we you know we owe it to our school districts to have really clear guidelines that are coming down from the state and congressman i applaud you saying that i thank you for it because you know i've often thought you know as we look at our businesses and dining let's say you know there hasn't been a directive way where it's hey every restaurant out there you know come up with your own plans and you know we're going to look to see if we think that works for in dining or not or you know it's a broad um directive because we know that there are certain standards that are safe for certain standards that aren't you know i think you're right on with uh you know we need a little more definitive guidance there it's crazy that every school district is being asked to come up with their own plan here so our next question is from laura irby um laura has a question when i'm pronouncing that right laura has a question about her seventh grader okay so um our situation is that she just does not feel comfortable wearing a mask and there's just too many unknowns at this point so we've opted for the distance learning but with that we need to under make sure that we have all the resources that we can to make sure her learning doesn't get fall too far behind and i just wonder from the teacher's perspective what can we do to enhance her learning i know that her focus started out really good when we had to go to distance learning in march and as the months went by i could see it sort of getting harder and harder and harder for her to stay engaged stay focused i i love my daughter's name but by the end of it i was so sick of saying it over and over again tom has met charlie a couple times so we just want to be able to provide tutors whatever we're very fortunate that we have the resources for this computers we have good internet all that stuff is fine but what can we do to help her well thank you for that and i think that first thing that has to happen is what we're calling for now is recognizing that despite all the best efforts districts should be preparing for virtual instruction distance learning different distance teaching even was as noted you know just because of the fact that so many kids are going to get the sniffles throughout the year and have to be home no matter what right so we should be we should be preparing for that now i think what i've talked about and discusses many superintendents the sooner we make that transition the sooner a districts can work on truly quality you know virtual platforms right that's the first thing you know figure out as a district might be by grade level but but certainly age appropriate you know different learning platforms that we're going to all go to so that then as you train your educators you leave time to then include and train your students and your parents right so now as we are learning it as educators a new platform you're learning it you're seeing it as well so you're going to be better equipped to help um you know your student your son your daughter whoever you are when you're looking at this work whatever grade level also gives the opportunity for educators to say what are the supplemental resources and materials that we're going to attach to these lessons now that they're all virtual now that we know our platform what can we add into this and whether it be and there's some great public private partnerships out there i know for example you know um you know njtv and others have created great programming you know teachers might say here's a lesson that we're going to do once a week in this format so it's not always you're just on a screen like this and you're doing another zoom or whatever it might be where you know you have something that is going to engage uh your daughter more engage you know a child more and i think all of that is important and if we pivot towards that focus now we can get that real quality experience the longer we wait and the more we get back to the uh oh you know we're back to a virtual thing and you know you've got till monday to figure it out right right back to the challenge of we're just using what we're using we're just making it through instead of making it an awesome experience yeah in in our schools case i give them a lot of credit for pivoting as quickly as they did but what it ended up being was they'd watch a video and there was no real time teaching there was it was hard to get her to dial into her teachers and so i'd like to see some more real-time kind of learning but you know i like i said i can't complain about what we have but i just saw how it just went over time so yeah sorry for that yeah thank you not easy uh thank you for that question um i think our next question is going to be from ruth hammond she has a question about teacher training hi um thank you for um this uh time i'm wondering what kind of training is available for teachers so that they can use zoom and whatever other um uh whatever else they're using creatively and effectively um what kinds of interactions among students is made available i mean teachers in a classroom will often have breakout groups these are available on zoom if you know how to use them so that the students can interact with one another as well as with the teacher and have some variety and um so forth you know in their their class i know there are a lot of complaints in march april and so forth that teachers weren't doing anything but so many of them have no idea about the capabilities of online teaching that they can use and be more effective in their teaching lecturing doesn't really work with most students particularly all day okay well thanks for your question and again others feel uh certainly to jump in on any of these two as well but uh first and foremost i want to say the lecturing doesn't work for adults either you know all day we don't none of us want to hear that style right um you know to your point i think looking back on what we had and i think that's the emphasis i'd just like to make it if we're getting what we had before shame on us right because we've now had the time to be able to prepare for this and do this in a much better way um i think first and foremost districts were scrambling before many districts had policies you weren't even allowed to interact with students in a format like this live you know according to various district policies and other things so they were scrambling now at this point i think as you switch to a virtual distance learning environment there's an opportunity for once districts pick that platform if there's training available outside externally that's great but while we have some educators who aren't as familiar we have some that really are and know how to do this well and peer-to-peer education teaching is a great resource it's a great resource for districts that are already you know tight on cash and some other pieces where they can bring in uh current educators to help teach other other educators that way it's also very district specific you know we know what the challenges are they know what the obstacles are in any district or any building um and can kind of help bring those uh who aren't up to speed along and then of course it's it's helpful because then during the year it's not like a one-time thing it's uh they can check in all the time and follow up and do additional trainings it's not where we've got to be where we want to be uh just to start the year as we know as educators you're always growing you're always learning more so we need to continue to work on these pieces and incorporate more in so i think there's a lot of pieces there uh in terms of what training is available um i think that's an important piece uh but as we're talking about training i also just want to highlight you know as we rightfully so often focused on the instructional pieces i know it's always important to remind everybody and also focus on our students like emotional health and well-being you know we have many students who are home in difficult situations with family members and others and we've got to make sure we've got our platforms down we've got to make sure we've got our content that we're presenting in a in a way that's exciting fun and effective and we've also got to continue to check in on our social emotional well-being of our students make sure they're doing okay make sure that that that's being met as well so a lot of pieces but i think if we start early enough here which is what we keep eating that drum for and really start working at it uh that that experience can be provided thank you that's a good point you know you hearing anything from the teachers at your school about what they're asking for i think similar to what's been already mentioned just trying to figure out how to do this safely right and all these rules that had existed before that prevented some of these interactions to happen so there's definitely teachers who wanted to do more like zoom like class styles but they couldn't because of the restrictions and the policy so i mean it's daunting i mean i think i can say that montgomery township um teachers were amazing like literally between friday and monday they somehow came up with this program that we were just amazed that they could even put it together you could see the progress through the spring like what they did in march was so different than what they did in may because they had experience right um but it's a really really daunting task and to kind of go off of you know checking in the emotional well-being of students um you know speaking as on behalf of all the parents here i think checking in with the emotional well-being of the parents is so key too um it's a lot i mean we're all stuck in this phase of like prolonged exposure to stress right and if you think about what it does to all of our mental health like um you know i'm a mental health clinician i see this with the clients that i work with just to prolong the exposure and you know reminder not only to take care of your students here but as parents to take care of yourself too because how you manage your own stress about around this really impacts how it trickles down to um the students and sometimes when i hear the comments from parents being really frustrated you know it's not always about you know towards the students or i mean towards the school it's sometimes i think it's just this is a really really tough situation to be in and so we're feeling the impact of this prolonged stress all throughout that's a good point thanks yoona i'm gonna before we get to the next question i just want to some people claim into this a little bit later and i just want to reintroduce our panelists so everyone knows who they're hearing from we have sean spiller who is the vice president of njea the mayor of montclair a parent and a high school teacher in wayne we have euna kim who was just speaking eunice the president of montgomery elementary the mom to two daughters and a licensed clinical social worker hence why she was able to speak so well about that topic and we have dr mike caraggio dr mike is a practicing pediatrician in clinton he is on staff at hunterdan medical center and he was named as one of new jersey family's favorite kids docs and of course we have congressman malinowski so thank you again for everybody who came late and hope that now you know who you're hearing from thank you so much ruth i think our next question is going to be from diana she has a question about funding for teachers if you could pressure on me partner with the college of new jersey to offer their off-cam master's degree program and do teacher staff development and a lot of what we talk about in our courses with teachers is hands-on activities uh inclu incorporating the arts you know active science experiments those kinds of things so if you could please talk about funding for teachers they already spend a ton of money in their classrooms for a basic materials pencils tissues hand sanitizer those kinds of things who is going to fund the materials that kids will need at home to do the kinds of hands-on activities that teachers can orchestrate in their virtual learning yeah good point good question anyway well i'll just chime in here to say um that in as we're negotiating this hopefully next bill hopefully we get an agreement one of the points that i've been making and a lot of my colleagues have been making is that whether we go virtual or in person it's going to cost money because each model requires extras extra investments they're different depending on which model you choose but they will still be extra and so we don't need to know from a washington perspective exactly what new jersey's going to do and montana is going to do and california is going to do we just need to know that every part of the country is going to be struggling with this and we're going to need resources at a time remember revenue to our state government our municipal governments is down because of the economic shutdowns and our state and municipal governments have to balance their budgets they cannot print money and so if there's not federal relief they can't even meet their current expenses much less the extra expenses that we're going to incur if we really want to take care of our of our kids so that's why this is so important to get that state and local relief some of which will be specifically dedicated for schools um but all of which will be important great thank you um thank you so much our next question is going to be from joseph wright joseph has a question about his own children who have ieps and health issues hey joseph can you press the unmute button on your zoom i think that will uh solve the solve the problem you with us joseph i don't think it's working um no i want to move to the next the next question all right why don't we go to terry she had a question specifically for sean about the difference between preparation and training terry hi sean um a person who has been very active this summer with her district and um school trying to prepare for the um reopening um we've spent a lot of preparation time trying to make this happen and try to think of all angles to make it safe and effective but i don't think we're there and i know definitely we have not been trained in any of the new resources that are out there beyond what we taught ourselves back in the spring how do we make that happen i mean people are very anxious teachers are very anxious about this because we want to do what's best for our kids in any situation that we're in and we really haven't had the training so far well thanks for the comment uh terry in question and i would say that's why i think conversations like this and again i appreciate that the congressman for for bringing this all together are so important right this has been a journey i think for many it's been an attempt of course a valiant one as i noted before to look at systems that would bring us back safely um but more broadly uh we're at where where you just uh what you just said right we're not there yet to do something uh i think that everyone is comfortable enough with on a district by district basis uh and shame on us if we are not looking at some of these other pieces and i don't think we've spent enough time on that and i think okay we we're working on a lot of pieces we're at this point now but in really short order and you've heard a lot of people on this zoom so far uh you know call in you know zoom in with these types of questions hey our virtual experience that we had last time we want it to be a different experience this time this next time and i don't care if you're a proponent of some type of hybrid or in person uh or not yet uh your son daughter in all likelihood is going to have some virtual experience at some time based on just the again a lot of the things noted already on this zoom so we have got to shift to a real conversation around what are the platforms that districts need to be helping their educators learn and understand and work with what are the trainings that can be offered what are the trainings that can be relied upon with the expertise of of current educators in each district in each building what are the pieces that can be supplemental to give a rich robust experience what are as was previously noted maybe some of the at-home pieces that can be sent home to parents as a science teacher myself to help with you know lab experiments and other pieces you know these are the conversations that i think would get us to a really exciting and robust distance learning uh distance teaching experience and i think we've got to you know really pivot to a strong focus there as much as it is so valid all the talk that we're having around you know ppe and sanitizing classrooms and and how long it's going to take to get our tests back and and all of those things are important for when we've got to get back uh but they are they are absolutely taking up some of that space taking up some of that opportunity to focus on the very thing that you're talking about and i hope everyone's recognizing the thing that so many have brought up on this on this zoom you know having a really great virtual experience so that has to happen hopefully uh you even asking that question or us being part of this conversation helps to move uh move the needle uh and get us to to that a little sooner than later so that our students and our staff are comfortable with what they receive and are excited about the learning they receive in uh when schools come back in september great thank you um okay so okay so i guess our next question is going to be from mary ellen marilyn are you there can you unmute yourself hi marielle and i'm trying to mute you if you could just press the a mute button on your zoom can you hear me now yeah yep we can go ahead mary mary ellen um i wanted to get back to something that uh congressman malinowski had said at the beginning of the meeting and he was talking about getting uh financing for the schools through um the uh current bill in congress and i had read some i read on the internet and i know you don't believe everything you read on the internet so i wanted to verify i'm doing a little fact checking but i had read that the current bill includes two billion dollars for military spending and nothing at all for education and um i wanted to know if that was true first of all and if it is true what do we do about it so there are there are two proposed bills one is the heroes act which is the big bill that we passed in the house of representatives now more than two months ago because we knew that we were going to need more um and that's been sort of waiting on senator mcconnell's desk uh along with a lot of other stuff and it's kind of our opening proposal it's big it's 3.4 trillion dollars it's unemployment benefits extension it's uh it's the 1200 stimulus checks it's a very generous amount of money for state and local government relief it's child care um it's the snap program for uh for for kids who need food assistance um that was what we proposed then a couple of weeks ago senator mcconnell um finally presented his counter offer this is the what you will read about is the senate republican bill it was about a trillion dollars so less than one-third of what we had put forward there is money for education in that bill to be fair there is some money set aside for schools although some of it is conditioned on the schools physically reopening so they proposed using the money as leverage to force states to make the decision to physically reopen which i personally object to i don't think washington should be telling us to reopen schools i think washington should be helping us to reopen schools by fighting the disease and giving us these resources so there is money in there for education but tied to reopening nothing for state local and county governments and you're right there was amazingly bizarrely not two but i think something like 13 or 14 trillion dollars for weapon systems um that the pentagon didn't even ask for it's just basically for defense contractors to you know make more money uh building helicopters and planes for the air force and the army um and i was you know i'm i'm a pro-defense member of congress i'm i'm willing to defend a robust defense budget but that has no business in a covid relief bill there was also some money in there for the fbi building which president trump asked for um look all that's going to be gone like we're not we we we're not going to approve anything like that and i think the senators knew that so the real question now is can we get an agreement on the basic fundamental things that i think most reasonable people agree we still need to do and that does mean some extension of the unemployment benefits because you don't want people to go from 600 to zero overnight with the economy still where it is it must in my view mean um generous aid for our state county and local governments because that's what supports education in our country not to mention our police our fire our public works all the stuff that touches our lives we've talked about that it must include funding to protect the post office i know this isn't the main subject of our call this evening but um this is a three alarm fire for me when the president has admitted openly that he is holding up our mail our prescriptions our social security checks if you're a small business and you're relying on mail to get your product to people but he's holding that up because he he doesn't want us also to be able to cast absentee ballots in november it's just crazy and so that's something we're fights not a lot of money but we're fighting for for that to be in this bill that's what the debate is about we'll clear out all the bs all the little things that are not related to covet but we've got to get those core things in my opinion totally agree um thank you for that so uh before joseph we couldn't get him to he couldn't unmute himself but i'm gonna ask the question for him he's because i think it may pertain to a lot of folks on here what should i do if i have a daughter and granddaughter that both have ieps and health issues any guidance for many of our panelists well i i'll i'll just start by saying um you know difficult to offer any type of broad advice because we know those individualized plans are are that for a reason they're they're specific to a student's needs so you know i wouldn't offer any kind of broad you know suggestions without knowing exactly what's there but i think it speaks to the issue of we have a lot of students in our schools who do need individualized plans to help them the best way we can learn and to make sure they're safe for sure it was also noted in the question you know what needs to be done what can be done i think again depending on what we're talking about and again without knowing the sooner we get to understanding a situation where we have uh virtual distance learning instruction we can also look at what are some other pieces that can be provided it was alluded to before when and one of the questions was around bringing activities home to students you know sending them home whether it be science uh labs or other pieces there can be other components as well if there's a very small uh sample size let's say of of students who need certain things there might be a you know limited you know settings where they could you know come for whatever is needed or be given provisions that allow them to you know understand additional topics or present it in a different way you know educators if it's a specific learning component can talk about all right this is the broad platform we're teaching our classes on but we're also going to offer this supplemental piece for those students who need it those with an iep that that might pertain to this um that's going to help them you know learn what we just presented in this other way in a different way because we know according to their iep uh that this will help them a little more so there's a lot of pieces that can be discussed around that again i think that's it's so unique and specific to the student but i think that's the granular level that you know educators want to get down to looking at as soon as you know we know these more broader you know pieces like what platform are we using you know what training is there you know some of the things we've heard already uh but then let's get down to that specific piece when we as educators are having our small group discussions uh with our amongst ourselves and we talk about students needs and how we can best meet them you know those are the things that you talk about as to how we can tweak something bring something else in and support the learning experience for each student yeah i think um you know i think so much of this has to do with kids that already tend to struggle and how do we make sure that they are struggling not the ones who are bearing the brunt of this and i think um i actually we have a question from jordana horn who that along those lines go ahead jordana hi um so i have a two-part question first of all thank you all so much for giving this forum and for answering our questions because we need guidance really desperately um i'm speaking as a parent of six kids as a sister of educators and i have a lot of educators for my friends and um we're all like really worried i'm sure that's news to all of you i'm sure you were you're surprised to hear that um so i guess it's a two-parter and so one is with regard to in-person um what can we do to make sure that students and staff have the ppe that they need in order to go back safely because as you know it's still hard to get the right masks to get gloves to get clorox wipes etc and the other part of my question is that here we are the schools are in this impossible position of being required to open and we as parents we have no compass we just have this like magnetic north of magical thinking that somehow like it's all going to be okay so i wanted to ask are you willing to say and to give formal guidance to say that if you are able to keep your children home please do because that would allow schools to focus their resources on the kids who really need to be in school and would keep it safer for those kids and for the staff that have to be there in person that's it that's all i got that's it she's got some really easy questions um congressman you want to take the ppe part and then maybe um sean and dr mike and junior can take the second part yeah well we are we're better off on ppe than we were in the spring obviously um you know in my canvas of the school districts talking to administrators um some tell me we're fine we're we got what we need but but honestly some have told me no there are still some shortages of basic things and too many have told me that they've benefited greatly from volunteer sewing masks for them i mean it's inspiring it's wonderful but we shouldn't be dependent on parents sewing masks for for schools um so you know again my message for the state you know from the federal level my job is to get money for the state but my message for the state is you need these things to be as centralized as possible because um what we learned on ppe is that when everybody's out there scrounging for it and competing against each other it's more expensive it's harder to find some people are better than others of finding things and and you know the state now has a lot of experience in um in figuring this out there's just you know they just announced a program for small businesses to acquire ppe is a really great initiative from the governor where there will be approved providers and a website and you can you know any small business that needs it can figure out very quickly where to get it and they get a discount we need that for schools if there's going to be any in-person reopening because again i don't know i don't think our educator should be saddled with with with the responsibility of like getting black market masks um so you know again that's something unconveying i think we're mostly okay but mostly is not good enough it's got to be a hundred percent thank you um sean do you want to talk go to address jordan's question about you know whether those parents who can should keep their kids home what do you think about that uh my short answer is yes you know i think that's the case um i think that as as broadly as possible that we can say the longer we can delay this to make sure that we address all of these pieces and there's been so many great questions raised here um the better off we're all going to be we are seeing what's happening in other states we noted before you know the top people noted what's happening in states that have brought students back and how many already in quarantine and what this leads to i mean it's just you know it's it's right there we know how devastating this virus is i think uh we all know the pressure though that that's pushing the other way right the challenges that that come with with trying to keep kids home and and the disruption it is and but it's it's a disruptive time so uh my short answer is yes i think the more we can keep our students uh in a virtual experience here i think the safer they're gonna be i think the the the better schools are going to be able to meet their educational needs uh and even as it spills over into that i know it's not directly ppe but when we talk about what districts need you know some of the ones that strike me and especially when we're doing this piecemeal way you know some districts might have what they need in the sense of you know i've seen plans where their their plan of between classroom you know classes coming in for for a teacher they're giving like a box of wipes and you've got to have the kids wipe down the desks and everything else right and you're like well you know how long is that well it's a box per what you know like how how long you think this is going to last like how you know and all these core questions you're like well your plans you you think you've got what some of these basics are but um i'm not sure you really do right so i think that you know we're worried on a lot of fronts as to what that looks like and and again i think if we can go back to and so many do experience it i i think if you talk to a lot of parents they will talk about you know oh you know for for some of these opportunities or some of these classes for some of my kids we had this great virtual experience and they did this and they did that it was fun um if if we can try and incorporate some of these pieces there's a really robust you know quality educational program that can happen in a distance way and we can make sure that our students and our staff are safe and then as we get to a safer place we know that science and this is changing all the time the data is and of course our advancements are changing we can get to a place where we all feel more comfortable in having more and more and more of an in-person component so short answer yes i think less in person better i'll keep it simple dr mike what do you think from a healthcare perspective well you know i remind everybody it's not all doom and gloom at shorten there is a lot on the horizon the entire world is working on this you hear things like vaccines you hear monoclonal antibodies you hear nanoproteins newer antiviral drugs but most importantly also research starting to come back of what works and what doesn't work and i don't think you have to look at this as this is going to be a five-year plan okay i think this is going to be a tough winter i think that we have to take that into account but that is light at the end of the tunnel um and i i in my own community saw that school's putting out surveys for parents who wanted to virtual school who wanted in school and i think some of that was okay you know how do we spread the population but that being said um i agree next year things will be a heck of a lot easier and you know you've got one child you've decided to send and sue hybrid and one to say so what what's your thought on this right there so i mean to what you're saying jordana i think our responsibility as parents is to know our kids too and what works and what doesn't i mean like this is where it's really an individual decision based on your family's needs your kids needs so as i mentioned i have a rising second grader and a fourth grader and initially the discussion was that they would both start hybrid because they wanted to meet their teachers but the other piece was i had to set a very realistic expectation that school in september is going to look very different so my kids are imagining they're going to go back in september run to see their k you know their friends they haven't seen the hug play on the playground and i had to really paint the realistic picture of like this is what it's going to look like when you go back to school in september and here's where your responsibility lies in terms of making sure everyone is safe and my six-year-old flat out said i'm not doing that like i can't do it right and so as much as i want to send her because i do think i'd love for her to at least meet her teacher physically once right but realistically i know like for me as a responsible parent like i can't send my six-year-old knowing that the teacher is gonna have to spend so much of her energy making sure that she's not touching things she's not supposed to you know keeping her mask on so that's how i came to my decision and i think that's the common theme a lot of the parents discussions are having that really there is no blanket right answer wrong answer there's so much variability in what's going into your decision making things are ever changing so you have to make a decision what's for in the best interest of your your family and i know um there's a lot of discussions about people pulling out their kids and doing homeschooling and you know if that's what works for you now again like that like dr mike said this is not what's going to happen for the next 20 years like we're in this crisis at some point it is going to end i think all of us would feel a lot better if we knew even if it was going to end a year from now like if we knew like what we're working towards and the ambiguity is really really hard but this too shall pass and we're going to be able to be in a different era where we can negotiate some of these things everyone is really stressed but you know this like this is temporary like we are gonna work through this um and i know a lot of the parents also feel like well is my child gonna be behind the next child and you know like we're all in this together everyone's in the same boat and just remind like everyone's in the same boat so i don't think one person has a clear advantage over the next like these are all things that we're trying to negotiate and the last thing i want to just plug in is i think this is where community resources are tremendously helpful you know i discovered along the way like my neighbor has talent that i never knew she had so like this is a time where even if large group meetings can't happen i think we've all agreed that smaller in-person gatherings are safe and they're safe ways to do that so like if you have resources to share like those people who knew how to sew like go you know all those people who got aids in their homemade classes back in 7th grade this is where you're shining but you know this is where i think the community aspect is so important like if you have something to offer like offer it to your neighbors if you know reach out like there are so many resources out there without all of us having to figure it out on our own and i think that's what a lot of the theme here has been that like share what we know and let's we're going to get through this excellent so yuna thank you thank you all of our panelists i think we're going to end there because i'd like to end on a high note that we will all i know there were so many questions that we didn't get to um but i hope that you all found this helpful and i want to give congressman malinowski an opportunity to say a few words and then we're going to be done thank you well i like i like where we ended and um and thank you both for reminding us that there's light at the end of the tunnel like everything we've been doing um these last few months it's all about buying time it's about buying time for science to catch up with this disease and to give us treatments and vaccines that work we'll we'll get there um and then we'll be able to to live with it and get back to something that resembles normal but hopefully with greater preparedness and understanding that this is that fighting these global pandemics has got to be a bigger priority for our country um so we've been buying time with the money with the closures with um all of the the painful decisions that we are all making uh with regard to our schools um but uh but yes we are all in this together we we are all um uh sacrificing together uh the new state of new jersey i think has done better than just about any state in this country after having been hit harder than any state in the country we were actually the hardest hit state and our rate of transmission just dipped back down below below one we should all feel a tremendous sense of pride that through community effort shared sacrifice and decisive action by our leaders we we did that we showed it could be it could be done um so this is not going to be easy it's not going to be normal but we are going to get through this together and i'll continue to do all i can to try to get our state our communities the help that we need to make it even easier so thank you all for being part of the discussion um you know we'll i'm gonna continue the outreach i do these these zoom calls all the time so if you follow our social media you'll be able to sign up for the next one and and um hopefully eventually we'll be talking about something other than the pandemic okay thank you so much thank you sean yuna dr mike of course congressman thank you all for for joining us tonight um have a wonderful evening and stay safe out there thank you everybody thank you

is a member of the natural resources uh committee on the hill uh congressman welcome you know putin has used oil as a weapon how did europe and us to a much much lesser extent how did europe end up having to rely on vladimir putin in order to keep its lights on and and the folks they're warm yeah good to be with you eric and when american energy policy is weak that means russia is stronger and what we've seen is a weak energy policy from the far left and the bible administration which has been an attack on domestic energy here in the u.s you know they have uh an agenda that's created bad policy but what they don't have is a coherent plan that actually solves our energy problem what exactly would you like to see uh we've got to open up american energy for business we have to uh biden has to back off on his war on u.s energy it started on day one with cancellation of the keystone xl pipeline his moratorium on leases on federal onshore and offshore that has to be removed but we need to be developing all kinds of energy not just fossil fuels we need to be looking at nuclear and hydro at fossil fuels at wind and solar but this administration thinks that electric vehicles are going to solve the world's problems and you need wind and solar and they're they're in a vacuum they're not looking at the rest of the world they're ignoring the fact that china built 38 gigawatts of coal power plants last year our energy policy needs to be to provide reliable affordable energy and guess what we can make it the cleanest in the world here in the united states you know the administration we heard gensake i mean they're saying look they're 19 000 oil licenses available look they're saying it's the oil companies that are that are giving it to us the fact that they're trying to deflect from the policy that biden started in the debate with bernie sanders that said he wanted to shut down fossil fuels the actions that this administration has taken these 9 000 permits that they're talking about that is that doesn't tell the whole story just because you have a permit doesn't mean that you can drill on a or develop a field that doesn't mean that you have all the other permits and regulatory loopholes check so that you can go in and develop it if american energy producers could be producing energy they would be producing it and plus this administration has created an environment where investors are scared to invest in fossil fuels because they know there's an all-out attack on it so this is not only hurting investment on public lands but also on private lands where you don't have near the regulatory loopholes to go through investors are backing off because they can't make a long-term investment knowing that this administration has openly declared war on u.s domestic energy well you know it's also vladimir putin experts are saying that the russians had a strategy over in europe get this that they supported climate activists and others to get off of nuclear to end fracking and that was part of putin's strategy over the last decade plus in order to sell europe more gas and oil let me read you what activist michael schellenberger has written about this i mean this is pretty astounding he writes quote climate activists partly funded by russia blocked fracking in 2014 nato secretary general revealed russia was funding climate activists saying quote russia engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organizations working against shale gas to maintain dependence on imported russian gas russia exports three times more gas than europe produces why because climate activists partly funded by russia blocked fracking finally congressman does it surprise you that putin may have been sitting in the kremlin trying to back some of these groups to end nuclear power so that he could uh hold the west hostage by selling them more oil and gas not at all eric and like you said putin had a stress they'll have an agenda we do not have a sound energy policy here and it's not just putin it's china as well that's promoting all this uh you know no fracking uh attacking our domestic energy production here so that they can have the energy and produce the things that we need to buy here in the united states russia and china are not backing off on carbon emissions and carbon is a it's a global issue we can't solve the world's prop carbon problem here in the u.s alone so we have to have a strategy and a plan that actually works where we're at right now is not workable we have to change gears and start producing domestic energy at a rapid pace arkansas councilman bruce westerman thank you for your insight that's pretty stunning that this could be part of the geopolitical efforts by putin to put a stranglehold on us which he in a way at least for europe has congressman thank you thank you eric and eric of putin's war

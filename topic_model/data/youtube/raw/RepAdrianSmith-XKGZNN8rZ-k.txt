Thank You mr. chairman and thank you to our panel of witnesses today I think this is an important topic that we have a discussion about let me first say that I believe paid family leave and does have broad support and I can't speak for everyone else but I that's that's my sense of it however I think the legislation we are actually discussing today has a number of serious flaws it certainly concerns and appears that it could be actually a bad deal for a lot of families that's often obviously what we get with a one-size-fits-all solution but let's revisit an example I've used more than once this year under the tax cuts and Jobs Act a single mother with two kids has zero federal income tax obligation until her income surpasses $50,000 per year the social security plan we had a hearing on earlier this year would raise this same Mother's taxes by about $1,200 per year by the time it's tax increases are fully implemented this mom is also looking at increases in the gas tax that she pays to get to work increased energy taxes proposed under the green new deal and increased taxes to pay for Medicare for all under the agenda we see currently in place proponents of the bill we are discussing today claim that they will need to raise taxes on this single mom and by only supposedly 0.4% to pay for the proposal however we know from a recent study the tax rate needed to fully cover the cost of this program is actually 2.9 percent and mr. Chairman I would ask for unanimous consent and to submit for the record the study from the American action forum that does discuss the details so ordered us thank you what does that 2.9 percent tax increase add up to for this single mom ultimately that is about 58,000 dollars in taxes out of her pocket over a 40-year working career to put that in perspective someone earning $50,000 per year would be paid approximately eighty three hundred dollars over a 12-week span of using this program if it was enacted at that rate and the single mom would have to access the program for twelve weeks at least seven times to break even just just break even on the $58,000 we are asking her to pay into the program this certainly isn't robbing Peter to pay Paul it's actually robbing Peter to pay Peter Paul Thomas Simon and probably Zacchaeus too instead of focusing on how we can raise taxes on hardworking Americans to create a program we should be focusing on new ways to empower businesses to provide the paid leave benefits we know they want to be able to they want to be able to provide this includes continuing existing incentives incentives and making it easier for small businesses to band together to provide these benefits Ms Greg ler we keep hearing and hearings like this one in a previous one on Social Security that employees will only pay half the tax because their employer would pay the other half in reality can you speak to where the other half which is considered to be the employer share where it would actually come from yes the economic consensus is always any costs associated with employing somebody the burden will come down to that employee themselves and we've heard from small business owners Kerry Lucas herself who employs about 25 women said they even though she already has a paid family leave policy this Act would cause her the new higher taxes would cause her to change the policy she has and have to reduce compensation for those workers whether it's lower wages lower benefits or something else this costs have to be spread to the employees themselves so with a macro view would actually downward pressure on on the wages themselves is that what I hear you say yes particularly among the lower income people who don't have access to plans already employers who already pay a plan they can recoup those costs by not providing that plan anymore and just pushing those costs under the federal program for employers who don't have a plan already they're going to have to puts its costs down to the worker thank you and I do want to also bring up the fact that self-employed workers we know they have to pay both sides of that equation and certainly that is common among agriculture and my main constituency farmers and ranchers are self-employed and have to pay both sides of that equation and certainly this would have a I think a very unique impact on them but nonetheless a a burden if you will and that the benefits would would unlikely be felt as well so I hope that we can take a thoughtful approach to this realizing that flexibility as McGregor you point out as a mother of six and that flexibility is key as so that employees can work with their employers to ultimately meet their mission and thank you Thank You mr. chairman thank the general

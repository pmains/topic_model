mr. speaker my amendment is very straightforward it would make clear the two laws enacted several decades ago to manage the after-effects of industrial toxic waste spills would not apply to everyday emissions that are simply away life on family farms across the country there's an earlier this year overturned the EPA exemption for agriculture from reporting requirements under the Superfund emergency planning and community rights to no laws this court decision means that over 100,000 farmers and ranchers will be forced to report low-level odor emissions from livestock and poultry if farmers and ranchers don't submit these reports they face potential lawsuits from the government and any citizen who wishes to sue them subjecting these farmers and ranchers to penalties as high as fifty three thousand nine hundred and seven dollars per day for not filing paperwork farmers will lose time and money that would otherwise be spent growing our nation's food supply Mr Speaker I think that it's important that I note that the Obama administration as well as the Bush administration defended this exemption this is not a partisan issue this is simply a case of reaffirming congressional intent under the law is the EPA already tried to do several years ago I urge all members to vote in favor of my amendment and I reserve the balance of my time

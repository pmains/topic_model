you know listen to my colleagues discuss the failure of the legislative process would be comical approximately 125 americans hadn't died of gun violence in the past 24 hours today while we debate a very modest attempt to address an epidemic of gun violence in our nation another 125 americans will die over the weekend while pundits discuss what we did or did not do in washington this week 250 more americans will die at the hands of lethal weapons this week while we pour over a decision by our highest court that is ill-informed misguided and out of touch 875 americans will die violently 1250 citizens in this country will lose their lives in those 10 days they will leave families behind that will grieve their loss and they will deal with the senselessness of it all with the full knowledge that their so-called leaders care so little about their lives they drone on about the need to protect law-abiding citizens to possess lethal weapons and impose virtually no requirement on those citizens to act responsibly or to have accountability for their actions in the next month while americans celebrate the founding of this extraordinary nation 300 3750 of our fellow citizens will die those citizens will be black white and brown they will be children teens middle-aged and elderly they will be collar and blue collar they will live in big cities suburban towns and rural communities they will leave behind families that will never ever celebrate life's important milestones birthdays anniversaries graduations job promotions retirements if we sit here this morning and talk americans are begging for action 70 percent of them believe we have failed they want gun laws that are sensible and reasonable they want the carnage to stop and they want congress to care about them and their lives they don't understand why we can't adapt to a world filled with ar-15s and ak-47s and ghost guns and high-capacity magazines instead of the world that folks like madison and hamilton john jay wrote about in the 18th century when the great threat wasn't the private right of arms but the overreach of a central government does the federal government not have the wisdom or the will to protect its citizens and make certain we can require responsible gun ownership this bill is limited my colleagues have talked about it as much as i appreciate the work of the senate it doesn't go nearly far enough we've done we've dealt with this over the weeks in the past it offers however some hope that the massive violence and carnage can be stopped so let's be worthy of our duties and our responsibilities please please please americans are looking to us this is the time to act and i will support the rule and the underlying bill i appreciate all the work by my colleagues to get us even this far uh and with that uh mr chairman field back

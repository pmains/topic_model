mr president i rise today to honor the lives of four hoosiers who were lost tragically in a car accident this week edith schmucker zachary potts emma thompson and representative jackie walorski we grieve them all and we pray for their family and friends this is of course a profoundly difficult time for those of us who who knew one or more of these hoosiers it's such a difficult time for their families and their friends and all of us i know we commit to do whatever it is in our power to comfort their loved ones in the difficult days ahead like everyone here and back home in indiana i am absolutely heartbroken i think one thing that hit everyone particularly hard was the loss of two young congressional staff members whether you knew zack or emma personally or not you certainly know their type if you're watching these proceedings from capitol hill you know the type of of hard-working smart committed young person that comes to work on a congressional staff they dedicate so much of their time their talents other opportunities are given up in order to serve their country to work towards the betterment of their nation we should celebrate their accomplishments while we grieve their laws it's a reminder i think for all of us to thank the many congressional staff members who who do much more than the public will ever know i want to take a few minutes today to pay tribute to our colleague right here in the halls of congress jackie willorski jackie and i came to congress roughly the same time she two years after i and and i'll never forget when she arrived here at the u.s capitol jackie didn't need time to get her sea legs no jackie knew that she belonged here jackie understood that this was her calling she she didn't need people to tell her that she belonged she got right to work because she had some things to accomplish i have to say her her confidence was infectious everyone saw it everyone was impressed by it people loved being around her and including me jackie had so many other amazing qualities and i'd like to highlight a number of those today she was always so full of energy it was a positive energy she was she was a lightning bolt she could light up a room like no other in fact in in my observation she she only had two speeds it was full bore on and and off she was high spirited and and full of fire jackie also had a really big heart in fact her heart was as big as it was good she wore it on her sleeve every day every moment of the day she didn't hide her convictions in fact she made sure that they were expressed in the boldest most colorful fashion her convictions were deeply helped she was proud of them it's what made jackie jackie it was she she was a deep conviction clearly not just with respect to her politics no it came from a deeper place she had deep convictions with respect to her religious faith i have to say for all the many speeches i saw her deliver for all the people i saw her energize it was often after she delivered a prayer and i saw her deliver a number of those that audiences gave their most heartfelt ovations jackie was a larger than life figure but jackie was never fake she was never contrived she was beloved in fact because she inspired and motivated people with a passion that was so authentic so human and jackie cared about the people she connected with she was genuinely concerned she was what you might call the genuine article jackie was also very smart not just energetic she was very smart as a member of the house ways and means committee you could see that on a regular basis but even in a casual conversation jackie had a habit of cutting right to the issue but more importantly jackie was smart about the people she represented she knew their hearts she knew their concerns she knew their challenges she knew their aspirations she studied them she lived it she stayed in touch with them she never forgot who she worked with she never forgot who she worked for and she never forgot who sent her to washington jackie also had courage she was a fearless leader you see this in in your best leaders she didn't flinch in the face of tough votes well jackie was smart enough to know the consequences but she wasn't afraid she did what she thought was right she did it for the right reasons and she had enough self-confidence to go explain her votes to her constituents it was at once a confidence in herself but it was also a confidence and and those she represented she was a leader confident in her own abilities and and confident in the abilities of of those around her if there's a single memory of of jackie's time in this building the us capitol and i'd say her time in the indiana state house it was that she is indeed a leader since jackie's passing i've had the opportunity to to discuss her service her life with a number of people and this keeps coming up she was a real leader this is what they're talking about for all these amazing qualities i have to say personally there's something else that i keep coming back to it's the first thing i come back to when i think of jackie and it's it's frankly it's it's very personal to me i'm going to miss jackie's laughter oh she had a beautiful bellowing laugh uninhibited so authentic not contrived it came from a place where she appreciated humor she appreciated at times the absurdity of life she always had a joke at hand or a funny observation to make or maybe she had read something recently she wanted to share with me but we had so many great laughs together and she could make my side hurt in fairly short order i'm going to miss that it's really hard to believe that our paths won't ever cross again they crossed so frequently sometimes in this building but typically it was in indiana's second congressional district back home it was rare i'd say that i didn't go into that region and encounter her or at least follow in her tracks she was she was so active so engaged i'm gonna miss those encounters just a few weeks ago i i had an opportunity to visit with jackie in person we shared some laughs of course it was at a dinner in elkhart county we're scheduled to be together this coming week to attend a ribbon cutting ceremony she was constantly on the road serving doing her job it's not too far it's not too much to say that that was her calling it's also not too much to say that jackie's last breath was spent in service in service to her constituents to her god to the great state of indiana to her country to her calling jackie loved them she was ever faithful to all of those things to the great benefit of indiana and america and for that i am grateful for that we loved her back and will miss her dearly that be her legacy i yield to my colleague from indiana

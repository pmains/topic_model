so I met dan at a good friend's home my childhood friend she introduced us and we were friends first for quite a while and my parents were stationed out in California at the time and they had a fabulous backyard and so we would have barbecues and Dan all of our friends would come over and Dan be there and he would hang out with my dad and he actually became good friends with my dad first and we dad really liked him so after that barbecue that dan hung out with my dad he ended up asking me out later that week he asked me on our first date and he was quite the gentleman which I loved about him and he picked me up and took us to a nice dinner and half liked their dinner I think is what I do that he was the guy for me so and 2012 Dan was on deployment in Afghanistan and it was a long deployment it was nine months so at the end at the very end of month six going to the beginning of month seven I received a phone call at 610 and one and it was the phone call saying that Dan had been involved in an incident and that she was currently in surgery and that was you know life life changed then Oh dan was in a medically induced coma at the time and on a breathing too and he wasn't stable enough to be flown again Stan so we we waited waited for several days then there was a miracle and danced stabilized enough to be flown to Germany and I think that Dean and I live our life knowing that he did come home and others those that we love did not many over the years of not come home and so it's very important to us to continue serving to continue the mission and serving the American people in any way we can and we owe to them that that's what we'll continue to do so something that I greatly admire about Dan is his strength no matter what it's happening when we were in the hospital shortly after he'd been flown in from Germany the doctors informed us that they didn't believed in would see again for me this it was very difficult news to hear and Dan was completely blind and he reached out and set my name and took my hand and he told me that everything was gonna be okay and he'd just been told that he would probably never see you again but it was incredibly strong for me and he told me not to worry Dan will always be that person I've watched Dan have strong faith even during the hardest moments of our life I've watched Dan give strength to others when times are very difficult and that is something I've always been incredibly proud of him for doing when everything is crazy around you and you feel like the world's falling apart because the person you love was just thought up by a bomb he's the person to tell you it's gonna be okay not to worry even when he's the one that's been blown up which i think is incredible dan is incredibly driven when he was told he would have to be medically retired from the military this was of course our day we thought Dan would be in the military for 20 years and ended up being 10 years and the next day he woke up and he told me that he was gonna figure out a way to keep serving and he was going to apply to the top policy schools and he did and he got into everyone that he applied to and I was very proud of him for that and he kept moving forward he went to school he received his master's he worked very hard hit excellent grades and then he wanted to come home wanted to come home to Texas and so when I met Dan we were not in Texas he was stationed in California and I talked her when this when you meet a boy who's from Texas outside of Texas they tell you from the first day you meet them they're going home to Texas so I always knew that we were gonna come home to Texas one day and Texas boys Dano particular he's special he's a gentleman always be respectful and he's kind and he will always listen to another point of view the other side of the argument he won't necessarily agree with you but he will tell you why he disagrees with you in a nice way and in a respectful way Stan as a policy guard and I find that incredibly attractive he is someone that will research everything talk to everyone he can about if they're an expert in the field he won't come out with the policy without getting the research done looking into it seeing what the best option will be he's very thoughtful one of the reasons I fell in love with him is because he's the type of person never have to worry that he's saying one thing to your face and one thing when you're not into him everything he would say he says it to the person it's been incredible because people have really respond to that even when dance disagreeing with them we meet people at events or knocking on doors they'll tell him well I don't agree with this do you or I do agree with this do you and if he doesn't feel the same way as then he'll tell them he doesn't he doesn't lie and I really admire that because that's that's a hard position to be in when someone doesn't want to hear what you have to say or disagrees with what you have to say but to still stand true to your beliefs your values and your opinions and I think that is something that is needed in any profession but especially in Congress

hey it's congressman cure creatives today's a great day because today is the groundbreaking for the final section of la-1 which is going to be connecting level on up to golden meadow inside the hurricane protection system this route is important for a number of reasons it's not just about the economic development benefits from all of the fishing from the tourism this is a hurricane evacuation route and this is really a nationally significant corridor because it services port fusia which of course services about 90 percent of the offshore energy production in the gulf of mexico one of the largest non-tax revenue streams for the federal government this is another major milestone this was the largest grant in the nation in 2020 and as i said the last elevated section of this new improved roadway that is really key because it goes under water when you just have a strong wind on some days or high tides now look this is a big step forward for a priority but we've got many others in louisiana we're going to keep moving forward and addressing other high priorities in the state of louisiana like a new bridge crossing the mississippi river upgrades to la-1 on the west side of the river highway 30 or nicholson on the east side of the river i-10 i-12 other huge priorities in the state of louisiana but really excited about today because it marks a major milestone and checking another priority off the list

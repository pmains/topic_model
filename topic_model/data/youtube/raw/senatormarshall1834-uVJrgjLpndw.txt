you are a physician by trade you also served for seven years in the army reserve i'm going to quote you here you said american heroes should not be treated as felons because they refused the covet vaccine uh it is important to note and i know you know this prior to covet 19 there are certain vaccinations that are required for all service members so so why do you feel that this vaccine is different from other vaccines that have been imposed on service men and women you know amy i think that's a great question and a fair question as well and first of all i want your listeners to know that i support getting the vaccine i got the vaccine my parents cut the vaccine hopefully they have their booster shot by now and and all your senior uh citizen listeners should be out there talking to their doctor about the booster shot but right now 10 or 20 percent of our veteran of our soldiers are not vaccinated they're going to be separated and perhaps given a dishonorable discharge if they're giving a dishonorable discharge then that soldier is going to lose their benefits they're going to have problems getting a job in the future they'll lose their their benefits of getting a free education as well as health care why this is different is first of all half of the soldiers are already immune from the virus so why would we be forcing young healthy soldiers who have minimal problems with the virus anyway why would we be forcing them to get a vaccine which does have side effects especially for this age group we're seeing a little bit high incidence of heart enlargement from this vaccine especially for young healthy males so i encourage people to get the vaccine but i still believe it's a personal choice and we don't want those soldiers separated with a dishonorable discharge senator i know you've also been an advocate for those booster shots for seniors and we know now that the fda has authorized the pfizer vaccine booster for all seniors what are you doing in your state to make sure that seniors in kansas have access to those booster shots yeah i'm absolutely certain that our that our pharmacist our health departments have an adequate supply of supply of these uh we have been pushing the fda for actually over two months now to approve it so it is happening we it's all teed up i have confidence that if folks call their own doctor call their own pharmacist if you're a senior citizen that you should be able to get your vaccination now your third shot now

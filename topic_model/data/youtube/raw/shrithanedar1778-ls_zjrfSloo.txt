Joshua wants to know about our water and how can we keep our water clean and pure you know we are sitting on 21 percent supply of words drinking water pure water and we as the stewards have a responsibility to protect our Great Lakes and to do that we must ensure that we shut down Enbridge line five immediately it is a ticking time bomb and if that line ever breaks it will create a huge problem secondly I will make sure companies like Nestle can no longer steal our water currently Nestle has a sweetheart deal they can take as much water as they want from our Great Lakes for $200 a year I will put a name to that in terms of drinking water we've seen what happened in Flint when the governor tried to run this state like a business his emergency managers tried to save a little bit of money and ended up poisoning the citizens of Michigan in the Flint area it is important that we replace all of the LED lights not only in Flint but we have lead lines in Detroit we have LED lines in Saginaw we have lead lines in Bay City and some of the cities in Michigan have lead levels higher than that in Flint and as a scientist and as a chemist I understand what the toxic effects of lead can be on a person's health including mental health so we are too and we owe it to the people of Michigan that we provide them clean and pure drinking water it is not a privilege but it's a fundamental right of every Michigander so Tyler wants to know about Flint so one of the thing I want to do is have a resistor II of all of the Flint residents that got exposed to lead toxicity and like lead poisoning we as a state to speed it wrong to these citizens of Flint and I want to make sure that the state monitors the health of all those that got affected and exposed to lead and I want to make sure that we provide health care free health care to these people who have been affected ah there's a question that just didn't want to ask about a lawsuit that was filed against me by the buyers of my company as you guys know two years ago I decided to sell my business and the business was doing very well but I decided to sell my business so I can devote rest of my life to public service so I sold my business in November of 2016 gave a little bit of the money to all of my 50 employees and put some money into my campaign now the business went into a slump for a short period of time maybe about seven months and the buyer got panicked and looked like they needed a scapegoat for the downturn in the business and they try just they sued me they try to negotiate with me and I told the buyer look you had four months to do the due diligence you spend over a million dollars to do due diligence to find out everything you can about this company and I haven't done anything wrong and so I refuse to settle it I refuse to pay them anything and challenge them to go sue me and that's what they did I intend to fight it and I will win it that's the kind of a leader I am I don't let anybody bully me I don't let anybody intimidate me and that kind of a strong governor I will be for Michigan and I will stand up to right-wing lawmakers if they start to just say no for the sake of saying no you know we need a governor that has a strong backbone to implement strong progressive ideas in Michigan yes I know I the question is am I going to be ready to take on the Republicans as the governor I will you know I have lived my life through a lot of adversities so I'm nothing new to adversities I am used to being an underdog I am used to operating without having much leverage because I'm a good negotiator I'm a fighter and I will take on the Republican Senate and if we are lucky we will have the house turn democratic but even if the house is not democratic I know how to get things done and I will use the power of my office the power of the veto power the governor has to make sure that we negotiate good solutions and I will certainly be open to ideas I will certainly be open to listening to all stakeholders when we are together arrive at good solutions that make sense but if the Republican Senate wants to say no for the sake of it I will stand up to them and if necessary I will go to the people of Michigan with my ideas and get support and put pressure on the lawmakers to do the right thing you know one of the first things neither did was tax the pensions of retirees just to give 1.8 billion dollar tax break to the corporations I will be happy to repeal that tax on retirees pension because state of Michigan made a commitment to the retirees and we need to let that commitment stand there is no some time I seen retirees having to make a choice between prescription medicine or food and we need to have our retirees the first responders who worked hard all their life to be able to retire in dignity then wants to know about a donation I made to the McCain campaign then I have donated about thirty two thousand dollars and usually these donations happen when a candidate or a committee of a candidate calls me or invites me to a fundraiser and 29,000 out of the 32,000 almost 90% of the money that I've donated I have donated that to Democrats there may be just one exception and that was this fundraiser that I got invited to and I went there because I wanted to question a Senator McCain about some of the immigration policies and that was the only way I can walk up to him and question him now Alex wants to know about how do we bridge a gap between the progressives and the moderates you know end of the day we are all Democrats and I think our goals are not all that different what we want to do is get away from the Republicans who are who have rigged this system in favor of the top one percent and all we all want to do all Democrats want to do is make this economy work for all not just the top one percent and I think I would be a governor not only I'll be the governor's for the progressives I will be the governor for the madrix but I will also be the governor for the Republicans and the moderate Republicans as a governor I want to make sure our government works for all of the people of Michigan and many of the problems are very common problems we need to solve problems about education take our education to the top 10% we need to fix the roads and the bridges and ensure people have clean water we need to make sure people's civil rights are not violated you know what we have seen last seven years is the attack on workers rights what we have seen is attack on women's rights and we need to protect that so I think many of us have a lot more common ground than we believe and I think I'll try to bring people together not divide them based on either our ideology or religion or color or economic status

[Music] welcome back to morning in America We are following unconfirmed reports that Iran has abolished its morality police state media in Iran for is making this report citing comments from a meeting with senior officials now it's unclear whether it's a final decision but the Iranian government has not confirmed or denied it and Nick is back now to join us with more on this report and Adrian this is definitely a direct response to the number of demonstrations that have taken place because the government is definitely hearing it and are aware the unit is responsible for enforcing the Islamic Republic's strict conservative dress code for women but now Iran's Chief public prosecutor says they have been closed if true the development would be the first major concession by the Iranian government to the protest movement that erupted following the death of Masha amini the 22 year old woman who died while in custody of the morality police while many in the west may take the news to be a sign of Hope for Iranians Iranian officials have not confirmed the move and according to some state-run news outlets the prosecutors were represented last night on news Nations weekend Prime California Congressman Jim Costa told our Natasha zubes is unlikely the regime will make any concessions we should remind ourselves the current president of Iran uh is one of the uh in his previous uh position it's one of the bloodiest rulers in in post uh uh um uh Iran history so uh I I have little confidence in the president to to make the necessary changes to restore a democratic rule in Iraq and there are others echoing that statement and we're also learning this morning that the family home of Iranian rock climber El Naz rakabi has been leveled rakabi Rose to International prominence for competing with her head uncovered just as anti-regime protests swept Iran earlier this fall now the protests in Iran have killed at least 400 people and as many as 18 000 others have been jailed and we're also following information this morning uh Adrian that protesters are calling for a three-day boycott of making any purchases in Iran well it's been tense and obviously you have to take every report that comes out of this region with a grain of salt especially as there were reports just a week and a half ago that they said she wasn't killed in custody she just died absolutely which makes it even more difficult to get the information that we need yeah Nick thank you

West Virginia has a proud
legacy of service to our country, a legacy that
often goes back generations. Mrs. Kim
Parrish of Spencer contacted my office
recently, to learn more about her late father's
service in the Air Force. Mr. George Frame of
Doddridge County served in the US Air Force in the
1950s. However, Mrs. Parrish didn't know much
more about her father's service, and she feared
that records of his service had been lost to
time. My caseworker Aidan, assisted Mrs. Parrish and
I reached out to the National Personnel Records
Center on her behalf. I'm happy to report that as a
result of our inquiry, more than 50 pages of
records were found and delivered to Mrs. Parrish. I lost my dad in 1990 to
cancer and I wasn't able to ask him anything about
his service. Now a lot of the records are lost. So
it's very difficult to find a lot of records and
you can't get them without help. And without Senator
Manchin's help I never would have obtained them.
I want to thank you, Senator Manchin, for
helping me find my family's history and
getting my dad's military records. It has meant so
much to me. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mrs. Parrish.
Your father's service will always be honored and
remembered. If you or someone you know is in
need of assistance with a state or federal agency,
please contact my office at 304-342-5855. My staff
and I are always ready to help fellow West Virginians.

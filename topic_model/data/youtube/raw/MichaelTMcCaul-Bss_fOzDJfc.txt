thank you mr chairman um mr secretary uh section one two three of the atomic energy act as you know uh requires that all significant u.s nuclear cooperation agreements must be approved by both houses of congress last year congress approved two such agreements one with south korea and the other one with great britain who are our allies however in this case when we're dealing with the world's leading state-sponsored terrorism uh the position of this administration is that that that should not be subject to approval by the united states congress i don't quite understand that distinction can you explain that to me thank you congressman i think the issue is what is the best form of an agreement uh in order uh for us to have the flexibility that we need to make sure that iran is living up to its obligations and to be able to reimpose sanctions quickly if it's not um we what we are seeking is uh and the issue here is really whether this is a legally binding agreement or not if it is a legally binding agreement it would be subject to the rules of international law on how you get into an agreement and how you get out of it which can be quite burdensome so having a non-binding agreement allows us to have the flexibility we need if necessary to snap back sanctions immediately not wait for international partners to agree uh or not agree um with regard to whether it's a treaty or not and so subject uh to the advice and consent of the united states senate as you know the vast bulk of international agreements that we've made under democratic administrations republican administrations in the non-proliferation area in the foreign policy area more generally uh in fact are not treaties uh and are not subject uh to uh the advice and consent of the senate and i can go through the list uh under the non-proliferation uh area we have everything uh from the um missile technology control regime which has been very successful uh in creating voluntary export licensing around the world uh the uh the nuclear security guidelines um and then and my times let me end i appreciate what you're saying i just think we're treating our allies different from the state sponsor of terror and i think that the american people through its should be weighing in on this deal but i know we disagree on that point icbms this concerns me greatly there's been no this has been off the table not part of the discussions at all and the intelligence community and the pentagon and its annual report on military power of iran have noted that by as early as 2015 this year they may have icbm technology missile ranges that could potentially reach as far as the united states of america and then the ayatollah the supreme leader says that to limit this program would be a stupid idiotic expectation and that the revolutionary guard should definitely carry out their program and should mass produce why in the world isn't this on the table and and does that that not concern you about their intent here yeah the missile program is absolutely a concern um which is again why uh we have been working very vigorously around the world to deny where we can iran the technology for that program and to push back against proliferation and that effort uh whether there's an agreement or not uh will persist and those sanctions uh and the various measures we're taking will continue regardless of whether there's an agreement the scope of this agreement if there is one is the nuclear program uh that's what our partners have agreed to that is what is being negotiated um it is not a missile agreement um now there are aspects of it that come into this that are critical in terms of iran's capacity to make potentially a nuclear weapon to a missile and indeed we are focused with on that because that does fall within the conflict well because that's the delivery device for a nuclear warhead exactly and so they're not backing down on that which kind of makes me question you know their whole good faith analysis here and i you know if i just say i mean when i when i read their own words president rouhani who you say is taking a different tact and trying to be a maker here says that uh in geneva agreement world powers surrendered to iranian nations will and that that's in his words and then you know they said the centrifuges are spinning and will never stop when prime minister netanyahu gave his speech to the joint session of congress iran was blowing up a mock of the uss nimitz in the red sea simultaneously i question the good faith here you have an extraordinary challenge sir and i wish you all the best but i cannot i just have to question the good faith uh on the part of iran is sir you're exactly right uh it's not a question of um of good faith it's a question and by the way whether it's uh president rouhani or the foreign minister any others uh it's not that we think these are good guys who like the united states it's that there are some people who are somewhat more pragmatic about what uh iran needs to do uh for its own interests in the future and they believe that negotiating an agreement and getting some relief from the pressure that they've been under is what makes the most sense for their country again not because they like us or have or have good intentions the other thing i would say i think it's important is that uh there are foreign statements made on a regular basis by iran's leaders on all sorts of issues in some instances though uh some of these statements are made for domestic political purposes we sometimes have a tendency to see iran as the only country on earth that doesn't have politics in fact it has very intense politics and there is a lot of politics going on right now between those in iran who would want an agreement again because they believe it's in the interest of the country and those who don't want one and some of the statements you're seeing as objectionable and as abhorrent as they may be some of those are designed for political consumption at home to push back against those who don't want an agreement thank you

LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WORKS. LET'S FOCUS ON THE BAD GUYS. LET'S MAKE OUR SCHOOLS SAFE. THANK YOU. >> THANK, YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF I OBSERVED ACCURATELY, I MIGHT BE THE LAST SENATOR TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS. AND THEN WE AS VARIANT OF AN EXTRA MINUTE OR TWO TO NOT JUST QUESTIONS BUT BEGIN BY ADDRESSING MR. WILLING HIM. I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU. I FEEL YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OBSERVATION YOU MADE A FEW MOMENTS AGO ABOUT THE THE SENATORS UP HERE ON THE DAIS, BY A LARGE, IVORY. THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND DIVERSIFYING THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY TO CONFIRM NOMINEES TO THE FEDERAL BENCH THAT ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE THAN HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST. TO BRING IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVES, NOT JUST FROM A GENDER ETHNIC PERSPECTIVE, BUT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, LIFE EXPERIENCE. MANY OF US ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO OVERTIME FURTHER AND BETTER DIVERSIFY THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN CONGRESS AS A WHOLE TO BRING MORE PERSPECTIVES AND LIFE EXPERIENCE. I SHARE YOURS. WHEN I GET HOME, I INVITE YOU TO GOOGLE DEPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA 1980S. THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP. IF YOU REALLY WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT, YEARS AGO THERE WAS THIS MOVIE BOYS IN THE HOOD. YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. MORE RECENTLY, SANTA COMPTON, I DID NOT GROW UP IN COMPTON. JUST WATCH THOSE OPENING SCENES. YOU'LL GET A FLAVOR FOR WHERE AND HOW I GREW UP. JUST SO YOU KNOW, THAT PERSPECTIVE IS PRESENT UP HERE. ON THE DAIS. MISTER CHAIR, AS YOU KNOW, I TALK ABOUT IT OFTEN, I'M NOT JUST HERE AS THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. I'M HERE AS A FATHER. OF THREE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. SO, MY HEART REMAINS BROKEN FOR THE FAMILIES AND THE FRIENDS OF THE VICTIMS IN UVALDE TEXAS. AS YOU CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDED TO THE ACTIVE SHOOTER AND MORE ABOUT THE SCHOOL SECURITY APPARATUS. THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK THERE STILL. WE CANNOT LET THAT DISTRACT FROM THE UNDERLYING ISSUES OF UNFETTERED ACCESS TO GUNS. THAT'S WHY I TOO AM ENCOURAGED BY THE -- THAT'S BEING MADE ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS HERE IN THE SENATE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT WAS ANNOUNCED THIS LAST WEEK. AMONG OTHER THINGS, WILL CLOSE THE BOYFRIEND LOOPHOLE THAT SENATOR KLOBUCHAR TALKED ABOUT. INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN MENTAL HEALTH. I HAVE A QUESTION ON THAT HERE IN A MINUTE. AND ALSO IN-HOUSE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR BUYERS UNDER THE AGE OF 21 AMONG OTHER THINGS. SENATOR MURPHY, ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE, HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB. I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO SENATOR CORNYN WHO SPOKE EARLIER FOR LEADING THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS. WE DO OWE IT. NOT JUST TO THE COMMUNITY OF UVALDE IN THE FAMILIES THERE, BEFORE THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE FOR TOO LONG BEEN IMPACTED BY SENSELESS GUN VIOLENCE. WE OWE IT TO THEM TO TAKE ACTION. BUT I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL ACHIEVE HERE IN THE DAYS A COUPLE WEEKS AHEAD WILL STILL LEAVE US WITH MORE WORK TO DO. IT WILL STILL LEAVE US WITH MORE WORK TO DO. MY FIRST QUESTION IS WERE GUARDS TO ACCESS TO GUNS. OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE SEEN A GROWING THREAT POSED BY AT-HOME KITS USED BY MANY TO BUILD UNTRACEABLE GUNS. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT RETAILERS, HOW OLD YOU HAVE TO BE, BACKGROUND CHECKS, ET CETERA. BUT GHOST GUNS ARE A GROWING CHALLENGE. LESS THAN ONE WEEK AFTER THE TRAGEDY AND UVALDE, A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY WAS ARRESTED IN BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, MY HOME STATE, FALLING REPORTS THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO RECRUIT STUDENTS TO ATTACK A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. UPON SEARCHING HIS HOME, OFFICERS FOUND PARTS TO BUILD RIFLES, THEY FOUND EXPLOSIVES, AND VARIOUS KNIVES. ALL OF WHICH HE HAD LEGALLY OBTAINED. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, OFFICERS ALSO ARRESTED A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY IN THE COUNTY FOR THREATENING TO SHOOT UP A SCHOOL AND BEING IN POSSESSION OF A GHOST GUN. A QUESTION, CHIEF WILLIAMS, I SEE YOU NODDING, IS FOR YOU. IN YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY, YOU SAY THAT CONGRESS MUST ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS AND AUTHORITIES IT NEEDS TO MITIGATE THE THREAT POSED BY PRIVATELY MANUFACTURED FIREARMS. BESIDES ESTABLISHING A PENALTY FOR OBTAINING A GHOST GUN, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU URGE CONGRESS TO DO. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. WE HAVE A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ALCOHOL TOBACCO FIREARMS, THE ATF, LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, BECAUSE OF OUR RESOURCES THAT WE DON'T HAVE, WE HAVE TO ENGAGE MORE WITH THE ATF. MARVIN RICH AND SAID, IF I MAY WITH OTHER RECORD, IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING LEAD IN THAT CAUSE. WOULD I WOULD ADVOCATE IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IS CREATING DYNAMICS WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO AS LAW ENFORCEMENT TRACE THOSE GHOST GUNS AND TRACE THOSE PARTS THAT GO TO MAKE THE GHOST GUNS. AND ONCE THAT TRACING HAPPENS, BE ABLE TO LINK THAT PERSON AND STRONGLY PROSECUTE THEM. >> THANK YOU AND I HAVE SOME FOLLOW-UP ON THAT TOPIC. I DO WANT TO JUST ADD FOR THE RECORD THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT DOES HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. THAT IS SEEKING TO RAISE THE AGE OF BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM FROM 18 TO 21. AND OTHER PROTECTIONS. AS A RESULT, THERE'S 8.5 GUN DEATHS PER 100,000 POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. 38% LESS THAN THE NATURAL AVERAGE WHICH IS 13.7. A PARTIALLY 40% LESS THAN IT IS IN TEXAS, WHERE AT 14.2. YES, SMART GUN SAFETY LAWS DO WORK. THEY'RE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY CAN BE WHEN IT'S ONLY STATE BY STATE. WE NEED FEDERAL PROTECTIONS. BY THE WAY, CALIFORNIANS ARE 25% LESS LIKELY TO DIE IN MASS SHOOTINGS. THE OTHER ISSUE I WANTED TO RAISE, MISTER CHAIR, IS IN REGARDS TO MENTAL HEALTH. NOW, I HAVE TO CONFESS, WHEN I HEARD THE FRAMEWORK THAT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEKEND, WITHOUT A ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, WITHOUT A BAN ON LARGE CAPACITY MAGAZINES, SUCH AN EMPHASIS ON MENTAL HEALTH, I PAUSED INITIALLY. IN A TIME WHERE STATISTICALLY AVERAGING OVER ONE MASS SHOOTING A DAY. MORE MASS CHAINS IN AMERICA THIS YEAR THAN DAYS ON THE CALENDAR. WE HAVE TO PAUSE AND CONSIDER THE TRAUMA INDUCING AFFECTS OF THESE WEAPONS. AND THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY CREATE HAVE ON OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. DOCTOR SZILAGYI, YOUR ORGANIZATION JOIN OTHERS AND DECLARING A NATIONAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH LAST YEAR. AMONG THE LIST OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS, YOU ALL RELEASED A CALL TO INTRODUCE FEDERAL FUNDING SO WE'RE BETTER ABLE TO SCREEN, DIAGNOSE, AND TREAT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN. CAN YOU DISCUSS SPECIFICALLY HOW THIS WOULD BENEFIT CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO GUN VIOLENCE? >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FOR THAT QUESTION, SENATOR PADILLA. YES, WE DID DECLARE A NATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. AND DECLARED BIAS FOR THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AN ACID LESSON PSYCHIATRY AND THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE AN EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS AMONG OUR YOUTH. THEY'VE ONLY BEEN GETTING WORSE. INCREASED FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN DIVERSIFY OUR WORKFORCE, AS MR. WILLING HAVE NOTED, TRAIN AND EDUCATE THE CURRENT WORKFORCE WE DO HAVE TO DO THIS WORK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY IN A TRAUMA INFORMED WAY. IN A WAY THAT IS CULTURALLY HUMBLE. SO WE CAN USE THE TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THERE ARE EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS FOR SCREENING AN ASSESSMENT FOR DIAGNOSIS. EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT. FOR FAMILIES THAT WE DO IDENTIFY OR CHILDREN WE DO, IDENTIFY ARE STRUGGLING AND HAVE DIFFICULTIES. I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE THEN TO PERPETRATE VIOLENCE. AND THAT THE FORENSIC ANALYSIS DONE IN 2019 LOOKING BACK AT ALL THE MASS SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA BACK TO 1966 FOUND THAT 100% AND THOSE WHO PERPETRATED MASS SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS ALL HAD SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA HISTORIES THE GREW UP AND VIOLENT HOMES THEY WERE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED THEY WERE BULLIED AND THEY HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNITY VIOLENCE. SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS. I THINK HAVING THE RIGHT TOOLS WILL HELP US. WE ALSO DO NEED MORE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITIES BASED HEALTH CENTERS, AS WAS NOTED TODAY, SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND INTEGRATED CARE AND PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO. I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT A COMPLEX PROBLEM DOESN'T HAVE A SIMPLE SOLUTION. I THINK ALL THE MULTIPRONGED EFFORTS AROUND APPROVED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUILDING SAFE SCHOOLS, PHYSICALLY SAFE AND EMOTIONALLY SAFE, SENSIBLE GUN LAWS AND SAFE GUN STORAGE OR ALL COMPONENTS OF THAT. >> MY WIFE MANAGES A MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCACY SO SHE EDUCATED ME. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS, MR. CHILD, WHEN YOU FIRST HAD A FRAMEWORK I HAD TO PAUSE THIS SUCH A FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH IT. WAS A CRISIS BEFORE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IT'S BEEN MADE MUCH MORE ACUTE, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND WHAT MORE THAN CONVINCED ME TO SUPPORT THE FRAMEWORK WAS AN INTERVIEW I SAW, JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, ONE OF THE TEACHERS THAT SURVIVED IN UVALDE, AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME HIS NAME IS ESCAPING ME AT THE MOMENT. BUT WHEN I SAW HIM A NATIONAL NEWS, APOLOGIZING TO THE PARENTS OF THE COMMUNITY AND OF ALL THE TO PLEASE FORGIVE HIM. HE DID EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD WIN, AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, SUCH A FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH IS USED TO FOCUS TO DISTRACT FROM THE GUN SAFETY SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION. MENTAL HEALTH COULD, WE HAVE PREVENTED IS? COULD WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A TROUBLED YOUNG PERSON? I GET IT, THAT'S PART OF A CONVERSATION THAT -- BUT I SAW THIS TEACHER POURING HIS HEART OUT AND HE SAID THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN WHO DIED ARE GOING TO NEED HELP. THE CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED ARE GOING TO NEED HELP. THE TEACHERS WHO SURVIVED ARE GOING TO DETAIL. THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO NEED ONGOING HELP. WE NEED AS MANY RESOURCES INVESTED

i just want to join the course of members of this committee and the senate and sharing my condolences to the families and the communities reeling from recent gun violence across the country from buffalo new york to laguna woods california and now uvalde texas the gun violence in our communities are that are experienced that our communities are experiencing is simply simply unacceptable i've spoken nonstop since yesterday's tragedy not just as a senator but mr chairs you know as a father of three young school-aged children this shouldn't have to be the case in the last two weeks we've experienced at least 22 mass shootings across the country no other developed country has to deal with this but we do now some folks suggest that arming teachers or providing more armed presence on school campuses will make them safer if more guns were the answer the united states would be the safest nation in the world but it's not the case when i was growing up i remember uh on at least an annual basis uh we'd go through these fire drills at school what to do if there's a fire on campus i come from california i grew up in california so we're also not unfamiliar with earthquake drills to think that our young people today have to practice active shooter training it's a sad statement on our society when young children aren't don't feel safe going to school when people have to wonder whether it's safe to go to a grocery store or a house of worship it's a nightmare come true i know the jurisdiction over gun safety straddles a few committees they said on the homeland security committee but this is the primary the judiciary committee and i hope that we can find the will to advance common sense gun safety legislation because yes it is a choice to take action inaction is also a choice i choose to take action we cannot sit idly by and watch children in america die to gun violence thank you mr chair

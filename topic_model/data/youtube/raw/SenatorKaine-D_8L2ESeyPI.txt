hours and there of course are trying to demand a vote on gun control virginia democrat senator Tim Kaine attended the sit-in in a show of solidarity with his house colleagues he joins us now good morning senator hey Alison good to talk there are some scenes that looked pretty raucous from last night what was the scene when you went over there it was it was pretty amazing you know they had shut the cameras off they had shut the microphones off and we were sitting in I was sitting on the floor with a beautiful view of Congressman John Lewis sitting right there on the center of the floor kind of in a zen-like place and it was it was amazing it was a real team building exercise we felt the same way when we did the filibuster in the Senate last week we went on the floor to say it's time for reform because we were we cared about the issue but what we found is being on the floor together made us feel stronger made us feel like we were doing what our constituents want us to do and made us feel like we were inching closer to the day when we break the grip of gun manufacturers on Congress and actually embrace reasonable safety reforms well beyond this team-building exercise over in the house what will this accomplish there well let me tell you on the Senate side here's what's happened after the filibuster last week we had votes monday night democratic proposals and republican proposals neither pass but within 12 hours after the vote i was part of a group of ten five Democrats five Republicans putting a meaningful bipartisan bill out that basically says Terrace shouldn't be able to buy guns we should add a new federally prohibited class of individuals and block them from weapons purchases and this is something the American people overwhelmingly support and it's important Allison at this bill Susan Collins Heidi Heitkamp Martin Heinrich a number of us worked on yeah it's important that it's bipartisan it is you were not microforms and will not make reforms without it being by party indeed and so is that bill going to pass well we're going to see it if we could have a vote today or it could slip into next week we think we're going to be close it again is something that overwhelmingly the American public supports if you are on a no-fly list you're too dangerous to fly in an airplane then you should be prohibited from buying a weapon if you're on the special selectee list where our intelligence agencies have selected you out as a potentially dangerous because of your ties to terrorism you should leave I block from buying weapons we prohibit felons we prohibit those under domestic violence protective orders we should prohibit terrace senator just to prove your point we do have a new CNN Oh RC poll out this week I just want to put it up to reinforce what you're saying when you even ask Republicans do you favor preventing people on terror watch lists or the no-fly list in guns ninety percent of the american republican public say yes they fate would favor that eighty-five percent of democrats I mean counterintuitive that the numbers for Republicans are higher and yet it just seems so hard to get traction on Capitol Hill well well Allison you will see that poll number you've looked a lot of holes we couldn't get that kind of a number for supporting mother's day this is something that the American public deeply believes in and that is why we think when it's actually up on the floor and people just have to vote yes or no the time for skirmishing is over we think we've got a chance of getting it over the goal line

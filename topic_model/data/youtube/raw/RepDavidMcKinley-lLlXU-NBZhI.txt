since you've you're one of 22 attorney generals that have filed an action against the president's uh uh removal of their withdrawal the permit and and so i'm curious about your brief uh i'm a structural engineer i'm not an attorney but i want to understand more about what can we do in congress that to prevent a president from being able to do this in the future i would assume that you say something about that in your brief well the biggest point to that mr chairman i i i mean you guys have done it congress acted on keystone xl clear back in 2011. um so from my perspective as as a constitutional guy and as an attorney this is a settled issue article 2 section 8 of the constitution says the only only the congress gets to regulate foreign and interstate commerce and that's exactly what you've got here congress has done that congress has acted uh to me this looks like the president trying to reach back in time literally a decade and veto legislation that was was in front of his previous boss in which president obama elected not to veto so i mean there's there's maybe there's maybe an administrative procedures act argument to be made by the congress um but i mean when you've when you've got a president that at least is acting like he wants to ignore the act of congress and and and act unilaterally on his own i i guess i'm not sure what to do with that other other than to do what we've done and file suit thank you and i appreciate the fact he did that my second question is to premiere mo um um so look unfortunately this age of misinformation uh the opposition party here is deliberately misleading the public on keystone pipeline uh like just back in february a democrat member of the energy and commerce committee the very committee that we're from coming from here boasted that revoking the permit for the keystone xl pipeline would actually prevent the discharge of a nearly 180 million tons of co2 emissions in the atmosphere annually that this was stopped and she was proud of that so i i know you made some comment about that uh premier mode but i'd like to reinforce i was under the impression that canada was still going to develop their royal hands uh and the tar sands and they were gonna ship it so am i wrong or is she was she wrong one saying it's not gonna happen now okay a little bit yeah no they're actually she was uh incorrect uh the the oil sands continues to attract investment continues to reduce its emissions profile as well in fact their target is to reduce it by 27 by the year 2030. and that that's something i think people should be aware of i i spoke to saskatchewan's emissions reductions plan around methane a 45 reduction 15 percent overall in the energy industry and the fact that uh if if the world operated on on canada's flaring standards it would be a net reduction in emissions around the world by 25 but yeah no this product is going somewhere um it should be going down into the us because it checks the box of north american energy security north american economic security and provides jobs for us on both sides of the border and it does actually uh provide a net reduction in emissions um i think both of uh of the other presenters uh had mentioned that emissions will be going up with the cancellation of keystone and what will happen to the energy in saskatchewan and alberta is uh about 300 000 barrels of it is going to go into the tmx pipeline out to the west coast there is some of it will travel by truck and rail down to the gulf coast there is some talk now of a potential of another eastern pipeline um and there's also some uh discussion around with some indigenous groups and companies on another uh transport corridor uh through the kind of the northern areas of the province back out to the west coast west coast is fine for the western canadian energy industry uh it certainly does nothing to building that north american energy and economic security that we're all after and ultimately um you know you're going to continue to have barges delivering oil into the gulf coast into where this this energy could actually displace that that is a better environmental value and i would say collectively uh provides us and i speak a lot about north american you know energy and economic security this collectively takes a large step towards that thank you i want to squeeze in one quick question back to uh uh john studi if i could just say maybe it's a yes or no but given that that the uh do your people in the in in the pipeline is their 11 000 jobs have been lost will those workers be able to find other employment with the same wage base in the in your immediate area thank you uh we've certainly seen when you look at the uh comparable jobs that many of the jobs that they could find are lower in pay up to 30 percent lower in pay and there's fewer of them so depending on where you are getting a green job or a renewable job might be a good thing but people should really pause if the policy is to force people to take a pay cut or force people out of work especially in today's economic times that's not the thing to do thank you john

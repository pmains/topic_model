mr simpson thank you mr chairman uh welcome dr orzak i guess if anybody wants to understand what the problem in washington dc is all they need to do is listen to the debate that's gone on here the first little while pointing fingers and trying to decide who's to blame for what the reality is the american people don't care who's to blame what they want is the problem assault and i don't think it does any good to point at bush or to point at uh this administration and say this is that and whatever and i'm glad further and i'm glad for the health care debate i wish would have had this health care debate on the floor actually it would have been a good debate unfortunately we were denied any debate on the health care bill on the floor or any alternative so uh we need to get back to try and solving the problems in this country and while i think this budget is a problem in terms of long-term uh fiscal responsibility to this country what the what the american people are saying is that what you need to do up there is quit spending money it's really that simple quit spending money they're saying return the unspent funds from the stimulus package to the treasury and pay down the debt they're saying quit taking the money that came back in tarp and using it to fund new programs do what it was originally intended to do and that is pay back the treasury for the money that was spent on tarp and it doesn't seem like the administration seems to have gotten this message and i know that you're that you're in a difficult position this is a tough time for all of us there are parts of this budget that i agree with parts of it that i disagree with obviously we've heard a lot about statutory paygo statutory paygo only means anything you follow it after the great rhetoric that was put out about we're going to have statutory pay go and we've enacted statutory paygo the first year we enacted it you exempted 412 billion dollars of spending from paygo rules so if you put in statutory paygo you better be willing to live with it and quit exempting it if it's going to have any impact in the long run and so far nobody's been willing to do that all we do is go out and say the rhetoric about statutory pay go uh do you know as in terms of question though do you know how much money we're spending budget-wide in addressing global warming and greenhouse gas emissions and those types of things because one of my concerns has been i'm the ranking member on the interior subcommittee almost every agency in there has money for global warming studies and i know in a lot of the other agencies they have the same thing is any but how much are we spending and how coordinated is all of this spending and i'm not trying to be a global warming uh denier or anything like that i just don't see the coordination within the administration just it's like if we spend a lot of money then we'll say we're doing good uh we can get you the exact figures but very roughly speaking there's about two and a half billion dollars in the domestic agencies places like noaa doing climate research and so on and so forth uh and then about a billion and a half dollars in international affairs uh in the international affairs budget too so that would be about four billion but we'll get you the exact figures but there are i mean it's like the national park service has 10 million dollars to spend on global warming epa spends a ton of money on global warming we need to look at across all of the agencies what we're doing and what the coordination is within the agencies if we're going to be spending all this money on studying global warming i complement the administration frankly for the first time an administration has matched some of the rhetoric in support of global war in support of nuclear power with the funds in their budget they've put together a pretty good budget in terms of nuclear energy and the research in nuclear energy i do have some concerns with some of the policy obviously the yucca mountain decision uh that we are going to completely defund that that we are going to going to withdraw our application for for uh yucca mountain what what have we put in this budget to settle the lawsuits that are inevitably inevitably going to come and that we are going to lose when we uh when we withdraw our application for yucca mountain how much money is in there for that and how do we come with that amount and what do we assume the final amount's going to be well let me first answer that as you know the president has appointed a blue ribbon commission to study uh longer range waste management and other options for as we expand uh this form of energy what to do with the waste so that's that's i think crucially important i'll get back to you with the exact figures on as you know there's a set of uh of uh payments that are already involved in uh the local storage that the as you know the waste tends to be stored in secure facilities but uh around the reactors it's themselves and i'll get back to you with the details on uh payment flows involved in that thank you i appreciate that very much and uh mr chairman let's focus on problems and see what we can solve going forward

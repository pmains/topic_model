hi everyone its Elise as students across the North Country return to school this fall I wanted to take a moment to speak with you about some of my recent work focused on education one of the most common concerns I hear when I meet with constituents is the need for educational options that work for traditional and non-traditional students this year we have had several big wins on education for families in our district in May my initiative to expand Pell grants to summer classes was signed into law by President Trump by expanding the eligibility window to include summer classes and increasing the maximum Pell award by 50% we can make sure that low and middle income families in our district have more flexibility to achieve a college degree as the first member of my immediate family to graduate from college I know how important it is to have access to a high-quality education unfortunately the skyrocketing cost of higher ed locks many low and middle-income students out of a chance to pursue a college degree that is why I have introduced a bill to reauthorize the federal Perkins loan program an important higher ed resource for families making less than $30,000 a year this bill is critical because without reauthorization the Perkins loan program is set to expire on September 30th I am thrilled to report that bipartisan momentum is growing and we now have over 130 co-sponsors I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure my bill comes up for a vote finally this year the house took action to expand access to Career and Technical Education the bill we passed will help North Country students compete in a 21st century economy and provide them with the skills necessary to secure the jobs of tomorrow whether you are a traditional college student an adult student returning to school or you are pursuing technical education it is imperative that you have access to as many education and training options as possible there is still much work to be done to help our students achieve their goals and in Congress I'll continue working to help create an educational system that works for North Country students as always thank you for listening

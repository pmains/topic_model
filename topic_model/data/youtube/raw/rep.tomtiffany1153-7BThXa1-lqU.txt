well we want you to know that there are folks discussing d-listing the gray wolf in washington dc one of those wisconsin state representative tom tiffany from wausau not only is he working to try to de-list the gray wolf and put management plans back in the hands of state officials he is also working to remove tax incentives for some of these big solar farms and wind farms that have sprung up across the state tiffany's argument that he believes that we are converting valuable farmland into those solar and wind farms and that is a cost he does not think we should have to bear i talked to him about it yesterday we start off with the argument about the gray wolf yeah so in the nearly two years i've been in congress i've introduced a couple bills to allow the um the listing of the wolf and to do it in statute so that it turns it over to the state and that's ultimately what i've been trying to achieve is let's allow the states to manage wolves just like they manage their other wildlife populations but what we have is federal judges on the coast once in washington dc a decade ago and now just recently a judge from california interjecting themselves into this process and saying no we're not going to allow the wolf to be listed and it's really disturbing because it's obvious they have very little understanding of what's going on with wolves throughout the country and how their numbers have been restored we all support having wolves on the land state landscape but they should be managed well exactly and that's been the case that wisconsin agriculture has been making for a while and what's really difficult is there are pockets of wolves being managed like out in the rocky mountain region i mean it's a checkerboard kind of situation to try to keep track of yeah that's correct so a number of years ago um actually it was senator john tester democrat from the united in the united states senate in montana he made it very clear as he was going up for real election that hey we got to get these delisted otherwise i may not win re-election that's what i'm hoping some senators will do here in the upper midwest um like the two in minnesota senator baldwin in wisconsin and that's what i'd really encourage people to do is contact those u.s senators and say this really needs to be done and they'll be managed properly because our state departments of natural resources they will the job that they're given which is to manage these wildlife populations but the depredations continue millions of dollars paid out in um you know for the deaths of animals things like that and it really is time to return management to the states and by the way i just sent a letter to the chairman of the natural resources committee which i sit on and i encourage him chairman grijalva from arizona to have hearings on this and to start to advance a bill on this issue that's wisconsin state representative tom tiffany hailing from the wausau area he is again not only introducing that legislation to allow for delisting the gray wolf putting that responsibility back in state hands he's also introduced a bill they're calling the farm act for short future agriculture retention and management act that legislation would eliminate energy tax incentives that are helping to finance sighting of solar panel and wind farms on agricultural lands tiffany says that will permanently take that land out of production and he said that comes at an incredible cost so two different pieces of legislation that representative tom tiffany is working on we'll be talking with him again in the future

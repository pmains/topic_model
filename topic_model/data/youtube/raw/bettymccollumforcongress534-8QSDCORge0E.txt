What do you think of President Trump's erratic
behavior and reckless tweets? Too often it's alarming and disgraceful. Republicans control Congress but they refuse
to put any checks on this President - they'd rather protect him. Congress needs the courage to do its job to
stop the corruption and profiteering infecting this White House. I'm Betty McCollum and I approve this message
because with your vote you can help me hold President Trump accountable.

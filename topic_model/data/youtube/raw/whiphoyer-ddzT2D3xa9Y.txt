on those bills and on the priorities that are incorporated in those bills mr. leader it appears that the majority has stalled somewhat in their efforts and fast forward on repeal the ACA and president Trump's address on Tuesday seems to me didn't offer many details he does say however that everybody is going to be covered everybody with better health care and cheaper that bill comes before I'm going to vote for it mr. leader I want you to know that health care for everybody quality accessible affordable and cheaper now as much as the majority leader knows the budget resolution that was passed this year set a deadline of January 27 for committees to report legislation repealing the law it's now March second and there are reports mr. leader that Republicans have a draft bill that it perhaps is located in H 157 that it's not being posted and that Republicans have been told they can view it in H 157 I don't know that I have the room number correct and I'm not sure that that information that i have is correct but i will tell you that Michael Burgess dr. Burgess on your side of the aisle said this he said it yesterday people need to have access to this document apparently his presumption was he did not have access to the document or he believed others should not only members of our side of the aisle but also the public and if there are problems let's talk through them it's been a long time in the works most of the pieces that are in there people have seen in one form or another in the past but it does need to be an open process mr. leader let me repeat that it does need to be an open process according to dr. Burgess Gus Bilirakis says we're not having a hearing or anything we're not having a hearing or anything but there'll be a place for us to view it in draft pole line the speaker said three days ago we're going through the committee process we're doing this step by step we're having public hearings we're having committee work on legislation this is how the legislative process is supposed to be designed we're not hatching some bill in a back room perhaps H 157 he didn't say that i said it and plus American people front door and mr. leader you and I both here when the Affordable Care Act was passed was allowed to talk about the Affordable Care Act and how it was passed in the dark of night that was baloney of course we had 79 bipartisan hearings and markups over the two years that we considered the Affordable Care Act House members spent nearly a hundred hours in hearings heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle considered 239 amendments both Democratic and Republican and accepted a hundred and twenty-one amendments the original House bill was posted online 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the track committees formally introduced their merged bill in the house House Democrats posted the House bill up that was the final process online 72 hours before the bill was brought to the floor consistent with our rules now my understanding Ways and Means Committee has been told this bill is going to be marked up on Wednesday there will not have been a single hearing there will not have been a single witness and members cannot on our side of the aisle as I understand it see the bill today I don't know where all my tea party friends are who demanded full consideration and that everybody read the bill I don't know I don't see them out on the lawn I don't see them out on the plaza I don't see him out on the sidewalk as they were when we were considering the bill and we had those 181 witnesses the hundred hours of hearings that they thought work sufficient I don't know whether they'll think that having a markup next Wednesday when the bill has not even been made available to Democratic members of the house apparently Republican members have to go to a room to see it and the public clearly has no idea of what that bill is mr. leader i hope you will tell me that I'm wrong that there will be hearings consistent with what speaker Ryan said three days ago I hope you will tell me yes we're going to honor what speaker Ryan said that we're going to have those hearings we're going to have witnesses we're going to consider amendment all of us understand that this is one of the biggest issues confronting the American people we have had hundreds of thousands of people showing up at town meetings saying how concerned they are and yet if my information is correct mr. leader they will have no opportunity to talk to the Ways and Means Committee I am further informed and i hope the majority leader says this is wrong that the markup will look for the congressional budget office has the opportunity to say how much it's going to cost all this weeping and gnashing of teeth about balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility a bill that affects eighteen percent of the gross domestic product and the critical need for people to have access to affordable quality health care not one of them will have an opportunity to know how much this repeal will cost again mr. lita I hope you're going to be able to tell me no mr. whip we're going to have hearings we understand how important this issue is how much interest there is in this country and we're good to give time for serious consideration and we're going to have witnesses come before those hearings and then after the witnesses we're going to have a markup after substantial debate and consideration is allowed on both sides of the aisle I now yield to the majority leader with the hopes that he will be able to give me some degree of confidence that Paul Ryan our speaker was correct that we're going to follow regular water and make a transparent consideration of this piece of legislation I yield to my friend well I thank the gentleman for yielding I always look forward to your quotes they're always quite interesting now I'm blonde you know

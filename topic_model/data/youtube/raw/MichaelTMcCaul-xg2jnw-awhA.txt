ensure the security of our nation in addition to providing hundreds of new well-paying jobs that will stimulate the local and national economies a Chinese wall was committed to partnering with the US agencies to ensure that identity credentials used for entering the United States at our land and sea borders are the most secure a counterfeit resistant in the world as Texas is a border state we understand the need for government policies to address border security we are happy to share our expertise in this area of members of the US Congress and step in the Texas Legislature we've been working with carolyn mccall on these issues as well as through the House Homeland Security Committee which he had we look forward to continuing this relationship to support the Chairman's goals on border security and Homeland Security congressman McCaul is currently serving his fifth term representing Texas's 10th district in the United States Congress representative McCollum became chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security 2013 committee has oversight over the Department of Homeland Security ensuring it is a with carry out his core mission of protecting the American people as chairman represented recall has focused on domestic terrorism cyber security at airport security he has prioritized border security and elevated this as a national issue pro-growth pro-jobs voting record thank you as well as a stand against unprecedented government expansion makes them the ideal person to officially open the door to hid global's corporate headquarters and North American operations center here in Austin today you want distinct honor at this point to introduce chairman Michael McCall thanks to me I expect this kind of weather in Washington but not launched in Texas but we just say on behalf of all of us here in Texas and welcome to the ATU to hid global for moving your headquarters from California right to here in Austin Texas thank you soon I think it's because we had that pro-growth pro-jobs attitude if you world philosophy i think that brings so many people to this area and also the high tech that we see in austin this is a high-tech company and as denisa we need to look worn the federal government towards the private sector for our solutions and that's why i tried to do is chairman of Homeland Security this company obviously a private separate company now provides seventy percent of the identifications for all federal agencies it also provides a the identification cards for green cards and there are so many other instances where it can be utilized identifications becoming as we evolved into the this century and into the modern threats is becoming more more of an issue with its biometric whether its encryption another voting card that I have that I vote with whether you agree with my voting record or not right here and it's the develop on this company with the encryption on it the worst pretty wild the green free s read for no yellow for present and your name's up on the board but but I'm real excited to work with this company i'm excited they're moving here at 200,000 square feet we have 50 million dollars being brought here to Austin with 500 jobs new jobs being created here in the Austin area so this is a very exciting opportunity I think also from the homeland security standpoint terms of protecting American people whether it's the border southwest corner whether it's visas people come into the United States from other countries we need to know who they are and we need to know when they exit the country I passed the border security bill that passed unanimously which is almost unheard of the Congress today in a bipartisan way Adam light committee we have a u.s. exit bill that will be passed fairly soon out of committee that deals with the exit biometric we know who comes in we don't know when they leave we need to know that if we can get a true accurate assessment on who is in the country and who is not and that all leads towards you know if we ever end up with immigration reform which I think eventually we will we need to have a biometric or an identification card some sort of system like you do with the grapevine to deal with that very important issue as well so this company s he is really on the forefront of homeland security issues will be extremely extremely helpful in our efforts at the national level to better secure of the United States but also move forward as a people with technology because at the end of day I do believe the technology provides the answers to so many in solutions to so many the problems we have in this country and around the world so with that let me just say Denny thanks for coming to Austin we look forward to working with them and I can't wait to see the new facility you

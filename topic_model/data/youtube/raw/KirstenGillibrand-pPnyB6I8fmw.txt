this president is one of the most cowardly demeaning presidents we've ever had he is somebody who demonizes women people of color he has said racist statements he said anti-semitic statements he is against freedom of religion with his Muslim ban he has divided us on every type of line you could possibly imagine and I wanted to talk about what it actually means to stand up for what's right to do what's right especially when it's hard to be able to stand up against corporate greed and stand up to the unbelievable powers that change everything in Washington if you're unwilling to stand up to the special interests you're never gonna change anything and so one of the reasons why I wanted to have my speech there is because I want to talk about what's in the way of everything we believe in we believe in health care is a right and not a privilege we want Medicare for all for that reason we believe that our public schools should be better and stronger and that we should be able to have debt-free college we believe that no matter how hard you work you should be able to earn your way into the middle class and that the American Dream is actually for every everyone but the truth is you can't get to any of those things because our democracy's been corrupted our democracy has been taken out of the hands of the people and given to the hands of the special-interest the people who control everything in Washington are the moneyed interests the special interests and and those who have power and so if you don't want to give you if you aren't willing to get money out of politics and have publicly funded elections you're not gonna get there if you're not willing to take on the drug companies you're not going to be able to get rid of the opioid crisis or be able to afford prescription drugs if you're not willing to take on the insurance companies you're not gonna get healthcare so right so I wanted to talk about what this president isn't and that's brave I wanted to talk about what it's like to have a president who's brave enough to stand up for what's right even when it's hard especially when it's hard this is a president who doesn't he punches down he demeans the vulnerable he is not brave he wants us to believe he's strong that's why he puts his name on every building he wants us to believe that he is powerful well he is not he is weak and he is a coward and that's why I wanted to have that speech there

to the floor that's regular order mr. speaker and to rationalize a procedure which has a bill introduced Monday night and is subjected to 26 hours straight of markup on the following Wednesday less than 48 hours later no matter how you dress it up that is not mr. speaker regular order what it is is trying to jam through a bill before the American public has a opportunity to tell us what they think about the bill what it is is jamming through a bill and not allowing the providers the doctors the patients the insurance companies all of the stakeholders to have an opportunity to read that bill introduced about 72 hours ago now a little more than maybe close to 96 that mr. speaker is not regular order and I will tell my friend for whom I have a great deal of respect I think he puts the best face on it but nobody believed the Republicans had a bill mr. speaker until Monday night well actually I believe they had a bill as the last colloquy and I look for it all over this capital I couldn't find it it wasn't posted the ranking member on the committee didn't have it no committee committee Democrat they couldn't read it so to pretend mr. speaker that hearings on some other bill at some other time in some other Congress suffice a--'s for regular order is something mr. speaker I cannot agree with and if the situation's would were reversed as I have experienced over the last 36 years that side of the aisle would have torn this place apart why do I think that because I've seen it yes we had some delaying for motions to adjourn

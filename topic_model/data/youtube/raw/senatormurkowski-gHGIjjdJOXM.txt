infrastructure needs across the state of alaska are pretty varied and some 80 of our communities there is no road access so you either access by water or by air this is this is not only the mail plane it's the food plane it's the baby diaper plane it's the everything plane so that's how our mail gets delivered you're a pilot right but you're the pilot and you're the grocery deliverer you're the mailman you are you're the guy that's bringing everything from baby food to to pharmaceuticals if it fits in the airplane it goes freight mail anything like i said fits in the airplane it gets to its destination including we have geese over here also on our in our box if they didn't have this airport uh the ability to get uh food in for people to be medevaced in and out for people really to to to move around it would be pretty limited so this is yet another example of some of the great things that we did within the infrastructure bill making sure that it's not just big airports but small air strips like this that are kind of the lifeblood of a small alaskan community [Music]

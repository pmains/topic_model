high stakes legislation approving the Keystone pipeline takes center stage in the Senate tomorrow after flowing through the house this past Friday will the Senate and the president greenlight this project six years in the making we're asking Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota who recently introduced the legislation well not recently last year introduced the legislation he joins us now by telephone senator thanks for being with us today I want to start with your expectations with what's going to happen to this legislation will the Senate pass it along and then will the president sign it well very good to be with you i think the Senate likely will pass it tomorrow we've got 59 votes that have publicly said they're committed I think there's a number of maybe so I think we'll get to the 60 tomorrow but I think that it's very likely the president will veto the legislation Wow okay so I'm curious about the Senate vote because is this a political vote or is this are these people saying we're all behind Keystone or is this something to say Mary Landrieu well we're going to get enough votes either now or in the new Congress i mean i think that Senator Reid knew that we had enough votes and we'd get over 60 in the new in the new Congress so clearly the timing as uses obvious got a lot to do with the race in Louisiana but represented bill cast yeah this is a bill I wrote and right senator Landrieu's a co-sponsor but represented bill Cassidy took the same bill in the House passed it on Friday I think we'll pass it tomorrow in any event though I think the president vetoes and we're back at it in the new Congress I want to ask you about the president's statements on this legislation because he said this is something that really just benefits Canada do you agree with that no absolutely absolutely not look to build the kind of energy plan that we want for our country we've got to build the infrastructure to go with it that means pipelines that means moving energy by rail by Road also we want to work with Canada and together between the energy we produce in this country and working with Canada we can get to energy independence and not need to bring in oil from the Middle East or places like Venezuela and finally remember this pipeline whoop a hundred thousand barrels a day of light sweet Bach and fruit from North Dakota and Montana into this pipeline right off the get-go of course that's expandable later you know the president has said this is a disaster environmentally and yet his own State Department has said this approval or denial it's unlikely as to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for a heavy crude oil climate conditions during the construction period would not differ substantially from current conditions in other words the State Department of setting no big impact on the environment why the disconnect between the president and his own State Department well first off you're absolutely right we've gone through five environmental impact statements and they say no significant environmental impact now that's pretty clear and the reason he's saying otherwise because he's a he opposes the projects of the project obviously I mean he's held it up for six years that's very clear how many jobs there's a big debate over the number of jobs this pipeline will create what's your best estimate well there's been a number of estimates but I take the one that's included in the State Department report in the environmental impact statement and it indicates about 42,000 jobs and so you know look it's a job creator it's about more energy it's about you know really a national security national security I guess we'll leave it on that note senator Hoeven thank you for coming on the show tonight we appreciate your time thanks Jerry good to be with you

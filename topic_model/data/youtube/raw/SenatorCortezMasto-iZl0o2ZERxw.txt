thank you and thank you to the NAM unique nominees for your willingness to serve welcome welcome to your family members and thank you also for meeting with me I know some I've had the opportunity to meet with some you've met with my staff and really appreciate that opportunity and then for the two of you that I've already talked with on Commerce I'm not going to direct my questions to you because I've already had the opportunity let me let me start with mr. Ratcliffe mr. Ratcliffe on July 5th I sent a letter along with 28 of my colleagues requesting information about LGBTQ non-discrimination guidance that apparently they had been pulled down from HUDs website this guidance was arrived in at consultation with direct service providers and is meant to help grantees comply with the law when secretary Carson had been asked about this during House and Senate budget hearings he said that the department and I quote was looking at it in determining whether it was effective as head of community planning and development you'll be entrusted with ensuring that the CDBG the home program and homelessness service providers obey their non-discrimination obligations under the law if confirmed will you commit to promptly restoring the resources to HUDs website I'm not familiar with the details of that situation and so if confirmed I can commit to you that I will look into it and do what I think is right and can you commit to a timeline that within which you will take a look at that and get an answer back to us yes ma'am I would look at it within two weeks thank you very much I appreciate that and then Miss patias is confirmed you will be the Fair Housing chief at HUD do you commit to bringing cases and forcing against LGBTQ discrimination if the evidence demonstrates that there has been a violation of HUDs equal access rules yes argue thank you and then also HUD conducted the first ever study of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people in the rental market will you commit also to continuing this research during your tenure is confirmed yes I do thank you very much I appreciate that and then let me just follow up with the conversation you had with my colleague senator schatz I - I think the housing first model is very appropriate so I appreciate your comments and continuing to support it and work through those issues so thank you very much mr. Campbell I have a few questions for you as well when the Treasury Department released its report seeking to identify ways to rollback financial protections secretary minuchin noted that about 80% of the report's recommendations could be implemented administrative ly without Congress this came as troubling news to some of us who think a much more nuanced approach narrowly addressing community financial institutions and balancing the need for consumer protection is more appropriate as a longtime staffer of the legislative branch you've made it clear that you respect the rollback of Congress and exercising its will and providing an important counterweight to the executive branch if confirmed will you commit to working with Congress in a bipartisan manner when it comes to financial rules rather than pushing through 80 percent of its reports recommendations without input from Congress as proposed senator I'd note my 17 years of working up here in this body the most lasting change that can be made is a bipartisan change through this through this the Senate into the Congress I'm aware of some quiet conversations that are bipartisan to try to find a path forward a bipartisan path forward to redress in some regulations that we could perhaps find some consensus on if confirmed I look forward to working with you and members of the committee that are interested in their staffs to helping facilitate those conversations and trying to find a bipartisan legislative path forward to right-size and tailor where appropriate regulations related to financial markets financial institutions I appreciate that and in the report also to my chagrin included no mentions of ways to bolster consumer investor protection though it has dozens of proposals for ways to weaken rules for the some of the largest banks and I understand that future reports from the Treasury are forthcoming and you would be in a position to work on such reports in your new rule if confirmed will you work with Congress to incorporate recommendations related to needed consumer and investor protections in subsequent Treasury reports so sooner I think that if confirmed there's no better there's no more important job that I would happen to protect the protection of consumers and absolutely you have a firm commitment that I'll work with you members of this committee in enough and off this committee to better understand your priorities and and where possible fold those priorities into the reports that are that are forthcoming thank you and I know it's my time is almost up let me just say thank you all again incredible resumes incredible background and your willingness to serve I so appreciated I also please excuse me of bouncing back and forth I have an Energy Committee going on at the same time but thank you again and thank you to your family members for being here as well

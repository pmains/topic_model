four minutes Thank You mr. speaker mr. Speaker we have a problem here my record is very very clear I'm providing assistance to any place in this country in fact my record is a hundred percent so I have some credibility come to the floor to discuss this with my friend from Florida I hope you'll listen my heart goes out to those impacted by hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria the past several weeks I'm committed to providing for federal response and recovery I was pleased to support aid to those affected by Harvey and Irma and will continue to do so we are gently need to deliver relief and assistance to those currently impacted by Hurricane Maria and in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with the entire island has lost power are many are without water however this bill today does not provide that needed relief let's be clear we in New Jersey are not some johnny-come-lately on disaster tax relief this is not a question of you got yours and I want mine we've been working on disaster tax issue since 2012 based in part of how we addressed helping victims of Hurricane Hurricane Katrina more than a decade ago let me remind you Hurricane sandy devastated the Northeast in the United States in 2012 lost 233 lives causing 75 billion dollars in damages at the time it was the costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina while Congress until then had routinely provided tax relief to communities and the wake of our worst storms tax relief talking about Katrina Rita Wilma victims of hurricane sandy did not receive the same treatment fact we had to wait three months we just did it in three days we seem to have short memories 179 Republicans in this body and 36 senators voted against aid to victims of Hurricane sandy in 2013 that many and today those same members asked us to support not only aid for hurricanes Harvey and Irma but tax relief provisions which they never even considered after Hurricane sandy I was a yes vote a week before last for your aid unequivocally why should I take it out on your citizens the foolishness that happened in 2013 that would be wrong and I think you feel the same way through the chair this whole debate smacks of a certain Apocrypha and I know I'm not the first to point it out and the weeks after Sandy I worked in a bipartisan manner to draft a tax relief bill that would make permanent the most common-sense tax relief provisions to take politics out of the equation when it comes to disaster relief and over the years I worked with many of my colleagues both sides of the aisle and both chambers of cat of the Capitol our bill the national disaster Tax Relief Act led also by Congressman Tom Reed of New York thank you provides tax relief to victims of Hurricane sandy and puts in place permanent provisions for all disaster areas going forward I'm ready ready to debate these provisions and go through regular order let's have hearings let's have a markup let's have regular order on something that should be as non-controversial as helping those in need but instead of taking a bipartisan approach some of the majority have chosen to sneak in a few provisions taken from our bill and tack them on to an unrelated aviation bill and apply them only to this year's hurricane victims leaving out all of the disaster victims that have been waiting for support over the years front page of the story of papers in New Jersey today people are still not back in their homes from Sandy 2013 that's not fair it's not the American Way the specific provisions Republican leaders you're putting on from our bill include bigger than usual property cap Speaker thank you bigger than usual property casualty lost deductions penalty free retirement withdrawals you may smile but think about those people are out of their homes since 2013 that's no laughing that's no laughing matter mr. chairman an increased threshold for charitable giving a tax credit for impacted employers and flexibility in applying for the Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit I would note that Puerto Ricans despite being American citizens are ineligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit and I have a bill to correct this gentleman from Massachusetts reserves chair recognizes gentlemen for your courtesies mr. speaker no one was laughing at any

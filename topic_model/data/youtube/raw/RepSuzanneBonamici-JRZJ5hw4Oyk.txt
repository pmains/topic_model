joining the platform we are recording so thank you everyone so much uh for joining us for this important discussion today i especially want to thank my staff uh andrew dunn al bannon and everyone else on the team for helping us organize this event i'm going to be giving a brief update about my work in congress but i'm really eager to hear from you this is a discussion and it's going to be a two-way conversation so the biden harris administration is preparing for an upcoming conference on hunger nutrition and health that demonstrates a deep commitment to finding solutions to end hunger to improve access to nutritious foods and to strengthen our nation's food system the first white house conference on food nutrition and health was more than 50 years ago so it's about time for another it resulted in an expansion of the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap and the national school lunch program it also established this special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children which we know is wic uh and it really that critical work that was done 50 years ago paved the way to significant reductions in food insecurity for millions of individuals and families now today with the pandemic with increasing income inequality there's an urgent need but also an opportunity to develop solutions to end hunger no one regardless of their income zip code citizenship status who they are who they love no one should wonder where their next meal is coming from there should not be barriers to accessing food in the united states we know that the covid19 pandemic exacerbated the crisis and highlighted the urgency of addressing the gaps and vulnerabilities in our country's food security nutrition programs according to a report by oregon state university hunger and organs surged about 10 to more than 24 of oregonians that was in october of 2020 fortunately childhood food insecurity fell nationally because of our work in congress to expand child nutrition programs and enhance snap benefits for adults and families although there is not a major fluctuation in 2021 of food insecurity we know it is again on the rise and we also know that these numbers are higher for bipac oregonians who experience widened disparities the pandemic has taught us a great deal about the unmet needs in this country and we must do more to protect and to support our most vulnerable populations as chair of the education committee's civil rights and human services subcommittee i've been focused on making sure that all students can access nutritious meals we're working on reauthorizing updating our child nutrition programs which is a top priority of mine as a subcommittee chair but also we know long overdue recently i had the opportunity to visit with chapman elementary school students in portland during their lunch hour and have to serve meals and it was really really powerful to hear from this very enthusiastic group of third graders about why it's important for every student to have access to healthy meals if you want hope for the future talk to some third graders so i'm glad that congress came together to extend the child nutrition waivers that were established at the beginning of the pandemic that was based on bipartisan legislation that i led that to to make sure that children are not going hungry i also worked on a bipartisan update to the older americans act that was signed into law in 2020 i just want to note that that with that bill was called the keep kids fed act the one that recently passed and what a difference it's making so with the older americans act which i've been working on for for several years it helps seniors truly help seniors age with dignity it includes nutrition services that cover the cost of meals for our most vulnerable seniors including public-private partnerships um with organizations like meals on wheels always doing a great job out there so in 2018 nearly 150 million meals were delivered by this program and during negotiations on the build back better act i led the efforts to include 10 billion dollars in investments for our child nutrition programs now we know that that past the house and is pending over in the senate but we're working we're not giving up on getting these important programs passed and i want to note that part of my advocacy involved the healthy food incentive fund to help schools improve scratch cooking capacity exceed nutrition standards and very excited to see the biden harris administration implementing a fund based on this proposal i know that the federal government can play an important role in expanding access to fresh and healthy foods i've always been a supporter of the farm to school program for example recently i had the opportunity over on the north coast in astoria to visit the astoria co-op so they're participating in the snap double up bucks program to help snap recipients better access fruits and vegetables which is helpful we've been able to get support to continue as i mentioned the child nutrition waivers and we're continuing to respond also to the crisis and infant formula production address rising costs in that area through wic giving flexibility there but also working on the supply chain issues so i remain committed to finding real solutions to help oregonians and americans keep food on the table and to address these overlapping challenges that affect food access in our region we know about food deserts and we know there are food deserts in some areas and if you look at the history of redlining for example showing we need a holistic approach to addressing housing insecurity along with our work to end hunger i've had conversations with many of you around the table today about the need for a comprehensive approach to enact effective and equitable policies that examine the root causes of hunger and under nutrition and how they affect health and the prevalence of chronic disease and how they can be addressed so i appreciate the opportunity to be together again albeit virtually uh to to discuss um the actions that we need to take to end hunger and to increase healthy eating and physical activity i look forward to hearing from you and i'm going to open it up to discussion i'm going to put a couple of issues out there and just re just really open it up and want to hear from you when you're speaking we didn't take time today to do introductions because i want to have a lot of time for conversation so when when you're speaking please say your name but also your organization and then also i want to let people know at the outset that um if you have additional ideas thoughts inspiration afterward please don't hesitate to reach out we will be preparing a report for the administration they've asked us to do outreach and to get ideas from our communities and i know here in northwest oregon we have so many advocates with so many great ideas so i'm just going to put a couple of issues out there what specific actions should the federal government both congress and the executive branch be taking to end hunger improve nutrition and eliminate disparities how has your community been affected by hunger or diet related disease what existing federal programs are effective and what could be expanded or improved what fed this is important too what federal or state programs are not working or pieces of programs that aren't working we really appreciate knowing that as well and are there barriers that can be removed by the federal government that would help ease your work on hunger and nutrition and i know we we do work with our state and local partners as well but we really want to know uh what we can do at the federal level and what actions should local state and tribal governments non-profit and community groups take to achieve uh our goals and are there more opportunities for public-private partnerships so uh are there are there innovative things that you're doing uh here in oregon that can inform our actions at the federal level oftentimes states and local um work at the state level and local level is a sort of incubator and pilot of ideas that we can can scale up on the federal level we want to hear about those two and then finally the you know the dietary guidelines for americans were last updated in 2020 so how can we improve nutrition education especially for for children for students in our community so lots of issues to talk about today i'm going to open it up you can either raise your hand on the with a zoom feature or you can just wave um please make sure that your name is in the in your uh that you have your name and and when you speak please um you get to have your name identified and then also have your um state your organization so who would like to start i could be like the teacher and call on somebody i saw susannah morgan from the oregon food bank good morning congresswoman um uh yeah of course i have stuff to say so i'll get um my stuff out of the way so we can hear from folks more on the ground i'm susanna morgan i'm the ceo at oregon food bank and it's an honor to be here with you congresswoman and with so many other great organizations um as you know at oregon food bank we our mission is to eliminate hunger and its root causes and we work to ensure our community has the food we need today and we work to change the systems and policies that create and perpetuate hunger as you probably know hunger has been at its highest level ever since the pandemic in 2019 the number of people who sought food assistance through the 21 regional food banks and 1400 partners of the oregon food bank network was 860 000 in 2020 that number was 1.7 million in 2021 that number was 1.2 million as of right now we think we are going back up so we are back in um in the worst level of hunger that this country has seen since the 1930s and we at oregon food bank don't believe that hunger is primarily a result of personal choices it's a result of community-wide it's a symptom of community-wide systems that perpetuate poverty and injustice and that poverty itself has a root cause that's racial gender and economic inequities so um we got a big job i would love to share with you today some guidance we receive specifically from folks who have lived experience of hunger we have been working very closely with people accessing food from the food assistance system all across oregon and southwest washington and we have particular recommendations for the safety nets that i'd like to lift for you today for snap we recommend removing time limits ending exclusions for immigrants and for college students increasing benefit levels for older adults and establishing parity for our neighbors in puerto rico american cinema cnn modernizing snap to reflect the true cost of healthy food and expanding the double up food box which you mentioned you had seen in action in astoria recently for child nutrition programs we recommend enacting the healthy school meals for all which i know you support making summer ebt available nationwide making the recent improvements to summer meal programs permanent and making changes to the wic program by increasing benefit levels for fruits and vegetables extending nutrition benefits for moms and postpartums to two years and extending wic eligibility for kids through the age of six these many of these ideas are not new and i know you've heard them before congresswoman but maybe we have an opportunity right now to make um some of these things uh true it's also true that we need to remove barriers that all of these benefits should be available when you apply for one so that if you need um snap and wic you don't have to go to two different places to get it and they should be available in multiple languages so that all of our neighbors can access them whatever language it is they speak at home and in the worst of times the emergency food system where we hand out food is the very last resort um below living wage jobs below the safety nets is the food assistance system and we rely on food through the emergency food assistance program there's an ask right now for a billion dollars of additional food to help us get through this year on the table adjusting cfr 251 so that states are prohibited from increasing barriers to service and that other states operate as well as oregon does and then i would also love to just be able to say again that we don't believe that hunger is a result of personal choices it is a result of these big systemic barriers and those systemic barriers include racism and sexism and disproportionately impact our black indigenous and other people of color and prevent them from obtaining economic food security so here are a couple policy recommendations that directly address those root causes uh and the first one i believe you totally agree with me on is let's bring back the monthly child tax credit it worked it worked so well um there's such good evidence uh that um it drove down child poverty by an incredible 41 and reduced food insecurity by 26 if we do one thing can we do that please um and then let's make housing affordable and accessible consistently people requesting food site housing as the biggest reason they're standing in line at a food pantry making child care affordable and accessible to everyone make the earned income tax credit available to all workers and increase eligibility for people without kids and end policies that result in mass incarceration we have data that shows that staggering 91 of people who return to our communities from incarceration experience food insecurity so that's my big brain dump congresswoman we're so glad to be here um and i'm going to make time and space for my other colleagues susanna thank you so much i think you saw a lot of nodding heads throughout uh agreeing with uh so many of your ideas and thank you for the work that you're doing the oregon food bank is doing and for identifying uh those pieces of policy absolutely the child tax credit what a difference that made uh but all of your ideas we're gonna take back and many of those as you know are things that that i'm working on uh i'm gonna to go to who would like to speak next i'd love to hear from everybody whitney good morning thank you um it's great to see you again and thank you again for your visit to our schools um i can pretty much say ditto to what susanna said great great points susannah and i figured i would piggyback since you talked about child nutrition programs i am the senior director of nutrition services at portland public schools um and yes we've made uh i appreciate the support uh through the keep kids fed act and we're anxiously awaiting for the state to provide guidance on that um immediately it will help our summer programs with some of the difficult conversations we're having with families about not having that grab-and-go option to take food off-site i just took a civil rights complaint for a family who has a student with special needs where eating in the park is not an appropriate setting for their student they tried and that was not the right environment for their student and or their child and so um the the roadblocks that they face they already have filed so much paperwork um for their students disability um within the school system and this is for a family that borders between portland and david douglas and so while david douglas might have the paperwork to understand this child's needs my district is not and so we're working to try and share that information but what a what a huge benefit to families um to not have to navigate those things and to file complaints and to feel welcome in any setting um to try and access the programs and services that we offer if we can eliminate some of that paperwork and burden on them um similarly again having all meals for free within the school day i know you and i've talked about how you know we don't charge a family for library books right even if they can afford it we don't charge them for library books within the schools we don't charge them for certain things but we do charge them for food based on their social economics and why are we adding that that layer to the cafeteria that then places shame or stigma on our students as they are in the school day um so we continue to advocate for that for all meals to be free if they want to eat with us we want to be able to feed them and that was the unfortunate thing as we started our summer program is with the pre-pandemic rules of the summer feeding program i literally was having to tell schools and children that wanted or needed my services that their site was not eligible and therefore i could not provide them with food and that's our purpose that's why we're here we're here to feed the kids that that need it or want it um and unfortunately because of those old school rules um i had to tell them no or that they had to find other money to pay for my services and that shouldn't be the case it shouldn't have to pull from education dollars or other sources of funds and so i appreciate what we're doing now but it was very heartbreaking to have to say no in the beginning of setting up this program so again like susannah said to permanently place these things in place or streamline programs within the school district sponsors where we can just feed breakfast lunch and after school supper programs um without having to reapply or navigate multiple programs during the school year or the summer would be a real benefit to our program not just for families and students but for my department operationally it creates efficiencies and allows us to put more of that money towards the food on the plate and the people who are making those food not food and that's really at the core of what we do um similarly with the snap and we are all interrelated and connected so um if we continue with the eligibility piece our snap program really the economic piece of it the federal income guidelines does not match what what our families are experiencing especially within multnomah county the cost of living is incredibly high and minimum wage is the higher than federal minimum wage and so the the point at which people are eligible for free or reduced price meals doesn't reflect what they're feeling in their own household so that is is a disconnect i know not only for within portland um but other major urban cities as well across the country um so i would hope to see that happen um i think one of the creative options that we have here in multnomah county is the support and connection between our after school partners in sun and the connection between our food pantries backpack programs and school markets i think being able to expand or put more funds towards those opportunities helps to connect and a place for families to access food for the entire family that my program is limited to just children so while those families are able to visit schools and access those programs they're able to increase their access to healthy foods for their entire family it makes it very convenient and with the rising costs in transportation funds the more that we can help those families access food where they're already going will help to better support them and i know that that's come up in the last couple years where we've been limited on the available funds where some schools have asked for more frequent food markets or um food pantries but because of the cost of operating that we've been limited to a limited number of times in a week or a month um that we have it available in a certain area and i know north portland in particular has had a high need um and has been very vocal um amongst my principals about trying to improve that that opportunity um so i'll stop with that and again thank you for this opportunity thank you whitney for all of your excellent ideas and i just want to emphasize the importance of number one reducing or eliminating the the bureaucratic paperwork but also ending the stigma uh some of the lunch shaming stories that i've heard are just heartbreaking and there's no reason for that to happen um so so thank you for all of your ideas and thank you i think i saw fatima with the partners for hunger free oregon next hi yes hello everyone i'm fat maja with marty i use she her pronouns and i'm from hungary oregon um and really appreciate being here today and the opportunity that you're providing to hear from everyone in the oregon community it's just so valuable and i appreciate that and i also just wanted a lot of the things i'm gonna talk about i know that you congresswoman have been a huge supporter of and proponent of and been leading the charge um for a long time um so i don't have too many additional things from what susanna and whitney have already shared but just a couple pieces that i wanted to highlight more um regarding child nutrition programs we're really excited to see the kids fed act pass but know that the expansions and the things that are needed in our schools and our communities are far beyond that in 2019 um oregon did pass as i'm sure you know a series of school meal expansions that really um will support were going suited to support our families in the ways that they needed but as a pandemic happened in the federal supports and the federal waivers they have been far beyond what the state had originally planned and so i think being in a situation in the fall where we can roll back on those organ supports but know they are nowhere near what's currently needed i think just continuing to champion expansions to schools meals making sure that meals are flexible and the additional things that i'll also say so i know susanna mentioned um summer ebt and pandemic ebt organ has been a pilot state of summer abt for a long time we have a lot of data around the impact and value that that has on our families during the summer because there's always been a gap once the school year ends and then families are you know expected to meet two additional meals a day and you know we hear a lot of hard choices that happen due to that you know parents having to make difficult decisions to put their kids first and additionally with pandemic ebt just having schools have flexibilities you know the pandemic in the last couple years have shown us what it looks like to be responsive in an emergency but in oregon we've long had things that have impacted our schools and being able to have federal flexibility such as fires or snow closures or things like that to make sure that kids are getting meals in those times and then additionally outside of school meals and child nutrition programs also wanted to highlight you know just what i've been hearing a lot around hunger has long existed but the pandemic has really exacerbated it and like specifically for our most marginalized communities and so a lot of the programs are not meeting the needs of our immigrant refugee and gufa community members they're not meeting the needs of our tribal reservations and they're not meeting the needs for college students and older adults so really looking at both program access because many of these groups don't have eligibility and then also in kind of i've heard a lot about streamlining the process making applications more accessible specifically looking at language access and how things are communicated things that are federal government that can provide that help folks with the fear and the stigma and just the not knowing how to access programs susanna highlighted what it would feel like to show up to one place and be able to access all of the resources that families need to thrive um and additionally i think actually i'm looking through my notes here i think that is a lot of what i would really highlight is just so many of our communities are not having their needs met and they have not had their needs met for a long time and we're really seeing those disproportionate impacts increase over the pandemic so i'll pause there to create space for other folks um thank you for your time thank you so much for for all you've done and your ad ongoing advocacy and for highlighting yes there are so many disparities and gaps that we want to work on closing so thanks for being with us who would like to go next hope i said your name properly yeah oh hi i'm naeli i um currently am working in the basic needs hub of portland state university uh as an assistant but i also have worked for the portland state food pantry i have also worked with and known many students from all backgrounds and i myself growing up my family had ebt and we utilize food pantries so i am also like a person with like the lived experience um i love everything that everybody has said so far um i have maybe more of a slightly pivot of one one of my ideas um so for my capstone um i think a year ago i was able to uh work with roberta eaglehorse um on with her women's wellness garden which i think is on or was on the oregon food bank um like garden area a property i don't remember exactly but um i think when it comes to like food and health i think a big part of it is also like connection to the earthen connection to the food and i think um something in addition to all of these wonderful things that have already been talked about is focusing on uh garden um education gardening education uh community gardens uh maybe like one idea i you know i don't know all the specifics about how things can be done but uh especially in areas where it's mostly apartments and people don't have land um to grow anything or have to rely on pots or raised beds and stuff having maybe like government funded people who can help create gardens and sustain gardens for different communities and training for everybody like how can you grow food at home how can you grow food and if you only have a tiny amount of space uh how can you grow food with other people um i think that would just help a lot um not only for like especially if people need culturally specific foods um but also to just have that connection because that's an issue that we have that we don't have that connection to food anymore um and we also don't have the opportunity or are able to because of how our systems have been built where we are working so much that we can't even like do what we as humans like should be should be able to enjoy which is having that connection to food um the other thing that i um more specifically have in my mind as a student who um knows other students is that i know that that has to do with de-stigma is destigmatization um a lot of students do not feel comfortable signing up for snap or going to the pantry um especially if and i know a lot of students who maybe they grew up like more middle class and but now they are struggling and because they never um had to worry before they don't know what resources are available to them and if they do um find information they don't feel comfortable taking it because they feel that they don't deserve it or um other people should be taking it over them which is not the case at all if you are struggling or if you are eligible then you should be able to use those resources um so uh i think i don't really know exactly how to go about furthering like destigmatization but i think that is also um very important and um yeah and that's i think what i have to say i think you know i i really enjoyed my visit recently to portland state to to meet with students to talk about food insecurity to visit the food pantry and i am working on legislation to expand opportunities for students to learn more about what is available currently um through snap another program so thank you for sharing your lived experience i was in the same situation i was on my own when i went to college um and i and i used food stamps as well then food stamps snap benefits as well to help me because otherwise i wouldn't have had enough food to eat so it you know it's having that lived experience that you know you really appreciate and bring that to the table so thank you for sharing your ideas and also emphasizing the importance of growing food and connecting with that and that's why i'm such a supporter of school gardens and farm to farm to school programs and i have seen students actually eat food because they grew it themselves that they would probably not have ventured to taste um otherwise so it is really you've made some very important points and i appreciate that um i see tyler and then ashley hello thank you so much for joining us um my name is tyler johnson i work at the community action program of east central oregon where i oversee all of our food pantries and energy and motherization programs i just uh wanted to echo everybody's topics that they've discussed so far and also um throw out some others um out here rural access to foods is um a really a big thing you mentioned um food deserts and that is a hard thing to break down um one uh one way to go about it that we haven't instituted out here but i have seen it in other areas are is the healthy corner store so just a small little uh mom and pop shop uh in just like a little bodega or something in the middle of a small town that has access to fresh fruits and vegetables nutritious meats and stuff like that i also think another thing would be i i come from a public health standpoint and i've dealt with a lot of policy and medical research and demystifying some of the terminology around nutrition that we use frequently but you take it to even some of the well-educated people that don't play around in these arenas and they may not understand what food security means in the same way that we are using it so demystify some of those terminologies define them outright what uh what we're meaning when we're talking about food insecurity food deserts stuff like that um and also just um nutrition education in general has slipped from our school systems and it's not a fault of the school systems uh my parents and my sister my parents were lifelong teachers my sister is a current teacher there's not enough time not enough money in the budget to support nutrition education getting nutrition education back in the schools including um cooking education not in the same way homeek was done but something similar to homec that shows people at a young age how to prepare healthy meals how to read labels so that they will know what they're getting and then also working on creating a different grocery store environment here i'm in hermiston today and we have a local grocery store that the owner came from the portland metro area and he designed the grocery store to have all the healthier food in one aisle so it's not mixed in with all the other canned goods you don't go down the canned vegetable aisle and search for the healthy canned peas or canned corn you can find them in a particular aisle so the you don't get lost in searching the grocery store for the healthy item the other thing too is um more of a connection break down the barrier between the medical system and the non-medical system around nutrition i mean you have registered dietitians in the medical system you have the intermediary which is kind of the nutrition therapist that's kind of in between the two and then you have the health educator and then the average public so find a way to kind of break down that nutrition education component and then finally people have already spoken about destigmatization destigmatize the systems for nutrition aid the snap that type of stuff also destigmatize some of the um some of the long-held beliefs uh around food and whether it be ethnic or connected to disease so like um i know in certain places being a vegetarian or a vegan may be frowned upon but explain uh have some conversations happened about why that may be a better health choice for somebody with different issues and also how the family history or the genetics plays into nutritional diseases um i'll let somebody else talk but thank you again for joining us tyler thank you so much so many great ideas and thank you for bringing the rural perspective it's a reminder that hunger is an issue everywhere in the state in the country it's not just an urban area not in areas not just in suburban areas it's everywhere um and i really i love the healthy corner store idea so so thank you and as a as a member of the education committee education ashley from the oregon farmers market association welcome thank you ashley house i'm the executive director at ofma oregon farmers market association she her thanks for having us um i have a lot of things the first thing specifically would be um changes to gus net policy allowing for double up food buck matches um for meat and dairy that's something our shoppers have been asking for for a long time program is fantastic and it works really well at farmer's markets and the next thing would be fixing housing policy oh you can make the food cheaper but when someone's spending 80 to 90 of their income on their rent that's not going to help we need to really fix housing policy particularly here in oregon and i think there's a lot of tax revisions that can be done including limiting depreciation for vacant units i think in portland there's over 16 000 vacant units while we have record houselessness um i think that investments in infrastructure are huge our processing facilities are so limited farmers have to go so far that creates food deserts because rural areas are not able to bring in food railways electric vehicles the cost of diesel right now when the bulk of our food is reliant on that type of transportation is really hitting our farmers hard they're absorbing those costs infrastructure particularly in oregon and co-packing facilities and cold storage and food hubs we do not have a lot and federal funding can help support that particularly in meat packing and cold storage for our farmers here infrastructure and farmers markets in food deserts there are a lot of farmers markets but they're very limited and small and federal funding to support those has been helpful um to bring fresh food local food healthy food into communities that may have limited access because there are food desert or far out there um food waste is huge a lot of our food goes to waste i used to work in the food waste industry and it was bananas how much perfectly good food was thrown away right at the source and there are a lot of federal tax revisions that can can help enhance that including um an incentive that would be more like a tax credit for what we would call like a low margin business such as farms farms throw away a lot of food because it's not marketable or it costs them more to get it to the customer and if there were in a tax credit and some revisions to the policies it would be really valuable for our farmers particularly and our producers as well as making food much more affordable i've seen a lot of grocery stores that mark their their blemished food down during the days and i think being able to have a tax credit for that for larger chains would be fantastic as well they throw away a lot of perfectly good food and so giving them tax credits and possibly even increasing the access to compost and requiring them to compost food or donate it rather than sending it to the landfills where it's creating a climate crisis um and of course i think you know echoing everything that everyone said but adjusting the federal poverty limit it's not realistic and you know it should be more in line with what a living wage is and and to go in line with um not exactly with inflation i know that that would be a logistic nightmare but it is um that's not the real poverty limit and needs to be adjusted and reflect what's actually happening in america um and i think that is all with all of my notes lots of so many great ideas ashley thank you and thank you for bringing that pers the perspective of the farmers and identifying the the issue of food waste such great ideas thank you for joining us next i have francia from adelante mujeres and then carla from adelante mujeres and after that we'll have kaylee hello good morning i'm francia from adelante mujeres and i am the child nutrition coordinator and i run the child nutrition program uh one of the things that we focus on at mujeres is about teaching the the kids at this very young age about food where the food comes from how to grow it that's what we use in the garden um because we want to create a new generation where they have more knowledge about where the food comes from and the healthy choices they can make but one of the things that everybody here is mentioned is like what happens after school who teaches the regular population about nutrition so i think it would be very good to have nutrition or dietitians available at your workplace as well because i personally just consulted one when i was pregnant and i became with gestational diabetes but before that make being completely healthy never crossed my mind to go visit one and maybe have some options for me to never have that experience of gestational diabetes um i feel like what nageli mentioned about having people more connected to to where their food sources come from like having community gardens it would be really good to have people go back to growing their own food um and just like we have laws that all buildings in apartment complex have to have a fire alarm or fire detector a small detector we should be able to have a law that asks the apartment complex to have a community garden and that would be really helpful if it is required by lab to have that we're not gonna force people to go for it but at least have it available and have the resources and the information it's like oh you're gonna comment and be my rent my apartment we have a community garden would you like to know more about it and from there have the resources to move on if anybody needs to go to like apply for food stamps or one week or find a dietitian or things like that thank you so much francia for your your work at adelante muhiras and and also for sharing your personal story uh yes it's so important to have those community gardens thank you so much for joining us uh next carla also from adelaide muharras welcome thank you so much for inviting us and yes i am the health equity manager at the mujeres and i'm having so much trouble with the internet today so my notes are just not showing up but i agree with everything everyone has said today and it's so nice to hear all these new ideas i am very new to oregon so i am definitely an outsider looking in which i think gives an important opinion opinion because because i can see things that maybe other people haven't seen and so the disconnect that fancy was talking about is is serious there's there's just people don't know where the things come from and food we're specifically talking about food but we don't know where half the things we have on a daily basis come from so it's so important to get information out there like how things are grown where they're grown what are the uh benefits of these different vegetables and fruits that we have grown locally and not always buying things just from the supermarket that are imported from other countries so that was just one thing but i did think one thing that is also super important to talk about is how badly we need funding if everyone here has so many amazing ideas and at adelante mujeres we have ideas after ideas but we always get stuck when it comes to the money we're like yeah we want to do this and we have this idea to get out to the community this and and this other idea but we don't have the money to to do all these things and i think that we could really do a lot more if we have just a little bit more funding and something that franti and i actually talked about right before before this um this round table was we see marketing all day long social media is all over the place it's like really has control kind of at some times controls our lives and it is so it would be amazing if we had some sort of marketing or marketing culture advertising that focuses on not just pack like not packaged food sodas going to mcdonald's and taco bell but like hey the local farmers the the local gardens all the things that like that i was just talking about fruits and vegetables like why we have nothing that focuses on that to get people's attention uh in in a more like uh internet type way and social media way and then one more thing i wanted to to say was that when i don't remember your name i think you uh i'm not sure but when you were talking about farmers it just like an idea just jumped out at me it would be so amazing if it if the farmers because they're the ones that come to the farmers markets they sometimes have that connection with a local a local supermarket and they can they can sell their fruits and vegetables there but what if what if the government allowed them like a small little store within their farm where the people can actually go and purchase their things directly from the farmer and that way they make ends meet as you know and they can make a little bit of profit off of this amazing organic locally grown philly and then come back to carla to finish up when she reconnects carla we lost you for a minute there okay let's go to let's go to kaylee and then we'll come back to carla and then i don't know i saw matt milching applaud i don't know matt if you want to join us after kaylee and carla hi there my name is kaylee summers um i am the food security program manager at ohsu i also am a board member of the oregon farmer's market association and chair a veggie prescription working group through the oregon community food systems network and i just want to applaud all of my colleagues here on the call today i won't mention all of the amazing programming and ideas that you already said but i just want to say ditto as well um and i the one program that i did want to rise up and and highlight um is um veggie prescription or produce prescription programs as a model um that has taken off in organ um and we have in oregon been a a role model for other states and programs that are starting up across the nation in terms of veggie prescription or produce prescription programs and i think as we've all talked about today these hunger doesn't happen alone right they're all of transportation and housing and um incarceration all of these issues that um that make life so difficult for um folks living in the united states is um across the nation we really do need to think about intersectional partnerships for these complex issues and that not just one program is going to fix everything we need to be thinking um about child nutrition programs about community gardens about supporting farmers about reforming the federal poverty level all of these things but to mention this this program model of veggie prescription programs where public and private partnerships really create this huge benefit not only to patients but talking about supporting small farmers and economic development both in rural urban and suburban areas to address hunger nutrition and health for oregonians and other folks in other states as well and so i would really um i'd be happy to talk to you um or send your staffers more information about these types of programs after this meeting too um but i think um as carla mentioned as well um greater utilization but also financial support for these types of programs not only in oregon but nationwide and using oregon as a model that standardizing and how flexible funding dollars are being used to support these types of programs um so that this is not only another safety net for folks you know who were falling between the gaps i i just want to point out too um i i had worked with my colleagues at um francia and carla at adelaide for over 10 years and one and we had a veggie rx program that is continuing to thrive and one of the reasons why we started that program is because of that stigma of signing up for snap or being ineligible for snap benefits because of immigration status and that through these partnerships with local healthcare partners we could identify families who really did need those food supports would get those benefits to shop at a farmers market and get groceries for a week at a time throughout that growing season um so that really supported families um and um and caught some folks that would have fallen through the gaps otherwise and i think in in oregon we are situated where we have the coverall kids program so folks on ohp um can get support through these veggie rx programs and get paid through that those benefits are paid for through ccos but we need to standardize that and make that more known across the board there and then nationwide as well um so thank you so much for the opportunity on this and i um uh i just want to applaud um everyone who's who's doing this work the the work that i'm doing at ohsu too is really supporting employees and i um just because someone has an ohsu badge on doesn't mean that they're not struggling with food insecurity um and that you know it's something other colleagues here have mentioned that stigma of reaching out for support even if you have a full-time job or multiple jobs life is difficult and it's not it's not working right now for many many people um so thank you so much thank you kaley and thank you for reminding us about the intersectionality of all these things and i have had a couple of visits this week uh dealing with the need for more affordable housing for example and can you just confirm kaylee is the is the veggie prescription program just exactly as it sounds prescribing uh for for i assume children to get vegetables or for adults as well children and adults so typically the way that it works is that it's a partnership between a healthcare clinic or fqhc and a community benefit organization where patients are identified by the clinic and then the community organization connects those patients with food resources usually at a farmers market or a csa they receive those those food benefits throughout the growing season or sometimes year-round sometimes that food is delivered directly to the family or sometimes the family goes and shops at a farmer's market to receive that food and it covers usually children or entire families depending on the program thank you so much and i didn't know if matt wanted to weigh in uh we do have press and i want to give them a minute matt did you want to to add anything to the conversation no no i'm staffing suzanne i just dropped another chat thank you for the invite though and great

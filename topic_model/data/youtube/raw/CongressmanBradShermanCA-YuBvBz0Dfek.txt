AND THEY'LL GIVE IT A GOOD LOOK. >> GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. BEFORE WE GET TO THE DISCUSSION  ABOUT WHO WILL LEAD YOUR GROUP,  WHAT DO YOU DO HERE GENERALLY? A LOT OF REPUBLICANS CRITICISMS  FOR DONALD TRUMP, THEY DIDN'T  THINK HE WAS THAT CONSERVATIVE. THEY THOUGHT SOME OF HIS IDEAS  WERE FAIRLY DEMOCRATIC. ARE THERE THINGS YOU CAN GET ON  BOARD WITH OR STRAIGHT  OPPOSITION? >> DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGNED AS A  POPULIST INCREASINGLY I FEAR  HE'LL GOVERN AS IF HE'S MITT  ROMNEY. WE WANT TO IMPOSE TAXES ON THOSE WHO SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS. SOME IN HIS GROUP ARE TALKING  ABOUT A ZERO TAX HOLIDAY ON THE  PROFITS EARNED OVERSEAS. WE SEE BANNON, THAT'S CERTAINLY  NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR THOSE WHO  WANT TO BRING THE COUNTRY  TOGETHER. THERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND  TRUMP'S STATEMENTS IN FAVOR OF  PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND  MEDICARE BENEFITS, AND, OF  COURSE, HIS TRADE POLICY. WE'RE RUNNING THE LARGEST TRADE  DEFICIT EVERY YEAR, YEAR AFTER  YEAR, THAT ANY COUNTRY HAS EVER  RUN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. AND I THINK WE MAY GET A NEW  TRADE POLICY FROM DONALD TRUMP,  HOPEFULLY WE GET MORE THAN JUST  A NO ON TPP. WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED  THAT NO MATTER WHO HAD BEEN  ELECTED PRESIDENT.  >> WHO DO YOU SUPPORT WHEN IT  COMES TO YOUR LEADERSHIP? NANCY PELOSI OR TIM RYAN. TIM RYAN IS THE NEW FACE. YOU GOT SHELLACKED. IS IT TIME FOR NEW LEADERSHIP? >> WE GAINED SOME SEATS IN THE  HOUSE, THEY GAINED SOME SEATS IN THE SENATE. IT WAS IN THE HANDS OF BARACK  OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON AND  THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL. BUT WE WON THE POPULAR VOTE, AND I THINK THAT IT IS NOT SO --  PEOPLE AREN'T VOTING FOR FACES. THEY'RE VOTING FOR POLICY.  >> WE'RE SHOWING OUR VIEWERS NOW THAT THE LOSSES THAT YOU  SUFFERED UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA  SINCE -- DURING HIS TEN YEAR. 63 SEATS IN CONGRESS. 10 IN THE SENATE. 12 GOVERNORSHIPS. AND THEN PRETTY DIRE AS WELL. RESPOND TO THOSE. YOU DON'T THINK THAT HAS  ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE  LEADERSHIP? >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ELECTING  GOVERNORS, THAT'S NOT MY FOCUS. IN THE HOUSE, THIS IS THE  LEADERSHIP THAT LED US TO THE  HUGE VICTORIES OF 2006 AND 2008  AND THE GOOD SHOWING IN 2012. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT, HOWEVER,  FOR HOUSE LEADERSHIP TO CREATE  AN IMAGE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC  PARTY. GO BACK AT YOUR OWN BROADCAST. HOW MANY MINUTES WAS NANCY  PELOSI ON VERSUS DONALD TRUMP  AND HILLARY CLINTON. PEOPLE WENT TO VOTE, THE IMAGES  THEY HAD WERE DONALD AND  HILLARY.  >> 2008 WAS THE LONG TIME AGO,  THAT WAS THEN. THIS IS NOW. THERE SEEMS TO BE A HUGE DIVIDE  HERE. YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER, LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, FAR TO THE  LEFT. YOU HAVE YOUNGER PEOPLE LIKE TIM RYAN, LITTLE MORE CENTRIST,  WHICH PATH SHOULD YOU TAKE? WHAT IS THE LESSON FROM THIS  ELECTION? >> THE LESSON IS TO REACH OUT  AND OFFER THEM NOT JUST AN  OPPOSING TPP AND I DON'T THINK  MY PARTY ARTICULATED THAT VERY  WELL. THERE WERE SO MANY IN OUR PARTY  INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS  IN FAVOR OF OUR EXISTING TRADE  POLICY AND DOUBLING DOWN ON IT,  THAT THAT MESSAGE GOT LOST. LOOK AT THE STATES THAT HILLARY  CLINTON LOST. THE EXACT STATES YOU LOSE IF YOU ALLOW THE REPUBLICANS TO LOOK  LIKE THEY'RE FOR A NEW TRADE  POLICY AND ALLOW THE DEMOCRATS  LED BY THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE IT  SOUND LIKE WE'RE FOR DOUBLING  DOWN ON THE OLD TRADE POLICY. NOT THAT WE LOST NATIONWIDE, WE  WON THE POPULAR VOTE. WE LOST THE STATES ON -- THAT  CONCERNED ABOUT TRADE, MOST  ESPECIALLY, AND THOSE ARE STATES WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO BY  PROPOSING A NEW TRADE POLICY.  >> NATIVE CALIFORNIA, NATIVE OF  LOS ANGELES MYSELF, YOU  REPRESENT THE SAN FERNANDO  VALLEY. OIL AND GAS PLENTY IN  CALIFORNIA. YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR YEARS. SHOULD YOU DRILL FOR IT, SHOULD  YOU NOT. IF WE SEE A GREATER OPENING FOR  OIL AND GAS, ALONG WITH  RENEWABLES, AS A CALIFORNIAN,  WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT? >> PLACES IN CALIFORNIA YOU  SHOULD DRILL, PLACES IN  CALIFORNIA THAT YOU SHOULD NOT. >> SUCH AS WHERE IN.  >> OFF THE SANTA BARBARA COAST. I THINK CALIFORNIA PRODUCES  SIGNIFICANT OIL, WE'LL CONTINUE  TO DO SO. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER PLACES  IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE WILL  PRODUCE HYDRO CARBONS AS WE  TRANSITION WHERE THERE ARE MORE  JOBS PER KILOWATT THAN THERE ARE IN COAL. >> SIR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

i asked for unanimous consent to suspend the quorum call for a few minutes so that i might speak without objection mr president i am just profoundly sad and also humbled and proud to honor the memory of a cherished son of wyoming more than anything i rise to honor my longtime friend leland christensen leland was most recently state director for my u.s senate office truly his death cuts me to the depth of my heart i have known leland for decades and there are few losses in my life that i have ever felt as deeply as this one leland was all wyoming he was tough as nails endlessly patient and unwaveringly kind prior to his time in my office leland served the people of wyoming and our great nation in a number of roles he was formerly a member of the wyoming national guard a sheriff a county commissioner for teton county a state senator and chair of our state senate's judiciary committee a deputy director of the wyoming office of homeland security and of course most recently state director for our u.s senate office when i was elected to the u.s senate i knew i needed leland on my team because he loved wyoming people he loved to help his fellow man he cared about the challenges faced by our state and its people his smile would light up every room and his laugh was infectious he was a joy to be with he was my dear friend he even guided my daughter and me into the teton wilderness along with his own family on horseback to hawks rest the most remote place in the lower 48 states intense in the rain fishing with mules panniers packs it was an incredible experience we also floated the snake river together with leland at the helm of his own raft his knowledge and skill had a timeless quality to them he rescued people in swollen rivers he rescued their horses he searched for people in wilderness areas because he knew the wilderness areas like the back of his hand he was a totally unique human being his knowledge and skill was so timeless he would have thrived and excelled had he lived 200 years ago just as surely as he did in the 21st century where he skillfully navigated legislation people issues computer issues listen to endless books on tape while he traveled all over wyoming he was a timeless wonderful individual i can honestly say i never worried about whether my team was taking care of the needs of my constituents in wyoming because i always knew that leland was watching he always made sure that anyone who needed help with a federal agency was assisted and that our team was doing everything possible to help them resolve their problems by every estimation certainly by my estimation he was 10 feet tall and bulletproof but in his own good time god calls all his children home to be of service there leland was prepared for his service in heaven each and every day throughout his entire life of wyoming i can remember leland praying before a meal out in the wilderness with such gratitude that you had heard a sermon in gratitude by the time he was done offering grace over a meal i've talked a lot about leland as a public servant and a friend but he was first and foremost a loving and devoted father and husband i am mourning his loss with his wife anita children hunter brittany simone jed and wyatt their spouses and his grandchildren my staff and i many of whom are here today joining me in this senate chamber along with the entire wyoming community tens of thousands of which knew leland and love leland and we are all praying for leland's family words cannot truly convey the loss that we as a team feel since leland passed away i've worked with hundreds of colleagues many of whom i've cared for very much but rarely do i come across someone whose sincere humility generosity and selflessness come close to those of leland christensen every day spent with leland was a better day he was the definition of both civil servant and statesmen and on behalf of the people of wyoming i want to say thank you for his service to our state and our country mr president i yield back

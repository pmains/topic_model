first of all i want to thank my colleagues for standing here with me this truly is incredible and if the democrats were being honest the bill would be titled the abortion on demand until birth act because that's what it is the women's health protection act are you kidding me this is not protecting women's health it has nothing to do with protecting women's health and everything to do to making abortion on demand just the law of the land an everyday occurrence to be thought of just like that every day that this can happen there's no need for this bill or today's vote especially when americans know there are many more critical needs right now going on in this country and around the globe it's simply out of touch with the views of the american people 65 percent believe states should oversee abortion laws 65 percent oppose abortion in the second trimester and 80 percent oppose abortion in the third trimester i oppose abortion i will continue to do what i can do as a u.s senator and as a mother to protect to protect the lives of all of god's children from this horrifying extreme legislation such as abortion on demand until birth act thank you

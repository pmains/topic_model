all right so joining us in our first segment here in the eight o'clock hour really excited to have uh this voice on and you hear him a lot uh during the moon griffon show but uh we get a chance to speak with him here on acadiana's morning news u.s congressman mike johnson joining us uh sir thank you so much for taking the time hey thanks brandon bernie good to talk to y'all yeah we're we're so thankful for the chance to get to talk to you this morning so let's talk about the border let's start there congressman um what are the latest insights from there you know secretary mallorca's claims that quote the border is secure and um i think anybody that i can't even hardly say that with a straight face it's hard to believe that he does yeah i'm just gonna it's i'm gonna be frank and tell you that i think he's com he has uh committed impeachable offenses by the day now and you know he came before our house judiciary committee just a couple months ago and i i told him in a in a little video clip that went viral that he needed to dust off his resume because we're going to have the majority back in november and we have a responsibility to get this madness under control and this guy is doing this stuff intentionally so we'll see what happens with all that but y'all the numbers are staggering and and i did town halls all over the district i have 15 parishes that runs from up north you know the arkansas border in northwest louisiana all the way down um into part of cajun country there just north of where you guys are and uh whatever parish i go to everybody has the same three concerns there you summarize it all in in three eyes i call it the three eyes and it is inflation immigration and incompetence right that's the problems they have with washington right now for the obvious reason but since joe biden became president y'all over 3.1 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at the southern border now they that's the apprehended number that doesn't even count but probably close to a million of the the godaways who just debated capture entirely and it's just completely out of control these open border policies mass releases zero enforcement it has created the worst border crisis in our history and it is a direct uh a challenge to our safety and security and our sovereignty of the country and you say they've been apprehended but what happens when they do get apprehended oh yeah all that means is they get processed really yeah this isn't uh fake handcuffs like um like aoc on the steps of the supreme court this is they don't even use fake handcuffs right they what they do is they give them everything they need healthcare um they they give them a little bit of money oftentimes they get a cell phone tracking device some of them but they're processed and they're sent throughout the country and so we're getting busloads of illegal immigrants dropped off in cities all around louisiana and all around the country routinely well we're paying for that of course the american taxpayers and it's not a sustainable situation and you talked about that on the bus loads and and you know dan bongino uh which you can listen to here on k-pal from uh noon to 3 p.m monday through fridays um he was talking about that yesterday how you had a couple of the uh liberal mayors one of them being you know uh mayor bowser in washington d.c and i can't remember the other mayor um but was come oh new york's mayor was coming out and come here there you go coming out and complaining about the immigrants that were being quote unquote tricked and sent over to their cities and these are people that are a part of a party that has been very obviously sympathetic to all of these immigrants coming over illegally and they're okay with it whenever the illegal immigrants are you know on the border states like texas and here in louisiana but then when when when the illegal immigrants are sent up north to their areas all of a sudden now they're complaining and they're upset that's right because governor abbott in texas is the one paying for those bus trips now to send them into the blue districts and that's a key brandon they have been doing they've been sending the bus loads my theory is and we have no way to to access the numbers they won't tell us exactly uh where and how often and how the locations are chosen but our theory is they're sending them into our red congressional districts republican areas okay um and and now that they're being sent into these big blue cities um the mayors are panicking right and and eric adams in new york as you said he said this is a quote a real burden on new yorkers food clothing school he said this is going to impact our schools there's just a whole host of things that's going to this is going to produce unquote they can't handle it mayor bowser in dc said our city is overwhelmed well welcome to the crisis folks yeah we've been ringing these alarms for almost two years now because this began of course as soon as the blind administration took over it is intentional and it is unconscionable and it is not sustainable and we have to have the rule of law there is a reason that everybody in the world wants to come to our country we're the greatest nation in the world but we cannot sustain that we can't be the great benevolent country that we are if we can't maintain our border you have to have a border or you don't have a country i mean it's really simple and and anybody can can acknowledge this and and by the way there's also another little viral video uh on my social media anybody can watch all this rep mike johnson right so we were in a judiciary committee hearing about two weeks ago and i got the chairman of the house judiciary committee jerry nadler of new york to admit that their objective here okay is that they want to turn the illegals into voters there it is he said it he admitted it in a colloquy that he and i had and and we sent that out immediately and it went everywhere because we've known all along that was the objective but now they're saying the quiet parts out loud jerry nadler he is i know this is kind of off topic but since you brought him up he's kind of an odd fella just gonna be honest i love you brandon he's an odd guy and he just doesn't seem like someone that gets along with much of anybody you know personally these are not bad people but what i object to brandon is there is their crazy crazy policies okay we have the greatest country in the world for a reason it's not by happenstance it's because we're built on certain foundational principles individual freedom limited government the rule of law you know peace through strength discord responsibility free markets human dignity the sanctity applied but all those all those values that made us who we are the the left now and the leaders of the democrat party hold those in disdain they actually oppose the central premises and the foundational principles that made us the great nation and they're working every day to dismantle those foundations and rebuild us to become some sort of european you know socialist style government we have to oppose that and it's not personal you know look the bible tells us we love everybody right i do but it also tells us that we are supposed to demolish false arguments that set themselves up against the truth and that's what we got here and and you know not to over spiritualize this but this is a battle for the future of the country and for the future of what is good and right and and for human flourishing of all people regardless of who they are and that's why let me ask you this um were you an original supporter or were you a supporter of the wall of course it's just common sense and you know what it worked and that's what i was kind of getting to because i wanted to to get to not just about how it worked but where does it sit now after almost two years of the biden administration i can tell you from my first-hand account i've been down there in the rio grande valley you know biden stops by executive order stopped construction the day after he took office by the way we already paid for all the materials i mean you're talking about hundreds and hundreds and millions of dollars of fencing uh that is laid in the in the dirt there just rotting and rusting away and they just stopped it i went to the where the wall actually uh was was ceased to construction at one o'clock in the morning with a handful of my colleagues and we just watched droves of illegals just walking across you know it's an open completely open border and that's why when when mayorkis said this week a couple days ago oh yeah well the border is secure i mean that is just it's laughable it's a joke it would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous by the way y'all we've had scores of terrorists on the terrorist watch was coming into the country that's the ones we know about and among those millions who went through got through you know without any detection at all the guidaways you can be assured that the dangerous people went that route right they didn't want to get caught by the border patrol to be processed they had other designs so we have no idea who's in this country where they are what they're planning and it's a really really serious situation yes people need to pay attention without a doubt my god that's frightening so congressman johnson let's look ahead to the 2022 midterms so republicans if republicans are able to overtake the house and the senate like is expected what can be done to help to reverse some of what's happening at the border i know that joe biden is still the president democrats are still in control there but what can be done from a congressional standpoint to help reverse what's been happening over the last year and a half brother we're going to start on day one uh in my committee judiciary is the one that has jurisdiction over this and so we've we've got plans already in the works to by by every measure possible uh to push legislation to fix this mess and we can now here's the question what is joe biden or kamala whomever is in the white house at that point yeah what what are they going to do are they going to are they going to veto that legislation i mean we're going to dare them to and that will set up a a epic election for president in 2024. um but we're going to do everything we can in that two-year period you know we'll begin in january the new congress it'll be republican-led the house we're expected to have possibly the biggest majority in u.s history um you know knock on wood i certainly hope that we get close to that projection i i believe that we're going to win a a small majority in the senate by at least one or two seats and so the republicans will be in charge of the legislative branch again and this is a long time coming because right now we have unified government of course we have the democrats the radical left really in charge of the white house and both houses of congress and that's why the country is crumbling that's why we have a crisis everywhere you look because their policy white house does and we'll fight them in court we'll we'll fight them every way we can because this is about the survival of the republic and you cannot overstate its importance so i got a little bit of a curveball for you as we uh close the segment out we've been mentioning former president trump uh often in uh in this segment so he said he's going to make an announcement uh before the midterms you know the election itself about whether he's going to run or not you someone that served on his legal team uh you fought for the former president do you think he's going to put his name into the hat to run again in 2024 i think he certainly wants to and my guess is he probably is going to do it before the midterms i mean i haven't talked to him in several weeks but of course my advice would be if he calls me i'm gonna say mr president please wait because um you know we're working on on a strategy and our messaging and all of that and of course if he throws his hat in now that'll change the whole dynamic of the race and everything will be about trump you know and i'm not sure that's the best play the best strategy for for him or the the republican party or the country so you know i i'm hoping he's a patient in that in that realm he's known for a lot of good things but i don't think he's known for his patience no not not so much you're right no uh us congressman mike johnson has been our guest sir thank you so much for your time we really appreciate the insights this morning yeah great talk to y'all keep up great work

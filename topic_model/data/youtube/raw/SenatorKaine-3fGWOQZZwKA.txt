well the senator who helps decide where the money goes for our military was in our area today he's illinois senator dick durbin chairman for the subcommittee on defense he and virginia senator tim kaine paid a visit to a business that depends on the military heavily newport news shipbuilding and center science art khan is also there to talk to the centers about sequestration and the pace at which congress is handling this and how that discussion became more about compromise than carriers yeah that really is the topic tom i mean at this point the budget battle might be better described as an endless debate rather than simply an ongoing argument but one thing everyone does agree on democrats and republicans alike if congress cannot find compromise the consequences will be significant and felt by everyone especially in this region the senator from illinois said he was impressed with the operation at newport news shipbuilding but expressed grave concerns not only for the future of the ship construction and repair industry but the business of running the country we're facing challenges the likes of which we haven't seen in modern times when it comes to the budget the department of defense will have to trim its spending next year by 52 billion dollars sequestration cuts the navy's budget by about 14 billion dollars those reductions are real the chief of naval operations said today that he would try to continue funding ship construction good news for newport news for the rest of this region's shipyards that perform ship repair 2014 could be a tough year as we look at it now i think there'll be a significant reduction in our surface ship availabilities subject to a change about half of the 60 availabilities that we have planned will have to be deferred i have not read this particular comment from this morning but but we got to fix this senator tim kaine says the fix depends on compromise a process he says won't begin until senate republicans allow their budget to proceed into conference it's frustrating for us it's got to be much more frustrating for the people who are losing paychecks or these jobs that we're losing frustrating to many taxpayers is the fact that congress is about to take their summer break in the midst of all this unfinished business a lot of the american people think you should stay right there until you get this budget thing taken care of especially in with the potential of everything we're talking about here today well let me just let me just say there's no reason why we can't work through the august break at least in a conference committee and resolve our differences well senator durbin sounds sincere in his desire to work in conference during the break however it's not likely to happen given the lack of interest house republicans have shown in the senate's budget proposal thus far i don't think it will happen aren't content on your side

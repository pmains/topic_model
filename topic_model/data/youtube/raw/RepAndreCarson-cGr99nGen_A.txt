congressman it's been a historic week in Washington with the Supreme Court decisions on health care and on same-sex marriage I want to get your reaction on both cases first on the marriage ruling what did you make of the court's decision I agree with the court's decision i think it's a it's a great time in our country for for loved ones of mine for friends of mine for Hoosiers and for Americans this is a huge and monument to an overdue step for us so I'm very excited and I commend the LGBTQ community for their advocacy and I salute the Supreme Court for doing the right thing it's certainly been at the top of the news cycle in indiana throughout this year with all of the controversies we've seen in the Hoosier State what do you think is next in this battle over marriage is is this debate over now or will we continue to see legal flights about various issues relating to this topic absolutely not i think that there are still huge pockets of bigotry i think that there are huge degrees of discrimination as it relates to the LGBT community and i think we have a long way to go however this this signal coming from the Supreme gives us some hope but the fight must continue with the activist community those of us who are legislators we are tasked with providing legislative remedies and so as we move forward we still must understand that we cannot relax the battle continues

so i'm here standing next to the trans alaska pipeline right now we're flowing at less than half capacity because we've got policies in place that quite honestly are not allowing us to produce what we need this pipeline and what this pipeline represents is energy security it's national security we've got policies that are taking us backwards we need to unleash america's energy particularly now where those in europe are begging us give us the us alternative we can't do that if we have policies in place that deny that that say we would rather go to foreign countries with dictators that we don't like that are ruthless who have horrible environmental track records you've got an administration right now that would rather go there rather than tap into america's energy wealth benefit americans help our economy environmentally sound insensitive that's where we do it is here we can have that independence here based on our american energy resources

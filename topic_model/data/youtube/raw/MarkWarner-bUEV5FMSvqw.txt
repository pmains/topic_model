president we appreciate that bipartisan conversation that's going on in to share and hope that more of that will go on and that really is comes a little bit to why I rise today because I hope and pray that if there while we have many legitimate policy differences in this body that one thing one thing we ought to have absolute complete agreement on is that the United States of America cannot afford another government shutdown the last shutdown which President Trump was so proud to initiate cost our economy and this is the lowest estimate we could find so we don't look like we're overstating an estimated six billion dollars but the truth is that number hardly reflects the human cost of this self-inflicted disaster that our country was led into a recent survey found that 62 percent of federal workers depleted most or all of their emergency savings forty-two percent of federal workers took on debt to pay bills or other expenses 25 percent tapped their retirement accounts and if you tap your IRA you pay tax penalties you get none of that reimbursed and listen to this mr. president 25 percent of our federal workers who were the victims of this shutdown 25 percent of our federal workers during this shutdown had to visit a food bank if you work for the United States of America the greatest nation in the world and you are asked to show up to work without pay you should not have to go visit a food bank I spent most of my career etc and proud of those activities but I know very few folks who work for any of my companies that would have continued to show up day in and day out do their jobs if they were going for 35 days without pay in 35 days without pay well frankly you had some members of the so-called board the Congress who had so no appreciation all for their suffering and many who of which who said they didn't mind a bad shutdown had continued indefinitely mr. president those fellow Americans our federal workers our contractors private businesses who support federal installations or the the campground outside the Shenandoah National Forest or the restaurant outside the Petersburg battlefield not just federal employees folks in the private sector as well interim n discard ship because the president decided to use their livelihoods as a bargaining chip that can't happen again unfortunately and while I'm want to always try to be optimistic and appreciate the bipartisan agreement that has been reached by the budget negotiators unfortunately we find ourselves in this same spot right now potentially just days away from another Trump shutdown now the president said quote unquote he's not happy but he won't say if you'll sign the bipartisan deal that came from the conference committee let's be clear the uncertainty itself is having a negative impact on the operation of the federal government in costing taxpayer dollars each and every day that this cloud hangs over the government agencies are already interrupting investigations canceling trainings and meetings they're being forced to act as if the government will once again be shut down at the end of this week this is just plain mismanagement of government by the Trump administration and yet it's another example of the disrespect this White House has shown to our federal workforce in Virginia over the past few weeks senator Kaine and I has spent a lot of time listening to federal workers we heard federal we heard from federal workers who had to pull their kids out of daycare and send them away to relatives because they couldn't meet those day care expenses if they weren't getting paid folks who missed student loan payments or literally had to choose between their medications and paying rent now these workers have started to receive some of their back pay and many of them not fully all of their back pay from the shutdown but the truth is even those federal workers those who drew down their savings or incurred a tax penalty from taking on their IRA or taking in advance on the credit card they're not made whole by receiving back pay because they have incurred penalties that will never be made up beyond the psychic damage has taken place to with their families but even if we accept that most of the federal workers will ultimately get their back pay that is not the case for thousands of federal contractors in Virginia and around the country but quite honestly the nightmare is not over for the president's decision to finally reopen the government didn't magically undo 35 days of miss pay unfortunately no one from the White House could be bothered to meet with any of these folks whether it be federal workers or contractors who were hurt by this government shutdown but if they had they would have they would know how much pain this president shutdown continues to inflict on federal contractors particularly low and middle-income workers I've spent the last couple of months the last month and a half listing these folks describe the anxiety of not knowing when their next paycheck would come or if it would come at all now we're not talking and sometimes when we think about federal contracts you think about sometimes high-priced folks and any other move who do a good job working for our government many of them in my state that sometimes the image of a federal contractor I wonder if most of the members of this body realize that the people who clean the toilets at the Smithsonian or serve the food in the cafeteria the Smithsonian are federal contractors and for the 35 days to come and shutdown they have no recourse at this moment in time they are struggling as we speak and they will continue to struggle if Congress doesn't take advantage of this opportunity if we get this deal signed by Friday and keep the government open to make good on our commitment to those contractors as well if we end up with the alternative and the government shuts down again these folks lies but at least the economic class will be in jeopardy the number of small businesses women-owned business minority-owned business veteran owned businesses who tried to this last 35 days shut down to keep their workers on payroll they had to take that money out of their business pockets to try to make ends do but I had a lot of after a couple weeks couldn't afford to do that and those businesses shut down years in certain cases decades of work down the drain not because they did something that was mismanagement not because they did something that was irresponsible not because they weren't providing the taxpayers with the full value of their work but because we here in Congress and this White House couldn't come to a common agreement on the most basic responsibilities of government was it to keep the doors open and the lights on held a roundtable recently with a contractor in Springfield Virginia a contractor told Barbara that told me she's behind on her rent and had to think a granddaughter out of daycare because she can't pay the bills she's glad she's back at work but that 35 days with no pay unless we rectify that with this deal that may come to pass before the weekend she is still left in the cold another at that same roundtable told me of having to choose between food and medicine a couple of weeks ago as well I met a contractor named John and Afghanistan veteran who was picking up groceries at the food bank in Arlington because the shutdown had wiped out his savings yes impressed that John didn't want to go on camera you know he was a little bit embarrassed that he had to come and pick up food at the food bank this is someone who was a veteran this was someone who continued to serve in terms of protecting the country around Homeland Security thirty-five days without pay and as the status quo he will never get those lost earnings back if we don't rectify that this week another contractor named Joseph who works as a custodian at the Department of the Interior told me this quote we work just as hard as anyone else we need our back pay so we can catch up on our bills and survive the remarkable thing is for some of these generators and custodial workers on buildings that were open they had to continue to work and still don't get back pay one of the most heartbreaking things was listening these contractors talk about the shame the shame of being treated as if their work does not have value but the truth is these folks take pride in their work because they love their country that same contractor Joseph says he thinks of the building he cleans as the president's house and he works hard because he wants to make it shine every day what it is graced that this government can't even honor his service with back wages so they can pay his bills and get his personal finances in order many other contractors take pride in their work because it represents their independence over forty five thousand disabled Americans workers federal contractors through the AbilityOne program I know this program is very successful in Delaware my Senate Senate from general will speak on speak shortly I've met contractors who are double double amputees veterans with PTSD and folks with physical and intellectual disabilities they are able to live quote unquote normal lives and contribute to society because of these federal contractor jobs for many of them this these jobs or more than about pay it's about respect it's about being valued and part of a community part of a team at the offices they work in and they suffer more than just about anyone when their lifeline that source of end income independence and dignity is cut off because of a government shutdown I want to close with something a federal contractor named Constance told me last week even though she and her team of custodians still faced tremendous financial hardship she told me that she remains hopeful she's hopeful because she and her co-workers are now back to work and she's hopeful because people in this chamber are finally starting to listen to folks like her I share her hope that the Senate will have the decency and the basic humanity to make sure one that we don't close down this government took come Friday but to that when we come to this deal we take that moment when eyes see colleagues from both sides that we've gotten a CBO score it is scored to make sure the back pay for the contractors with an emphasis towards low-income contractors under $50,000 the cost would be at 1 billion dollars that's a CBO score but we ought to make sure that these people's lives the work they do is valued so I hope that as we have this bipartisan deal to avoid the shutdown that we can also put and make it right for the folks who oftentimes many of us don't see who cleaned the buildings serve the food many folks again from the disabled community who rely upon us to do the right thing Congress should pass this back pay for federal contractors legislation the ped the president should sign it and if the Congress doesn't the Congress should override his veto let's make sure as we did with federal workers that they will always be ensured that they will get their back pay let's make sure that contractors get that same business and that same decency it's time to do the right thing mr. president with that I yield the floor

senator Tim Kaine will spend this day in our area and he's getting it started by talking to us live right here on WDBJ 7 morning the senator joins us now live from Dublin before his tour of the Volvo truck assembly plant senator Kaine thanks for being with us this morning let's start off with what you got to hear from those workers there at Volvo in Dublin well we're going to talk about the economy I'm really glad to be back I was last here at this plant probably in about two thousand eight or nine it's the only vehicle manufacturing plant in Virginia they do a great job real leaders and sustainability wonderful you know american-made trucks and it's going to be good to visit with workers and management and find out what I can do in Washington to help them be more successful senator Kaine one issue that local businesses say could affect them is the New River Valley Airport there in Dublin losing its only Customs and Border Patrol officer now do you see any problems coming from losing that officer and can a position be replaced well the this is a real serious problem senator Warner and I and congressman Griffith signed on to a letter to the CP be back in customs and border patrol patrol back in May to encourage him to keep the staffing levels but frankly this is a victim of the sequester and budgetary challenges were in as you know we're in we're engaged in the sequester where we're doing across-the-board cuts including cuts that I don't think are a good idea to make it all that's why I supported stopping the sequester with a vote in the Senate and februari I have work to pass a Senate budget for the first time in four years that would eliminate some of these frankly kind of ridiculous and non strategic cuts but our budget has been passed in the Senate we are trying to go to a conference with the house and thus far that conference is being blocked we're going to work on it every day to see if we can come up with a solution ultimately the challenge here is budgetary politics and if we can get the budget right then I think there's some hope that we could restore the position senator Kennedy want to talk a little bit about the president's health care law we're seeing businesses all over cut part-time hours because of that employer mandate the requirement businesses offer health insurance is this something Congress should have seen coming before passing the law or is it something that should be addressed now well I think it's something we need to fix look employers have been sadly reducing health insurance for their employees for many years back in the 90s about sixty-five percent of small businesses for example provided health insurance for their employees and by the time of 2010 when the Affordable Care Act was passed that number had shrunk the thirty five percent so for decades employers have been shedding health care because it's too expensive they're continuing to do it that means we have more work to do what I hope in Congress will do is instead of spending now three years having 40 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act which would which would hurt people with pre-existing conditions which would hurt seniors let's start to talk about reforms if we spend our energy on reforms rather than repeal that's going to be the better way to go and reforms to deal with this part time issue I think would be a real good place to start all right a lot to consider and nice hat and Senator came right here in our area today a busy day in dublin everyone and then on to roanoke for the summer school program senator Cain takes for taking time with us this morning that great to be out in southwest nights we appreciate it thank you so much it's been warm here

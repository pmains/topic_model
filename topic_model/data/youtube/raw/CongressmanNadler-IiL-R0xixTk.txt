thank you madam chair I wish I could say I'm shocked to find myself here today voting in a report and contempt against them Express but today's meeting is just another step in a long corrupt process this effort is in clear violation of house rules the company against whom the chair is attempting to bring criminal contempt charges has made a good faith effort to comply with the demands of the Republicans on this panel even as those demands change from day to day the company has made reasonable and clearly necessary requests for some consideration to be made for the safety and security of its employees and the clinic scientists and other companies with whom it works the Republicans refuse to acknowledge these requests stem Express is offered up witnesses and dates those witnesses would be available to provide explanations and testimony about precisely how their business operates the Republicans ignored those offers most importantly stem Express has produced reams of documents over 1,700 pages in response to each of the panels request the Republicans always demanded more documents more names more information somehow it has never been enough but this panel has never been about pursuing the truth rather this witch hunt is designed to end fetal tissue research it is designed to force these companies into bankruptcy this corrupt process has always been about cutting off fetal tissue donation without the chair ever having to issue a report and release any factual findings of illegal activity by stem express Planned Parenthood or any of the multiple other organizations and individuals that chair have and the Republicans have shamefully named in the press despite repeated requests to protect their safety this is not a legitimate attempt to get gather relevant information miss heartless said we should quote we should determine if the laws being broken and if profits are being made the American people through their elected representatives formed this panel to find out if there is anyone if anyone is profiting from sale of baby body parts know if there is evidence that the stem Express or anyone else is violating the law by selling fetal tissue at a profit that evidence should be referred to the US Attorney it is not the province of Congress this committee to look at evidence of somebody's breaking the law simply for that purpose the Supreme Court has been very clear quote nor is the Congress of law enforcement of trial agency these are functions of the executive and judicial departments of government no inquiry is an end in itself it must be lated in furtherance of a legitimate task of the Congress investigations conducted solely for the personal aggrandizement of the investigators or to punish those investigated are indefensible instead this handful of Republicans were grossly abuse the power of Congress to intimidate harass and ultimately push private businesses out of perfectly legal business activities or even into bankruptcy without a single vote they will cut off access to fetal tissue and thereby end the vital research on which it depends at a time when public health officials continue to struggle against the Zika virus and scientists getting closer to unlocking the mysteries of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease it is shameful and underhanded it is dishonest dishonorable and contemptible this corrupt process and clear lack of regard for the rules of the house not to mention lack of regard for the personal safety of providers student scientists patients and employees has brought us here and has brought discredit upon the house I urge my colleagues to stop the switch-on follow the rules of the heart of the house stop this contemptible conduct to your jobs I yield back

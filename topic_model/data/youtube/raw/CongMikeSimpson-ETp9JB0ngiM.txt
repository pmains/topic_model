hey mister Thank You mr. chairman and thank you all for being here today appreciate it very much first 34 comments that you can comment on later if you'd like to and then a question first of all for the benefit of Mr Edwards my good friend and for mr. or hawk Paul Ryan isn't on this committee if you'd like to comment on that comment on his his plan I suggest to do it when he can respond to because I think he probably has a little different take than either you or mr. Edwards have on his plan secondly fiscal commission i agree with you i think the president was right to do that many of us have been suggesting this for a long time and i think everything ought to be on the table and it's going to be ugly decisions are going to be ugly we all know that if I think they're in the best interest of the country i'll vote for it if I think they aren't I'll vote against it and that's the way it ought to be thirdly when we talk about unemployment and era funding while we talk about it creating jobs you know I'm not one of those who says it hasn't created a job obviously it's created some jobs 300 in one company in my district doing cleanup we are now planning for next year when they lay off those 300 people that's something you're going to have to deal with also because there's going to be it's kind of like cash for clunkers it moved the purchase of automobiles up and then depressed it in future types so it is something that we're going to have to deal with when that unemployment hits in the coming year fourth I have heard surprisingly I guess financial debt when you came into office financial deficits opportunity to deficits job deficits education deficits investment deficits in a new one Foreign Relations deficit the only one I haven't heard is the reality deficit that that seems to have been created from all of these if there are any other deficit you face when you came into please send me a list of all those I'd like to hear about him now the question the one thing I heard when I was home over the last couple of weeks everywhere I went at every bank what we had was I wish you at the federal level we're making the same tough decisions every state legislature is making and I heard that from state legislators and I tell you I've been through some of the decisions that they've had to make back in nineteen 84 and 85 when I was in the state legislature they've made tough tough decisions is the president got a plan or submit a supplemental to bail out States and if so why should those states that have been fiscally responsible bail out those that have not made the tough decisions and we all know that there are some that have not made the tough decisions that others have made and so why should my taxpayers or Indiana's taxpayers bail out and i won't mention the states that have been irresponsible but kind of maybe i just could begin I think you're right to say just to go back to one of your initial points which is that you need to think about the recovery act as a bridge to recovery and private spending private investment and I think if you look carefully what's happening across the country today you can see encouraging signs of that happening because again you just look at look at what's happening to businesses you are seeing private investment expand again exports start to grow and that's encouraging that you know this this this will the economy is going to be able to grow coming out of this even as we do the necessary thing which is wind down these emergency things we had to do in the face of the worst recession a long time and you're absolutely right of course we have to make tough choices and I think the American families but not just not just musical governments are making that choice all the time and to what the President's budget does is lay out what are dramatically consequential changes in resources and commitments over the next four years that would bring our deficits down very very sharply over that period of time and Congress is gonna have to choose again what mix of those policies is going to embrace but it's very important everybody except the basic reality we live with which is that we have to get those deficits down very sharply over that period of time so you're right to emphasize it but I think in the near term this year given the damage of the recession we're still living with there's a very good fiscal case for a good economic case for giving additional support to state local government so they don't have to cut critical services deeply at a time when the economy is vulnerable and so many people are still suffering we need to do that in a careful way and if fiscally responsible way has to make sure it's temporary so we can unwind those kind of things but I think there's a very good economic case very good fiscal case now for additional targeted support first a smoke herbs as they make difficult choices we're not going to believe them of all those choices they're going to still have to make very tough choices on priorities but we want to make sure they're not having to cut deeply into critical services at a time when again in so many parts of the country unemployment is alarmingly high and there's still so much trauma and damage as in the aftershock of the recession could you do we have any time one thing I would like to address is what we're doing is fixed costs one thing we've complimented administration on in past years is that they have fully paid in Forest Service in the interior this year interior is going to have to accept 109 billion dollars a million dollars in fixed costs how are they going to do that well first let me just say with regard to since you raised fire in particular that aggregate resources not just in interior but in the agriculture department and elsewhere for addressing wildfires it is up five percent look you talked about hard choices I'll I don't wanna be we face a flat nominal budget despite the fact that the vast majority something like eighty eighty plus percent of our budget is personnel and there's normal upward pressure because of not only wages but health benefits and we have to make hard choices the Interior Department is no different and going down the list of other departments that I did earlier where you are fit where the secretaries have agreed to even nominal reductions they have plans to do so I mean other words they have specified budget plans to do so and we could follow up with secretary Salazar and in particular if you're interested but that's exactly what's involved in getting more efficiency out of the federal government

thank you Miss Wexton the chair now recognizes mr. Posey for five minutes I thank you madam chair when you talk to people who aren't familiar with history and you mentioned the importance of our space program to the survival of our species you get some chuckles and you even get some harassment a lot of that diminished somewhat when we had that relatively small asteroid implode over Russia a thousand miles from the nearest living person and injured a thousand of 1,500 people it did wake up some people to the possibilities the Planetary Science Division of the space mission director is responsible for the planetary defense coordination office which searches for characterized catalogs near-earth objects that could collide with the earth NASA established a planetary defense coordination office in 2016 in response to the NASA Inspector General's report and the Trump administration is calling for suit significant increase in near-earth orbit funding Congress asked NASA to identify 90% of all hazardous near-earth objects by 2020 NASA recently provided us a report that indicated they're not able to reach the goal in that time period but that the National Science Foundation's large synoptic survey telescope coupled with a space-based infrared mission could accelerate the survey and so mr. subbhu can I just wonder if you can tell me if NASA's now ready to go and and what the time he'll look maybe I think it's for the question ever committed of course that to achieve that goal I we're not gonna make it by 2020 I should have started a few years before sorry but no I mean look I mean we are what we're focusing on are two things first of all we want to use any and all assets that are available whether it's from the National Science Foundation or from our own missions to look at the data that are there and included into the very database that you're talking about for example the test machine that's out there in astrophysics is one of those sources that were piping into that very analysis the second one is through the increase by close to a factor of 3 of that particularly budget line that I fled together with our team were in able to actually do the very mission that you're talking about in fact we've started to invest in the technology the sensor technology to detect I was very cold objects and it's our expectation to go forward with that mission in the next few years as a budget which becomes available in that line ok mr. Sykes did you want to comment on that you had the largest grin when we were talking about survival of species well well we do have the tech technology and with the moving forward of the neo cam mission that provides the space-based infrared component the the limited to earth-based observatories and and I'm a telescope jockey myself is that you can only observe at night and and when you can only observe at night that means that you can't see much the interior there towards the Sun tour or interior of the Earth's orbit towards the Sun and and we can be hit by stuff from there too so so the neo cam mission is placed at Earth Sun l1 in between the son of the earth closer to the earth and it's scanning tens of degrees you know closer to the Sun so it captures well inside the orbit of Venus although all the objects that are moving in there and there's an interesting thing I'm sorry I could please cut me off but but that that you know for instance those chellie been size 20 meters site type objects that exploded in the in the atmosphere over Russia well about five times as many of those objects are hitting us as based from detecting flashes in the atmosphere and infrasound then are predicted by the asteroid population models from ground-based observatories why is that well there is a possible answer is that you could have a breakup of an interior as asked for interior to the orbit of the earth and we're getting fragments from that but you wouldn't pick that up in a ground-based telescope but you would with neo cam so so there's there's all kinds of having this combination of these ground-based sources in combination with neo cam is is really is really going to put this to rest not by 2020 but but you know probably within five years of its launch that the longest silence I've ever heard it in this committee it's when the president's chief scientists the NASA Administrator and the Secretary of the Air Force were asked in one of our committee hearings if a relatively small asteroid the one that that made it over Russia were headed for the Big Apple and we had a weeks notice which we wouldn't have what would we do that's the longest silence we ever heard in this committee thanks

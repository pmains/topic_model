Thank You mr. Zuckerberg thanks so much for being here today too and I also want to thank the chairwoman for having this hearing I think you've said a lot of things today that I don't think could have been said in the last hearing so it was important to have you here and your responses to questions has been very direct and very helpful so thank you for that and thank you very much for being here I just had a few quick questions about the Libre Association on the website one of the benefits before mr. Marcus appear before our committee was that those contributing who joined the Association could derive dividends from Libre Investment tokens and that since been taken off could you elaborate on that sure congressman I think that there had been an idea that in order to encourage marketing of the payment service that there might be some investment that other companies could make into this and some return that they could make but I think that that idea has either morphed or been abandoned at this point I'm not sure exactly what the current state of it is but that's what you're referring to yes that is do you think that's a reason some of these bigger name players pulled out of the Association or do you have a theory on that congressman I don't think that that's related to that would be my guess I mean those companies could have invested if they wanted to under that program but I I'm not sure that they were planning to and so I want to kind I want to close on this line of Switzerland I traveled with the chairwoman to Switzerland and we we found an environment there that seemed to be very Pro bringing the Association to Switzerland and one of the things that was troubling to me was this this idea that we've got a great American company like Facebook and a great American success story like yourself who's pushing this idea on foreign soil in your written testimony one of the things said as I believe this will extend Americans America's financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world if America doesn't innovate our financial leadership is not guaranteed those are your words and I agree with you but why not bring this to the United States even if it means saying we tried this we couldn't get our fellow Americans who couldn't get Congress on board but we think will have more success here at home why not give that a shot well congressman our subsidiary Calibra as well as a lot of the other independent there's a lot of the other organizations our American a lot of the work that we're doing is happening in America the platforms that we're building like whatsapp and facebook Messenger where people might be able to use Libre if the project moves forward those are American products that carry our values and it's it's contemplated that the Reserve of the independent Libre Association would be primarily American dollars so we've talked at length today about some of the reasons why it might make sense to headquarter a an International Association in the place that a lot of other international associations are headquartered but I wouldn't take away from that that this isn't still going to be an American innovation that is extending America's financial leadership around the world so I'll just say this before this hearing I kind of had two issues one was some of the issues Facebook has had over the last few years a lot of them have been voiced in this hearing today and the other was the whole issue of moving us to Switzerland and I just would say that I think you've done a good job answering our questions today any company as large as yours is gonna have problems and you'll continue to have problems and so I'm not so much against the idea of Facebook pursuing an innovative idea like perhaps I was in the past but I I it's difficult for me to get on board with something that's so big being in another country and I would employ you implore you to consider bringing this home perhaps as things Ford you've said that you'll pull out of the Association if it goes the direction you don't want to go I would argue that you will you have enough influence to bring this home and keep this American and I would ask that you consider that and I yield back

joining us now is Abigail spin burner Democratic nominee for Jinnah seventh congressional district running to try to unseat Republican congressman Dave brat mrs. Bamberger thank you very much for being here tonight I appreciate your time thank you for having me on Rachel so we've seen this story unfold over just a quick few days what do you think of the current explanation that we've got now that the release of this very sensitive document from your your time applying as a federal law enforcement officer and CIA officer it was all released just as an accident well that is that is the explanation that they've given and and frankly it doesn't remove or change the fact that my document was released in violation of the Privacy Act and that it was given to this research firm and that it was later than circulated and provided to journalists so you know I'm incredibly disappointed that this human error which was a resulted in a violation of law so profoundly impacted me but but actually I am really glad that it came to light because I want to ensure that this doesn't happen to other people in the future as far as you know in terms of the response that we've had from the administration thus far um have they notified any of the other people who may have been subject to the same kind of breach they made reference today in their formal statement about this matter that there may be other people whose personnel files with who knows what's in them may have been may have also been breached do we know if they've made further contact with other people who might have suffered what you did I do not know that no okay I also want to ask you about a matter of timing here so the the conservative pack here these Republican groups that obtained this information they apparently got this paperwork by accident through a Freedom of Information Act request that should not have been responded to the way it was as far as I understand it from the New York Times reporting a firm hired by you to help essentially prepare for your own campaign also filed a Freedom of Information Act request for your own records months and months ago at the end of last year and as far as I am as far as I'm told the firm working for you that filed that same request for your information still hasn't got anything but this Republican group appears to have had a zip zip very quick less than a month turnaround in terms of how quickly they got their information that's correct it's typical for campaigns to file research requests for themselves so we hired a firm to research me and they did submit Freedom of Information Act requests back in December of 2017 and as of right now we have not received any information either from CIA or from the US Postal Service related to my time as a federal agent or as a case officer with the CIA so you asked for this information on yourself you're waiting nine months on you still haven't gotten anything we know from the timing as explained by these Republican groups that they've got a response including your unredacted security clearance application they got it they had it in hand within three weeks of them first making a request that timing seems nuts I don't know if you have any explanation or any suspicions about that I don't have an explanation for it I would echo your your sentiments you know in in as you noted in the opening a FOIA request wouldn't typically or wouldn't wouldn't result in receiving an SF 86 which is the national security questionnaire and certainly not an unredacted one which as you mentioned include my full medical history my social security number you know every place I've ever lived every roommate I've ever had basically all of the information that you entrust to the federal government when you ask that in exchange they provide you with a security clearance and trust you with state secrets last question for you here you are part of a what appears to be a real wave of Democratic candidates running this year particularly first-time candidates who do have a national security background people with law enforcement military intelligence diplomatic Foreign Service background I wonder if you think that's a coincidence or if there's something about our politics in this moment this year at this time with Democrats opportunities that effort to take back the house which would really change Washington fundamentally I think right now it is it a coincidence there's so many people the kinds of backgrounds that you have that are all running right now or do you think it's sort of do you think it's it's it's a moment for the Democratic Party right now that we should see as a national trend I think it is a national trend and when you look at the fact that we did have a super PAC that was pushing out my my personal information my security my social security number my medical information you know in attempts to have some sort of political gain it speaks to how broken our system is it speaks what is wrong with our political system and I think there are so many of us who have served in various ways is in the military and intelligence community and law enforcement who were driven to serve the mission of protecting this country and upholding the Constitution and this is this situation is just emblematic emblematic of how bad things are in politics and you know you expect to be hit with a couple attack ads here or there I suppose but but this is just beyond the pale and what it does and what it signals to anyone who might currently be in federal service who's who's filled out in sf-86 a national security questionnaire you know I think there's probably people around the country taking pause of what might happen with the information they thought was safe and so so many of us who are running we're running because we want to stand up for what's right and we want to get this country back on track and be part of the change of changing not just the tone of the conversation in Washington but but really standing up for the principles of just right and wrong and the fact that this information was put out in violation of law either by a human error or otherwise you know that was the first mistake but then the second mistake is that an organization would know that they received us an error in violation of law and would continue to push it out and so you know for those of us who are running we're running because we want to stand up for what's right and and bring our voices to Congress and I'm excited to be part of this wave because I think this is just one more example of the fact that people with a service to focus on service to country and and an admission of upholding the Constitution that's exactly what we need in Washington at this time Abigail Spann Berger former CIA officer Democrat running for Congress in Virginia 7th District thanks very much for joining us today I'm sorry this has happened to you but thank you for allowing it to come to light so we can at least put our radar

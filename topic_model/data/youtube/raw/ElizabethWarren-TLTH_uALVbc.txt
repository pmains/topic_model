i knew those are people that love this country that truly respect law enforcement would never do anything to break a law and so i wasn't concerned [Music] mandela i am so excited to support you and your campaign you have done a terrific job as lieutenant governor and you are going to be a great partner in the united states senate so we got to get rid of ron johnson can you tell us a little bit about what's at stake yes and thank you so much elizabeth i'll say this the bottom line is that ron johnson is looking out for himself his wealthy donors not the working people of wisconsin and that's what we're all frustrated with and we'll just let the senator speak for himself here just listen to what he said about funding child care people decide to have families and and become parents that's something you know they need to consider when they make that choice i've never really felt it was society's responsibility to take care of other people's children wow this one is personal for me mandela here's a card-carrying member of the party of family values saying that american families are just out there on their own that is not how i think america should think about its children well absolutely and it's critical that we invest in our children like you've always fought for because they're our future but again it seems like ron johnson only cares about his future and making it as cushy as possible i hope most people increase their net worth you know 3.8 times that's what the s p index uh increase so the fact that i've gone up only double i've way under poor in the market this just makes my blood boil the ron johnsons of the world have seen their wealth increase during this pandemic so while he's wringing his hands about his net worth is he creating more opportunity for the people of wisconsin nope he uh sure isn't you can just look at what he did recently when a company in his own hometown announced that it wanted to create a thousand jobs in south carolina instead of using union labor in wisconsin i joined senator tammy baldwin and others to call for the company to create those jobs right here at home but not ron johnson instead of fighting for working people he's busy making excuses for the company here's what he said it's not like we don't have enough jobs here in wisconsin wow so he won't lift a finger to support unions and bring good-paying jobs to his own hometown this is a guy who's not on the side of working people he's on the side of big business it's time for something better you said it you know people are also deeply concerned about the ongoing threats to our democracy senator johnson made it clear that he's on the side of the insurrectionists i knew those are people that love this country that uh truly respect law enforcement would never do anything to to break a law and so i wasn't concerned now had the tables been turned and those were tens of thousands of black lives matter and antifa protesters i might have been a little concerned and that's just shameful he's doing more than just praise and provoke the insurrection it's ron johnson is actively trying to take away people's vote right here in wisconsin so here's a guy who's happy to cozy up to trump and his extremist supporters in order to hold on to power now i know that you have a plan to protect and expand democracy in wisconsin can you say a little about it oh yeah happy to uh you know for every day that goes by where there's no action on voting rights republicans like ron johnson they just get more powerful and this is why the very first plan we released was our democracy and accountability agenda to make sure that people who work to subvert elections are held accountable and you know what i'll also be the 51st vote to expand voting rights because we know that this is long overdue the 51st vote i love it and you are absolutely right people are sick and tired of this we need action now and this is why we need to elect you mandela so tell the good folks how they can get involved you can go to www.mandelabarns.com please chip in if you can get involved make calls and help us in this insurrectionist packing good well i just want to see you do this i know you can you're you're the right guy you're not only not ron johnson which is like the first threshold but the second is you're going to be really good at this mandela yeah i like your inspiration from well we got a lot of folks who are rooting for you

the chair recognizes the gentleman from New York mr. Zeldin for five minutes Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to discuss the importance of improving health care for America's seniors living out one's golden years to the max can come with its share of challenges especially as it relates to health care which is why fighting for our seniors and improving their quality of care must always be a top priority whether our meetings in my Long Island office my mobile office hours or at various other events in my district in Suffolk County New York I have met with seniors struggling with balancing health challenges in a fixed income many cite a lack of health care options and a difficulty in gaining access to quality and affordable health care as a result of Obamacare there are also serious concerns over the solvency of Social Security and Medicare which many seniors rely on for both financial and health care security is health challenges arise and seniors are budgeting based on a fixed income we should do everything that we can to ensure that those who need medical care and attention are able to access quality care an affordable price without having to jump through hoops they also should be assured that the programs and benefits they rely on will always be there for them Obamacare has significantly impacted our seniors and their access to quality and affordable health care I frequently hear concerns about lost doctors canceled policies and higher premiums and deductibles earlier this year Congress passed the restoring Americans health care freedom reconciliation Act which would repeal many of the flawed major provisions under Obamacare over a period of two years specifically many of the harmful mandates and taxes so that we can increase seniors access without compromising quality of care or efficiency it is important to improve the quality of health care in our country for our nation's seniors Congress has also taken action to improve Medicare over the past year the House passed a number of bills to strengthen Medicare including the protecting seniors access to Medicare Act the Medicare beneficiary preservation of choice act and the Medicare Advantage enrollment bill all proposals that would protect and preserve Medicare for our seniors who rely on it as well as restore and expand the Medicare open enrollment period the house also took action and made significant reforms to Social Security and Medicare saving millions of seniors from significantly increased health care costs working in a bipartisan fashion Congress was able to stave off a massive premium hike for seniors who utilize Medicare Part B without this action approximately 8 million seniors across our country would have been subject to a fifty two percent premium hike for Medicare Part B in a bipartisan effort action was taken to prevent a 20-percent across-the-board cut to Social Security disability benefits moreover working across the aisle with my colleagues in the house we were able able to repeal the sustainable growth rate formula also known as the doc fix to prevent a twenty percent cut to medicare this action alone has been seen as the most significant Medicare reform that has taken place in years without this legislation which is now law many doctors would have simply stopped accepting new Medicare patients or even cease to accept Medicare altogether Congress has also been committed to passing legislation and securing funding to expand seniors access to the most innovative technologies and treatments so that we can diagnose and treat diseases as early as possible last year the House passed a 21st century cures Act bipartisan legislation i co-sponsored in congress to improve and modernize our nation's healthcare this legislation would accelerate the process for scientific advancement while providing desperately needed research funding so that we can provide the next generation of cures these to our duty as Americans to always protect and improve the quality of life and care for our nation's seniors if anyone in the 1st Congressional District of New York ever needs assistance or has questions about Social Security and Medicare or federal issue in general I incur to contact my Long Island office at area code 631 289 1097 Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

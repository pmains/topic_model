[Music] well my good friend congressman Adam Schiff thank you so much for doing this you know people in Los Angeles and California and frankly the nation just have so much respect for you the stands that you have taken and your leadership and what I wanted to do today was to really have a discussion take a step back and talk about January 6 what happened but in the bigger context of our democracy and I tell people in the district all the time that our democracy was injured by Trump during those Trump years and frankly even though we thought we turned the page when the election was over it's clear we have not so I wanted to have a discussion with you about the state of our democracy wanted to get your opinions and perspectives about where are we we know our democracy was injured but tell us what do you think is the state of our democracy in the United States that first of all it's wonderful to sit down with you uh thank you for inviting me to have this dialogue um I think you're absolutely right I expected um even after the events of January 6th even after when the police finally cleared the building a great personal cost to themselves with 140 injured some who would lose their lives even after the Republicans went back on the floor to pick up right where they left off still trying to overturn the election I thought now that the country has seen the horrible end to which uh Trump and trumpism have brought us surely now they will repudiate the big lie that led to the violence of that day and all that he stood for but in fact that didn't happen and here we are a year and a half since those events that big lie has metastasized around the country they're using it to usher in a new generation of Jim Crow laws meant to disenfranchise people particularly people of color they're using it to run local meritocratic elections officials out of town with death threats and our democracy is more precarious today than it was on January 6th that's a terrible conclusion to reach that that we have moved backward not forward since that day but if you persuade people as the former president has that we can't trust our elections anymore to decide who should govern right what is left but violence that's right and you know sometimes I think that um those of us that live in California and Los Angeles we don't quite understand this because it doesn't necessarily impact Us in the same way as it does in States you know across the country but what about our state what about you know what is going on nationally how does it impact Us in California in Liberal California but yet this can still impact us and maybe you could speak a little bit about that oh that's absolutely true you know we have work to make it easier for people to vote not harder for people to vote and that's a wonderful thing about our our great state but in other states it's been quite the opposite people have worked hard to pass new laws in Republican legislatures to make it more difficult for people to vote changing the laws about when you can vote by absentee or reducing the number of polling places in urban areas or prohibiting even the case of Georgia giving people water who are waiting to vote on a hot day in one state they changed the requirements for students to vote such that if they changed merely changed their dormitory they had to re-register to vote oh my goodness and the effect on California right is that in a national election where there are key Battleground States if those key Battleground states have moved to disenfranchise people than we in California like the rest of the country may be stuck with a a an election in which millions are disenfranchised and the result is not the popular will because the popular will has been negated by putting these hurdles in front of people's right to vote well this year we experience the reversal of Roe and the impact that that's going to have in our country and what do you foresee I mean how does that connect how did that happen that row was reversed considering the makeup of the Senate and connecting all of those dots what could the Supreme Court do in the future well the the road decision the the Dobbs decision over turning row was many years in the making really decades in the making this had been sort of the conservative aim for a long time uh and they worked at it by seeding very conservative reactionary judges through the Federalist Federalist Society onto lower courts to get them to the higher courts to get them to the highest court all with a quite premeditated plan there was really one litmus test among above all others and that was will you overturn Roe and they got they got their wish they got those justices ultimately on the court those justices uh I think misled the Senate although the Senate many of the Senators had to have pretty strong blinders on not to see what was really happening and you know it has you know brought me to the position that I I find myself supporting things I never would have imagined supporting like expanding the court um but uh you know I have two kids that are in their early 20s I'm not content to have them live their whole adult life under a reactionary partisan Court Supreme Court is no longer a conservative court right conservative Court would have some reverence for precedent right this is a court with a radical social agenda I do think it has had the effect though of really waking up the country to the the radical nature of this GOP um it's torn the veneer off and of course women's reproductive Health the right to that choice may be just the first right among many to fall if those behind this Court's agenda get their way what do you think is next do you have any ideas of where they're going to go we knew they had the campaign as you described against Roe for years what do you see in the future decisions they might reach well Justice Thomas he kind of signaled the road map that uh marriage equality might be next the right to contraception might be next and if you conclude as the court has that basically precedent is there to be broken and that there are there is essentially no right to privacy then all of the rights that we've enjoyed that are premised on our right to privacy are on very thin ice so the no telling um and I think it is an indication of some systemic challenges to our democracy as you know because of the gerrymander the house is often run by a minority of Americans right because of the uh overweighting of the least populous states in the Senate the Senate is often controlled by a minority of Americans what do you mean overeating by the least populous states especially those those of us in California don't quite yes understand that well we have two senators in California notwithstanding having tens of millions of people in very small very unpopulated states in the wyomings the Montana's The Dakotas Etc they have two senators too they have an equal amount of uh vote in the Senate and as a result when you look at the popular will as reflected in the country as a whole and what what do a majority of Americans want they often don't get it in the Senate because the Senate doesn't rep represent the popular will and because of the Electoral College at the level of the presidency it that often results in a president who lost the popular vote we now have three of the five justices on the court who made that decision over turn row appointed by Republican presidents who lost the popular vote and in this makes you wonder how long a democracy can Thrive let alone survive if a majority of our institutions are often controlled by a minority of the the population I know when I talked to constituents we don't realize how big California is and even Los Angeles I mean the city of Los Angeles population little over four million people is larger than many many states I think of Vermont 600 000 that's smaller than a California State Senate District that's smaller than a congressional district of 700 000. so yes that structural problem is is really a challenge for us if I can ask you um we all have very different experiences to get back to your first question about what the sixth means and what it was like what was your experience on the sixth and what was your takeaway then and what's your takeaway now well you know I was I was in the gallery but I left just a few minutes before if I had left 10 minutes later I literally would have run into people in the hallway and so when I got back to my office you know the TVs are always on and I saw what was going on and I I was more Angry than I was scared but it was just so evident to me that what Trump created is a cult and I say is because it still exists it's not a was not in the past tense and that only a cult leader could convince people to storm the capital to overturn an election and so it was just a really really sad day and uh and unfortunately that day you know the impact of that day has continued the very notion that there were people there that day who were running to be members of the House of Representatives and my win is still something that I have a hard time grasping and the fact that we have to go through metal detectors to go on the floor of the house when the only people on the floor in the house are members of Congress but some of our colleagues want to carry guns on the floor so it's an outrage and a shock that continues you know your experience on the January 6 committee um give us a few highlights the things that were most shocking to you that you learned through the committee meetings and hearings well first of all um I think the reason our committee has been as successful as it has and productive as it has really traces back to a decision the speaker made which at the time was controversial now seems quite intuitive but she made the decision fully within her rights not to seat some of the insurrectionists that Kevin McCarthy wanted to put on the committee that allowed the committee to have a membership of Democrats and Republicans who were really United in the the goal of exposing the truth and it allowed also Witnesses who were willing to cooperate the ability to come forward and know that their testimony would be respected it wouldn't be a circus and as a result we've had some pretty remarkable testimony and what stands out to me most um are really a couple things uh now and then there'll be a vignette in an investigation that tells you a lot about the larger picture and two things really stand out to me the first is a meeting in the Oval Office with the president and top leaders from the Department of Justice his own people people he picked people he appointed and it goes through a Litany of these bogus claims of fraud you know what about dead people voting what about suitcases of ballots and they shoot them down one by one and finally the present responds just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me in the Republicans he tells them just say it was corrupt just say it was corrupt you know I'm a former prosecutor as a former prosecutor look for evidence of intent and here you have the president confronted by his own top justice department people who are telling them effectively that these claims of fraud you've been peddling to the country they're all Bs and his answer is just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republicans the other thing that stands out to me is on the mall on January 6th the president is told by the Secret Service there's a problem at the metal detectors the magnetometers oh it's not the usual problem that they had that they would have at Trump rallies where there might be long lines of people to go through the metal detectors now here the problem was people wouldn't go through the metal detectors they wouldn't get in line and they wouldn't go through them because they had weapons oh my goodness and he's told this because he's upset that there aren't more people for his speech on the ellipse and he's told they won't go through the magnetometers because they have weapons and his answer is take the mags down oh my goodness yes answers to basically take the metal detectors down he says they're not here to hurt me and he wants these people to March the capitol knowing they're armed he's indignant when he can't march with them I mean to me this is just staggering the president of the United States knows there's an armed mob and wants them to be able to keep their weapons and March to the capital and is is Furious when he's not allowed to go with them and then he goes back to the White House and he watches the violence unfold and he does nothing his family his staff even these right-wing Fox hosts they're texting him they're calling him do something say something he's sitting there watching it on TV but he won't lift a finger to stop it not for hours well I have to ask you though back to the mall um this the job of the Secret Service of course is to protect the president in spite of the President right what happened were they not unable to control it I I think they didn't they didn't respond by either taking the magnetometers down or by waving people through I think Trump just had a smaller crowd in that section of the mall but but they let the people come in I mean there isn't a way you can stop them right um there there was a smaller area set aside for his speeches and so they waited outside right of this smaller area because they wouldn't go through the magnetometers but of course then all of them that wanted to March the capital March the capital with their weapons and uh when you hear the present now even now talking about well if it gets another chance in office he's going to Pardon these people yes yes people ought to watch that footage again of these people beating police officers gouging them there's that that heartbreaking video um of one of the police officers who was trapped in the door crushed right and Donald Trump wants to pardon the people that were crushing him it just uh shows you why um someone with that little regard for the law and the National Security can never be given a chance to govern absolutely absolutely and now it seems as though he's embraced cunan I mean with the symbols the music and everything in your committee has Q Anon come up has that been you know in terms of some of the rioters or some of the people connected to the White House or is that outside of uh no Q Anon has come up and uh you know it's this dangerous toxic brew of Q Anon and the white nationalist groups the three percenters the praetorians and The Oath Keepers and the proud boys uh you know I keep coming back to and I'd be interested in your thoughts on this when I think about our colleagues across the aisle many of whom prior to all this I had admired and respected because I believed they believed what they were saying right turned out they didn't believe any of it or if they did none of it really mattered compared to holding their job in Congress or maybe getting a better job and I I kept coming back to something that historian Robert Carroll once said that power doesn't corrupt as much as it reveals it doesn't always reveal us for our best but it says a lot about Who We Are and how much power had revealed things about the people we serve with but also in a broader way how much power in the last several years had revealed things about our country and how the former president gave a license for all of these hatreds and bigotries to rise to the surface and become somehow normalized and acceptable and um it tells us that the road to recovery is a lot longer one than that we might have hoped but but tell me you know I know folks are often asked me I'm being curious because they're probably more willing to talk with you what do the Republicans say to you privately about former president about the big lie what do they say in private well you know certainly that they know some of it is is garbage but prior to January 6 they would say their concern about being primaried post-january 6 they talk about their concern for their safety now that is shocking to me that they and we know we've seen evidence of this I mean I remember when we took the infrastructure vote and a couple of Republicans that voted for infrastructure and then had hate phone calls and everything you know as an African-American though I look at it just slightly different in the sense that it's very hard for me to see this openness you know especially around race and just hatred as not being connected to people who were so traumatized by the election of Barack Obama and that you know the idea of this black family rolling up and actually moving in the white house it's one thing to work there as staff but how dare you actually be the President and Vice President it's like that to me is connected to all of this stuff coming to the surface because it was like he was the realization of all of their fears the symbol of it but the bigger fear is the demographic shift and there's only so far that you can gerrymander if people actually live everywhere then you can't gerrymander it anymore and so the best way for the minority to hold on to power is to seize one of the branches of government and that's the Judiciary and that's you know kind of a different a different perspective but but let me actually steer Us in another Direction because I would like to take what has happened here with the Trump presidency and post uh Trump internationally because we've seen a rise of right-wing leaders in a number of different countries it was extremely frightening to me to see the Prime Minister from Hungary come to CPAP and for CPAP to actually go to Hungary and now we have the election of the Prime Minister of Italy from Mussolini's party so draw a connection between you know the right wing here and also internationally and the potential implications of all of that um it's a great question because we see globally a rise of autocracy even before Trump and I think it's the product of a couple forces that that are clearly impacting us here but impact the whole planet and that is there are dramatic changes in the nature of the global economy in which millions and millions of people at home and abroad are working harder than ever and finding it more difficult than ever to to make a living to keep a roof over the head keep food on their table and many in the middle class are desperately worried about falling out of the middle class and there's this profound economic anxiety with globalization and automation that is really ripe for the rise of demagoguery your your circumstances are stagnating economically because of people who don't look like you it gives the xenophobic populace a real fertile soil to work with and so we do see the rise of these xenophobic populace in Hungary and now in Italy but also in Brazil in the Philippines right we see the rise of far-right parties in other parts of the world as well um I I think responding both to that phenomenon and the Revolution and information now where so many people around the globe get their information on social media a medium in which lies and fear and anger travel with virality and so you give a demagogue that kind of a platform in a world in which people feel economically vulnerable and you have this rise of uh of the autocrat and um you know for all of us who grew up in the post-world War II generation we figured through the decades watching more and more democracies being born people's freedoms expanding that this was an you know in Violet law of nature um only to find out no it's nothing inviolent about it every generation has to struggle to preserve freedom and democracy and to expand rights and uh and in the absence of people struggling to preserve democracy you you have backsliding dangerous backsliding and we never thought that could happen here but it turns out we are no more immune from these forces of demagoguery than anyone else in the world and we we're fortunate to have a constitution that better constrains those evils but uh but even we are vulnerable to them and sadly what we've seen over the last several years here has only accelerated the trend elsewhere and and January 6th in particular in the images of people literally climbing on the capitol are used by Nations like China which is a totalitarian state to say that democracy doesn't work it's too brittle it doesn't adapt quickly enough that that country should adopt the China model well make no mistake about the China model the China model is totalitarianism it is not a substitute for democracy and uh and so I'm proud that that Joe Biden has reclaimed uh America's mantle as a champion of democracy but as he will be the first to point out when he makes the case around the world that America is back he is confronted with the question yes but for how long exactly and you know when I think of what Putin did in terms of invading Ukraine and essentially saying I'm going to destroy this country uh I I look at it in the context of everything that's happening in the world and I believe that that's why he felt he could do such a bold move but you know in spite of all of this there is also the other side and I think there's more and more people who are becoming active the response to roe with a new generation of young people both both male and female who are outraged at the idea that a right that existed for half a century could be taken away the potential um the potential rollback of marriage equality and privacy like you described I think is also given rise to a whole new generation of activism So within that you know I'd like to know your thoughts about the other side the um the the potential a fight against and actually run a whole new generation of leaders right I'm so glad to ask that question because when you go through as we are cataloging some of the challenges facing the country it can be overwhelming to people exactly uh can can become despondent well we don't have the luxury of Despair right and what's more there's good reason to be hopeful um you know I look around at some of the people who are rising to the challenge of these days and there's an extraordinary group of young people that are becoming involved for the first time and they're becoming Community organizers and they're running for office and they're just truly inspirational figures and it gives me great confidence we're going to get through this right I think when you're in crisis and I think our country is in crisis it's hard to see when it ends sometimes it's even hard to see if it will end but it does end this too shall pass but what we do right now I think we'll determine how quickly it passes and how much damage we have to suffer along the way and the fact that so many uh millions of people are getting engaged many For the First Time shows that we're going to get through this and and the reality is that there are millions and millions of wonderful patriotic generous um decent people in every state in the Union um they represent I think what America is really about absolutely and and I think they are they are fed up uh with what they've seen over the last several years and and want to take back the values of the country and and move us forward again you know what I um always tell folks is that when you are in a crisis like we're in now it's an incredible opportunity to teach people I don't think moving forward we will ever take our democracy for granted again with all of its challenges and then it's an opportunity to teach people history because I think one of the things in our American culture is we're pretty ahistorical we don't connect up what happened 20 years ago or 30 years ago or 50 years ago and it's an opportunity to teach history to show what happens when you are in a crisis you can learn from it and be so much stronger moving forward so I'm excited for the future I'm going to use all of these challenges to encourage people to get involved and to sustain their involvement so I just want to thank you it was wonderful having this conversation with you and I'd love to see us have a part two and maybe the next time it can actually be in person with both of our constituents from Los Angeles since our districts are next door to each other but you're a wonderful friend and just a a brilliant member of Congress thank you I'm a huge fan of yours and uh I'm so fortunate to serve with you and to call you my friend thank you

meals on wheels is one part of government that truly understands the connection between the heart and the head it touches the heart because i saw when you bring a nutritious meal to seniors you can spend time visiting with them at home and often they will tell you that you're the only visitor the only visitor they will have during that day and it causes you to use your head and a sharp pencil because you can see without meals on wheels as sure as the night follows the day some of those seniors are not going to be able to stay in the community and they will end up needing institutional services and those services are more costly and of course seniors will often be less happy with those kinds of institutional programs and i bring up meals on wheels today chairman conrad because several of the proposals that are offered by colleagues on the other side of the aisle they're not going to be bipartisan because they cut the part of the budget that funds meals on wheels substantially in several instances specifically through our research between 17 and 59 percent in just the upcoming year now putting meals on wheels at risk like that just defies common sense and i think what is common sense is what you chairman conrad have touched on and other colleagues and that's tackling the big issues on a bipartisan way and certainly when it comes to medicare that's what's needed if nothing is done the medicare guarantee is in peril and my own sense is that medicare because it's already facing cuts with sequestration as chairman conrad has pointed out medicare if nothing is done will face a steady diet of benefit cuts and costs shifting until we do not recognize the medicare guarantee as it stands today that's unacceptable to me it ought to be unacceptable to every member of the senate and as chairman conrad has noted medicare reform is going to have to be bipartisan and i'm interested in working with every colleague here in in the senate to pursue it here's what it's going to take first and foremost it will take protecting the most vulnerable seniors what are called the dual eligibles seniors who are eligible for both medicare and medicaid the protections for those dual eligibles must be ironclad the second part of medicare reform is to ensure that you protect traditional medicare traditional medicare where the government pays doctors and other providers for services as well as private sector choices that have to offer at least as good coverage as traditional medicare and by doing that you force traditional medicare and the private choices to hold each other accountable third medicare reform and we went into this uh in a very good hearing that was held in chairman conrad's budget committee is going to require comprehensive consumer protection i'm committed to bipartisan medicare reform i think medicare is really a sacred ground it can only be preserved and protected by ensuring that we take the steps i've just outlined three or four of them here this afternoon that ensures that we put seniors and their well-being before ideology and politics

well good morning to my colleagues what an honorable group all seriousness in all seriousness the last several hours beginning yesterday morning and through the day yesterday through the night and now into the early morning hours of this give a day I believe we have made a moment of history an historic situation conducted by the Democrats of this house to have gathered on the house steps with leader Pelosi with our colleagues with advocates who joined with our voices to encourage if not to plead for progress to respond with common sense good sense to items that need to be addressed that address the public safety within our communities our neighborhoods an important bit of business that we have prompted here on the House floor and then to have joined the forces of those who organize us today an icon in the name of John Lewis brother John brother John Lewis Congressman John Lewis who's notorious for standing for civil rights and human rights having set a tone for this nation for decades enabling this country to grow grow in terms of recognition of being that more perfect union providing rights for those who were denied rights making a difference in the quality of life of the people of this great nation and to have had the efforts fort fort by representative captain Clark whom I'm looking at at this moment thank you peg by David Cicilline representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island who I'm looking at also thank you David for a member state and as we gather here testimony upon testimony upon testimony we heard of the need in our given communities we express the loss of life the suffocation of dreams promises that will never be captured because of life cut short you know I've talked to a number of stations in my district early this morning and the response from the Republican majority has been this is a political stunt what is a political stunt banging the gavel two days early closing session our journey in the heat of a city and in the darkness of nineteen fleeing Washington that's a political stunt so I say to the Republicans in Washington and I make that distinction because in my district Republicans along with Democrats along with independence along with non-affiliated voters and the general public at large gun owners and non gun owners have said common sense is where we need to be that needs to be the road that we follow making certain that if you're deemed dangerous and should not fly on an airline airplane you should not be able to purchase a gun common sense if there are loopholes that allow you to purchase a gun online or at gun shows not having a background check common sense close that loophole that's where people are but in Washington Republicans our colleagues in the Republican ranks want to call this a political stunt I implore those colleagues the Republican colleagues to see this for what it is a human outcry to the Republican majority in the House of Representatives it's not a political stunt see it for what it is an impassioned plea on behalf of those who have lost loved ones to gun violence and to the leadership to Speaker Paul Ryan and two other leaders in the house from the Republican ranks see it for what it is it is not a political stunt its rightful indignation America has had enough they have lost their loved ones they grieve you know we listen to the stories that people will talk about with each and every passing bit of carnage and people will talk about visiting the family members and loved ones of the victims we hear about them looking into their cheerful dolls we hear about them empathizing because of their broken hearts but then we get here and business is denied progress is denied it is so disrespectful it is so insensitive for our response their response the majority's response when they lend a blind eye to the cheerful dies when they address with hardened hearts the broken hearts the heavy hearts that is the injustice that is driven by their recalcitrance by their determination not to let a bill to the floor for a vote hmm my tallies I am so proud of the efforts we have made today individual voices collective voices saying we can do better than this there are solutions that are common-sense solutions let us go forward no fly nobody close the loophole make certain background checks cover each and every purchase that's a start that's a respectful response to those who have forever lost loved ones children parents siblings grandchildren neighbors and friends I am honored to stand on this floor with colleagues who are champions for reform let's go forward with that I yield back

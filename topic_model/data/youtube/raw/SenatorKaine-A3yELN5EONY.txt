objection madam president the senator from virginia i rise to speak on amendment 2096 cte is a core academic subject i grew up working in my dad's ironworking and welding shop i ran a school that taught kids to be welders and carpenters in honduras many years ago and what i learned is that high quality technical education is an important part of the educational spectrum we downgraded it for a number of years but there's a renaissance now what my amendment would do is it would go into the current federal law and specify that career and technical education programs are core curricula originally english math and science were this bill broadens what is a core curriculum to include computer science and foreign languages and this amendment would make plain that high quality career and technical education is a core academic subject i want to thank senators ayotte merkley scott baldwin and warner as co-sponders and i also want to thank chairman alexander senator murray for their great work in bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor this is common sense and bipartisan and i would hope it would pass

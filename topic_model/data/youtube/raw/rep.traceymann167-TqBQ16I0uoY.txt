speaker i yield next a gentleman from kansas mr mann thank you to my colleague and friend from louisiana for your leadership and for hosting this here tonight you know less than 24 hours ago the president delivered the state of the union address in this very chamber i would like to respond on behalf of the big first district of kansas last night americans hope to hear our commander in chief address the many crises facing our country and explain his plans for fixing them a reasonable request instead we heard a monologue of half truths and empty promises this administration has failed on the world stage creating one foreign policy disaster after another and the repercussions are posing threats to america's food supply energy security and our freedom on the home front this administration has created record inflation which is destroying livelihoods and killing small businesses across the country in my and in my district drugs and crime are destroying american communities and communities and families and we have an open southern border where drugs and human trafficking run rampant the supply chain is still in disarray our country's debt is at an all-time high almost 30 trillion dollars and president the president has halted our march towards energy independence by killing the keystone xl pipeline so the by administration has made a disaster in his handling of his issues at home abroad our country has an egregious trade deficit with china a country that ripped off american farmers to the tune of 16 billion dollars in the phase one trade deal and this administration has done nothing to hold them accountable the president was getting lots of applause last night for for talking a big game about supporting ukraine but we've done nothing meaningful so far as in response to the humanitarian crisis vladimir putin has created there his financial sanctions won't prevent china from bailing out russia financially and president biden won't stop buying half a million barrels of oil a day from putin because again president biden killed the keystone xl pipeline furthermore the president clearly isn't worried about the food implications of russia taking over ukraine which is the breadbasket of europe by the way and the third largest grain export in the world because he still hasn't even appointed a usda under secretary of foreign trade and agriculture in 13 and a half months he hasn't even nominated one americans are resilient people we've proven that over the past two years and i would argue that kansans are among the most resilient of all we've made it through the worst we've made it through worse times than these but i'm standing here today be to say enough is enough we need to get this country back on track and to do that we need a president who actually leads last night i hope that the president would tell us about how he plans to hold russia accountable for its inhumane invasion of ukraine stop inflation fix the supply chain secure our southern border and stand up for american farmers and ranchers who feed fuel and clothe the world but he did not instead i heard an out of a touch i heard an out of touch stump speech from a politician who wanted me to believe that everything is going to be just fine as long as he's in the white house mr president i pray for you and i want you to be successful but in order for that to happen you must lead thank you for hosting this i yield back very well said my friend thank you for being

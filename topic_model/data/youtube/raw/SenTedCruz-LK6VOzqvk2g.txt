Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen good morning thank you for your good work globally gold has become a key way that that bad actors conduct illicit financial activities in Venezuela the gold trade is maduro's best and perhaps perhaps his last lifeline in 2018 alone Venezuela exported 900 million dollars worth of gold to Turkey kortnee the US Treasury Department Turkey has been making large purchases of gold almost certainly inclusive including illicit purchases from Venezuela to cut off this lifeline I've introduced a bill along with chairman Rubio that says if a country or bank conducts precious metal transactions that are subject to sanctions as moving gold for Venezuela or Iran would be that the Secretary of Treasury can take those transactions into account when deciding about a broader conclusion that such country or bank shall be designated as a jurisdiction of primary money-laundering concern mr. Abrams can you please describe the role that illicit gold and precious metals transactions plays in in sustaining the Maduro regime thanks senator it's critical what we did on pate of ASA cut off a lot of cash the oil they were giving to Russia and China was to offset previous debts they weren't getting cash so they lose that cash where can they find cash today gold is a one of the very few places and it's the biggest one I understand that the administration is in possession of a list of Turkish and entities that are moving gold for Venezuela based on publicly sourced information can you outline how the administration intends to approach these and other bad actors first we talk to the governments in question and in some cases the enterprises in question and almost every case to say you ought to stop doing this you ought to stop doing it because it's wrong and you want to stop doing it because they're going to be sanctions pardon me and we've had some success in other areas of the world and getting companies to say okay we don't want to yet risk of sanctions will stop we have not had that success in the case of gold sales in the Middle East more generally mr. green what initiatives can USAID encourage in Venezuela or other partners in the region to determine arose illicit mining and trade of gold and to safeguard the supply chain for Venezuelans Thank You senator actually in in countries like Colombia and Peru we have well developed successful licit mining programs which use environmentally sound methods for mining secondly because it's listed it actually provides a revenue source that can be reinvested in the communities and creates good-paying jobs and chokes off the source of illicit gold revenues that we know that narcos and criminal gangs too often use so I would propose in that day after in Venezuela that we ramp up investments like this this is a way of creating very good paying jobs around which you can raise families and build communities thank you Maduro regime has been holding six Citgo employees including five US citizens who live in Texas for over a year now the Cisco executives have been detained on baseless charges and subjected to harsh imprisonment it is well past time to secure their release and it is my hope that the new Venezuelan government will work with the u.s. to swiftly ensure their safe return mr. Abrams is the administration and discussions with either the guide o administration or the Maduro regime on the imprisonment of the citko executives who are u.s. dual nationals and and can you describe what efforts are being made to secure their release as you know senator we are unable to get consular access to them the position of the regime is because they are also Venezuelan citizens you don't get to see them so we've not been able to do that it's also true that the church in Venezuela has asked to see them on kind of pastoral visit refused no we're in touch with the families we keep pressing the regime because there are two court orders for their release which the regime simply refuses to implement so we keep pressing we do keep raising it I'm absolutely confident that at the point at which interim president whydo takes over their release will be very rapid well good and I would encourage you to continue to make that a high priority a final question for both of you this is a pivotal time in Venezuela's history it's a time with enormous opportunity but also enormous risk there are some 3,000 generals in Venezuela each of those generals now has to decide with whom he stands with the illegitimate and oppressive Maduro regime or with the legitimate and recognized wydo government what to both of you believe could be effective both carrots and sticks for those 3,000 generals to encourage them to stand on the right side of history with the people of Venezuela and not to support a dictator on his way out the door I'd say there are two parts to that the Venezuelan part in the American part the legitimate National Assembly has passed a transition law that speaks of amnesty pardon me and there are further debates in the National Assembly in Venezuela about saying more about that being more detailed about what an amnesty would consist of on our part we've made it very clear that sanctions can be removed visa revocations can be reversed and visas can be granted for those who are actually indicted that's a different story indicted or convicted they they should have their lawyers deal with the Department of Justice but from the Treasury and state point of view these things are reversible and we are trying to make the argument and more president why donation assembly are making the argument that they are open to those who are willing to change thank you Thank You mr. chairman I want to start with the same question that I asked the the previous panel which is we're at a potential tipping point in Venezuela and in particular the military and the generals have to make a decision with whom to stand in both of your opinions and judgment what carrots or sticks would have the greatest impact in speeding along the exit of Maduro and a transition to a democratically elected and legitimate regime thank you senator Cruz I agree with the implications of the question that the real arbiter on the ground in Venezuela is the military and those were the guns which is the monopoly of the regime at this point so at some point you have to either get them to stand down or switch sides and switch their allegiance to mr. Guido as the interim president these are individual decisions these are decisions that are made based on people's best guess for their own prospects and that of their family and our understanding is that many of the people who remain quote-unquote to the regime are not doing so because they particularly like mr. Maduro or even like his social project or whatever it is but because they're afraid they're afraid that they'll obviously lose their jobs and their pensions but they might actually be killed and the way that the security services are being monitored not just by the Venezuelan spy also by some of their outside advisors there is a real sense of who may be looking to create conditions for to try to overthrow the government or leave or what-have-you so it's a very delicate situation what can the United States and the international community do I think we can continue as that was discussed in the previous panel to to express openness that those who do not have blood on their hands who have not participated in human rights abuses would be welcomed into a new Venezuela I think that's absolutely appropriate but I think at the end of the day the people have to understand that there will be change in Venezuela because they want to be on the winning side they want to be on the side that's left standing and if they think that mr. Maduro will have the opportunity to remain forever then the Opera then the choice to switch their allegiance to mr. Guido becomes that much more fraud and if they believe that mr. Guido in fact will be ascending to real power in the miraflores palace then the decision in some way becomes a little bit easier I'm not saying it's easy but it will be easier so to the extent that the international community can continue to show the commitment for real and lasting democracy in Venezuela I believe that's the most potent thing that we could do at this time like to add to that it's gonna be very difficult I think to break the the high command the I think the number the number that I've heard is 2000 senator Cruz not 3000 but it's still it's a substantial number and whatever it is it's at least double if not triple what we have in the United States and an armed force that's hugely bigger I'm I recall that in the Chilean transition General Pinochet who subsequently was made to stand trial for his crimes of torture and killing of political opponents remained as the head of the armed forces and then became a senator for life so I think that there are things that are done at the outset of a transition that are deeply distasteful repugnant but nonetheless I also recall the words of a great teacher friend jurist from Chile who headed there Truth Commission jos√© zalaquett who talked about the ethics of responsibility which is to say that we are not talking necessarily about pure justice right away obviously everyone should have to pay for crimes against humanity for torture for killing for the kind of the levels of corruption and drug trafficking that they've engaged in but what you can accomplish initially as you have a try government leading to elections is very different from what can i think occur down the line and I think the United States has an important role to play in this again as distasteful and contrary to the whole concept of the rule of law that this may seem if people feel that if they change or if they somehow agree to break with the regime what awaits them is a is it Supermax jail cell in the United States you will never see the movement of those people so I think we have to think in very pragmatic terms not in absolutist terms be flexible but also listen to what the Venezuelan opposition is doing in terms of speaking to the military making that outreach because it's clear that the office that the offer of amnesty has not yet been sufficient so one one additional question mr. farnsworth you made reference to the Cuban soldiers and thugs that are on the ground in in Venezuela can you detail a bit more the the malign influence that Cuba's having propping up the Maduro regime from what I know from outside open sources there have been very active particularly in the security services offering not just guidance in terms of how to organize intelligence operations but also helping the Venezuelans carry them out in some cases they've also been active in state functions such as passport agencies and authorities so that they know who's coming in and out of the country and these are reports from from folks open source etc you don't need a whole lot of people from outside the country to do a lot of damage if they are embedded in the most sensitive areas of the government and the areas that have control of the population and this is what the Cubans have primarily focused on is my understanding so with that in mind it's become a very complicated effort and to try to get some of these folks the Venezuelans who may quote-unquote want to do the right thing it's they don't know who's watching them they don't know what information they had you know they have on them they don't know who's watching their families it's a really complicated and difficult scenario thank you

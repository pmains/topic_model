thank you Mr chairman Dr Upton and the rest of um our panel thank you very much for joining us today to discuss issues facing native veterans as a senator from Hawaii I am very disappointed Dr Upton that your testimony neglected to mention native Hawaiian Veterans as you know like other native communities native Hawaiians serve in our military at disproportionate the higher rates I know the VA understands the importance of ensuring native Hawaiian veterans are treated with the same concern as American Indians and Alaska native veterans especially following the secretary's a recent visit to our state in October for a field hearing but it is critical given the historical lack of parity in native Hawaiians are received from the VA that native Hawaiian veterans are always included in our language and our policies would you be willing to correct the record to include native Hawaiians in your testimony and to show how you are engaging with native Hawaiians as part of the Native American Veteran community thank you sander and I appreciate the acknowledgment of our native Hawaiians who are so important and important in our veteran population as noted in our Our Testimony they are an important part of our tribal advisory committee and I really appreciate that voice being on the group that advises our secretary in talking with our region of va's that works very closely with the team in Hawaii I know that they are taking the work with our native veterans very seriously working on efforts with the University of Hawaii as well as well as other Outreach to the population there we certainly welcome the impact and input on how to do better and to continue those Partnerships um so my main point is that native Hawaiian should never be deemed an afterthought and that when we talk about focusing on programs that support native communities or native veterans that would be three large groups of native peoples and you know what who they are so I'm asking that we need to always include native Hawaiians when we start talking about all the things that we're doing I am aware that there are specific programs that support native Hawaiian so like other native communities native Hawaiian veterans have long experienced significantly more challenges in accessing resources and issue that former chairman akaka Senator Dan okaka from Hawaii who chaired this committee fought to fix for years and one that I am committed to as well va's own 2021 National veteran Health Equity report chart book on native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander veterans reported that native Hawaiian veterans often expressed more issues with care as compared to White veterans it is clear that the VA needs to increase its understanding of native Hawaiian culture Outreach to native Hawaiian community and build ties with organizations trusted by the community to ensure native Hawaiian veterans receive the care they deserve and I greatly appreciate a va's partnership on issues important to veterans in Hawaii we have a lot of veterans in Hawaii a big group of them are native Hawaiians including of course as I mentioned a second secretary McDonald's visit to Hawaii early this year but it is clear that the VA still has serious work to do to better support native Hawaiian veterans and I hope that we can continue working together to ensure native Hawaiian veterans are getting the care and benefits they earned through their service to our country and this really requires in many cases very different ways of Outreach to this community it requires understanding of the native Hawaiian veteran community and so I realize you do have some a person who sits on your Advisory Group and I will be continuing talking with him as to you know what more support we can provide I have a question about homelessness in the time I have left the the homelessness among veterans is a huge issue for the VA and at one point one of your one of our our secretaries said that eliminating homelessness among veterans who has this top priority clearly that is still an issue so um we're talking about the the 2022 point in time count showed that native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islander veterans make up the second largest share of homeless veterans on islands and that veterans overall had twice as many health conditions as compared to the broader population included in the pit comp in your testimony you mentioned va's toolkit to provide a quote background planning resources and programmatic options for organizations interested in finding solutions for homelessness among native veterans and this tool does not again mention native Hawaiian veterans at all does va have any strategies that specifically address native Hawaiian veterans experiencing homelessness and if so do these strategies integrate native Hawaiian cultural practices and norms foreign thank you sander and please know I take all of that feedback very seriously um I do not know offhand about specific programs uh impacting homelessness for a native Hawaiians but I will absolutely take that for the record and we will follow up with you thank you so homelessness as well as so many other health issues including mental health issues and suicides of the native Hawaiian veteran group experienced much higher rates than in the larger populations so Mr chairman thank you for your Indulgence I'm a little bit over time but clearly we have work to do thank you

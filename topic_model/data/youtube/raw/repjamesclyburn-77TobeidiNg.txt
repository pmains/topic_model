distinguished clergy Vice President Biden governor McMaster another distinguished elected officials to this great family my entire family thank you so much for allowing me to be here with you today and to help celebrate the life and legacy of one of South Carolina's most outstanding public servants when I first was asked a few hours after Fritz passed what I thought when Fritz Hollings I said he was one of a kind statesman I felt that because for talents demonstrated with every ounce of his body every modicum of his intellect he demonstrated that he was one of a kind there's a classic point which we thank God a man can grow he is not bound by earthly gazes on the ground no matter from which he came I'll pull all oh thank god a man can grow what is implicit in that poems were fraying is that all men do not grow but all men can croutons demonstrated that time and time again I wrote in my memoirs Blissett experiences I wrote though we can be no more knock will we ever be in or less than what our experiences allow us to be fruits grew up in a neighborhood near here near where I stand today and you said he attended this historic military instant institution he graduated he went off to serve in the Army during World War two he came back and attended the University of South Carolina School of Law a segregated School of Law graduated in 1947 and one year later he ran for the state legislature and he got elected to an all-white body several years later he ran for lieutenant governor the year was 1954 so in 1954 church becomes lieutenant governor and then a state Supreme Court decided this equal was inherently unequal now that decision grew on the court decision here in Charleston where the minority vote the dissenting opinion was written by another toss Konya 1948 same year their futures elect then Fitz gets to the legislature and governor Byrnes realizing the wisdom that existed in a young man who wrote the legislation but to attempt to equalize black and white schools with a three cent sales tax governor burns realizing what was in this young man named him as a part of the team that will go into the federal courts to the fin acceptabie Fitz and I talked about that often I would teach him about being subjected to the wisdom of Matthew Perry and Thurgood Marshall and others mr. Joffe all time it's now look I'm with him I was on the team then figured argument I carried his bag and in the rate when that decision came down I have no idea friend Fritz began to change I read the Bishop James on yesterday talked about Fritz the person they knew each other very personally and mr. James said he had something in him I always believed that if it's in you whatever it is eventually he's going to come out and that's what happened good fit silence he came out and I think it was on national display when Fritz stood before the legislature here in South Carolina shortly after our second meeting now the first time I met Fritz I received a phone call from sister Mary Anthony some of you may remember sister Mayor Anthony Sheeran the Our Lady of Mercer neighborhood house over on Charleston's East Side and she called me back in 1969 and she said to me I want you to come and walk with me in senator Hollings I'm some things here on Thompson East Side that he wants to get to know about a little bit better we took him on what was the first leg of Collins's poverty to us it was January 1969 now that was our really second meeting because French was serving as governor he was he got elected my second year it's softer on the state and some of you may remember what was going on the campus of South Carolina that in the 1950s and it's most especially in 1960 I was helping to organize sit-ins and we were challenging the status quo that Fritz because of his experiences felt obliged to protect and this first meeting he invited us protestors to Colombia to his office to sit down and talk with him about what was on our minds and we did he opened up to us we open up to him and we felt good about that needed because what was in it came out in that meeting but then we got to the door about the lead in fridge stops now when your walk outside of this door there's going to be a throng throng of news people they won't all ask you what I said don't say anything to them that I'm gonna need to deny he gave me my first lesson in plausible deniability I'm so moved by that until this day I have never shared with anyone what we talked about in that meeting but I knew that we just heard and felt what was in it it all came out just before he left the governorship he is challenged by another tall stone Ian Harvey yeah would suit in a Clemson there's resistance all over the country but thank God a man who grow when Fritz stood before the legislature he said to them 1962 we have run out of course and we are a nation of laws not men we are going to do this and we're going to do it with dignity and civility pop again peacefully in the gritty Clemson why because a man can grow not all men will but fits all did and wouldn't we friends that have a tattoo of that day and just Anthony I sat down with him I knew that something would come of it and of course all of us remember he's writing the book the case against hunger I think he visited 15 counties around nothing a lot of people a little bit upset about that because no way we value our history of value our tourism and there were people who actually felt the calling attention to this issue will be ruinous to the state Ritz was trying to prevent ruining lives so he took the risk in this book the case against hunger he laid the foundation for what became the women infants and children program he laid the foundation for a significant expansion in the food stamp program for toddlers became a champion of community customers and we experienced a significant national expansion it is when I began to emulate tree toppers now I've often been called a black edition of fruits olives I sometimes wonder how to accept that because non fritz as many of you did fritz sarcasm to be pretty biting and of course not all that welcomed by son his wit and wisdom was us you always hope that when the compassion is being made it'll be on the wit and wisdom side the fritz to me was something else I studied his governorship and I think a lot about what South Carolina is today and I go back to that little piece of legislation written by John West at the invitation of Fritz Hollis that created the South Carolina Technical Education system and it failed my lot to have both those men in my life I feel blessed because for Fritz house he was my mentor never formally so and adopted he ever knew it but getting the phone call from his true talents was a blessing and I got them often he was very often to conduct myself and I listened to him and quite frankly didn't just listen I acted on this suggestion so many things that I have been able to do never would have happened without his wise counsel another ultimate in Fitz's growth took place 70 years ago when he called me and there's nothing to use with me to get a call so when I got the call from Fritz ups um I just thought it was another one incident for me to clean up my act or do something but this time it was different this call was different trick said to me I want you to sponsor a piece of legislation to take my name off this courthouse and I asked him why should I do that and they said to me because it would be much more appropriate for the name of J weight is wearing to be on that courthouse now Lauren South Carolina sisters I did I knew the cozy wait is aware who wrote that descendent opinion district the separate but equal I knew that the generators were the rule to equalize black and white teachers pay I knew that there was J way that's where I knew its decision in 1948 the year the fridge was elected that the Democratic primary must be open up to black voters I knew all of this about J way that's rare and now I'm sending myself now Fritz this asked me to take his name off the courthouse and put J with his rare his name on it I hung up I called them back later and for 45 minutes he lectured me on South Carolina's history as if I didn't know any of it but when I told him the danger am i doing that he said in the old costume bro you just do it I got your back he convinced me to do it and so we put up the legislation that passed the House it passed the Senate as my great honor to come down and in the center area of said Michael because the weather conditions we took the name off and Fritz Pope I was driven to the tears on that day because I thought I knew your mother well and I fought and you feel child as well but I found out that day that did not know him as well as I thought I did there was much more than him tonight every experience back only say today thank God a man can grow rich blue and I grew along with it

i'd buy 20 000 within the next five years so it's a very ambitious goal but it's something that if we all work together it definitely can be accomplished um the coaches of the national action alliance while they're not here today but they are the honorable john mchugh from he's the secretary of the army and also the honorable guardian of gordon smith who is the president and ceo of the national association of broadcasters um we also are joined by the american foundation for suicide prevention and dr hattie is going to be sitting on our panel for us um we also have trevor or someone still with us joining us today and they are leading the uh not-for-profit organization dedicated committing suicide through research education and advocacy they also provided the uh the yummy halloween cookies and cupcakes and soda outside so thank you for doing that um we also want to just welcome other members of the mental health community advocates families and attendees and congressman ryan has arrived so i'll pass it off to him we've uh welcome the primary sponsors for today sir all right so you're going you're doing good um at this point so it's actually right on cue so at this time we could uh welcome congressman tim ryan hi i'm congressman tim ryan i'm gonna be yes i'm gonna be brief we have a fantastic panel to learn from and i just want to thank everybody for their participation this is clearly a huge issue that many many americans are talking about and i think one that unfortunately as i've said before you know if you if you get killed in action you know you're on the front page of the newspaper there's a parade and there's stories about you and your family and who's left behind and all of that and that's all very appropriate i just feel sometimes that if you make it back in six months a year or two years later you take your own life in the obituary section there's no confident circumstance there's no ritual there's no way of really honoring the service and i think the best thing we can do is try to prevent that from happening and i think we have a great panel here today to just discuss that and i really believe um you know i just really believe that we're in a real punk right now in the country and i think part of it is that in little communities all over families all over our country are hearing these stories it's hard for us to actually know why but we just know something's wrong and i think we have an obligation as legislators and reserves to try to explore every avenue every opportunity should go and not just wait for them to come to us to have outreach and go find these men and women so very thankful for this fantastic panel i know you have a million different things to do but we've got a great crowd so on behalf of grace and myself and uh our first catalyst is um dr david litz from the action alliance um and then he will be provided overview of how members and staff can join the action alliance efforts to promote messages hope connectedness social support resilience treatment and recovery thank you congressman uh mommy and scott and everyone that's been involved in things together um so we're from the national exercise for suicide prevention 165 organizations coming together under an umbrella to work on some of the issues that are facing us as a nation as we look at trying to prevent suicides across the nation um we do have several uh veterans of congress that are i'm international actually both of our co-chairs have served here on the hill um and byron jordan is a member of the executive committee as his representative as we began looking at some of the national issues confronting us in our suicide prevention effort we realized that there are narratives going on in this country that we're working against and one of those has to do with military and veteran suicide if you just you would think that either a majority or a large minority of all veterans and military people are killed themselves and the fact is the vast majority of military veterans and active duty military are very resilient they're skilled people um they're they're reaching out for support when they need it um they're thriving and so if you're a person a military member or a veteran and you're really at a tough spot in your mind you have this impression that many or most of your peers in that situation are killing themselves that just lowers the threshold for you doing it so what we want to do here today is work with all of you to help us change this conversation because members of congress have a role in making giving people this country more accurate uh uh picture of what's really going on and how these veterans again military secretary members are really surviving and they're very very resilient so um you know we're coming up on veterans day here and that will provide opportunities for those of you who are staffed to to create messages it will provide opportunities for members to speak out about veterans resiliency and uh and and even the role of treatment and recovery for those who are suffering from the invisible wounds of war and so today we want to give you the kinds of equipment and resources to help you get those messages out and change that narrative and then really save some lives i think you know we're trying to empower you to help us save the 20 000 lives that we want to save in the next 20 years so think about the channels that you have available to you and as you're creating messages making sure make sure that you're focusing on help seeking giving people specific information about the things that they can do to help prevent suicides and to help others know where to turn for help um one of the barriers that we have and this is the language that we use and i want to draw your attention to one of the resources that you have somewhere in your packet there it's this thing has team up at the bottom and it says a style guide for reporting on mental health you can just find that in your materials and pull it out for a minute this was developed by one of our member organizations the entertainment industry council and collaborating with several others here and it's just kind of a two-page guide to talking about mental health issues in a way that's going to be helpful and not harmful and all those designed for journalists there's a lot in here that you can use i want to draw your attention just a couple things there first of all in the left-hand column about halfway down you see crazy psycho nuts lunatics those are all words when they're used publicly they just increase people's stigma and if they're people with mental illness they see those words and it just makes them kind of crawl in a hole and we don't want that we want people to come out and to get treatment and to recover and to do well in life so when you see that kind of language you know first of all don't use it but when you see it you want to correct it and i should point out that at the end of this session today we're going to do some role play and give you a chance to turn some of those messages around so look for some of those things and figure out how you're going to turn it around to say you know people with mental illness instead of some of these other very derogatory terms crime and violence the next item down keep in mind that the vast majority of crimes in this country are people are committed by people who are not mentally ill and the vast majority of people with mental illness do not commit crimes or violence so you know we have misperceptions about that in this country um over on the right hand side we talked about labeling um we don't call a person with heart disease a heart a heart disease right we call them a person with heart disease the same way with mental illness we don't call a person with schizophrenia a schizophrenic they're a personal human being that has a diagnosis of physiotherapy so you always want to use encourage you to use person-oriented language let's flip over to the back side um recovery and treatment the left-hand tunnel about halfway down whenever you get a chance emphasize that these things are treatable and the people can recover and go on and live successful lives and veterans do that by their noises um and then i want to flip over to uh suicide on the right hand column here there's a lot of language that we have tended to use around suicide that's not helpful at all for instance we say um sometimes a successful suicide suicide well a suicide is never a success actually suicide is a failure of society it's a failure of a middle individual to find a way to live likewise a failed attempt you know we just don't like that language i mean thank god someone didn't die when they attempted suicide um it's not a failure it's an opportunity to get someone to help and to help them find a way for life we also sometimes uh talk about committed suicide um and you know this commit uh verb with suicide comes back from a century ago and suicide was illegal in most states and in most countries it's also regarded as a sin that language doesn't help us understand suicide at all so i say get rid of it when someone talks about suicide let's talk about died by suicide took his own uh his or her own life that just some of those kind of nuanced things don't over simplify likewise i'm in the right hand column suicide is never the result of just one thing that went wrong it's almost always a dozen things that went wrong at the same time for someone and they just couldn't find a way through the painting so just be cautious about over simplifying explaining suicide likewise even with veterans it's not just simple oh they went to combat they came back and killed themselves it's never that easy and so be cautious of simplifying things a lot of other things on the sheet you can use as a resource so we provide that for you we do know that stories of uh overcoming adversity when people when a population a group of people hear stories of overcoming adversity that actually slowers the suicide rate in that population so as much as possible when you can bring forth stories of veterans or military members who are overcoming adversities and finding support finding treatment never miss that opportunity so again in your messaging talk about what things that can be done for health and we've been we're going to feature several sources here of support and as we go through this and there are some materials in your resources as well and i want to destroy attention to one other resource this is a fabulous maketheconnection.net is a fabulous resource put out by the va where veterans can go and find other veterans like them from either the same service or the same service era to find the vietnam veterans from the airports and hear them on video talk about how they overcame various different types of adversity and went on to find successful fulfilling lives so when you're talking with a veteran who is struggling i can encourage them to check out this website find someone else like themselves and see what they did to overcome uh this is the perfect example a very positive message this was the suicide prevention month message that came out of the department of defense this year it was where in previous years they would have talked about how many people are dying and and talked about all these great statistics this year secretary hagel came out with positive messaging about what the military is doing to prevent suicide and so this is the kind of messaging that we would like to see come out of our leaders here from the hill and you all are in a position to help make that happen so just for the first example i want to introduce a couple of folks uh here to talk about um a bedroom uh and an employer talk about how that support kind of comes together and so um don osterberg from schneider national um if you'd like to just hand it over to you sure great thank you david my name is dom oxford army uh retired colonel i'm currently searching for senior vice president international for those of you who don't don't know international global transportation company headquartered in green bay wisconsin uh we operate about 14 000 trucks across north america which means it's one of the largest fort higher carriers in north america we employ nearly 20 000 people worldwide we have a very rich history of supporting the military and military veterans in fact our founder al schneider back in 1935 it's a great american entrepreneurial story he sold the family car and large truck trucking company mr schneider now a long time member of the wisconsin national guard so as he grew the company he actually went to people with whom he served in the national guard and many of our employees even back from day one were military veterans mostly from the responsibility since uh in those interviewing 78 years we have valued military veterans guardian reservists into our forces if you think about that military veterans are dedicated goal oriented team players disciplined self-motivated physically fit with strong work ethic we can build a workforce around that just this year be appointed to 21 of the over-the-world drivers that we hired this year are military veterans uh we've gotten recognized that we're actively involved in the military apprentice program u.s army partnership for youth success u.s army wounded warrior program massage reserves employer partnership higher heroes joining forces and of all of the recognitions that we've gotten over the years from for our military support i think perhaps most notable in 1991 schneider nashville was recognized by the enlisted association of the national guard the united states uh has the most supportive employer of the guard and observer and since that was the very first award that gave out that war even today is now referred to as the al schneider memorial award so we had long valued military veterans the capabilities that they bring rather than listen to me talk about that i brought with me today i think an example of what i described in terms of desirability first sergeant john williams came to us as an overwhelming truck driver was quickly promoted to become a training engineer which was the only instructor for us became an operations support representative a senior operations support representative and has been promoted to an instructor position in our operating center in colorado pennsylvania still enacted by the national guard with the pennsylvania national guard i'm going to let him talk about his experience and really what to having a military friendly employer my name is john williams i am first sergeant with um the 56th record brigade in pennsylvania since 2004 i was on two stints with the national guard i was in the massachusetts army national guard when i first came to schneider um since then schneider's bent over backwards to make sure that all the employees make their week their weekend drills their annual trainings and anything else like nco academies disasters involved in massachusetts the 1993 blizzard i was actually home on my weekend off from schneider and was activated for a week for the blizzard and just just a phone call to my manager it's a good problem take care of the state so you know we the tall ships that came in 1993 we were activated for that as well and then through my process of promotions schneider national movement me and my family from massachusetts down to carlisle pennsylvania like don was saying as a operations support representative at that time now the army national guard had no aspirations of getting back in until uh one day when i was waiting to get my new class of students we were watching tv and they were watching the two planes going to the world trade center you know at that point i decided that it was for me to get back into the military so when um 2003 i enlisted into pennsylvania national guard 2004 once i graduated from my um my my schooling to get more deserved i uh volunteered to deploy to iraq and i left one month later through that whole time since 2004 i've been on active duty two deployments to iraq for six of the last nine years i've contacted i've been in contact with mission international they've been great where they've kept my job so i came off of active duty my last time just may of this year and i came right back into my constructing role it was it getting back on a horse didn't miss a beat they've been great through the whole process in contact with corporate itself i would send in my my las's my pace statements with the military and as a va they would still met they would still maybe the difference between what my base pay as a soldier was and what i was previously making with schneider so didn't miss it was an added added benefit they didn't have to do it you have to keep my job but they don't have to pay me that extra money and during that time my wife used my post 911 gi bill and she just graduated from nursing school end of april so i can go on and on and on grind my head off schneider's been um i think that that definitely deserves um our next panelist um we have um lisandra mason she's the acting director for recovery care coordination at the department of defense and she will provide an overview of the national resource directory and how the national resource directory can be used as a resource for your offices and as well um to helping service members veterans and thank you thank you for that i'll try not the online directory was launched in the fall of 2008 as a result of nbaa 2008 wanting us to establish a resource center of resources for republican service members families veterans and caregivers and the department of defense affairs department of labor and the department of defense came together and created this website we have over 14 000 resources that are available to service members and their families caregivers and those who are working with servicemembers and their families in their communities you can actually go to this website this is online directory and research resources in your communities in your state in your region you can use keyword searches for example you could use the keyword of suicide and for example florida and put that into the directory and come up with all the particular resources within your area um the directory is is user friendly i can use it i think anybody can use it it's user friendly you don't have to have a password or a login to use it you do not have to worry about anyone researching who's looking at the directory and who's using it a lot of folks like to use things anonymously these days and you can certainly use this directly that way the website provides a central location for all those resources uh department of defense manages the content we go in on a daily basis and we do every service there every resource there eight hours sometimes 12 hours a day looking at resources making sure that the needs work that the resources are valid resources all the resources have been vetted through our office and then the department of labor and va working us behind the scenes to make sure that the site is always functional and useful for our service members the resource directory will allow for you to have a widget within your own websites and we encourage that because it offers your constituents an opportunity to go directly to your website and see that there's something available within their communities and they'll get access that region the it's been since july of 2013 this year we've increased uh our traffic to that site it's taken a minute but we've managed to get the information out and work out and increase by 33 we expect to have over a million um approaching the uh a million unique visits this year by december and we're on track to surpass three million page visits uh page views this year we research every every resource as i said earlier we research them every day we go in and we'll add resources as we go along with 14 000 and 75 right now 750 here and so any organization is welcome to add their resource to us and we work by state by accounting and communities so i would encourage each of you to take an opportunity to go into energy.gov and look at it play around with it within your particular states there's something unique there i think there are there's a space there on nrd where you can actually you know provide input if you try to choose to do so okay very quickly that's okay these are really useful tools because staff i we want to know what are the resources what are the numbers that we can share and because this is a government funded program we can share those on your website you can put them on the bottom of your tag link when you send emails so those are some things that we do within our office to kind of get at that resource as well um our next panelist is dr dan kemp and she will she's with the military veteran who suppress this hotline number how many of you knew that there was a crisis hotline the national crisis hotline and also with the national crisis hotline um they've really made it a one-stop shop with the hotline which is 1-800-273 top 825 and with that number it has a prompt that will um also include it for to assist veterans or their families so um it's kind of really easy it's one number that you can use again you can share that with your constituents on your website as well um so dr jeff kemp is um with the u.s department of veterans affairs and she will provide an overview of the military and veterans president's hotline and how you can use it and i'm so impressed to just rattled that number off the goal would be that you would all be able to do that when you walked out of them you know the veterans um crisis line is truly i think um a pretty good model of policy should actually come into being and operate um it's one of those uh now we hope it's some kind of an institution that's there to stay that was initially a part of legislation i don't know how many of you are familiar with the joshua angry bill which is a very important piece of legislation that came through at least in my life in 2008. the legislation was driven by a mother of a young soldier who returned from iraq and i killed himself and she really worked with her local congress people to develop this legislation it was one of those perfect pieces that um the va had a lot of input into we worked together to make sure we got what we we wanted to support our efforts and the community worked to see that they got what they needed to support their efforts and as a result of that for suicide prevention program in the va reform which is really exciting and really how she worked one of the pieces of that legislation was that we would provide crisis intervention services for veterans who needed them and we had some decisions to make about that about whether we should do it ourselves whether we should arrange for other people to do it and we decided that we really wanted to be veteran and military specific that we wanted people who called the number to give that sort of special attention to their needs but we recognized that we couldn't do it alone so we partnered with the department of health and human services in samsa to use the national suicide prevention number so that everyone would have the same number to call across the country and an option of pushing one people affiliated with the military in any way or a venture um it's been uh it's been pretty remarkable um sometime um towards the end of this week beginning of next week we will have our millionth call into proposed design and that represents really a million people who for some reason or another call for help or information something inside them said um remove i'm going to give it one more chance i'm going to give it a try i'm going to find out how to get help for myself or how to give help for my loved one and it's truly i think never going to save everyone's life but if certainly if you get them to make that call it's going to make a difference you know we really we don't know a lot about military suicide and veteran suicide um other than the fact that it's a tragedy and we're doing our best to to prevent it we don't know a lot about the risk factors that play a part in it we think we get a handle on something and then the data comes through and proves that perhaps we're wrong or we're not thinking about it right it's been kind of a continual effort on both of these part two to really come to some kernels and truth in this area but we do know a few things um and really it's very positive and helpful we know that if you give people an opportunity to seek help they'll do it and the other thing that we know is that treatment names are important that actually treatment helps um a treatment for the issues that are underlying the problems so if we can get people to make that phone call to get engaged in treatment in some way and it doesn't need to be a traditional sit down and talk to your therapist a sort of option we have online programs we have all sorts of other options now that appear to be making a difference also there's a lot of hope and that's the message that we need to get after that this is uh certainly um an exciting time and opportunity um issues they're dealing with can be awkward and uncomfortable we think to ourselves i never served how can i understand we'll talk about it when they're ready and then they'll wonder why they don't want to talk but when their behavior changes when they withdraw themselves increase substance use or even talk about hurting themselves it's time to act because if we don't our families and relationships will suffer ask the hard questions listen to the better ones in your life and show you care make the call it matters when you recognize the veterans in crisis call the veterans crisis line at 1-800-273-8255 so i think um you've got a folder full of information inside there are some propaganda tools that certainly can use if you have a little um that can certainly keep available on your desk or you'll notice that uh it's double branded is the veteran's currently signed in the military um we're kind of all in this together the cross countries take place and the referrals are made out to be appropriate people and the other thing to remember is that it's completely anonymous um you never uh demand anyone get probation or even seek it out unless there's an immediate crisis there's a website www.um.net um messages and it is really chatting but it's a a one-to-one discussion where the crisis line responded and our youngest veterans um actually used that chat feature a lot we opened up a texting service and that is slowly overtaking of our lives but it's a great opportunity but also because there's texting from their phone we do have the opportunity to call them and reach out to them with their children so that's a great option for everybody also on the website is a self-assessment quiz that people are taking by the thousands and i think it's a difficult thing to do to get into a website and say i'm thinking i'm killing myself or i think i might be in trouble but a lot of people will take this quiz and then they'll get into the chat room and said you know i took this self-assessment and it told me i needed to talk to you so so here i am that's kind of a conversation started so steer people in that direction also and i think i'm just going to end with um you just can't do it wrong go wrong you know i've really never heard of anyone being offended or upset if somebody said to them um boy you know if you ever need some help are having trouble and they found this number how far can i give it to you um i think um it's a it's a sign of regionality and hope that things will do better um and also from a staff perspective with the national crisis satellite number we highly recommend that as staff you can call the crisis hotline number from your from your desk and if you let the operator the person that answers the phone just let them know it's not a crisis you just want to know how the hotline works it's very helpful for you so that way as you're providing this resource to your constituents or to other veterans and you just if you ask them i'm just calling it's not a crisis i just want to see how the hotline works and then you can do that it's very helpful we also encourage individuals to put the hotline number into their cell phone because in time of crisis sometimes they people don't know who to call or they forget so it's it's easily accessible to have it in your phone and another thing too is anytime we're going to do a high publicized mental health event for example my boss did a mental health twitter chat with samsa um because we knew we didn't know who was going to be on this church chat nationwide so what we did is we actually called the national crisis hotline number tell work them that we were going to be doing a highly publicized mental health event so that way they were able to kind of up up on some of their to prepare some of their operators so from a staffing perspective this number is very helpful i don't know how many of your office has ever gotten a crisis call to your office in our office we actually did have a veteran colin and he was in crisis and has mentioned suicide and so another thing that you can do is you can do a three-way chat with the national crisis hotline number so maybe you're not fully um you don't have a background on mental health or whatnot but you can dial the crisis hotline number and an operator will get on and kind of walk them through that process so that way you don't have to kind of deal with um not knowing where to go and then hanging up and not knowing so this is a great a great um so thank you all for this number feel free to do that um oh and also we encourage you to have your bosses memorize this um if your boss puts out a mental health press release or anything that doesn't mental health if they're on c-span or if they're on television or radio we always ask that if your boss is talking about mental health or suicide that you include this hotline number on to your press release or on the bottom of the screen we try to do that because you don't want your bosses to go out and talk about this serious subject um our next panelist is um john madigan from the american foundation for suicide prevention and he's going to be really focusing on um the overview and collaborative efforts of social media um and how to use mental health within media what are the corporate things to say and not saying um despite some of the bad numbers that we see i lost my sister at 15 years ago after she lost their own battle with blind telephones national action um um executive secretary he talked about government smith who lost his story during the research uh back in september you may have realized that the first week of september was uh national suicide eventually the american foundation prevention got many members of congress to do these 30 seconds 60 60-second social media things something else social media wanted to show the group um prevention no one should ever feel ashamed embarrassed or afraid to ask for help help us reduce mental health stigma if you know someone you know needs help please contact national crisis hotline at 1-800-273-talk today your life matters hello i'm the united states senator joe donnelly of indiana and i want to help end the tragedy of suicide i'm working to help service members and veterans realize that their mental health is just as important as their physical acknowledging the challenges you face are not a sign of weakness seeking help is a scientist so here's what we're asking you all to do and what we'd like to do is not just your bosses um but yourself get yourselves involved we're going to reach out to the dsos the veteran service organization in order to see a separation um you know again both of us are pretty as simple as hi i'm john madigan i lost my sister nancy to suicide and on this veterans day i want to send a message to all of our brave men and women who may be struggling with depression or ptsd who are not alone as help is available use the hotline number and press one or visit veterans crisis learning dot net to receive confidential support from the process it's a real simple thing traveling again raise your hand back there um organizations and again this is just getting the conversation going you know once that's god's boss tim ryan getting a conversation with your addiction and substance abuse it's a normalized conversation as david said earlier if you were suffering with heart disease no one wouldn't sacrifice your heart fits but if you're suffering with diabetes you only wouldn't say get your diabetes right now internal behavioral health sometimes stigmatizing so we want people to get out there and do something helpful so how many of you might be interested in personally getting your loss or doing something like this yourself next week once you get the instructions all right i see a little bell and i want to see all the hands the other thing before i finish oh i'm sorry uh trevor asked me to say once completed we hope you'll help promote the video by social media and use the hashtag um veterans day the other thing that i wanted to let you know about this is our new um military family suicide prevention brochure and you are getting an advanced copy we're going to go out to all offices next help them week the risks factors the warning signs and the immediate protective actions as well laid out here and most importantly one place of all the resources for military and veteran across the country and then i also want to say again samuel i found this out four weeks ago i went to a uh open house at the dod suicide prevention office and i've been involved in four years now and uh jan i was telling senator earlier and i first met him four years ago she was telling me until we saw people not having jobs to install people without having access to medical care a whole bunch of things that sandwich wood does we're not going to really solve the suicide problem so i urge you to get involved it is a cultural message there are lots of good things going on within the actual lives of being an american foundation for suicide prevention received our first congressional staff award this past june scott may be in the line from the senior organization all no seriously i worked on the hill 35 years ago all of you serve really important front-line roles so let your constituents know let your bosses know what kinds of resources thank you very much i mentioned that at the outset that um the actual alliance is 165 organizations coming together and the american foundation for suicide prevention is one of the leading organizations and it's great to have them uh in the actual line and you know pull them together with us in every way possible um so now we've entered the fun part of this where you all get involved this is the audience and participation part right we're gonna do a little role playing and we have very good so first of all i'm going to put up um just uh we have a couple slides with some messaging on it and we'll just kind of first of all just pick that apart you know tell us what's wrong with it and then help us reframe okay are you ready so get your fingers on the buzzer okay the veteran suicide epidemic is getting worse i better commit suicide every 80 seconds what's wrong with the message negative though does it give you the perception about possession of how common this is maybe it's more common it really is there truly is not enough but truly the numbers have not changed drastically over the past 10 to 12 years um i've seen the uh the epidemic part of it is that we're paying attention um and we're actually located and for the first time we actually have a good idea how many effective foods some counter points that you would rather see better framing with the on the upside where the changes are from last year this year or the last initiative of this initiative in 2009 other ideas what would you like to replace this message with the vast majority of veterans what are getting help they're actually or they're doing well vast majorities are doing great companies supporting the community those type of messages so you guys can help get those messages those kind of messages up let's look at one more these service members are coming back from combat going crazy and shooting themselves what's wrong with the message crazy using that type of language going crazy language yes some of them have depression some of them have ptsd but that's not they're not going crazy right that's not going to want them i want to get them to seek help how about they talk about oversimplifying explanations for suicide you know this is kind of implying and actually deployment's yeah what else would you like to see there instead of you get the idea at least right you want to stay away from this kind of stuff more positive messaging now for the last little role play i need some people with a lot of kind of pittsburgh and we're going to put it out there ask that we drag some folks in the room and we want to stay this is a reporter calling a congressman who has some questions about veteran suicide and so i got a little script here and who who's like going there to put it out there who's who's going to take a risk okay now we want somebody to be the reporter now the reporter's got the easy part because you can just read the script all right so morgan if you just read these there's some questions here we've kind of see here's some ideas that a number of titles could use if we were to give up the script like we're not going to look at that so here are your questions there's another question there there's another question there um so take it away congresswoman in honor of veterans day i would like to talk to you about the ongoing suicide epidemic among your service members um it's been great if you read the newspaper it seems like veterans are coming back their own what can people listening to um is you know thank you very much if at any time any of you need help with messaging um we are happy to help uh i know uh colleen or i will help you i'm sure that john and trevor um mike wise so feel free to reach out we want to help change the conversation and make it one of promoting health promoting hope promoting connections uh life treatment and recovery um so um at this time we're going to go ahead and do some questions or by the same token is there new legislation you feel could be introduced to health support um uh um no that's great i think if anybody has any specific questions you can email me trevor t summerfield that's afsp.org and i'll be happy to talk about money in all deadlines and i would just like to say that the staff of the actual alliance is supported by anthem samson so likewise uh i'm here on 100 so i can't ask you for anything but i will just put out a fact that as the 10th leading cause of death um suicide is dramatically underfunded uh in terms of research uh to try to get it and the root causes and you know compared to other public health problems that kill about the same number of people um suicide gets just a fraction of that level on mental unfortunately and 40 million dollars for direct research on suicide prevention so i was involved in the cancer convention and i think we're sort of where we were then we are now with the suicide prevention movement we don't want to spend 40 years so again we realize there are tight dollars on the hill and we have to look at creative ways to get a bigger bang out of the bottom and try to work with groups inside and outside government you have to be reactionalized by virtue of their membership across the country there are lots of things going on so take a look at this which is why we were so excited to see that so again i think this is the beginning date hopefully on us having new conversations directly with all of you to be able to figure out what's going on out there and in um um same areas and age groups like generally many things um ethnic background so when you look at risk factors across the whole order you look at really what veterans who died look like is and the other way around but this isn't specifically a military problem um what would it look like for you as an employed member um like i said my wife used my clothes was hard enough and it was it was nice to have the extra money that schneider was giving me but um i mean especially like a guy a guy his pride is in supporting his family come home and not have that decent words one thing i would say is i know on the epidemic comment up there is a tendency to want to um if you say no there's not an epidemic sometimes you're doing a disservice to those without died by suicide and so maybe there's an opportunity not to to attack that issue but to move and shift and pivot from it and say you know really the tragedy is the men and women that are out there today that are suffering that are in pain that aren't taking advantage of an unprecedented level of resources out there for them and so i don't think it has to be a yes or no on that issue in some ways you're never going to win that so move the conversation quickly from that to what can we do now what we can who's out there today that we can help how can we get a message of hope and resilience out there the resources so i think there are a lot of opportunities where you don't have to put your boss in a position where they're on record saying there is no people you know put them in a position where they can be advocating to help the people who are here today who served their country who fought and come back and earned these resources and you know that's i think a real opportunity to sort of shift that conversation back to the positive narrative without having to take on this other issue which is right for you know bad bad sound congressman ryan does that really well when you talk about the tragedy so if you don't have any more questions um do any of the panelists have any last words of wisdom uh in the parade magazine section of the newspapers we're going to have a full section on suicide prevention so we'll be reaching 63 million americans we had an intensive training this morning with our folks in new york um because we expect a lot of phone calls but again as david and colleen and trevor and i have tried to do today's program we want to change the conversation and let people know there are lots of services out there they may not be around the corner of the particular person we've got to help people figure out where the services are and how to get them is that a washington post insert yes it's the magazine section of the wall inside there it's it comes i get it on saturday but it comes sunday so um take a look it'll be it'll be in print on sunday and online on saturday um veterans day will be attacking internally at hbo that features the veterans choices slide on that um the supporters so thank you john thank congresswoman thank you uh for hosting us today appreciate your support dave can you tell the group again watch foreign email so if you sign make sure you sign up on that contact

veterans and armed services health promotion actor in regards to the question somebody asked about legislation that's out there addressing mental health teams of veterans in my opinion it's going to

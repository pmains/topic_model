minute thank you i thank my colleague from minnesota for the time i rise in opposition to the previous questions so that we can immediately consider h.r 5586 this bill will kill a biden administration proposal that would allow irs agents to comb through the bank accounts of any american who spends more than ten thousand dollars a year to put that in perspective ten thousand dollars a year equates to just twenty eight dollars a day and fifty dollars a month or half of the average minnesota household mortgage payment in other words the buying administration wants the irs to be able to spy on tens of millions of americans so don't be mistaken this proposal does not just target the one percent as the president sometimes likes to claim instead it is pointed directly at working american families today i let a letter with more than two hundred of my colleagues urge urging treasury secretary janet yellen to scrap this proposal to spy on american citizens this is not china we must protect americans right to privacy and stop this proposed intrusive unnecessary spider financial reporting requirements and i yield back

hey all of us want privacy in our lives and I know I lead a public life but I like privacy too just like everybody else but then there's this thing called facebook that somehow my wife got hooked on and its really kind of take it away whatever privacy I thought I had hey Jer found your reading glasses for you bedroom bathroom kitchen dinette family room and car you can stop buying them now I don't know why anybody needed to know that there's this one okay he's only been home a few days and this morning while I was vacuuming I've already picked up to Candide pretzels three paper liners from between his thin sliced cheddar and a stack of filing from under his footstool I love him so much ! Yeah right maybe by posting this I'll get a better Christmas present or not again why does anybody need to know that about me this one I remember going to coldstone and her post is ended up at cold stone creamery after dinner tonight in aggieville and when Jerry and I walked in three workers yelled hey it's the cake batter shake guy pretty good to be known as that really one worker told Jerry she saw him at the rec center this morning thought hey that's the cake batter shape guy so it's funny to her that these kids have no idea he's a senator love it but maybe if he ate fewer shakes he wouldn't have to work out quite so much again don't know why people need to know that about my work and then this one a pretty typical of our lives Robin posts this face book that says this exciting saturday night with jerry having dinner in the car at sonic and then grocery shopping at ray's wow we are pathetic but happy i hope so and then finally you can teach an old man new tricks but evidently the squeegee on the glass shower door isn't one of them okay

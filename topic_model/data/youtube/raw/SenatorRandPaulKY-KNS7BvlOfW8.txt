so that would have also sent a pretty strong message republican senator rand paul of kentucky joins me now senator good to see you thanks for coming back today um what goes through your mind as you listen to your your good friend dr fauci say that well my question to him would be did you just discover vaccine immunology did you not believe in vaccine immunology a couple of weeks ago when i asked you this or were you doing it for show and it sounds like you heard him say he didn't want people to see him without a mask the thing is the science hasn't changed we've known that when you're vaccinated we've known this for quite a while that you're not transmitting it and not getting it we've known that for months now but also vaccine immunology if you believe in it if you believe in the vaccine that's what happens you don't have to wear a mask afterwards but realize they're still pushing this on our kids now because they're saying you have to have been vaccinated but kids who have not been vaccinated should be allowed to run track outside without a freaking mask they fired some coach in new hampshire recently because it wasn't making the kids wear a mask while running outside they're going to make these kids do it for another year so i'm glad some governors are pushing back kids do not need to spend another year in school wearing masks there's no science to back it up i saw a story this morning on fox and friends about two high school athletes who passed out um because they had masks on one of them barely made it across the finish line and tracked the other one was playing basketball um here here's you know when it comes to the science here's what dr fauci said about the difference between the last administration and this one i want to get your take on this senator obviously you could argue about about whether or not there should have been more planning about it and discussing about it but the one thing that is true is that what you're seeing now that you didn't see before was a considerable degree of independence on the decision-making process based on the science that's the good news there's no doubt about that so he's suggesting that the last administration didn't allow them on the task force to be independent about the science i think history will demonstrate that the only thing that affected the course of this pandemic was the vaccine government did have a role in it the trump administration had a big role in this but all of the other things were ultimately found out to be uh irrelevant and ineffective six feet of distancing didn't work mask mask with your cutting your undershirt up and making it into a mask doesn't work none of the other mitigation strategies did anything when we were at the height of all mandates in lockdown the incidence of the infection was at its highest there's no correlation between lockdown strategies fouchy mandates and the correlation with the disease none of it worked other than the vaccine it's interesting that you say that they put this up on the screen real quick we're almost out of time but total cova deaths per 100 000 people this is the measure right look at this florida texas new york has the highest of all and uh then you have michigan when you look across the country the deaths per 100 000 rate is is fairly consistent with some you know outliers in new york and new jersey on the high side um regardless of the fact that they had a completely different policy and approach to the whole thing real quick sir yeah none of the lockdowns worked and the only thing they did in new york was something that was incorrect and that was putting people from the nursing homes back in the nursing home that led to thousands of deaths and that's why their record's so bad indeed senator rand paul thank you good to see you sir thanks for being here thank you

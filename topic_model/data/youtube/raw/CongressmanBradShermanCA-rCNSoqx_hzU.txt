now at six thirty the latest on the threat to LA schools good evening I'm Micah Ohlman the school board president now says schools will be open tomorrow officials have declared the school's safe after a search of more than 1500 school sites the threat came and of an email mentioning explosives and assault rifles late today the FBI determining the threat was not credible officials are defending the decision to close schools today some have used words that I think are probably inappropriate like hoax and other things whether it's criminal mischief whether it's somebody testing vulnerabilities of multiple cities we still do not know enough to say definitively what we do know is that it will be safe for our children to return to school tomorrow when parents make their determination about the decisions that were made today I would ask him to look at it this way if you knew what the superintendent and the school board new at five thirty this morning when the decision had to be made would you have sent your child to school officials say more than 1500 school sites were searched after the threat they also say security will be greatly increased near schools tomorrow and for the rest of the week we have team coverage on the school threats Sarah welch standing by with advice on what to tell your children but first to Christina Pascucci live in the newsroom with details about a similar threat in New York today Christina that's right good evening Mike and also congressman brad Sherman sounding off on this he said Isis was watching a reaction today on one hand they see officials responding quickly on the other they see how on edge we become since the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino and all the hysteria that comes with that this as intelligence officials we spoke with describe the methods they use to determine whether a threat is credible the purpose of terrorism is not necessarily to blow things up & to cause gazal tease but to create fear and this email did just that congressman brad Sherman a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and local rep says language an email threat to LAUSD schools seemed to indicate it was a hoax well 99% of these things are hoaxes it's the one percent that kills people former Special Agent Steve Moore says often easy to identify a fake terror threat the counterterrorism expert says three factors helped him determine a threats credibility their access to the location that's being threatened you're looking for their ability to attack and you're looking for specificity hours after LAUSD superintendent Ramon Cortina has made the decision to send some 700,000 students home another email threat in New York we affirm that we do have an investigation underway but it's an investigation into a hoax but why did New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton had the opposite reaction to a strikingly similar threat he says LAUSD overreacted does he have a name yes the source New York officials said their threat reflected the plot of the drama series homeland I think the initiator the instigator of the threat may be a homeland fan and while the IP address linked to both threats in LA in New York originated overseas it wouldn't surprise me to think that it did come from somewhere locally but was spoofed to make authorities believe that it did come from overseas Soteria intelligence uses social media and other tactics to foresee threats like today's looking at historical data combinations of keywords as well as cut as well as cognitive computing based on their investigation we're pretty sure it's a hoax but we think it's still good to be vigilant and so Terry intelligence he just heard from launched a program in the last few weeks to try to mitigate risk risks exactly like what we saw today I to these schools and even though by the way New York officials almost immediately dismissed this as a hoax NYPD is working with the FBI and LAPD on this exact Brett and Christina Pascucci reporting from the newsroom Michael said it back to you Christina back to congressman Sherman for a moment if we may what was it specifically within the body of that email that led him to believe that it was not credible oh my gosh Sherman says there were many signs first off he said the from line that said the email who the email is listed from used empathic reference which he said is something a devout Muslim would never do the culprit also described himself or herself as a Muslim had been bullied by students at an LAUSD school and had dozens of extremist friends ready to carry out this attack similarly in the threat to New York schools they described themselves as having more than 100 jihadist friends ready to carry out this attack and Sherman said a lot of this to not just add up Micah

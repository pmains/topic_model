- In our vision, it's love of country, it's love of one another,
it's self sacrifice, it's red, white and blue,
it's America to the core and we're not apologizing for that. (audience agreeing) Because we are patriots. So that's why I'm here. Because I love Texas,
I love the people here. I love God and I love
country and we love guns. (laughing) We're proud of it and we
need lines in congress who will stand up for those values, fight for our culture and give a damn and have the people's back. Because that's what matters most. So thank you, thank you for coming and please, please help us. (applauding)

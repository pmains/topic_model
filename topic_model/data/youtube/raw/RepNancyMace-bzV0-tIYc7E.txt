nancy mace of south carolina who is on the oversight and reform committee congresswoman it's always great to have you nancy pelosi says investigating the origins of coven 19 is a distraction it seems to be a pattern on the left if they don't agree with something it's a distraction it's disinformation you're a denier it's you know it's conspiracy theory stuff how do you battle against that well i can say for starters that nancy pelosi is playing defense attorney for communist china she is not allowing a hearing any hearing on the origins of covet 19. republicans recently house republicans had to have a forum with different medical experts including the assistant secretary to hhs under former president trump about this issue and even he agrees that there ought to be more transparency and an investigation into the origins of covid but right now nancy pelosi is playing hide and seek she doesn't want to get down and figure out what's really going on and what happened this is a massive massive pandemic that is affecting everybody around the world and we're just letting china literally run away with it yeah but if the question becomes if the world health organization can't even get china to cooperate what's nancy pelosi going to do what's the united states going to do beijing has said look we don't want this looked into it's going to be very hard to put their feet to the fire what's the solution right a solution would be to have an actual public hearing on the origins of copen when you talk to doctors and medical experts everyone believes that it started in a lab in wuhan one of the things that the united states can do and this is not an overnight solution but rather than a slap on the wrist to china really work on our regulatory policy and trade with other nations to ensure that we're manufacturing less in china and manufacturing more here in the united states or other countries around the world that is one way that we can have an effective change on this and punish them by taking business away from them they're taking over the world here they started this pandemic and we ought to hold them accountable yeah you've gotten a lot of pushback congresswoman you know kind of changing subjects a little bit for for pushing back on wearing a mask at the capitol you tweeted the following yesterday quoting here a dangerous example is directing police to arrest you over a mask a dangerous example is telling the american people vaccines don't work they do a dangerous example is allowing coveted sick illegals to spread covet here socialist left policy is making covert worst i i want to kind of ask if if in the wake of the new information from the cdc that this might be as transmissible as infectious as chickenpox that you would change your stance in any way no i would not change my stance in any way yesterday morning when i walked into the office in dc we were told that the capitol hill police were directed to arrest staff and visitors to the capitol if they were not wearing a mask when we want to get people vaccinated and i had coveted not only did i have covet but i had a case of long covid and it was a horrible experience i'm also vaccinated i'm encouraging everyone to get vaccinated because it's going to save lives and i've said that message over and over again but it sets a very dangerous precedent to tell the american people that we're going to arrest you if you choose not to wear a mask rather than do that we should be encouraging low income areas and the hot spots around the country really going into those place surgically and asking people to do the right thing and get vaccinated making sure that they have access to vaccinations because that's the only way that we're going to get through this thing but just seconds ago admiral brett juwar said you know what he's in favor of is people wearing masks even if you're vaccinated if nothing else to protect children who are not eligible for vaccines yet your final thoughts on that well if you if you feel that you could get coveted whether you're vaccinated or not you should wear an n95 max i i'm not discouraging that at all i don't want people arrested for it i do want to know the data the cdc has done a horrific job of informing the american people earlier this week we learned that their data was coming from another country in a study that was not with u.s based vaccinations also the spread of covenant 19 at our border our border really is a super spreader event right now if you're a u.s citizen coming into the united states from mexico you have to have a negative cova test they're not requiring vaccinations they're not testing for covet of everyone crossing the border they're not making them wear masks treat this equally everywhere

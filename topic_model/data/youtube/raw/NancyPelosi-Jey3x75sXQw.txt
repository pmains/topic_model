i think doing a debt prioritization bill makes it clear to our bondholders that we're going to meet our obligation foreign debt is held by the chinese and the japanese second and everybody knows it so it's austerity for the american people but make sure that the bondholders are paid doesn't it mean as democrats have suggested you're basically choosing to pay china before you pay u.s troops listen those those who loaned us money uh like in any other proceeding if you will court proceeding the bondholders usually get paid first same thing this amendment is a farce it's a divert attention from the fact that you want to pay these guys before you pay these guys i cannot believe that this body would even entertain or consider a bill that put the social security check of 56 million senior and people after china how can we justify putting 2 million american military personnel many whom are in harm's way after china that is not right that is not fair and you know you know we're about the politics of this not at all that's what the overriding bill is about putting china first paying china first putting our troops last putting the american people last it's about putting them first and us last

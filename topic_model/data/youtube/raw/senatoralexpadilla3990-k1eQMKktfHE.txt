uh senator padilla thank you madam chair um that's from following the train of thought on the previous answer to the previous question but uh let's move forward here now under the disclose act organizations spending more than ten thousand dollars on campaign related activity would be required to disclose any donor who contributed more than ten thousand dollars which is in my opinion a large sum of money to fund that activity donors who give less than that amount would not need to be disclosed so this sort of basic transparency would not affect small dollar donors but would reveal the small segment of society that is spending tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands and some cases even millions of dollars to influence the outcome of elections and by extension public policy i think disclosure would also help voters and citizens broadly understand who's trying to influence and why it sounds like common sense policy those that seek to use their outsized wealth to gain an outsized voice in elections and policy shouldn't be able to do so anonymously yet critics claim that forcing disclosure of these large donors will subject those individuals to harassment or danger mr weiner i know we touched on this a few minutes ago but can you respond to the specific criticism that donor disclosure would lead to donor harassment of course thank you senator um i think that we should start with a common premise which is that everybody in our society deserves to be safe when they engage with the political process um but i am mindful of justice scalia's admonition that requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts foster civic courage without which democracy is due so yes it is not acceptable to harass donors it's not acceptable that violence is not acceptable but the right to speak is not to the right to be speak free from criticism and you know we have had millions upon millions of americans who have been subject to disclosure at the threshold for candidates and actual harassment and reprisals are rare there is also i would like to note an exception in this legislation for donors who face a real threat to their safety as a result of donation so i think in the vast majority of cases no this is not actually a serious concern and a good objection to disclosure okay thank you for that i um you know before i ask my next question which is specific to the citizens united case and i sort of take a step back and look at the impact not just of citizens united but shelby beholder right it seems that in the last decade the supreme court has uh specifically made it harder for some people to vote and easier for the wealthy to influence elections bad combination now in citizens united specifically the supreme court unleashed a torrent of unlimited political spending billions of dollars in the last 10 years on the basis of two assumptions and correct me if i'm wrong this analysis number one that spending would be accompanied by both independence and transparency the court reasoned that if expenditures were independent then they would not necessarily lead to the undue influence or corruption the court also reasoned that transparency would safeguard political integrity so mr wayne are also for you in the decades since the citizens united decision how have these two assumptions underlying the court's holding fared are independent expenditures actually independent and transparent well thank you senator no they are not many many many independent expenditures are actually of course carried out by groups that have close close ties to candidates and what you see is also obviously fundraising for these groups with candidates and elected officials attending and even donors being able to lobby for their favorite policies and then of course as we've been discussing neither are many of these expenditures transparent so i think neither of those predictions as sadly with many of the predictions in shelby county have um proved to come to pass thank you thank you madam sure okay thank you very much senator padilla

Hay. Hay. Hey, I'm Kim Schrier. Did you know Washington State harvests over
half a million acres of hay each year? But when COVID slowed supply chains, it kept
crops from getting to market. So I worked with both parties to get farmers
relief. And hold the Biden Administration accountable
to get supply routes back open. With Kim Schrier in Congress, we're making
hay again. It's like we found a needle in the hay stack. Hay â€“ that's why I approved this message.

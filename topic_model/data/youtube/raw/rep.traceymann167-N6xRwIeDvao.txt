kansas face of things kevin thanks for doing this i agree with my colleagues end of the day y'all this is about freedom and we got to understand there's an inverse relationship between the size of government and freedom government grows freedom shrinks government shrinks freedom growth that's what this is about i was just on the phone in the capitol with the business owner from kansas struggling with what is he supposed to do he's built a great team built his business from the bottom up uh his team's fierce with him that he has to enforce a mandate that he absolutely hates with his very existence that's flat wrong our office heard from someone in middle management worked for their company for 30 years they now have to implement a policy on there and they're they're stuck in the middle of this that they don't want to have to do our office heard from a woman in manhattan kansas eight months pregnant who's calling us asking us what she should do she's being told if she gets vaccinated she keeps her job if she doesn't she loses her job there's no research on the effects of a vaccine for a woman that's eight months pregnant so she gets vaccinated she potentially jeopardizes her pregnancy potentially if she doesn't she loses her job and can't feed her baby this policy is horrible flat wrong needs to end thank you very much

it's hard to believe a year ago today i was on the house floor speaking about the coronavirus and this same week my parents are going to get their first vaccinations i actually started reading about this on january 6 2020 over a year ago with more than 4 500 people confirmed infected in china and over 100 deaths the coronavirus certainly has my attention after reaching out to the cdc and the kansas department of health and just warning them that i thought this was going to be really bad i started reaching out to to the fda in the private enterprise saying look we're going to need more testing we're going to need more therapeutic agents and for sure we're going to need a vaccine and i'm just so proud of this great american effort to accomplish all of this you know way back in february and march not knowing exactly how this was transmitted but doctors and nurses on the front line uh just so concerned about it and and working hard and taking care of people and even myself i put my sports coats away and my tie away broke out some scrubs and found a stethoscope and a lab coat and went to work in in kansas city some lawmakers are even busier on the front lines of battling the virus like gop congressman who also happens to be a doctor roger marshall of kansas and the er doctor the icu doctors telling me they were running out of ventilators so we reached out to the white house paul and said we're we're out of ventilators we have 13 people up here and we just don't have any ventilators left less than 48 hours later two blackhawk helicopters with four ventilators showing up on the front lawn of southwest medical center was just a great sight to see we'll do whatever we need to do to make sure that we can accommodate the situation it was part of the dock caucus we were constantly assessing the situation making sure that the fda was given a prompt attention to the new therapeutics out there the new anti-viral agents as well as the new monoclonal antibodies let doctors make the decisions who they think would benefit from the most whatever we need to do to get government out of the way and let the doctors make the decisions that doctor-patient relationship so we were out there making sure that all the testing all the new tests that were coming online we're getting their attention as well and getting them improved in an efficient fashion and then lastly we oversaw paid very close attention to the to the development of a new vaccine i remember thinking back in last april or may that we could have a vaccine ready by thanksgiving time and so many people told me and especially the national media told me that was impossible usually it takes seven years to get a vaccine president trump is not going to be satisfied unless we have a vaccine ready this winter we didn't have just one vaccine ready by thanksgiving we had two when the when the front page is going to be talking about the impeachment we need to be talking about how do we get vaccinations in people's arms how do we get this economy going uh even just within this past week where we're vaccinating over a million people per day 1.6 million people actually just last week in one day alone we're well on our way it's been it's been an incredibly tough time we've lost 400 000 americans mental health issues suicides substance abuse all those things have gone up it's just been tough tough times but america is going to make it through this

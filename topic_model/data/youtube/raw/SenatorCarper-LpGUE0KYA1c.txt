well hi everybody happy uh earth day earth day has been a very important day for me for many many many uh years uh when i was a young naval officer a few years ago naval flight officer station we're just stationed just south of the san francisco bay i remember joining thousands actually tens of thousands of people just like you to celebrate what was the very first earth day amazing day in a remarkable way that day some 41 years ago i was about 12 at the time but it helped to change my life ultimately leading me to serve not just the united states navy but become governor and now to serve in the united states senate where gaylord nelson the founder of earth day served many many years ago as we observe this 41st earth day i am reminded of the progress that we've made to help clean up our nation we've made significant strides in the right direction but we still have plenty of work to do as a member of the united states committee that's charged with protecting our environment i work just about every day with my colleagues democrat and republican to try to address these these problems these challenges and for me though there's not earth ages in one day years every day every day ought to be earth day fortunately some of the best ways to clean up our air and protect our earth are also the best ways to bring jobs and prosperity back to this country the these investments in safeguarding our environment have also boosted our local economy here at home to me this sounds like a pretty smart move to use our limited resources finding ways to improve our economy and to improve our environment at the same time with the same federal dollar an example of this is in the investments that we've made in renewable energy through the american recovery and investment act i call it the stimulus act but the department of energy has invested some 80 billion dollars in clean energy projects that lead to about 150 billion dollars in private sector investments and these clean energy provisions from the recovery act are expected to create more than 700 000 jobs by the end of next year i'd say it's pretty good return on our investment really on your investment now there's a lot that we're doing at home in delaware to make smart investments in both our economy and in our environment right off the shores of rehoboth beach we're working to harness the power of the wind to create clean renewable energy that will soon power thousands i think about a hundred thousand homes in in our state and perhaps even more across the region there's a company called fisker you may have heard of a fiscal automotive uh they'll be reopening a plant our ogm plant in our very own wilmington delaware next year where they will make plug-in electric vehicles that are estimated at close to 100 miles per gallon and fisker is not only environmentally responsible in their vehicles but they're also responsible in how they decided or have decided to operate their plan the company opted for example to use or sell for the most part reuse almost all the old equipment from the general motors plan which helped to save energy and money and to reduce waste recycling and we use our keys to fiskar's operation something i love to see as co-chairman of the senate caucus on recycling that's a great thing and in wilmington at our city's wastewater treatment plant which serves over 750 000 of our local residents some very smart engineers are working to convert waste into energy to power that facility sometimes when we think about how we as individuals can improve our environment the task seems daunting and we might feel that there is little that we can do to make a difference that could not be further from the truth there really is so much that all of us can as individuals do and his families can do that will make a real difference for our planet for our health and for our well-being if we all just recycle well 10 more than what we do now we could save enough energy to heat 74 million homes across america that's 74 million american homes across our country which would be enough electricity i think for about two and a half million americans and if just one person per household left their car at home and commuted by public transportation carpool walked or or biked that household's carbon footprint would be reduced by 30 percent per year think about that 30 percent and in doing so we would be improving not only our environment but also our health something that's good for all of us in a nation where one out of every three people are on their way to being obese these are just two examples of thousands each of us could do to be better citizens of this planet earth in closing i i want to thank you for letting me celebrate this 41st earth day with you i call on all of you to join us to treat every day like it's earth day together our small choices can make a huge difference happy earth day happy earth day to everyone thank you god bless

Thank You mr. chairman this amendment would delegate authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate bulk price discounts in the purchase of prescription drugs for the Medicare program it's long been an astonishing fact that the biggest purchaser of pharmaceutical drugs on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries is by law prohibited from working out the best deal for the taxpayers by using basic market principles a seller in a buyer negotiating for a fair price the seller wants to sell high a buyer wants to buy low that is true in every interact commercial interaction that's the way it is and it was a unique and in really unexplainable provision in the Medicare Part B program or Part D program where we handcuffed the Secretary of Human Services from being able to get the best deal now the argument that some folks make is that negotiation doesn't work but what we have is a situation where we buy wholesale but have to pay retail and it's resulting in enormous lehigh prescription drug prices there was a study that was done that showed that in fact the twenty chopped pharmaceutical products were paying in the Medicare program about 58 percent more than we pay in other programs Medicaid oftentimes has negotiation the VA program has price negotiation and they get a much better price we're all struggling here right now about the pay for us to extend the chip program that we all support so what is the problem with it it's it's not imposing a price it's negotiating a price and by the way when Elijah Cummings and I had an opportunity to meet with President Trump about this he made it quite clear you know if he was negotiating for something in one of his buildings he's gonna try to negotiate a good price and if he's buying a thousand mirrors he's gonna get her price better price than if he's buying ten and he totally gets it that this makes sense to do and he what he also gets and what I think every one of us can get is it the people we represent are really struggling at their kitchen table trying to figure out their budgets and a lot of times they're having to make a decision about whether they can take the full prescription that's been provided by their physician or not because the price is too high and it's hammering the tax payer putting enormous pricing pressure on people needlessly this is not about restricting what the pharmaceutical companies do it's just saying hey there is going to be a price negotiation here because the government is buying in bulk negotiation works now give an example in and involves tommy Thompson who was the governor of Wisconsin but later became our health and human services secretary but in 2001 when we had to get a lot of cipro the price was for 67 per dose at the federal supply schedule the federal supply schedule had it at a dollar seventy seven during the anthrax scare secretary Thompson purchased a hundred million doses for 95 cents and had an option to purchase another hundred million at 85 cents in a third round it's 75 cents per dose as opposed to the 467 I mean it mystifies everybody I've ever talked to when they're told that we this Congress has passed a law saying we can't negotiate through the Medicare program to get a better deal for them and for the taxpayer we've got an opportunity to do it this is the time to do it it's a not it's a it's money that we can save for taxpayers and consumers so mr. mr. chairman my hope here is that we can begin this process of focusing on the excessive cost in various components of our health care system rationalize them introduce market principles like negotiation and get a better deal for taxpayers for employers who are paying for health care for their employees and for consumers as well and I yield back the balance of my time

yeah so my name is Zach Booker and I own several businesses in West Michigan some of them being from a small barber shop called Zach's barber shop to West Michigan auto glass to a large company called eyewear solutions so what do you want to say tonight in terms of your area of expertise and and what you got out of the experience in being here yeah first of all it was a great experience and definitely honored to be here thanks to Bill and you know as far as the tax reform goes it's definitely helping us back in West Michigan it's allowing us to have the opportunity to pay more wages to our existing employees hire more employees add locations by the locations instead of renting them and really being able to compete against the bigot big guys congressman the the critiques on the tax legislation are that it's it's not for everybody necessarily doesn't benefit them what's your reaction I think they are so off base we are seeing large companies we are seeing small companies like Zach's we're seeing medium sized companies in Michigan we've got the three largest office furniture makers we've got Tier one tier two tier three automotive suppliers we've got food processors they are all benefiting and more importantly their employees are benefiting and you know for for some to throw out the chin that this is crumbs that doesn't really mean anything to families it's completely off-base it's well over 50% of all families can't come up with $1,000 in an emergency fund to go fix a car repair fix an issue there or take a trip to the doctor so when we're seeing those kinds of bonuses being made those increases in wages stock options being offered that's real money that's real dollars into these families and hardworking taxpayers as a member of the financial

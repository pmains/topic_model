N POLITICAL VIEWPOINT OR IDEOLOGY. JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS IS GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN ANDREW CLYDE . CONGRESSMAN HAPPY TO HAVE YOU WITH US HERE? YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT AT THE TIME THAT TWITTER WAS DOING THIS, THEY WERE A PUBLIC COMPANY AND LYING ABOUT IT. I MEAN, NOW SINCE ISLAND MUST TOOK OVER THEIR PRIVATE, BUT THEY WERE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY AT THAT TIME. ABSOLUTELY IT IT MATTERS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. YOU KNOW, THIS SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS COLLUDING WITH BIG TECH IN ORDER TO SILENCE THE FREE SPEECH OF INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S SUCH AN EGREGIOUS MATTER THAT THIS WEEK I INTRODUCED A BILL CALLED THE FREE SPEECH DEFENSE ACT, AND THAT BILL WOULD BRING TO THE END. UH THE COLLUSION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND BIG TECH. AND IT WOULD IT WOULD ALLOW FREE SPEECH TO ONCE AGAIN BE FREE, AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. YOU KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT HAS A PRECEDENT THAT SAYS YOU MAY NOT DO INDIRECTLY WHAT YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING DIRECTLY ELSE. THE PROHIBITION IS NULL AND VOID AND THE GOVERNMENT IS PROHIBITED FROM CANCELING FREE SPEECH FROM, YOU KNOW, ALLOWING OR DISALLOWING CITIZENS FREE SPEECH, AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVED WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS FIVE AND WELL. YEAH TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT REVEALS GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. WELL, WHEN YOU SEE THE FBI HAVING WEEKLY MEETINGS WITH FACEBOOK WHEN YOU SEE YOU KNOW A PORTAL BEING CREATED WITH CISA, THE CYBERSECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY THAT ALLOWS THE DNC THAT ALLOWS CERTAIN LIBERAL GROUPS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO, UM JOIN TOGETHER AND CANCEL CERTAIN POSTS BY CONSERVATIVES BY PRO GUN BY PRO LIFE, YOU KNOW BY FOLKS THAT DON'T AGREE WITH THE BINDING MINISTRATIONS POLICIES, THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE. YOU KNOW , THE GOVERNMENT IS PROHIBITED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT FROM ENGAGING IN CENSORSHIP OF FREE SPEECH. AND THE WHITE HOUSE MAINTAINS THAT THEY REALLY HAD HAD NO CONNECTION TO ANYTHING ANY GROUPS ON TWITTER AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON ALL OF THIS, AND EVERYTHING IS PREPOSTEROUS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING ESSENTIALLY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS, IS THAT IT THEY ACTUALLY WERE CONNECTED NOT JUST DURING THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, BUT ALSO AFTER HE WAS ELECTED. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING AS WELL? WELL I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE BY THEIR AVOIDANCE OF DIRECT QUESTIONS, AND I'M GLAD THAT REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE MAJORITY IN JANUARY, AND I'M ON THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. SO WE ARE GOING TO INVESTIGATE THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH COLLUSION THERE WAS BETWEEN BIG TECH AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND WE'RE GONNA EXPOSE THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I'M SO THANKFUL THAT ELON MUSK IS EXPOSING WHAT TWITTER HAS BEEN DOING IN THIS THE RESPONSIBILITY, UM, THAT TWITTER HAS HAD IN THE SCIENCE. RINSING OF FREE SPEECH WHILE COLLUDING WITH THE GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THAT AS A AS THE TWITTER FILES AS MORE INFORMATION COMES OUT ON THE TWITTER FILES, AND I JUST I THANK ELON MUSK VERY MUCH CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT ROLE YOU KNOW? IT USED TO BE NEWSPAPERS THAT DOMINATED THE POLITICAL DISCUSSION. UH AND THEN, AND THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAY. BUT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THESE ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE. SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? AND WHO NEEDS TO BE A PART OF IT? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT GOOGLE FACEBOOK? ALL THE PLATFORMS WE'RE TALKING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, INCLUDING, UH, TWITTER. UM HOW DO YOU REGULATE THOSE WITHOUT CONTROLLING AS A GOVERNMENT? UM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO STAY OPEN TO VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS. WELL FIRST, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT STAYS OUT OF IT. THAT'S ONE THING AND THIS FREE SPEECH DEFENSE ACT WOULD PROHIBIT THE GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT, SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF IT, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO PUSHING THAT FORWARD IN THE IN THE 118TH CONGRESS WHEN REPUBLICANS HAVE THE MAJORITY, BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE ASPECT THAT PUBLISHERS HAVE SOME LIABILITY FOR WHAT THEY PUBLISH, AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT THERE'S AN EXEMPTION THAT THOSE ON THE INTERNET NET LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM, ETCETERA. I DON'T HAVE THAT. SAME UM A LIABILITY, AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO LOOK AT AND NEEDS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD HERE. UM, SO THAT THESE BIG TECH COMPANIES WHO ARE NOW AS YOU SAID, TAKING OVER THE PUBLIC SQUARE THAT THEY HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY, AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. ALL RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN ANDREW CLYDE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. THANK YOU. MEANTIME PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NON BEARING BINARY NUCLEAR WASTE OFFICIAL IS ACCUSED NOW STEALING ANOTHER PERSON'S LUGGAGE. SAM BRITAI

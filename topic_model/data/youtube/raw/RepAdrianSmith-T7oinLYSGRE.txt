Thank You mr. chairman and thank you to our panel is certainly for being here and sharing your insight and expertise we know that this is tariffs trade in general is such an important topic I think as some of the discussion that we've had across America about trade has been healthy recently now I believe that tariffs are negative you end up hurting producers and consumers that is a huge concern that I have I appreciate the president's objective I appreciate what his intentions are and I would also say that it stands to reason that the sooner we can get this resolved the better I hear multiple concerns from Nebraskans about the impact on tariffs we have a large sector of a center-pivot manufacturing those big sprinklers that are shipped around the world use a lot of steel and ranky for example and they they tell me that you know their input costs a for steel have gone up already and it actually hurts their competitiveness competitiveness so we see that more and more I mentioned last week in terms of more agricultural products themselves the dry bean industry Akeley bean tells me that in Scottsbluff they tell me that they have seen reduced orders from Europe actually I also preferred popcorn in Chapman Nebraska they tell me that they've they've lost orders in Asia and and in in Europe and so we see the exclusion process and as has been mentioned it's not working very effectively so we needed to to work more effectively and also acknowledge these realities I know mr. sensor you you pointed out that the concerns with the quota system that perhaps could leave you without product to buy perhaps at any price that is a concern expressed we might buy some Nebraska producers as well and that with Brazil for example choosing the court or rather than being subjected to the 232 tariffs that that conceivably could leave good opportunity in Nebraska without product at all at any price I hope we can address that and so mr. sim sir I of course I don't want you to repeat yourself what you've already said but I'm just wondering if if you could perhaps give us a best-case scenario moving forward best-case scenario moving forward is is our politicians and our administration fixing our issue very quickly I mean that is the the best case if it could be today that would be great that's best case for us anyone else wishing to respond to that same question I just wanted to make a comment I think another critical factor we've got to keep in mind is we can't let government trade officials determine product specs so we've talked a lot about tariffs exclusions quotas but the real alarming thing for me is if we end up having a trade of official overrule a company and say adequacy of a product spec it's our pipelines are specifically speaking for planes it's our assets we're responsible for them we're held accountable for them and we will operate them for decades and decades so I think it's a key factor that we got to keep in mind thank you yeah I I agree very much here we've asked our primary mill to give us steel 20 to 50,000 tons of specific specifications they won't charge us extra to give us a trial order to wreak wala fie we got a qualified take six months to two years to to qualify and right now we respect that for a German mill if we can't compete with Germany a high-cost country we've got a problem in this country and it was probably technical it's not people it's technical it's been putting in the right equipment to run the right products so and this is a cliff we're being tariffed we are supply chains six months if we don't order now for December or January we don't have it so we're betting on the future what is the future we have no idea it's really a tariff that is very very painful mr. sensor one of the ideas that we came up with through this whole process which would be probably the next best scenario for us to support the government's initiative is to source all the stainless steel strip from the US and ship it to Korea for processing but unfortunately that type of system still falls under the same HTS code and the same quota system as we have today although we're supporting the initiative we still get no good outcome for micro so virtually that the highly specialized aspects of the product are is the complicating factor is that accurate correct and I think it's important to note that the mere number of requests for exclusions certainly speaks to the complexity of this entire issue so that I just want to say that I hope we can get this resolved sooner rather than later thank you I'll yield back Thank You mr. Smith before I close I wanted to ask mr. Houseman a question or two so I asked each of the other gentlemen how many employees they had how many employees does the United Steel Workers Union employ

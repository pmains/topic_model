I'll ask you directly here do you share senator Warner's concerns that the president might sneakily fire the special consult counsel during the holidays well absolutely you know mr. Muller was director of the FBI he was US Attorney in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in California a very popular and widely heralded law enforcement official who was he who is a registered Republican was appointed by another Republican mr. Rosen Stein who is also rear DOJ official a US attorney appointed by President Bush and he was appointed by attorney general Steffan so you have a series of Republican prosecutors and now there's this smear campaign against Muller and his investigation why well it's obviously because of the Flynn guilty plea and the Papadopoulos guilty plea and the manna ford indictment and so on they're doing their job and suddenly there's this huge campaign to try to discredit and undermine them and the speculation is right here on Capitol Hill that there are people within the White House who are moving to try to get rid of him now it under the under statute it would require an action of the Attorney General and the special counsel can be removed only for misconduct dereliction of duty conflict of interest or incapacity so you'd have to show that there's some real good reason to get rid of him take a stand we heard the Deputy Attorney General say last week he saw no cause to fire him Warner went on to say that firing Moeller could provoke a constitutional crisis you hear that often from from Democratic lawmakers what does that really mean well I mean I think what we call a constitutional crisis is really a political crisis that implicates some of the extraordinary measures of the Constitution and I do think that a lot of members have been on the verge of pushing for impeachment in the House of Representatives I think that if the president engineered a series of moves to remove mr. Muller and destroyed the Special Counsel investigation that you would see a stampede towards impeachment and so the crisis a political crisis if the president finds additional remedy you're saying if the president fired Bob Muller you would push for impeachment and many of your colleagues would push for impeachment well I think it would be a clearly impeachable offense because it would constitute obstruction of justice the same kind of obstruction he fired FBI director Comey after Comey refused to drop the investigation into National Security Adviser Flynn and refused to essentially take a personal loyalty oath to President Trump so you know the evidence of obstruction of justice deliberate interference with this investigation is mounting and I think that that would clearly be the straw that breaks the camel's back let me ask you this I imagine you have a lot of private conversations with your Republican colleagues both on the Judiciary Committee but but elsewhere on the hill do any Republican colleagues say to you in private that they're concerned and that they would be outraged if the president were to fire the special counsel well unfortunately I heard more of that you know back in the summer and the spring where people were saying well look you know if he did something really extreme like try to fire the special counsel then we could see taking a stand there and we saw a lot more effort by the Republicans to to tell the president don't do that now the goalposts and moved you know we've got colleagues like Trent Franks who resigned from Congress because of his Handmaid's Tale scandal in his office but he took the position that the president should fire mr. Muller he openly said it so did mr. gates from Florida he's aging the president on urging him to fire the special counsel so we're alarmed that so many of the Republicans appear to be in this kind of attack mode and smear campaign against the special counsel and what they're doing is they're throwing all kinds of spaghetti up against the wall so first it was the text they found some texts from an FBI agent who've been removed from the investigation by Muller back in the summer but they dig these texts out they leak them under the most suspect in mysterious circumstances and then try to create some mythical b√°ez in the whole investigation then they moved on to some emails that they said were illegally obtained that was ridiculous and so every day they're coming out with a new attack on the special counsel in the FBI well you mentioned those emails your committee holding a closed-door interview with the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe tomorrow house Intel committee of course did the same earlier this week it was 8 hours long what more are you hoping to learn from him during that testimony well this closed-door hearing that we'll be in tomorrow was called not by the Democrats on the committee as far as I know we weren't consulted at all it's a letter that I saw was coming from the chairman the republican chairs of the Oversight and Judiciary Committees so you know this to me also looks like it's part of this bizarre and orchestrated campaign to discredit and undermine anybody who's got anything to do with the investigation and the FBI and apparently the attack on McCabe is that he is married to a woman who is an active Democratic politician in Virginia big deal there are lots of people in the FBI in the US Attorney's Office in DOJ who were married two people were involved in politics and there's no rule against that indeed there a lot of mixed party marriages in DC congressman Raskin thanks very much for taking

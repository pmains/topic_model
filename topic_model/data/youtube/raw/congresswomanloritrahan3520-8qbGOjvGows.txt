thank you madam speaker standing here today four weeks after the Supreme Court's disastrous decision to overturn Roe I fear for the future for my children I fear for a future where Republican leaders agree with Clarence Thomas that the right for same-sex marriage should be Revisited that the right to birth control should be re-examined let me be clear neither of those rights should be up for debate we voted this week to protect marriage equality we'll vote today to protect contraception and for those who believe this issue isn't on the minds of millions of Americans open your eyes Republicans in Idaho and Louisiana are pushing to ban forms of birth control the governor of Mississippi refused to rule out a contraception ban even the Republican study committee which represents most House Republicans has proposed eliminating contraception access programs for low-income Americans that's not pro-life it's anti-woman wake up already and join us in passing this critical legislation thank you

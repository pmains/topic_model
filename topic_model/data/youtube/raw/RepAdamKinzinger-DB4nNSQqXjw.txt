we'll go to representative adam kinzinger of illinois next thank you mr chairman mr secretary thank you for being here um i know it's a little bit going on out there and i appreciate your time uh just quick thing on the jcpoa has been discussed i think it is worth noting there are provisions of the jcpoa that would be expiring now had we stayed in it and uh i think it's important when we talk about the future in foreign policy time like 10 years actually is pretty quick and and so that once i want to pivot a little to ukraine from that perspective first off i want to say thank you to the administration for changing your tone i think it's become clear over the next few weeks that the administration is clear-eyed about the seriousness of this threat i was concerned with some of the uh some of the wording early on but uh it does appear as we've doubled down our commitment i mean it's very clear to me that ukraine and i think you've said this too sir ukraine is fighting for all of us uh they happen we have to arm them because they are fighting for all of us and i think it's important for people to remember if ukraine falls and i think we're doing the right thing by stressing our commitment to nato territory and i actually really do believe that if vladimir putin moves in on nato territory he would be met with a devastating response but i think it's important for people to remember there's a lot of real estate still that's not in ukraine that's not part of nato and that's why it's important right now for us to make sure that vladimir putin can go no further and i hope he loses some of his occupied territories just a couple of legitimate questions that i want to know the answer to believe it or not i want to ask first off about a month ago it was reported that there might have been the use of chemical weapons in ukraine i wondered if you had an update on that in terms of what we know thank you and some of this may be more appropriate to take on in a in a different sense but having said that this is something we're looking at very very carefully i don't believe that we've been able to verify uh the that use but uh i want to come back to you uh there are different kinds of chemical agents uh that that could be in play including uh riot control agents that would be uh prohibited that kind of thing but in terms of the use of a chemical weapon um i think what i can say here is that we've not yet verified the use but it's something that we're very very much focused on thank you uh next question is the use of uh you know for american aid to the extent we can answer this in this setting um what is the prohibition what is the reason for not basically flying american aid directly into ukraine versus through proxies is an international law issue is it a safety issue is it infrastructure i'm curious if you can answer that i think first the most important thing is the aid is getting in getting in in record time it used to be for example under presidential drawdowns it would often be weeks between the time the president made a drawdown decision and the aid got into the hands of those who needed it i was just there as you know including at the staging site for where some of this aid is getting in uh and it's down to in some cases 72 hours that's how rapidly it's getting in so i don't think we have an issue right now with um the assistance not only being provided but actually getting to where it needs to get once it gets to the border and it's handed over to the ukrainians they're the ones of course who are getting it where it needs to go they know this a lot better uh than we do and they've been extremely effective in making sure that uh these supplies could get uh where it needs to get and let me ask you about the the air force side of things um one of the i believe one of the programs we used to do through the air national guard i remember the air national guard uh we would pair with ukrainian air force we do fake fights train each other we train them to fly has there been any consideration to restoring those programs bringing ukrainian pilots potentially to american air force bases to learn to fly because i mean yes it takes a long time to train a pilot it does um because we're so good but uh it takes a long time to train a pilot but there's no time like now to start so i wanted to ask you about that um i agree with it with the general proposition and indeed we're we are moving forward on on training because here's one of the challenges um the some of the systems that the ukrainians would like to have uh that could be effective in repelling the russian aggression and defending the country are systems that they're not trained on and it does take some time uh the pentagon and i think secretary austin referred to this the other day uh is engaged uh in some training so are other allies and partners in europe i can't address that specific program the pentagon would have to address that but generically yes we're engaged in training and i'll just say to to wrap up i think you know it takes a lot to change an army from warsaw warsaw equipment basically to nato equipment i think with what we're seeing with our allies and donating some of the old soviet equipment is actually helping to accelerate that process to switch over to nato standards so thank you mr secretary and i'll yield back

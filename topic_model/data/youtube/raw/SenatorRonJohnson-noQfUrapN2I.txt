wisconsin's two united states senators democrat tammy baldwin and republican ron johnson put out a joint statement senator johnson's participation in that statement has drawn criticism from many of us on the right i've had an opportunity this afternoon to talk off the air with senator john said about his statement i'm going to read it in its entirety it's not that long on saturday u.s senators tammy baldwin d wisconsin and ron johnson r wisconsin issued the following statement quote it has come to our attention that outside individuals or groups may attempt to exploit the tragedy that occurred last sunday in waukesha for their own political purposes as the u s senators representing wisconsin one from each political party we are asking anyone considering such actions to cease and desist we have full confidence in the local officials who responded with extraordinary professionalism competence integrity and compassion they have many difficult duties to perform in the coming days weeks and months and they should be allowed afforded the right respect and support they deserve to undertake their responsibilities without outside interference the top priority is to begin the healing process with waukesha by providing comfort and support to surviving family members of the deceased and those injured both in body and spirit they must also conduct a thorough investigation and afford the accused full due process they will not be these will not be easy tasks and will be made even more difficult if conducted within a politically charged atmosphere we ask everyone to demonstrate their interest and concern by praying for the victims the families and the entire community of waukesha the waukesha community foundation and united way of greater milwaukee and waukesha county have also established the united for waukesha community fund for those who wish to provide financial support for the victims that was a statement at best the statement was comes clumsily worded at best at worst it's a load of crap i had concerns about the statement as have many other conservatives who feel as though that this was a signal that we're supposed to keep our mouths shut about this situation and not draw attention to all of the reasons why this mass murder in waukesha occurred senator johnson has assured me that that was not his intention it is his position that he had been hearing noise that there were going to be all sorts of outside groups intending to come into waukesha to raise trouble people from the left and people from the right marching on the streets and so on and that he was afraid that there would be even more hell in waukesha and he wanted to avoid that he said says he certainly was not telling people not to politicize the event and acknowledged he politicized the event he went on national tv within two days of the waukesha mass murder and drew attention to what happens when you have no bail or low bail policies since he himself has commented on this he says this was not an attempt to prevent people on the right from commenting on this issue it was to stop action by extremists who intended to come into the community and take physical action as i said to him well that's fine but that's not what your statement said nonetheless he put it out and he put it out because he believes look you've got a community that is distraught right now and he was trying to spare them more grief by every tom dick and goofball deciding that they're going to come into waukesha and raise more hell well certainly i agree with that people shouldn't be coming into waukesha to raise more hell so i disagree with senator johnson's wording on this but he has assured me that he is not trying to hamstring those of us who want to speak out on these issues and it certainly is fair to say that senator johnson is the least hamstrung senator in the entire united states senate he has been eviscerated by the left by his unwillingness to play by their rules on issue after issue after issue after issue after issue nonetheless that thing is hanging out there and it has been the subject of some criticism by people who believe that if we can't draw attention to what happens when you have one political party right now the democrats advocating for a change in bail policies to eliminate cash bail then how do we ever try to communicate to people what a terrible idea that is if we don't draw attention to what happens when we move toward almost no cash bail which is what this suspect had or draw attention to an individual with a remarkably checkered history of breaking the law again and again and again and again and again and again and again yet numerous judges court commissioners prosecutors and so on refusing to take any action that would result in him being incarcerated for any period of time we need to be able to use situations like this so that people learn what happens when the people that are supposed to be running our legal system betray us by looking out for crooks leaving innocent parade goers to be slaughtered now there's a very very thought-provoking piece that appeared appeared in several places but i believe it was originally on the blaze written by jason whitlock some of you are familiar with him he talks about sports and other issues commentator pundit he's on tv he's a columnist and so on i'm going to read whitlock's column wisconsin's u.s senators tammy baldwin and ron johnson released a joint statement saturday asking outside groups to stop exploiting the waukesha massacre for political purposes quote has come to our attention that outside individuals or groups may attempt to exploit the tragedy that occurred last sunday in waukesha for their own political purposes the letter stated as the u s senators representing wisconsin one from each political party we are asking anyone considering such action to cease and desist now let me interject this is me and not whitlock one of the problems of that sentence is the use of the term outside individuals that's very unclear is an outside individual some extremist group based in alabama or is it outside individual me is an outside individual some wisconsin resident who wants to comment on the issue again it was unclear now senator johnson to me has made it clear he wasn't referring to people like me he wasn't referring to people like you he was referring to people who have no real stake in the issue at all coming from way far away to cause actual direct action but again his statement was unclear on that and that's one of the things that draws the criticism here of jason whitlock now this goes back now to whitlock's column i resume whitlock according to media reports the statement was crafted because some conservative pundits blasted cnn msnbc and other left-leaning media outlets for downplaying the story and are rapidly moving on from it the bipartisan statement is as pointless as asking infamous bank robber john dillinger to stop using a colt 32 pistol the style of gun didn't make dillinger an unrepented criminal his immorality did america's fight for political power has descended to a seemingly unprecedented level of immorality ambitious politicians quickly turned human tragedy into political capital the baldwin johnson statement is not only pointless it is clueless it epitomizes the kind of cowardly leadership pervasive in american politics the statement is a virtue signal that pretends diplomacy is the antidote for wickedness that peace is possible with people who have no regard for objective truths why should waukesha be exempt from the political examination lens applied to everything else would ignoring the political implications of the alleged crimes of daryl e brooks jumpstart the cleansing of american politics i think just the opposite failing to fully publicly explore and explain what drove brooks to commit mass murder would only allow the evil to further metastasize declining to contrast corporate media's handling of the waukesha massacre with charlottesville january 6 and the written house trial provides unwarranted and unhealthy cover to the racist sowing american anarchy and division the alleged sins and radicalization of daryl brooks must be scrutinized thoroughly aggressively and publicly this isn't about settling a score between conservatives and liberals it is about assessing the cost of mainstreaming and normalizing critical race theory and gangster rap culture across our primary communication and information platforms daryl brooks appears to be a direct reflection of what the american zeitgeist says a black man should be angry emotional profane violent racist and criminal a racist would argue that brooks was born this way a liberal would argue that poverty and anti-black racism molded brooks into a monster having been born black and poor in america i would argue that the zeitgeist has maintained a culture that rewards black men for exhibiting emotion anger violence profanity racism and criminality corporate media hollywood the music industry and social media apps are the maintainers of this intentionally crippling culture it's why left leaning news platforms hollywood movies commercial rap music twitter instagram and facebook smear any black men who criticize the self-destructive tenets of quote black culture as and then he uses a term that's often applied to blacks where considered sellout i'm not going to use it it's a word that starts with c and it's short for it's a slang term for an animal i think you know which one i'm referring to here i'm not going to use it but i also don't want to not point out what whitlock has written and he says that term is applied often to people like him african-americans who reject the narrative from the popular culture then the other term he says that is often applied to people like him uncle toms and sellouts is there a particular political party in bed with cnn msnbc the new york times hollywood the rap music industry in big tech is there a political is there a particular political party that believes its ideology defines blackness the waukesha massacre needs to be politicized the racist political strategy of the democratic party helped radicalize daryl brooks the democrats told black people a government check could replace the black father the democrats tell black people the matriarchy is better than the patriarchy the democrats tell black people to see themselves as perpetual victims of an irredeemably racist country rather than as conquerors of america's sids the democrats tell black people to abandon our religious beliefs in pursuit of political power the democrats convince black people that obedience to barack obama could do more for us than obedience to god the democrats tell us to treat skin color and sexual preference as idols more important than our identity in christ brooks's social media posts read like a black lives matter diary he hated the police he called for violence against white people he praised hitler he bragged about being a pimp as a rapper under the name math boy fly he promoted drug use and criminality you ain't democrat if you ain't daryl brooks it makes sense for corporate media and the other gatekeepers of quote black culture to bury the waukesha massacre they want to avoid accountability for what they created they can't explain why a black man mowing down and killing six white people in waukesha is less sinister and racist than a white man killing one white woman in charlottesville they can't explain their outrage and animus toward kyle rittenhouse but their indifference to daryl brooks they can't explain immediately casting everyone involved with january 6th as a white supremacist while searching for an additional proof of brooks's bigotry i get the reluctance of the gatekeepers to politicize the waukesha massacre i understand tammy baldwin's motivation too she's a democrat her party's entire strategy is predicated on racial deception hypocrisy and division ron johnson is a fool and a coward like most politicians he's unwilling to stand on truth initially he had no problem attacking the duplicity of the left as it related to waukesha he folded he foolishly thinks there's value in making peace with people who believe men can get me who believe men can get pregnant and men and women armed with flagpoles tried to overthrow the government there will be no peace until truth is restored a column written by jason whitlock very powerful and direct peace in which he says we need to confront 30 years of social culture in this america in america that has reinforced violence among black people that has created racial division he didn't really get into the no bail and low bail policies and so on or the butchering of his case by courts throughout wisconsin and even in other states he merely addresses the fact that speaking as a black man he deeply resents the characterization and caricature rather the characterization of black bed as violent emotional and reinforcing that they all ought to a hate white people and b act violently and act in an uncivil fashion he rejects that so he says when you see african-american men acting out according to that caricature you need to connect it to the culture that reinforces that behavior and he doesn't like it when a couple of politicians one democrat and one republican say that outside people should not exploit the situation for political purposes now as i say i spoke at length with senator johnson i don't believe in hit and run attacks i generally try to give people an opportunity to explain where they're coming from to to me and i accept senator johnson's explanation that he is was trying to stop people from outside the community coming in and raising hell and causing trouble rather than stop people from commenting on the issue and he made it clear he doesn't believe people should not commented the issue and he believes that the issues are very very important i want to focus on the need to focus on this issue but i also want to stay on that point with regard to the joint statement of senators johnson at baldwin let's go back little over a year to another incident in the state of wisconsin nobody died in that incident but somebody was shot was the shooting of jacob blake that wasn't a mass murder it wasn't a murder it wasn't even a homicide but it was a serious wounding but it wasn't a crime it was ruled by even one of the most liberal experts on policing in america the former police chief of madison noble ray to be justified police action it was ruled to be a legitimate action by the same district attorney that accused kyle written house of murder that's how clear-cut justifiable the shooting of jacob blake was ethan michael gravely and nobel ray believed that it was justified yet i didn't see tammy baldwin come out and encourage outside groups to not try to take advantage of the situation in fact it was just the opposite democrats like tammy baldwin piled on and condemned the shooting and created a situation in which kenosha became a riot zone i didn't see tammy baldwin's fellow democrat tony evers demanding that outside groups keep their mouths shut in fact tony evers couldn't even keep his mouth shut he took the fire that was kenosha and poured cans of gasoline on it by carrying on about the latest injustice to a black man when in fact there was no injustice a rapist an accused rapist trying to kidnap children and defying police orders including moving through a taser while grabbing for a knife was trying to drive off with those children in a stolen car that's when he was shot that's what the feds were the facts of that case yet there was as far as i could tell anybody on the left that was demanding outside groups stay out of kenosha and not cause any trouble in kenosha where were the democrats demanding calm and restraint after charlottesville just the opposite they blamed it on donald trump where were the demands for calm after january 6th you could go on and on and draw attention to that where were the democrats who tried to tamp things down in minneapolis after george floyd where are the democrats trying to even stop the insurrection in seattle portland and san francisco were the democratic leaders that were trying to stop the insurrection that went on in chicago i'm sure at some point a police officer is going to shoot an african-american in the united states sometime soon somebody's going to be breaking the law and some police officers going to be shooting it probably will be justified maybe it won't be don't oh it's inevitable that these things will continue will senator baldwin demand that outside groups not use this for their political purposes i don't think so so her agreeing to this statement is filled with hypocrisy i would certainly hope that senator johnson would remind democrats who demagogue over legitimate police actions or other instances of behavior that at best might be close calls or even wrong that they shouldn't be opportunities for people to burn cities down now i'll point out that in the wake of the waukesha mass murder there hasn't been any rioting by any of us on the right there haven't been any white people burning down the courthouses in milwaukee or waukesha to make the people who empowered and liberated daryl brooks again and again and again pay for their actions none of that has occurred people have simply been sad people like me have tried to use this issue to draw attention to the toxic political beliefs of a criminal justice system that believes violent people should be held on virtually not virtually no or actually no bail or a criminal justice system like the one in milwaukee county they put a higher priority on keeping people out of court because somebody might sneeze and get covered that in bringing criminal cases to trial leaving dangerous criminals out free on bail for years these are not only legitimate things to talk about these are things that have to be talked about in a free society so again i think senator johnson's statement with senator baldwin was to be charitable to senator johnson clumsily worded senator johnson says the way it's interpreted is not what he intended well often i say things that are misinterpreted and i contend that you have to go by what i say not how some idiot misconstrues my statement and senator johnson's demanding the same courtesy and again he does not say in here that we shouldn't be commenting on the issue the problem was is that the statement to me was so unclear and muddled that it was very hard to tell who it was that senator johnson was saying to cease and desist he says he was referring to outside groups who wanted to come in and to take direct action and he wasn't trying to stop those of us who have strong political viewpoints from keeping our mouth shut one of the things that was surprising about it is if ever there was a politician in the united states who shoots off his mouth when all the lefties are telling him to shut up it's ron johnson they've been telling him and hushing him up with regard to kovan they've been telling him to hush up and shut up with regard to hunter biden and the situation in ukraine they've been telling him to hush up and shut up with regard to the fbi and hillary clinton they've been telling him to hush up and shut up about the fisa court warrants there's any number of issues in which senator johnson has refused to hush up and shut up so i take him at his word that he wasn't trying to tell the rest of us to hush up and shut up but i can certainly understand why some people felt that way all right to move aside from whatever it was that senator johnson meant in fact before i completely move aside from that senator johnson has written a piece for the same outlet that jason whitlock's column appeared in and clearly the piece was written by [Music] senator johnson in an attempt to clarify what his intent actually was i i think so you can hear senator johnson in his own words on this i'm going to read that here and share that with the audience so let's do that and take a break and after that i'm going to expand on some commentary on what is going on in america in any event as i say senator johnson is attempting in a column that he submitted to the blaze to clarify the remarks that have upset some conservatives and again i think it's probably true that his statement is being misinterpreted but part of the reason it's being misinterpreted is it was clumsily worded and it was so non-specific as to be taken in the way that some people have taken it so let's get to that just a moment here it's 3 40 at newstalk 11 30 wi has submitted a piece to the blaze the publication that ran the online column from jason whitlock that you heard me read it's not that long i'll read it to you and again clearly it's being written because senator johnson believes that some of his comments have been misconstrued when i told his office that i wanted to talk to him he got on the phone today he said he knows exactly what my concerns are because i've been hearing it from a lot of conservatives and he agrees with the concerns he simply doesn't believe that his meaning is the way it's being characterized anyway this is what he wrote on sunday november 21st 2021 a christmas parade intended to initiate a season of peace on earth good will toward men turned into a nightmare and slaughter of innocents families with their children who came to see santa claus high school bands of the dancing grannies instead witnessed the horror that will leave a lifelong psychological scar first responders in law enforcement who rushed to administer first aid and compassionately deal with the broken bodies and broken spirits will also be scarred for life the healing process began immediately as the citizens of waukesha came together to help the victims and survivors monday evening hundreds of people attended an interfaith prayer vigil to pray for healing and strength i had the privilege of attending that vigil and speaking to members of the community first responders and those who and those who knew the victims it was a moving experience that i will never forget sorrowful and yet helpful i attended the prayer vigil to offer my sincere condolences and offer whatever help i could knowing that except for providing medical and spiritual healing there was not much anyone else could do on friday i received a call from one of the individuals i spoke to on monday evening there was growing concern that outside individuals or groups from the more radical and for the more radical end of both sides of the political spectrum might come to waukesha as agitators and stir up trouble potentially leading to violence after what wisconsin experienced in kenosha this was not a concern to take lightly i was asking if there was anything i could do to help dissuade that kind of disruption i spoke to others about writing and issuing a bipartisan release and they agreed it would be helpful so i reached out to senator baldwin to see if she would join me in issuing it after reviewing it and suggesting a small edit she agreed to join and we issued the release on saturday i certainly felt that officials in waukesha had enough to deal with and the last thing they needed was protests that could result in violence and further suffering to date fortunately no agitators have shown up to so chaos and city officials have been able to continue fulfilling their responsibilities without interference if our bipartisan appeal helped dissuade harmful and violent activity i would consider it a small victory during a time of such division unfortunately our bipartisan appeal has been misinterpreted misconstrued and criticized some conservative voices have inaccurately portrayed it as denying the reality that the homicides in waukesha could have been avoided were it not for low bail policies or that they must have been or they that they must have been politically motivated the joint release was not denying reality in fact the release called for a thorough investigation full due process prosecution and punishment to the full extent of the law in addition during numerous media appearances shortly after i said the homicides and assaults never should have happened and that the catch and release policies of the political left were resulting in more crime and greater violence somehow those statements of mine were overlooked by some who are justifiably outraged by the bias in the media and the glaring disparity in the coverage of violence depending on which side of the political spectrum the perpetrators may come from i share those concerns regarding blatant media bias and the grossly unfair reporting by the leftist mainstream and social media but if we are to succeed in defeating them and saving our country from their destructive policies we do need to resist the reflexive tendency toward infighting at a minimum reach out before assuming and conveying the worse well i did reach out to senator johnson and he assured me where he was coming from on those issues

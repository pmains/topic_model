here to join us member of the House Judiciary Committee from Wisconsin Congressman Scott Fitzgerald uh Congressman your thoughts when you see the number up to that point it's shocking and disappointing at the same time uh you know a lot of us that that ran last time talked a lot about uh just how much money was being associated with uh covet and and the amount of spending that Congress is doing in and around that and uh it hasn't stopped uh so if there's anything to focus on in the upcoming November elections it would be to flip the house and hopefully get the U.S Senate back to uh first of all stop the spending just stop the spending overall so that we can figure out exactly kind of what the next move is but I'm telling you right now I'm very alarmed because there's already discussions and rumors of discussions about more spending happening in a lame duck session in Congress so uh you know I I don't think we're out of the woods by any means and I think that number is going to continue to climb as long as Democrats are in full control Congressman do you think that Republicans are on track to do what they need to do in the midterm elections to be able to stop this spending um if you could see in your crystal ball what what is your gut well it's become one more item that all of our Challenger candidates certainly are talking about out on the campaign Trail is to once again stop the spending wrap our arms around kind of what the issue is and then in the upcoming Congress uh try and approach it with kind of a uh a fiscally conservative type of approach I you know I'm not sure what that is exactly as we sit here right now here today but the spending has to stop that that's clearly the problem that's that's adding to this overall 31 trillion dollar debt yeah and and to put it in perspective for people the all the the gross domestic product all the goods and services the value of all those in a year is 25 trillion it's not even a up to 31 trillion and and percentage-wise we didn't have this higher debt during World War II so that's how much spending we're talking about um the last time we saw a balanced budget Congressman was back when you had Congress was in the majority the Republicans were in a majority in Congress and then you had a Democratic president is there any way that could happen again oh I would think that there's 12 appropriation bills that are going to be rolled out if the Republicans uh have control of the house and and hopefully the Senate is well I mean that's the leverage point right uh if Congress can say to the administration no more spending we're not going along with it uh that that would clearly I think send the message that you're not going to get away with these huge packages you're not going to be able to roll them out because the votes aren't going to be there anymore I I think that's truly where we can make a difference on those Appropriations yeah uh Congressman uh speaking of making a difference I want to turn now to the National teachers union earlier this year you introduced a bill to pull the national teachers union for pushing woke ideologies now there is a new bill in the Senate that Echoes your initial push give us a little more detail on this and where it stands yeah I was very pleased to see that uh Senator Marsha Blackburn was was taking up this initiative as well uh quite honestly I was shocked to see that the national teachers union was being treated with kid gloves for many many years here in the U.S as uh and put up on a pedestal as some type of of organization that was clearly there for the kids on a regular basis we found out very quickly and I saw this in the state of Wisconsin that the teachers union was absolutely a politically organized group that was continually weighing in on the elections and helping to elect Democrats period that's what it's all about uh and and the reason that they have uh been uh kind of I think criticized as of late is uh clearly some of the things we saw in judiciary where the national teachers union was working directly with the administration to uh then put pressure on doj to start digging in to some of these parents that started to show up at school board meetings it's outrageous what was going on and the Judiciary Committee has been uh kind of the tip of the spear in exposing this and rolling out the idea that this is not only outrageous but but clearly something that should never happen in this country yeah people should be able to show up at their local school board and voice their opinion and not worry about retribution from Merrick Garland and the doj yeah and uh and this all this all kind of works in concert with each other all right you're in Wisconsin so I did want to talk to you about something else people should be able to do go to a Christmas parade and and not end up dead unfortunately Daryl Brooks Jr is on trial right now accused of driving his SUV into a Christmas parade in Waukesha last year uh now representing himself in court here's a little bit of what happened in the courtroom these are not questions this court is obligated and say that I am sovereign all right you believe your Sovereign the record is corrected I don't understand all right claim to not understand and that's been made very clear you're not going to get me to consent because I don't take this as a game that you have yet to answer one question that I've asked you essentially kind of out of control there Congressman your thoughts yeah uh what Daryl Brooks Jr is trying to do is uh turn this into a circus uh listen I'd known judge Darrow she's been at the bench in Waukesha County for a number of years she's very tough she's fair and uh I think she knew what she was getting into here uh she did not delay in seeding the jury uh they have today off but they'll have opening statements tomorrow listen this psychopath is re-victimizing the city of Waukesha in Waukesha County with this trial I mean there has been basically gavel to gavel coverage so far on local news that's going to continue we're coming up on the anniversary of this event and uh and another Christmas parade and uh the people of Waukesha are strong the people are in the surrounding area have rallied around the city in the county um and and we'll get through this but it just proves again the failure of the system yes sir to have this guy once again break the law again and again and again and be let out I think Governor Evers has a responsibility in the in all of this in Wisconsin okay as uh as well as D.A Chisholm and and uh they're going to see this play out on on local TV on a daily basis now all right Congressman Scott Fitzgerald thanks so much for being with us thank you it's good to be with you

Arizona is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. Chairman I rise today didn't offer an amendment that seeks to redirect funds that would otherwise be spent on Department of Veterans Affairs bureaucrats and administrative expenses and puts those monies towards timely service for our veterans although this month this amendment is a dollar-for-dollar transfer within this bill which will result in a neutral impact on the bills budget Authority the amendment will actually decrease budget outlays for 2015 by 1 million dollars according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office the general admission administration account for the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded at 321 million five hundred and ninety one thousand dollars funds to this account can be spent on things that have nothing to do with administrating critical services for our veterans examples include things like receptions conferences uniforms and excessive travel for bureaucrats it is no secret that the VA like other federal agencies such as the GSA and the IRS has in recent years abused the trust of the American people in exorbitant amounts of money on conferences and travel expenses I think we all know that the VA has its share of problems in the past few years meanwhile wait times for claims processing and appeal process processing are horrendous most recent report put forth by the VA indicates there are more than 600,000 veterans claims pending with the VA even more troubling is the fact that 319,000 363 claims have been pending for more than 125 days many of our veterans are simply giving up there either giving up or trying to obtain the benefits they deserve or worse some of them are giving up on life altogether it is a travesty and this appalling trend must be reversed it is disheartening to me that such wasteful spending occurs while veterans are crying out for help it is distressing that it occurs why veterans while veterans are taking their own lives and it is truly disturbing that it occurs when we have veterans dying as they wait for care I appreciate the committee's hard work and its acknowledgement of the importance of reducing the backlog in this bill having said that I think we can do more and should focus on prioritizing funds funding for efforts will lead to timely or care for our nation's heroes as opposed to administrative expenses that is why i propose redirecting a mere 1% of the funds in the General Administration account away from the things like funding for conference expenses and bureaucrats and shifting those funds towards reducing the VA backlog it is unfair to say that all VA el VA employees and officials have abused the trust of the American people and the veterans that they mean meant to serve there are many within these this department who work tirelessly to get through their claims and streamline processes to those people I say thank you but our veterans and the American taxpayers are not pleased with the overall production level at the VA it is time to remember and act on the mission at hand serving our veterans who have given so much for this nation I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support passage of my common-sense amendment and with the Chairman I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back

right now the u.s. is facing some hot topics from the investigation of VA hospitals climate control and EPA regulations to the Bergdahl Taliban trade lawmakers nationwide are scrambling for a fix live in our studio this morning from the six district that congressman bill Cassidy thanks so much for joining us recently thank you we were just talking about your sauna they're in Philadelphia Oh in Pennsylvania right it's in Tavania so let's get right and do it we're going to talk about the co-sponsored legislation that you did for the VA and you said that you recently applied at this legislation that was passed in order for veterans to receive care in the private sector in case they can't go to VA hospitals recently Overton Brooks was looked into and said they're gonna be in for further review because of the wait times for veteran so what's your response on that I think any time you give the patient the power things work better and so if the patient in this case of veteran is locked into one system and no matter how long the wait times he cannot go anyplace else the system will not respond as quickly as oh my gosh the veteran has the power and he can go someplace else if it's taken if it takes too long to get his condition address the veteran the power the system serves better and given the vet from the power in this case is allowing the veteran to go someplace else should their needs not be met in a timely fashion and you co-sponsored this bill i believe the veterans access access to care act 2014 yes absolutely okay so what's the 12 EP a regulations you spoke out against this one this is one that a president obama is receiving a little bit of flack for it well you've received a lot of flak for their attempt to cut down carbon emissions but you believe that the regulations are a little bit too tough first let's say that there's that the EPA secretary or administrator has admitted that this will not affect climate mm-hmm so even though we're going to penalize companies that do that it will not affect the climate but what it will affect is your job and your utility bill right now we're having a very hard time creating jobs for folks who who kind of work in the manufacturing sector and yet here we're going to is there cost of businesses which hire them and raise their costs at home where they pay the utility bill if the president wants to change the climate do something to change the climate not something which punishes working Americans okay and moving over to the broker called exchange for five Taliban prisoners you recently spoke out about that president obama a lot of people said on democrats and republicans vote saying that he overstepped his boundaries here he's he's supposed to acknowledge congress within 30 days that wasn't given any notice your response to that the president appears to have broken the law the law clearly says he has to execute the law and the law was that he was to notify Congress 30 days prior to releasing people from guantanamo bay he did not now we can find out the other things about surgeon bar search sergeant Bergdahl's disappearance and all that down the pike but what appears to be the case now is that the president broke the law now any time you undermine the Americans general faith and whether or not the president is acting the law it hurts their faith in government it hurts their belief that the government will do anything correctly so I think the ramifications of this are further than just the president disrespecting Congress alright thanks so much our congressman Cassidy I know yet and jump on a plane back to DC to handle some more matters um thank you thank you for having me

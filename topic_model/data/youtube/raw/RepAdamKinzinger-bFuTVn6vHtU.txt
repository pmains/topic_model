  TIME. THE GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI  IS RECOGNIZED. MR. THOMPSON: MADAM SPEAKER, I  YIELD THREE MINUTES TO THE  GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS,  MR. KINZINGER, A DISTINGUISHED  VETERAN OF THE AIR FORCE AND  MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS IS  RECOGNIZED FOR THREE MINUTES. MR. KINZINGER:  I THANK THE  GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING. MADAM SPEAKER, FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, DAN SCAVINO'S CAREER  IS DONALD TRUMP. SCAVINO WAS 16 WHEN THEY MET AND HE IS TILL THIS DAY A TRUMP  STALWART. HE WAS PART OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA  PROGRAM. HE WAS TWO YEARS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR COMMUNICATIONS. USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR  TREND WAS SCAVINO'S CORE  BUSINESS. HE DID THAT FOR TRUMP DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN AND HE KEPT DOING  IT THROUGH THE STOP THE STEAL  AND THE FRAUDULENT CHALLENGE TO  THE 2020 ELECTION. HE ALSO MONITORED EXTREMIST  SOCIAL MEDIA SITES FOR THE  PRESIDENT. DAN SCAVINO WAS WITH THE  PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 5 AND 6. HE SPOKE WITH TRUMP BY PHONE  SEVERAL TIMES ON JANUARY 6 AND  WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT AS MANY  URGED HIM TO HELP STOP THE  VIOLENCE AT THE CAPITOL. SO DAN SCAVINO COULD SHED LIGHT  ON WHAT THEN-PRESIDENT TRUMP  THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN ON JANUARY  6, ESPECIALLY THE POTENTIAL FOR  VIOLENCE. DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW THE RALLY COULD TURN VIOLENT? THAT HIS RHETORIC ON THE ELLIPSE COULD SEND AN ANGRY MOB TO STORM THE CAPITOL? THAT WHAT ON THE EVENING OF  JANUARY 5, PRESIDENT TRUMP  CALLED A FIRED UP CROWD MIGHT  TAKE IT LITERALLY WHEN THE NEXT  MORNING HE TOLD THEM TO FIGHT  HARD, THAT HE WAS POURING FUEL  ON THE FLAMES? DAN SCAVINO WAS THERE. SO IF HE WERE WILLING TO DO HIS  DUTY AS A CITIZEN, HE COULD TELL US A LOT ABOUT THAT, BUT  INSTEAD, HE'S CHOSEN TO STIFF  ARM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED SCAVINO  SOMETIMES HELPED SHAPE HIS  TWEETS. TRUMP RETWEETED A VIDEO THAT  URGED VIEWERS TO, QUOTE, FIGHT  FOR TRUMP. THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK WAS THEN  JUST 2 1/2 WEEKS AWAY. WHY DID DONALD TRUMP RETWEET  THAT PARTICULAR MESSAGE? DAN SCAVINO COULD GIVE US THE  INSIDE SCOOP. WHILE TRUMP AND THE STOP THE  STEAL GAG WAS TRYING TO STEAL  THE ELECTION FOR THEMSELVES,  PRESIDENT TRUMP RETWEETED AFTER  QUEUE NONE ALREADY HAD A VIDEO  ON HOW TO STEAL AN ELECTION. WHAT WOULD DAN SCAVINO SAY ABOUT WHY TRUMP REPEATED A QANON  BLESSED VIDEO ON HOW TO STEAL AN ELECTION? HE WON'T RISK TELLING US. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  EXTREMISTS ON THE DONALD AND  OTHER HARD RIGHT SITES URGING  HIM TO JOIN A WILD PROTEST ON  JANUARY 6? POSTS SHOW SOME TOOK IT AS  MARCHING ORDERS, IN FACT. DAN SCAVINO KNEW THEY WOULD. HE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT HIS BOSS  WANTED. HE KNEW SITES LIKE THE DONALD  ATTRACTED EXTREMISTS. SCAVINO SAID THAT A USER ON THAT SITE UNDERSTOOD AS LITERAL  MARCHING ORDERS OR LITERAL WAR  DRUMS. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DAN SCAVINO  HAD BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR  FOUR YEARS BY THEN. THEY KNEW THE JANUARY 6 CROWD  COULD TURN VIOLENT. THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE DAN  SCAVINO, A KEY WITNESS, IS  UNWILLING TO SPEAK WITH US. HE FAILED TO PRODUCE A SINGLE  DOCUMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE  SUBPOENA. AND HE'S CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED  HIS COMPLETE AND UTTER CONTEMPT  FOR CONGRESS. DAN SCAVINO'S BLATANT DISREGARD  FOR OUR SUBPOENA IS --  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED. MR. KINZINGER:  I YIELD BACK. THANK YOU. MR. THOMPSON: I YIELD THE  GENTLEMAN 30 SECONDS. MR. KINZINGER:  DAN SCAVINO'S  BLATANT DISREGARD FOR OUR  SUBPOENA IS TO ENSURE THAT THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE NEVER GET THE  FIRSTHAND STORY HE HAS TO TELL. NONE OF US SHOULD FIND

that representative Carson from the seventh congressional district for his remarks during the special order at this time thank you thank you to my dear colleague from Nevada congressman Horford also to my colleague from Brooklyn representative courser also chairwoman Marcia fudge of the CBC mr. speaker a special ed teacher contacted my office last month worried about cuts to food stamps and the impact that they would have on our classroom one of her sixth-grade students had burst into tears in the middle of her lesson because she heard on the news that benefits would be cut on November the first mr. speaker this teacher was compassionate enough to take the child concerns quite seriously she gave him a voice by contacting her office I rise today mr. speaker to be this child's voice the voice of all of those who live in the wealthiest nation on earth but still live and hunger mr. speaker if you look at the list of the most food insecure districts in the country you see populations of every race every ethnicity even in the state with delays food insecurity fifteen percent of families still struggle to find their next meal so what will I speak today as a member of the esteemed Congressional Black Caucus we stand with all Americans sadly my congressional district of the great hoosier state of Indiana holds the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the entire country over thirty percent families in Indianapolis struggle to put food on the table and don't always know where their next meal is coming from to be clear this is not a criticism of the local food banks or not the prophets that served for Briana who's yours take care of one another which is why we have some of the best service organizations in the entire country the sad lady even the best food base can't pull fold out of the dead air over the past few years mr. speaker apart from many Indiana food banks the donations are down as more people struggle to make ends meet in our economic downturn it with high unemployment and underemployment federal assistance simply is invited a food to meet their demand the shell just on as full as they used to be this leaves many low-income constituents to rely on snack also known as food stamps a program that will be cut by five billion dollars next year as Recovery Act provisions inspired even with ideal funding levels full steps never means a large multi-course meals for poor families the Irish person receives less than a dollar fifty per meal from any of these families mr. speaker a healthful meal it's already a luxury that remains out of reach the expanders just want to put food on the table the program means a few hundred dollars a month per family which is enough for some bread cereal canned food but rarely fresh vegetables for me no one gets rich off of a full steps but at least they can eat yet it for some reason program remains one of the prime targets and members of Congress who are now fighting the cut nearly four million people from this program this is unacceptable it has real-life implications fortunately at our district seven congressional dominio we have the indie hunger network but the university center for urban ecology the Indiana healthy weight initiative Indiana's family and social services administration ssa and the indie pooh council that are working with our local farmers markets to encourage people receiving assistance to reinvest in our local community and economy by matching the snap dollar spent on fresh fruits and vegetables these types of partnerships are not support it and we decide to cut benefits and eligibility we must invest in these types of creative initiatives programs that feed our community and incentivize healthy living programs that create jobs and rebuild our economy so that people are fed and healthy enough to go to school work and contribute to our economy some of my companies argue that our debt is out of control that we need to rein in spending and that every American should be asked to sacrifice equally but we have to put this thing into perspective your person who makes millions of dollars every year you might lose hundreds thousands of dollars maybe your own business might decide to invest little less but contrast if you make a metal wage and live under the poverty line here at the year with my you lose monetarily very little fifty dollars here one hundred dollars their small impact on our debt but that's small amount that few dollars here and there equates to food on the table when looking for so-called equitable treatment what has ever asking wealthy person to go hungry but that is exactly what some of my Republican colleagues are doing but their proposal to cut thirty nine billion dollars to staff they are suggesting that some Americans like those in poor neighborhoods in Indianapolis simply don't deserve to eat because it's too expensive of republicans argue that snap is only meant as a temporary stuff yet most people mr. speaker poverty isn't a temporary stuff on the way to prosperity it's a family but Ben was fortunate enough to pull itself out of harmony ten many years maybe even a decade unfortunately our recession pushed many families in the wrong direction costing jobs incomes and homes also moving people deeper into poverty this means more children who go to school on an empty stomach means more aging seniors already on a fixed income who are forced to choose between buying groceries medication means more power than not less in fact between 2007 2012 during the height Great Recession the number of food stamp users roles seventy-seven percent because more people needed them I'm standing here with mine brilliant and the speed colleagues representative forsberg representative Jeffries and the Congressional Black Caucus because our district for some of the hardest hit this isn't black issue mr. speaker this is a nationwide problem that impacts every color and ethnicity in every city county and town and yet some of our colleagues in this house were willing to ignore millions of their constituents will struggling to eat just passed a bill cut staff 37 billion dollars we should be increasing snap funding not decreasing it we should learn the lessons of European austerity measures we should be debating an extension of expiring provisions to avoid benefit reductions next year we should be focused on ending hunger in America not just by cutting program that might reduce the debt mr. speaker as I close many of us take for granted we can grab the sandwich and make a salad when we need to eat most people here most of us I know I will celebrate Thanksgiving next week tables full of good food some of the best food that money can buy but for many in America Thanksgiving is just another day spent in hunger with these people in traditional Thanksgiving meal simply outreach yet we believe that struggling families across the country would say that on Thanksgiving they are thankful for any amount of food that you can buy the food that snack helps them both instead of taking this away let's fight for a higher quality of life let's stand together to make sure our neighbors our children and our vulnerable seniors never go hungry thank you I yield back my time I'd like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Indiana

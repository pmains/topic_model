get the read from louisiana republican senator bill cassidy uh by the way how was how was the chat there was it was an amiable uh you know were there the questions the give-and-take would lead you to believe where she's headed we had a great chat but not about this bill uh i've read press reports that she wants to do away with the carried interest loophole and that she wants to do something about the minimum 15 tax on uh book tax if you will but that's what i've learned from you not what i can tell you so let's just take that then uh because apparently senator manchin has drawn a line in the sand on that carried interest part i'm not sure where he is on this corporate minimum tax but and it's ironic because it's 13 billion dollars but we know the folks behind it are the richest people in this country perhaps the world and everyone promises to tax them and never do do you think this there's a chance that this bill might not make it at all i sure hope it doesn't make it because all the reasons we've talked about yeah it actually increases inflation it doesn't decrease inflation those making less than 200 000 a year not the ultra wealthy but like you and me at least me i don't know about you charles we're going to be paying more in taxes according to the joint committee on taxation congressional budget office says it doesn't decrease inflation everything they're saying as best we can tell is not true i hope it doesn't pass you know what really bothers me and i'm still i honestly and perhaps you can help what turned senator manchin around i don't see anything in here i mean we're going to create an army of irs agents that are going to be trained on small businesses i mean someone from west virginia he should be the first one in line to guard against this in my mind well particularly the the the book tax if you will that's going to fall 50 percent on manufacturing now we're trying to bring manufacturing back from china we're trying to bring it back from mexico from india you name it congress has tried to incentivize this move back by giving okay you built here will give you a little bit of a tax break these corporations are doing what congress has encouraged them to do which is to build here not overseas and boom this bill stops that this bill says hey goodbye go back to china we've got a veterans bill we've got the chips bill and and maybe something comes out of this we're talking all of a sudden another trillion dollars and i thought we learned our lesson all of us even those folks who believed that modern monetary theory and free money was the best thing in the world i could see you believing it put it on a chalkboard put it in a book it sounds fair and reasonable we tried it in real life sir it did not work it's made everyone's life a lot more miserable and yet they're still going forward does this mean ideology comes before everything these days i think convenience comes before everything just take the idea that giving the irs so much more money is going to raise a net of 120 billion consistently cbo has called that a gimmick they say it doesn't work and yet this accounting relies heavily upon it i just want them to be honest with the american people pretty straightforward don't don't tell this through your headlines through your through the title of your bill don't tell mr what you're doing just be straight with the american people yeah i mean that's a doozy you're talking about some hoots but that title in this one i thought affordable care act went a little bit far but this one this takes the cake senator thank you very much appreciate it thanks charles all righty

this hearing is about saving lives not partisan politics we're here because organ procurement organizations called opos are trusted by the government and by the american people to honor the wishes of donors and save the lives of patients mr miller i want to talk to you about the conversion rate metric that opo's have used to report their work to the government this is a rate of how successful opo's are in transmitting those organs that have been available from eligible donors is that right sorry i took me a second uh congressman um in my time i'm not aware of the conversion rate obviously that's the current metrics in my time we've been focused on the new metrics so you can you don't understand the metrics that were in use until a couple weeks ago well there's they are unused what i'm saying is i don't have a deep understanding of them so really of how we measure whether or not we're saving lives or not no i'm not saying that i don't have a deep understanding is what i'm saying okay well let's prove how good your understanding is because you're compensated to do this job um the the way this works is um there is a numerator in the question in the conversion rate metric there's a numerator that's the number of donors from whom the opo actually recovers organs and then there's a denominator which is eligible deaths so let's say that opo a was able to get 60 organs out of 80 eligible deaths okay out of this this comes to 75 you following the math so far i'm following your math accomplishment great now let's say that opob was able to get 70 donors out of 100 eligible debts can you reduce this to a percentage for me 70 over 100 70 70 all right so under this conversion rate metric which has been in effect then it looks to me like this is the more successful opio opo they have a higher conversion rate they would be rated as more successful correct then in the prior rules a a standard definition of what counts as an eligible death it's my understanding no there has not and that is part of the good didn't want to count certain eligible deaths certain possible donors they didn't have to they could essentially define eligible debts for themselves is that correct that is my understanding and mr miller that means they might miss out on another 10 donors i mean this lpo went after 20 more people and as a result got 10 more donors but under this prior metric they look like they're performing worse why would you ever defend this kind of metric and i have not defended that metric mr miller i don't want to humiliate you today by reading your emails to my office into the record in which you argued against the new metric would you like to restate whether or not you lobbied for or against the new metric did you lobby against the new metric yes or no you were uh yes or no we lobbied for improvements to the new metrics we were not lobbying against the new metrics it was simply congressman you what you're saying is correct we we want common definitions you are you are completely correct and that is right so you want a common definition that's what the new rules deliver but you didn't like the new rules because you had other apparently other issues with it my point here is that you were defending a system in which opos you were operating under a system in which opob looks like they're much worse than opoa but in reality it could just be the case that opob is going after every possible donor regardless of race regardless of whether it's hard regardless of whether they might not get turned down regardless of whether or not it might be easy they are trying to honor the wish of every donor and save every life opla on the other hand billy had 80 eligible deaths because say maybe the ceo of that opio wanted to go on vacation and they took the opo's private jet which is supposed to be used for transporting organs and therefore that jet wasn't available to go pick up the organs from these other deaths could that have happened under this scenario that i'm not aware of congresswoman i can't respond to that specific allegation well that is that is an actual that literally happened an opio ceo went literally on vacation this is not a hypothetical story with the jet they literally jetted off to vacation and left donors who were unable to honor others with the gift of life and left patients to die because they weren't pursuing every possible every possible eligible death every possible donor that's what actually happened and you have fought the changes in these rules every step of the way we have the correspondence from our office and i would be happy to introduce it into the record mr wadsworth as an opo ceo would you say that these new metrics recently set into law are more accurate that they address the problem that i've identified here would yes and are these realistic metrics that an opo if they're doing their job could achieve absolutely yes and will these new metrics increase the number of organs transparent transplanted annually and encourage opioids to go after every possible organ to take every opportunity to honor what donors wanted and to help save patients lives absolutely which is why i think it's so important to expedite this and implement it right away in terms of the so glad you asked that mr wadsworth how quickly could you implement this new system we get to work right away right now tomorrow yeah absolutely that is so good to hear mr wattsworth because tomorrow somebody is at risk of dying in this country somebody will die in this country while they're waiting for an organ thousands of patients waiting on a life-saving organ cannot wait while the association of organ procurement organizations lobbies and and tries to stop rules and procedures just to make it simply clear whether an opo is doing the life-saving work of of retrieving organs and putting them into into patients in need thank you so much i yield back

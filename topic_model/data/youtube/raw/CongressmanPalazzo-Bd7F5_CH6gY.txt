thank you for being here today border security is absolutely national security thank you for protecting America keeping our trying to keep our community safe trying to stop the the flow of the drugs the human trafficking the gun trafficking the foreign nationals from coming into our country and so thank you thank you for doing your duty the majority of the American people appreciate you following the rule of law and trying to protect our communities States and in our nation you know I had another question I hope I get to it I'm a member of the Mississippi National Guard chairman of National Guard caucus and I think the National Guard might as you mentioned is is going to be a huge multiplying force for for your agency and for securing the border you know our national defense our active-duty military cannot do anything without our Guard and Reserve so they could they can but to sustain operations and so they're they're great for plug-and-play so be creative on how you use them don't just you know have them you know garden fences you know doing fire watch and things of that nature I participated in joint task force missions on the border in the 90s I'm doing just surveillance communications using our eyes and our ears and our brains and reporting back and so feeding you the data to you hopefully make Intel out of it so with that I'd like to jump into some quick questions CBP has two key missions securing the border and facilitating cross border commerce that powers the nation's economic growth and us CBP officers are the most important border security and trade facilitation and resources we have however to accomplish their mission CBP needs enough agents and officers to be able to screen cargo interdict illegal drugs and contraband and make arrests while moving legitimate commerce and passengers through our air land rail and sea ports of entry we have set through many of these hearings together and we know for a variety of reasons that the CBP officers are in short supply these days which has created a national security and economic vulnerability but this Congress must address CBP is critically understaffed and remains well below its congressionally mandated staffing level by about a thousand CBP officers in nearly 2000 Border Patrol agents so I'm curious if you've given any thought to potentially leveraging the private sector to alleviate some of the manpower shortages by allowing qualified private sector security screening experts to carry out day-to-day scanning and screening functions and image analysis which would free up your officers to concentrate on their law enforcement and oversight missions and I'll leave that open to whoever wants the answer I'll specifically answer that question and obviously happy to talk about many aspects of our hiring effort to get the right work force out there we have made progress last year we we hired almost 200 additional CBP officers and we expect to increase our performance this year through a number of efforts but in terms of your specific question how are we leveraging private sector assets for functions like effectively reviewing scans from non-intrusive inspection technology we're actually leveraging the private sector heavily in this area both to provide an ability to do an automated analysis of the the vast majority of scans that's that capabilities increasing due to artificial intelligence techniques but we've also been able to partner with industry and we're currently rolling out an integrated viewer that can combine images from a variety of different technologies produced by different manufacturers and present a consistent picture for our officers and analysts you're right it doesn't have to be an officer or an agent to review that technology it could be an expert hired for that specific purpose or contracted out in some cases to do a good analysis of that image that is absolutely something we're pursuing and we're gonna have if we have the appropriate specialties and our National Guard partners we've we've requested support and in some of those areas to help extend our capabilities as well well I'm instances the Secretary of Homeland Security yesterday that DHS actually has a research and experimental UAV facility at Camp Shelby which is our nation's largest National Guard training site in America and so you know this is one fight multiple agencies are gonna be participating you're obviously the lead agency but you know we've got the coast guard in South and Central America trying to interdict drugs and bad actors before they make it into Mexico into the drug and whatever that the highway that will you know because if it's still correct I mean if it makes it into Mexico it's going to make it into America I mean it's just the resources that they have or are huge and I'm just glad this president and this Congress in numeric people are supporting us and investing in in in your your agency invested in your resources which are your people and the equipment that you need to do your job and to be successful the American people are with you good luck and just let us know how we can continue to help you do your job thank you mr.

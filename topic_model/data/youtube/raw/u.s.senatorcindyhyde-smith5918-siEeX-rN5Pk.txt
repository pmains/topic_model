the people of mississippi and this great nation have every right to be frustrated with washington d.c today they face pandemic worries inflationary prices on everything a border under siege rising crime rates and omnimos international threats issues that should be at the forefront of the senate agenda instead the u.s senate is spending more time fighting fake hysteria banned by democrats to justify a federal takeover of our elections this bill just like the last four versions amounts to a cynical power grab and not a true effort to strengthen electoral integrity the failures and floundering that have characterized the first year of the biden administration is a result of the hyperpartisan my way or the highway approach embraced by the president and his allies true voting rights and election reform legislation should have strong bipartisan support to be fully embraced by the american people regarding the filibuster protecting the traditional rights of the minority party in the senate is equivalent to saving the institution and its role in our democratic government without the filibuster democrats could pass any notion from their endless radical agenda without true debate or compromise effectively silencing the millions of americans who live in republican states

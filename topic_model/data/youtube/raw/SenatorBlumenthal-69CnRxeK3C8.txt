my first bill entitled honoring all veterans has as its objective to leave no veteran behind it offers a comprehensive set of measures to assure that we keep faith with every veteran every veteran who needs a job every veteran who needs better health care or counseling or training or education these commitments we have made as a nation to all of our veterans and now we have the opportunity to keep those promises and keep faith with them as we have a solemn obligation to do every day every year not just veterans day i want to thank senator harkin of iowa for co-sponsoring the legislation that i've offered and also to thank senator tester chairman murray of the veterans committee and ranking member burr of that committee for their work to address these challenges recognized by the honoring all veterans act and this comprehensive measure vowed to hire heroes amendment truly we should vow to hire our heroes and we should do so not just in word but indeed not just in rhetoric but in action and i am proud to be a co-sponsor of the important tax credit provision in the tester veterans jobs amendment for businesses that hire veterans helping veterans is a challenge that will require the engagement of everyone in the community from congress to veteran service organizations and business leaders across the board across the country across the state of connecticut at a recent veterans hiring forum i hosted in connecticut i heard firsthand the challenges in veterans recruitment and what innovative companies like united rentals are doing to hire skilled and talented veterans in this symposium in that setting they provided an example of what we can and should do so i see my co-sponsorship of this amendment as honoring a commitment to push for legislation to provide incentives firms to hire unemployed veterans and to make it easier for companies to connect with veterans so they can fill some of the jobs that are now available there are jobs available and we should give our veterans the skills they need skills they may have acquired in part during their service that need to be honed and expanded and we have that opportunity and i want to thank all of those senators for championing this measure my own legislation honoring all veterans act allows a veteran to take the transition assistance program known as tap an interagency workshop coordinated by departments of defense labor and veterans affairs for up to one year after separation of any military facility the bill before us makes participation in the tap program mandatory low participation rates in this program are especially concerning as junior members tend to be those most in need of the services provided by tap and the benefits available through the va from many skills such as simple skills writing resumes or interviewing have never been needed or learned before and not having such skills not knowing how to interview or write a resume puts them at a severe disadvantage when they are attempting to enter and succeed in the workplace after they exchange their civilian their military uniforms for civilian clothes section 222 of the vow to hire veterans act authorizes an assessment of the equivalence between skills developed in military occupational specialties and qualifications required for civilian employment with the private sector i always like to say that when you call out the national guard you call out the best in america when you call out the connecticut national guard you call out truly the very best in america the military recruits the most talented men and women in america to serve and then invest heavily in those skills in their professional development yet when they enter the civilian world very often those skills are simply unrecognized by laws requiring separate training or licensure and we ought to do more to recognize the expertise and experience that the military gives to these brave men and women that's why i authorized and authored a similar provision in the honoring all veterans act to ensure that civilian employers and educational institutions recognize a veterans military training the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america reported and i'm quoting 61 percent of employers 61 percent do not believe they have a complete understanding of the qualifications ex-service members offer and recently separated service members with college degrees earned on average almost ten thousand dollars less than their non-veterans counterparts i applaud my colleagues for including section 222 in the vow to veterans act it is a vital step toward helping employers find the employees they need and toward closing the income gap that exists now the legislation before us also expands education and training opportunities for older veterans by providing a hundred thousand unemployed veterans of past errors and wars with up to one year of additional gi benefits to go toward education and training programs at community colleges and technical schools i'm proud of the bipartisan compromise to extend this period for one year i hope it would be even further broadened and extended but this measure is a great first start toward providing skills for job opportunities now exists and can be filled by men and women coming out of our military to civilian life let me just say finally again to come back to the montford point marines i want to thank senator pat roberts who was with me yesterday at the 236th birthday celebration and most especially thank the senator from north carolina kay hagan who is with us today for her leadership on this issue truly we can make this veterans day special for all of us in this nation if we approve this congressional gold medal to men who step forward to serve and fight when this nation failed to appreciate their service and valor and now we have the opportunity to make good on our commitments to them as veterans to all of our veterans in this measure i am proud to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle in nearing now the number that is necessary to approve that measure and i hope that we can reach that kind of bipartisan consensus on that legislation but also on the broader vow to hire heroes act that can lead us back to the kind of bipartisan approach on so many issues that we need to emulate in this body

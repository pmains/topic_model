uh thank you for being here so I appreciate it um you mentioned I want to get kind of real specific now and probably something that we can do some follow-up on you mentioned your testimony that oit is is an advocate for small business for all matters related to trade policy and trade agreements um and kind of this uh there's a situation I think that's starting to evolve and and it's uh some manufacturing that's happened in China is actually kind of making its way as a secondary product into a lot of American for the most part light manufacturing so I have a small business in my district glenroy Incorporated it's located in Menomonee Falls Wisconsin glenroy manufactures it's that real thin uh flexible packaging um it's it's tinfoil that that is part of pharmaceuticals when you made you know kind of get access to any any over-the-counter pharmaceutical for the most part but so in glenroy was recently informed by Department of Commerce that it is going to initiate an investigation into certain aluminum foil Imports that may have inputs from China uh even though they are produced in South Korea so I I would think that this you know this is a very specific I think example of something that we think is going on um a little bit more widespread than that so my point is there's got to be certain trade policies by the byte Administration that uh could be negatively affecting some of these small businesses because of the level of investigation and glenroy is a company it's only got 250 employees um but uh you know my my bigger question is kind of what has been the involvement and kind of uh the back channels on making sure that manufacturing going on in Asia and specifically China how is that how is that being tracked or what is the administration looking at when if they're going to launch these investigations how widespread are these and what do they look like I guess well Congressman respectfully is your question that we should be limiting the amount of uh China inputs into manufacturing or allowing them if well if there's going to be if if they're actually going to launch investigations or put some of these smaller size companies I think kind of through the ringer on this stuff what would be um kind of what is the position on that or has there been a position developed on these manufacturing processes because it seems to be happening quite often yeah thank you Congressman now I'm I'm personally not aware of um the degree to which we're investigating small businesses relative of to China inputs I'm happy to follow up with your office on that particular example and and what we might be able to uncover and more importantly where there are these types of processes I think it is our role to be able to provide information to small businesses so that they're aware of any of these Dynamics and can be advised as to how to either avoid the investigations that you're talking about or to advocate for themselves to continue to manufacture as they wish yeah and I think it it kind of adds another wrinkle to the whole supply chain issue that we're faced with right now is that I think oftentimes it's kind of thought as in I go back to light manufacturing because that's what my state is more directly involved in but it it um I think there's some challenges here that we could overcome if we'd be a little bit more upfront and and kind of work towards making sure that you know these smaller businesses understand what the what the guard rails are what the parameters are are instead of finding themselves with somebody mailing them a letter or contacting them directly and saying well we're going to start you know kind of digging through some of these things so it's something I wanted to put on your radar this morning and um certainly we'll be able to forward any of the materials on this Corporation in Menomonee Falls too I appreciate that and again the SBA typically is not uh in the investigation mode relative to sources of manufacturing but where that might occur from other pieces of the government again we want to make sure that we are informing small businesses for all the Dynamics relative to exporting and so this might be one that we add to our list of things to inform small businesses about very good thank you very much I yield back manager the gentleman yields

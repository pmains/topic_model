hey good afternoon everybody thanks for joining us in the next installment of our webinar uh workforce job fair series as you all know last year we held the first ever cd6 uh in-person job fair where we had over a thousand job seekers connect with over 60 employers we wanted to do that again this year but we can't because of the pandemic so we came up with the idea of doing these virtual seminars to help people with critical skills that they need to navigate the the challenging job environment and to either help move their career to the next level or to even shoot careers so i'm here in washington tonight we're actually working really hard right now to get another stimulus bill to get an extension of an unemployment insurance benefits i know that so many families are struggling to pay their rent uh their mortgage their bills to buy food uh with the lapse of the unemployment insurance program uh so we're fighting really hard to get an extension of that program and get the relief that colorado needs so desperately in this in addition to that we want funding for more chronovirus testing more contact tracing uh resources for our cities and for our school districts to really meet uh the urgency of this crisis i hear from all of you all the time about how challenging it is uh throughout the community and i'm working really hard to meet that knee so tonight's seminar is going to be great uh we're joined again by beth hopps with arapahoe douglas works who joined us for an earlier seminar and tonight miss hobbs is going to be talking to us about career reinvention a really important topic as so many industries and jobs now are going out of business uh and we see massive changes in the economy you know what is the process of thinking about how do you look at changing careers and professions how do you do that assessment um how do you reinvent your career or whatever stage you are in life so uh beth hobbs with arapahoe douglas works is going to help work through that process with you we we hope you find these seminars useful please let us know contact my office at either aurora or in washington if you're having problems or challenges navigating federal agencies or benefits and we are standing by to help you it's one of the most important parts of my job so with no further ado i'd like to introduce beth hobbs to take it over and present tonight's training beth over to you okay thank you representative crowe i'm very happy to be here tonight and to talk about a topic that is really um one of the most current needs that i hear i am a career advisor a workforce specialist with arapahoe douglas works and so i talk with job seekers every day and many of them are now contemplating looking for a different career really moving away from what they've been doing in the past as we progress tonight i'm going to ask you to put all of your questions in the chat box and we will make sure that all of those questions get answered at the end of the presentation but i won't stop in the middle to answer them so please put them in the chat box and just know that they will all get answered before um the end of the presentation so with that i am going to share my screen with you so you can see the slides that i have so just take a moment here okay so as we get started here let me just say that career reinvention is an expedition it's not a day trip so i want you to think in terms of that this is really a journey and so the very first thing we want to talk about the objectives for tonight so they are first of all to understand a little bit about the process of career change what are the things that we need to think about when you're contemplating that secondly to explore some new tools for career change and lastly to apply the steps that we're going to talk about tonight to change careers successfully so three main challenges that often are in front of us the first is to recognize that sometimes we are our own biggest obstacle make sure that this new career or this change is something that really for you is a burning desire and not shall we say a passing fancy we oftentimes make excuses that that stop us from moving forward and we know that um what's past is past and so there are changes coming we've seen enormous changes in our lives in the last few months there will be many more as we um progress forward even as the the country reopens i want you to think um i want you to know that simply thinking about options doesn't necessarily work you need to put real energy into career change it takes a lot of work be mindful of what others tell you and also a little bit about what is your body telling you as you kind of think about different kinds of things it should come as a relief then that the main ingredient of successful reinvention is really not iq it's not having nerves of steel or membership in some kind of exclusive club but rather it's about attitude it's about commitment and it's about the willingness to follow some fairly simple principles um for those of you contemplating uh changing careers i would encourage you to think about assessments our workforce centers offer a number of assessments some of them are to help you determine your skill level some of them are to really kind of dig into your interests and what direction might you consider going others really deal with skills and where do your skills lie and how do we match those up with different um careers or occupations so first of all you want to start with a vision so we know that steve steve jobs told us that if you're working on something that you really care about you don't have to be pushed the vision kind of pulls you along and that's what we're hoping for in career and reinvention is to really have in our minds some kind of vision that is going to pull us along so the first thing that we need to do is to think about the myth and really do some reality checks um on how we're looking at this vision so start with the vision for your change because careers or jobs are really just delivery devices for the kind of life you want to lead and so you have to think about that first what is the life that i'm looking to lead um for some people it means i want a job that i can go to monday through friday i want to go in do my job come home and i don't want to think about it others are looking to really build careers to maybe um looking to gain greater income so there's all kinds of ways that that you can look at jobs and at work and we want to recognize that those careers or jobs really are delivery devices for the kind of life that i want to have so think about some of the myths that you may be telling yourself some of them are on the screen before you things like without agree degree i don't stand a chance i work with a lot of older workers who are seeking work and some of them oftentimes say to me i think i'm too old no one will hire me that's a myth we're doing lots of work here in colorado to ensure that that doesn't happen but it's even a myth today there are there is work for older job seekers as well sometimes we hear from people you have to know somebody to get in well there may be some truth to that but then the key is how do we get to know somebody so that we do get in how do we set ourselves up to be the most successful when we tell ourselves negative myths like this that can often become self-fulfilling prophecies and we don't want that um rather we want to really visualize and use positive thinking to help us stay on course but we also don't want to set ourselves up for positive myths that may provide unrealistic expectations and sometimes that happens when we start talking about job change so think about what are the problems that you think would be solved if you move to a different career what things will you finally get that you've been waiting for what are the barriers that you think might stop you from getting there what cool things am i looking forward to in my new career what won't i have to deal with once i make the switch and as you think about all of these questions there's kind of a positive and a negative to them um sometimes we can assume that by moving into a different career we will have no issues everything will be wonderful we'll be able to buy whatever it is we want to buy that kind of thing and that's an unrealistic myth as well sometimes we need to just get in touch with what are the barriers that we think are going to stop us not so that not because we want those barriers to stop us but because we want to give some thought to how am i going to get around those or over those are under those and so just kind of thinking about some of those questions as you think more about changing careers is helpful to uncover maybe some myths that you've been dealing with so step one in all of this is that career change is a journey and if we think about it from a map perspective it looks more like a treasure map than it does like what you would see on your gps we often times as we think about changing careers and counter detours congestions roadblocks and sometimes we end up at a place that we didn't even anticipate and yet it's a great place for us think about where are your strengths this is a time to really sit down and identify with those what your strengths are and i deal with a lot of job seekers and i always say to them you have all kinds of strengths it's about taking the time to sit down and to identify them so that as you start to look for other positions you can find things that really are positions that you will thrive in it's also important sometimes that we also identify our values because different workplaces can work well with our values or not so well with our vital values so it's important that we understand what those are for ourselves also we often sometimes have financial or environmental needs that we want to talk about do we want to think about what am i looking for anytime you're going to make a career change you need to know what your bottom line is financially two it's much easier to move into related occupations or ones that line up with your transferable skills which says first of all i need to know what my skills are i need to be able to identify those because positions that work off of those skills are going to be the easiest for me to transition into we know that change is hard and it often pushes us to a place of discomfort when you are really looking to reinvent yourself you often have to choose to put yourself in that place of discomfort to think about what am i willing to sacrifice maybe long term maybe it's just short term to achieve the goal that i'm looking at and really give yourself permission to pursue what you want so as we think about step one just a little review and i'm going to do this at the end of every step the takeaway is that careers and jobs are delivery devices so we really want to define for ourselves what is the life that we hope to lead and then what are the careers or jobs that are going to get us there um watch out for forgetting to give yourself permission um to pursue a different and a bigger life sometimes we can put a lot of roadblocks in our own way and as you think about how am i going to move forward start to make a list of three or four ideas that could deliver that lifestyle that you're looking at and i'd say along with that start putting together that list of skills that you have and lastly don't forget to spend a little time thinking about what are the things i love most about my life right now and how do i make sure that those things um follow me into my next position or into my next career i'm going to talk just for a moment about kind of some of the physical part of this your body is is often a good guy to to where you should be going there's a real sometimes balancing act between instinct and intellect our instinct is wise and and we don't want to let go of that we can oftentimes get signals through our body that tend to lead us in one direction or another and our intellect which is important as we start to get into doing research can also um help can also sometimes pop up some of those barriers for us or some of those myths for us so you have to really be thinking what am i feeling from an instinct perspective and then what do i know intellectually malcolm gladwell wrote a book called blink and he said respect the fact that it's possible to know without knowing why we know and accept that sometimes we're better off that way and so sometimes we just have that feeling that the next place i need to belong here i want to pursue is in this direction and we can't sometimes we can't even articulate that all good decision-making certainly requires an ever shifting balance of intellectual and instinctual input some decisions are better left to the first clear signal we have in our body that sends a message to us if we're paying close attention so as we think about listening to our body i just want to make it clear kind of what i'm talking about here when you uh think about a new occupation or a new career or a new job path are you feeling relaxed about that you know is there a sense of relaxation in your shoulders in your jaw and your stomach just generally within your body is your adrenaline flowing when you think about that are you anxious to get started to move down that path does the thought of it make you smile do you does your chest feel more open does your body tend to quiet down so it's kind of like if you think of something like a bowl of brussels sprouts does your mouth water over the idea or are you filled with dread so that's kind of when we talk about listening to our body what are those signals that we're taking in um in regard to that so again the takeaway is that sometimes our body is more reliable than our intellect of what we truly want or don't want and i think if you spend some time reflecting on that you'll see that watch out for your intellect shooting down your body's message sometimes we can intellectually put a lot of barriers in front of where we think we want to go and uh career reinvention is a lot about pushing through that so moving forward pick an area of your life and kind of practice tuning into your body signals when you make decisions and lastly ponder what is your body telling you that you may be afraid to hear and it may be that message that now is the time to go for this or it may be the message that this isn't what you need to be pursuing we know that progress really begins when we stop making excuses and so as you think about potential excuses that might block your reinvention here are some that i put on the screen think about the messages that you tell yourself remember that true career change needs to be more of a burning desire than a passing fancy it's a lot more work than going back into what i've always done but ask yourself why is it out of your hands what is it so start to take some of these excuses apart what is it that makes me think that this might be out of my hands what you know can't be um can be learned what you don't know can be learned and in all likelihood if you are moving into a new career you will have to discover what capabilities or skills are necessary for this new career i encourage you to research this career i encourage you to read job postings for this new position that you're thinking about moving into and take a look at what are they listing as qualifications for that connect with other people people who are perhaps working in that arena already we talk about doing informational interviews informational interviews are nothing more than connecting with people in an organization who have a position that is similar to either the position that you want to have or sometimes informational interviews are about connecting with people who work for an organization that you wish to work for again we we know that it's going to take time um so you know it's it's a journey it's not a day trip i'm going to discuss mentors with you a little bit later but really for all of these excuses and there may be other ones that really have been kind of standing in the way of your doing a career in reinvention begin to spend a little bit of time and energy thinking about is what i'm telling myself really true in terms of this and excuses all oftentimes will translate to fear so there's really two kinds of fears um that we see fear can be a healthy sign that you are venturing beyond your comfort zone which you must do repeatedly if you want to move closer to that goal but know that fear is there are two types of fears so we first talk about functional fear so this is where we ask my yourself am i in danger in other words a functional fear would be if i just step off the curb on a busy street i might get hit by a car if i'm not looking both ways and being very careful about where i'm crossing that street that's a functional fear there is real danger there potentially real danger but false fears are when we kind of project a negative impact into the future you know they're the kinds of things where you say to yourself well what if this were to happen or what if that were to happen and so you need to pull those apart and really take a look at first of all is there a way around that fear or am i just again putting up some road blocks for myself and one of the best ways to do this is really to find other people that you can lean on that you can have conversation with we'll talk a little bit more about mentors shortly but distract yourself from some of that get inside some of those fears find out what's really going on here and lastly spend some time talking back to that fear you know if i'm afraid of moving forward because well what if it doesn't work well okay let's talk about that what if it doesn't work but what if it does work you know what if you can attain that goal and um rather than thinking about what if it doesn't work what am i going to do to make sure that it does play out the way that i would want it to so as i said letting go of of uh excuses is important kind of giving up complaining don't let those excuses become a self-fulfilling prophecy think instead about what are the reasons for why you're stuck or unhappy or unable to change or make progress and then figure out what are the steps i'm going to do to get around that so it takes making a commitment and maybe it's a commitment to doing the research that you need to do maybe it's a commitment to talking with others who are in that field or finding out more about that maybe it's a commitment to additional training that you might want to um look at there are um programs that assist people in getting additional training the state of colorado has um dollars that come in from the federal government and a program called workforce innovation opportunity act which you can connect with a counselor one of our workforce centers but essentially there are dollars available for people who want to upskill or for people who want to change careers and feel like they need some kind of certification to get started so there's lots of things to research out there and to think about to make that commitment and move forward and once you've made that commitment kind of take a look at your actions in light of what you want to do and just know that the goal is to keep moving forward every day toward that goal of changing careers i mentioned assessments it may that may be one of the steps that you take as well so just remember that oftentimes when we're making excuses as motivated by a fear and so we want to get inside of that and really figure out what's the validity of that and how do i get around that what stops us really is believing our excuses so deeply that we aren't able to move into anything new so as you move forward think about three options to get around what's the biggest excuse i'm telling myself in my head and then what would life look like if i gave up all of those excuses what do i how do i think my new career would unfold so what you seek is often on the road less traveled and so taking a different unexpected path is really oftentimes about exploring multiple alternatives um and so not knowing the outcome of your reinvention can be difficult however the process of reinvention folk forces you to get more comfortable around ambiguity and so when we talk about ambiguity that's really that place that many people are in right now what we know about change is that we leave a place of generally security in an in an organization or in a career path we know exactly how to do our work we know when to show up we know who we report to what's important to the organization all of that and then suddenly we find ourselves in this place of ambiguity in which we're not sure exactly what our next career will look like we're not sure what it will come about um and i think right now there are a lot of unknowns around job search as a whole obviously the goal is to get to the other side to where we do have a position and we begin to learn things about that new organization about the new group of people that we are going to work with about the work that we're going to be doing and if you think about it in terms of i often think about it in terms of the pilgrims where they left a life behind that they knew and they understood and they got in the boat and for that time while they were in the ocean that was their time of ambiguity eventually they had land and eventually they were able to create a whole new life there but that time while they were out at sea there were lots of unknowns there were certainly things they thought might happen some of which probably did some of which probably didn't but one of the things we know is that we need to get a little bit more comfortable about ambiguity reinvention is not about the status quo it's about trying something new and so anyone who's considering career and reinvention understands that they're not only going to be trying something new but there may be a lot of learning involved getting to the something new so i'm going to share with you an idea that i think is really helpful it's called mind mapping mind mapping is really a type of graphic organizer that uses a diagram to visually organize ideas and concepts the central idea or concept is placed in the center of the diagram and then related ideas are added to it in kind of a radial fashion so there's usually two different um groups of individuals that i'm working with one group knows what they want their next career to be it is different from where they were before but they have a pretty good idea of where they want to go and so if you put the title of that on a graph like this and you can actually draw one of these yourself it's you know you put a circle in the center of a piece of paper and you put down where is it i want to go what's the name of the new position i wanna i wanna be and then we start to draw these lines out from there thinking about what do i need to know what do i need to do to get there so let's just say that um i'm thinking that um i want to be an administrative assistant i haven't done that before maybe i've been in the hospitality industry so one of those branches may be to identify what are the skills i have that i think would transfer let me start to just write those down another branch may be what kind of training or basic skills do i need in order to pursue this new career and maybe in the case of administrative assistant i begin to think about microsoft office skills are my skills up to date and if not where can i get the training that i need to make sure that they are up to the level that they need to be in order to secure the kind of position i'm looking for maybe another branch is about what kinds of organizations am i looking to be employed by and you know there may be offshoots of all of that maybe i want to think about distance i don't want to be very far from home or maybe i want to be on a mass transit line of some kind or maybe i want to work in a particular industry maybe i want to do that work within health care maybe i want to do it within corporate america or someplace else so you begin to see that by creating all of these branches off of that i can get a visual of the things that i need to do and what's it going to take to get there and it's really helpful because as you connect with other people and have conversation they can help you add to this graphic to make sure that you're really thinking about the entire picture as you move forward so if you do informational interviews somebody may share with you the easiest places to enter into that profession okay and you may want to create a branch for that so that's one group of individuals that i tend to see are those who are fairly sure about where they're going the other group of individuals that i um work with often times know that they don't want to go back to where they are but they aren't sure where they want to go okay so that center circle is difficult to fill in so we kind of create the center circle but we start with the branches and we think about what are my transferable skills i need to identify those what assessments might i take that would help me identify some good career paths for me to check out maybe i want to start to have some informational interviews with people who might be able to help me maybe i start by talking to a career advisor and then as ideas start to come to me and maybe i'm thinking about well i could be an administrative assistant or maybe i could work as a project manager maybe i have some i.t skills wherever my skills are those too can be branches and you can make branches off of those about what do i need to do to pursue that so it may be that if i truly if one of my branches is administrative assistant let's say i have some pretty good uh microsoft office skills so it might not be hard to move into that but if i'm really thinking that what i'd like to pursue might be something with an it then i have to perhaps get a certification in order to enter into that occupation and so then you know another branch becomes where am i going to get that what kind of certification do i need so again it becomes that graphic of what are the things i need to be considering and so in this case where i'm not sure as i think through my my transferable skills and and maybe take some assessments and i start to narrow that down um the graph is helpful and in fact it may end up being a couple of graphs once i identify some paths that i might want to go down so if you haven't tried this i really suggest it's a a very creative way of doing it and it tends to generate a lot of ideas for people and also it's a great way to sit down with other people who might help you as well brainstorm career ideas so as you're thinking about directions that you might want to go besides identifying your your transferable skills and your strengths think about in the work that you've done in the past when have you been in the flow in other words when have you done tasks for which you really got so absorbed in you you forgot about the time and you just really got absorbed into them um we all have those i know that in my work career there are projects that i've worked on or tasks that i've done in which i just get so lost in them that hours can go by those are times when i'm really working in my strength and so you want to take note of that because those are the kinds of skills that can easily transfer to something else sometimes it's times when things feel easy for us you know when um talent can feel as natural as breathing so there are things that i can do that um just seem effortless where for someone else they might seem difficult and vice versa there are things that they can do that seem effortless to them that for me would be very difficult and tough to stick with sometimes it's things that are so abundantly clear to you you wonder why others don't see it you know things that seem obvious to you think about where your interests are things that kind of spark an unending sense of curiosity the more interested we are in a topic or in a career in a pathway the easier it is for us to move into that that career think about what part of your current career do you enjoy the most you know you don't have to leave everything behind when you decide to reinvent to a different career and in fact you'll be most successful in career changes that build on skills you already have i'll give you an example that um i spent 12 years in a k-12 system and when i um through a layoff ended my my time there and i thought i really want to do something different i'm not sure where i want to go with that but as i thought about my skills and the things that i had done successfully i realized that moving into adult education which in many ways is very different than k-12 but on the other hand there are transferable skills from one to another that made that transition a little bit easier uh and lastly you know think about am i interested more in an entrepreneurial kind of situation what should exist in the world that doesn't you know if any of you sat down and watched shark tank you know sometimes it's amazing to me how simple some of those ideas are that people have and yet something brought that idea to mind and gave them the the push to produce that or to go after that where for others even if i were to think of that idea i might not take the initiative to bring it into existence so select as you're doing all of this the idea is really to select that reinvention target you know what is it i'm going to focus on if i'm going to reinvent myself like i said earlier on two groups of people the group that is really very unsure of where they want to go make it much more difficult for people to help them because i can help you along that path if i know kind of where you want to go generally but if you have no idea the options are just too endless and so that's why we encourage people to identify strengths to identify skills to take a look at what their interests are and to begin to see if they can't narrow that down so as you're doing all of that visioning and kind of research that will hopefully guide you to a path that is worth pursuing now that path may be open to several different careers but at least you've narrowed it down to a path that makes some sense for you going forward think about what have i always wanted to do but i never felt i could for some people that's their that's their career invention might be something that they've always wanted to do since childhood and now feel like gee maybe now is the time um some people think about it a different way if i didn't have to earn money what would i do we know we all have to earn money but for some the passion to do a particular career takes them on a place to where they actually do end up earning money sometimes we hear that uh certain careers i'll just pick out being an artist doesn't uh you know you never make any money being an artist but the reality is there are some very well paid artist and so if the passion is there and we do our homework there are ways to make for the money to follow i guess i would say so in review explore those roads less traveled those um become more creative as you think about career options and really the more you can get out and explore different careers we know that there are careers that are available today that no one had ever heard about 5-10 years ago one of the ones that has popped up in the last few months we talk about people who are contact tracers perfect example most of us had never heard those two words before and while those positions have probably existed in some extent prior to covet we also know that that's becoming more more of a position so really think broadly and think creatively and again get out and talk to people do your research because oftentimes there are career options out there that we we haven't even thought about watch out for people that might be telling you no that's not a possibility who might want be wanting to make that box smaller for you rather than enlarging that box for you so my recommendation for you would be to begin thinking about two of those less obvious career options that you maybe have been thinking about or again take some of those assessments so you begin to explore some of those options one of the assessments that we have at the career center which i think is just really marvelous it's called you science and it's done you can take it from the career um or from the workforce center for free and it actually takes a look at people's skills on a variety of topics and once they've identified skills for you they have a list of occupations that match those skills so they have a list of 10 to 15 occupations that are excellent matches to the skills that you have and then they have another layer down of careers or jobs that are less a good match but a little less of a match let's say but in doing that you also learn a lot about your skills and you also gain a lot of really helpful verbage when you go to write resumes also what are the other times when you've pursued a road less travel and you've succeeded sometimes we don't take enough time in our career search to really reflect back on what have we done and when you think back to the positions that you have had in the past what have you really liked doing what are those um what are those positions and what are those skills that you were using that um really made work enjoyable for you and sometimes we've even stepped out into careers or jobs that um we never thought we'd have let's put it that way and we've succeeded at them you know because we've been willing to take a bit of a risk so good thing to ponder so you've got tools in your toolbox um you're not starting from scratch and all of this and i think oftentimes people think they are when they think about reinventing themselves one of the biggest myths of reinvention is that your previous work has no bearing on where you're what you're looking at going forward so you have to get out of the habit of summing yourself up by what you've done and or who you were in the past and really start shifting that frame to think about who you want to be in the future we talk about this when we talk about writing resumes and that we often start them with a professional summary and oftentimes people are tempted to write that as kind of a look back over where i've been rather than defining them first themselves professionally on where they want to go so it takes a little bit of letting go of your of your old identity i've seen people put together business cards of the new job that they want to have and they start you know passing them out to people they meet um so that people begin to think of them in that arena sometimes people have gone to uh social events in that new industry or affairs or whatever meet up is a great place to begin to connect with people who are in that industry or in that position that you are might be interested in so and make sure that you're telling people that you're pursuing a new field people need to to hear that especially people who know you because along the way the more people you have working on your behalf to help you get to your goals the faster you're going to get there and so if you have been in one type of position and you're really thinking about looking at a totally different career let people know that because again they may have a network of people that may be able to help you so um it's you know they said letting go of your old identity [Music] and making a list of skills which transfer to you to your new endeavor so think about skills that you have in terms of technical skills you you have and that may be everything from i can drive a forklift to i can do microsoft office to perhaps i know how to to do graphic design whatever you consider your technical skills to be think about your communication skills critical thinking skills ability to multitask teamwork skills creativity leadership and this is just a few of what is an enormous list of skills and if you get kind of hung up on gee i don't know what to label is my skills i would encourage you to go out and google the word job skills and you will find a very long list and you can start to read through those and think about are those skills that i have so don't get skills confused with jobs jobs are where we work but the skills are what make us successful in those jobs and oftentimes in fact more times than not those skills are transferable talking with a number of people in the last few months who have been in the hospitality industry we're talking about their skills and how they might translate those to a different job obviously they have generally enormous skills in the area of customer service and so where are positions that for which customer service skills are paramount um to success so really thinking in terms of skills and letting go of jobs that i've been in and then to figure out okay if these are the skills what might i do which ones are transferable to something different and i think you'll be amazed at how many of them are so review your tools are really your skills and your talents and that's what you're going to use to build your new career so it's important that we can identify those and again that is not a short list that is a long list watch out for the gap between the skills you have and the ones you'll need a lot of times when we move into a new career we find that there are skills that we don't have that we do need whether that's just information that we need to know or maybe it's something we actually need to do for example maybe i have great microsoft word skills but for the positions that i'm looking at i need microsoft excel skills okay then that's a gap where am i going to find the training that i need in order to make that happen so if this is a bit of a struggle make a list of your previous job duties and successes and then start to break them down and say to yourself okay so what was the skill that was needed in order to do this job okay and again as i have more conversation with people in the hospitality industry we can begin to identify the skills that they have that we can take a look at other positions and other industries that they can move into so ponder what are the tools that i have what are the skills am i willing to polish them up sometimes i have to polish them up i may have used microsoft word in the past but i'm not an expert user maybe i need to get back in and do a little training to polish that up and then there may be new skills that i need to get in order to really be successful in where i want to go next i'm going to talk a little bit about a reinvention board a reinvention board is a fancy word for talking about the people who are going to help you along the way so first of all think in terms of strategy it's the framework you'll use to conduct your search and it'll help you organize as you move forward so we need to essentially come up with a strategy or a plan it's not meant to be set in stone because obviously the more we learn the more we talk to people um you know the more research we do it's got to be fluid because it's going to be changing we know that it does require um research it does require operations and funding and by that i mean so when we think about research kind of the gathering of information about new industries or new companies or maybe new positions um skills that kind of thing operations are really what are the tasks and the details that are required for me to do this search effectively and efficiently and lastly funding and this is an important piece because sometimes when you change careers there is additional training that's needed and so you have to think about how am i going to fund that and like i say there are some programs to sometimes pay for some of that but also what is it going to mean in the meantime when i think about funding do i have the funds to to take care of myself and my obligations during this time of kind of ambiguity and exploration and that kind of thing or do i need to look at maybe taking what we call a survival job a job that will help to get us through until we can get to where we really want to go people are incredibly important in any job change any frankly in moving from unemployed to employed people are are incredibly important but when you're looking at changing careers they become even more important so just know that 70 to 80 of the people who become employed do so through networking and so building that network of people is important um these are help people who can sometimes help you analyze sometimes give you information sometimes kind of take a look at your plan and say well you know here's an easier way and there's certain types of people we're looking for i put some of the names of those them and explain those to you but we talk about master connectors so think about the people you know the people in your network and do you have someone who's kind of a networking expert sometimes it's that someone with great connections who can put you in touch with others who may be able to help you um and you know we all meet people along the way that um can do that um i have a sister-in-law that has amazing contacts all over um and so you know look for those kinds of people um to be part of the people who are helping you we talk about clued in colleagues so this is somebody that you've worked with who knows your strengths and your weaknesses and can really have an honest conversation with you to discern whether or not an opportunity or career path is a good match for you and your skills sometimes when we look at our own skills the lens we're looking through is our own and so oftentimes it's helpful to have somebody else who's worked alongside of you and who's can say to you you know what i've seen you work in this other arena and be just amazing at it and maybe that's not even something you've considered we all need warm and fuzzy people so that's um the good friend who's gonna catch you if you fall and can make you feel grounded in moments of um despair or when we we don't feel like we're successful or not moving along at the pace that we want to we need to have somebody in our in our corner who's kind of a cheerleader we talk about drill sergeants these are the people who are going to help you get over yourself when you're kind of paralyzed by fear they have no patience for excuses but are nevertheless fully supportive of what you're trying to do but they're the people who are gonna hold you accountable for moving forward and then last of all the native is someone who knows the industry you're planning to enter and has important insider knowledge about the culture knowledge that you wouldn't otherwise have and so think about that think about them in terms of a board of directors on your career change these are people who are really going to help you move your dreams and your vision forward so um again your plans you need to have a strategy you need to kind of set that up what am i going to do first what am i going to do second i think that the mind map is a great place to start and then you have to put that down into an actual plan what happens first what happens second and to really create a strategy for yourself but help from a reinvention board is just terribly important um because as i said it is difficult to make all of this happen in a vacuum without the help of others um watched out for becoming kind of the lone ranger who doesn't need help or who's too proud to ask for help but rather start looking for people that can be part of this board for you and reach out to them and ask them if they'd be willing to assist you and to have conversation with you from time to time about the direction that you're going and and what you need from them and ponder what opportunities can i create to pay it forward you know where can i be helpful to someone else and to give without expectation of receiving anything back so we're going to talk a little bit more about natives because these are the people who can really give you the inside scoop on where you want to where you want to go and so the first thing is to to locate a native so we talk about going to your network some of you are on linkedin or on facebook um reach out to those people that you're connected with see if you can't find somebody who's in the the occupation that you're looking at or the career that you're looking at and if it's a struggle to find them someplace like that within your own network then um we recommend what we call informational interviews which are looking for people on linkedin or other places that may be part of somebody else's network or maybe they're within an organization that i think i might be interested in and i i make a connection with them and see if they're willing to spend 15 20 minutes talking with me to really talk about the industry to talk about the work that they do if that's what i'm thinking about doing so you want to i begin by identifying somebody that is a native to the work that you want to do demonstrate that you're determined to become a native to them i think people are really willing to spend time with somebody they think is serious about moving into maybe the career that they have or the industry that they work in and oftentimes these people will go to really to serious links to to help you make that happen um as you're doing that make sure you're always showing respect for those that are willing to help you make it easy for them to help you and by that i mean you have to be open to meeting with them or having conversation with them at a time that is helpful to them okay and so um as you think about looking for natives look for people who are doing well in their target career and who enjoy what they're doing that's really important you want somebody who's excited about that career that you're thinking about getting into we know that happy people are more likely to be objective because they don't have an axe to grind people who are burned out in their positions are more likely to put a negative spin on thing things and so and people with a conflicting agenda can often steer you wrong so you really want to find those people who are excited about what they do and i think as you reach out to your own network and you may not have a native necessarily in your network but to say to those folks um do you know of anybody i'm looking at getting into this who would you recommend that i talk to that i spend some time with um as much as possible we used to say to land an in-person interview obviously that's a little bit more difficult we're all becoming a little bit more proficient at zoom and i think that's the way between that and the phone that we're going to be doing these at least in the near future but make sure that you are prepared with questions for this person that it's really going to add to your knowledge and um you know what maybe you want to know about pay maybe you don't want to know about the best way to enter into that type of position maybe you want to know about other employers that they might know who have this type of position that you're looking for and certainly one of the things that you always want to ask at the end of some of those conversations is who else do you know that you think might be helpful to me in this industry so you're again you're building that network and when it comes to a time when perhaps there's a position that you feel um you're qualified for and you want to apply for you may have met somebody at that organization that perhaps can ease that path a little bit just some basic tips you know use email telephone um social media make sure that you are always being very respectful of people when you're talking to them and keep your options open obviously you have a plan in a way that you want to do this in a timeline um just remember that other people also have obligations and so sometimes you have to really work with their timelines we know that natives can really provide invaluable information on the pros and cons of your career but also who's hiring who's not hiring what kind of education do you need what kind of qualifications do you need but really can also speak to culture what's the culture of an organization what's the culture of this industry and to kind of give you that insider's feel which is important so start to set up networking meetings with people that you consider to be natives as you identify that path that you want to go down and you look for people who are natives look for people you can talk to and get passed along to other people to be of help to you consider the downsides um of any profession um what am i willing to deal with in order to have the upsides of this new career because there may be some downsides and i think you want to be honest with yourself realistic about what it's going to take to get there so think about that as well anticipate struggles and really plan for them you know sometimes that's planning for them financially sometimes that's planning for them in other ways one thing to be mindful of is we all have a timeline in our head of how long this is going to take and i'm just going to tell you it takes the time that it takes remember again i'll repeat this again it is a journey it is not a day trip and so while we all want to be in control of this moving to a different position there are things that we can control there are things we can't control sometimes we have the illusion that when we call someone they'll get back to us right away sometimes it doesn't always happen sometimes we have a timeline in mind as to when we want to meet with people that doesn't always happen there are life events that happen there are world events that happen certainly um the covet has changed kind of world events in many ways and so we might have had a plan for how we were going to do this reinvention and now we find that we need to be thinking about doing it other ways because what's happened we also really can't control when opportunity arrives you know sometimes we have a plan set out and there will be an opportunity that maybe pops up in the middle of that that's just something we hadn't thought about something we hadn't planned for and yet it arrives and it's something we want to take part in so think about how am i going to change my expectations really make a list of the things you can control keep a plan b on the back burner knowing that as you go through this journey of of changing your career you have to just be mindful of the fact that it's going to take the road it takes and while you can put as many things in place to make it go your way um at times there are just things that you're going to learn people you're going to meet opportunities that pop up maybe things you haven't planned for that are all going to require you to to refocus the journey refocus the strategy so um you need to make kind of a tactical plan of how we're going to go about doing this develop a plan to accomplish your goal anticipate struggles plan for them as well as you can write down the tasks that the things that need to happen make sure they're in small bites that they're manageable that's a way that as you accomplish those you can feel like you're making progress you're moving forward if we make them too big sometimes that just can be self-defeating for us so make those tasks manageable keep a routine of kind of doing those manageable tasks in other words it's not about doing some of it tomorrow and then not doing anything for a month you really need to to set up a plan that that gets you on a path that keeps you going if at all possible you know make them fun make some of them optional but momentum is important and so build in rewards as you go along um formal accountability as well as well as kind of a tracking system and so those things will help you to keep moving forward um if i know that if i do these five things by the end of the week i'm gonna you know treat myself to whatever maybe it's a walk maybe something more than that that's great if i have some people on my reinvention board who can hold me accountable in a more formal way that's helpful and then just to have a tracking system so i can go back and take a look at that and say wow look what i've accomplished look how far i've gotten i maybe have a ways to go but i have accomplished something already and then try and do one thing that challenges you each week we learn the most when we are challenged and um so just know that those things that kind of challenge you or that seem um maybe even a little bit intimidating or frightening in the beginning once we've conquered that they become new skills so you will learn a lot just by going through the journey itself so again the takeaway is reinvention has its own timeline you certainly need to lay out a plan lay out a timeline make sure that you control the amount of effort you're putting in this to make things happen but things will also somewhat happen on the on the schedule that they do happen um sometimes things pop up that we don't see and can really um just you know turn us around for a bit until we can get back on track as i said before set up a plan to reward yourself whatever that means for you um and then think about the enjoyable activities that i can pursue while i'm on this journey and again that doesn't have to be things that necessarily cost money it can be going for bike rides we do know this the world buys into an aura of success confidence comes from a belief in yourself and the more confident you are about the path you're going down about what it takes to get their confidence in your skills to get their confidence in your work ethic to get there that will um other people will see that okay and so you want to know your skills and aptitudes you want to focus on career changes that really link to transferable skills sometimes it means we have to do emotional work to heal for some people during this time the leaving of their past employment has been incredibly difficult and for some we know that that position or that company that opportunity may not come back to them that way and we have to deal with the emotional side of that especially if we're going to go out and interview with other organizations a positive attitude is incredibly important in interview situation as is confidence want to hire people who are confident so doing the emotional work maybe just having conversations with people that you trust about what you've been through and finding ways to kind of move beyond that acknowledge that you have been successful in your past and for some of you and it may be for most of you you have held positions that maybe as a very young person coming out of high school coming out of college you never thought you would have and so look back on that and take a look at those positions and acknowledge the success that you had and acknowledge the skills that you've learned someone told me a long time ago and i think it's really true don't run from something but rather run to something and so as we look at a different career path be intentional about where you want to go don't just run to something because you feel like you have to have something and again it may mean that you take a um what i talked about a survival job to get to where you want to go but really think about where is that i want to run to not um i want to run away from something so take the time to really assess your motives for career change um for many of you there's a choice between do i move into another a different career a whole different path or do i go back to the kind of work that i was doing before so for many of you that's a choice for others of you the career you have simply doesn't exist at least not in the near future and so um there again you want to be intentional about where do you want to move to because at the end of the day you want to find a place where you feel like you belong you feel like you fit into the culture you feel like you have the skills you feel like you have the ability to learn what you don't know and we always have to learn something when we move to our next position even if we're moving to the same kind of job so just really take a look at where you've been successful in the past and then surround yourself with people who believe in you um you know whether that's family whether that's friends again as you start to build this network of people and think about that network of people who are going to be uh who are going to walk this path with you as you look at um career reinvention or maybe just moving into another career so um the takeaway on this last step is that um create that inner knowing in yourself and that faith and the possibility of attaining your goals you have to believe you can do this before others will believe you can do it but once you have that faith in yourself and you can develop that confidence in where you're going other people are drawn to that uh remind yourself of challenges in the past that you've overcome um for many of you you have taken on positions that um maybe you felt you had some of the skills and then you get into a position you go wow i don't maybe have all of them but you've taken on the challenge of obtaining those skills and so give yourself credit for that that we all have learned a lot as we've progressed from one position to another and then ponder how determined am i to succeed because that kind of motivation that determination is what's going to take you where you want to go so it's now time to reinvent yourself let me just um tell you about a couple of free training opportunities quickly before i go to questions 80 works which is arapahoe douglas works it's the workforce center for those two counties offers a number of free two-hour virtual workshops that anyone can take advantage of and i would encourage you but one of the ones that i think is particularly helpful to people is on emotional intelligence and um in that um this is a skill set that's used in and many positions and i kind of um throughout earlier you know jobs like contact tracing this kind of thing is very important and i think if you can talk about your skills we see a lot of people in the hospitality industry who have great emotional intelligence skills because they're used to reading um situations and they're used to reading other people and determining how to to serve them best so just know that we have some workshops on that that are scheduled on tuesdays and fridays and you can find that information on our website at www.adworks.org you don't need to register you simply need to to go on to the calendar link which is on the lower left hand corner on the front page and um you will see not only the calendar but the times of all of the courses that we offer including emotional intelligence i will just tell you i found another resource for people that i i happen upon by sheer coincidence that i think is interesting um for those who who have an interest in in contact tracing we know that there have been some of those positions in the past maybe some in the future um purdue university has a part of their program called purdue global and they actually offer a free online contact tracing course i think it takes about eight hours and you get a certificate at the end of that but that's the kind of research you want to do about certification programs or just training that you can get much of which is free we know that linkedin learning also has a large amount of uh free training as well and there are other resources i would encourage you to to reach out to your local library many of our libraries have a career advisor working for them i know arapahoe county certainly does so that is the conclusion of what i wanted to share with you today so i am going to go back to um let's see here um i'm going to go back and answer questions [Music] so all right hold on here okay now i've got to do this the right way there we go okay this is ali from congressman crowe's office i just want to remind everyone to put your questions in the q a box at the bottom of your screen and we'll make sure they get answered so ally i am just struggling to get back to where i was um this is kind of crazy yeah that if you look either there's a q a box at the bottom of your screen or i put stuff in the into the chat box for you as well either one works okay let me see if i can um pull that up here there we go um we'll start with q a okay um so someone says i was in an industry for 15 years um and i went from entry level to manager now i have to change industries but i know my experience is just as good as a degree in other industries when it comes to crew management but all of the jobs want a degree not experience um and and that's a struggle we're seeing more and more organizations that are recognizing the importance of um of experience over degrees it may mean that you need to get some kind of certification to to move into those some of those positions you may not have to get a degree i'll tell you the other way around this though is to start networking and really networking with all kinds of people in the arena that you want to go into and um really talk with them about how do i get in without a degree you know and getting to know people because many people are hired that way regardless of the qualifications that appear on a job description so um let's see another one so the chat here okay allie i am seeing that one let's see i'm only seeing one and i'm getting some more for you hold on just a minute beth okay i have someone here who said i'm done working in hospitality after chronovirus how do i get an office job i talk to people all day long who say that exact same statement and i think you start by taking a look at what are your transferable skills if you've worked in in hospitality you do have skills in customer service in all likelihood you may have um skills in in conflict resolution you may have communication skills um so it's about starting to um identify all of those and then it's um about writing a resume that really highlights the skills that you have and a little less where you got them we call that a functional resume and i would encourage you to get a hold of your local workforce center and just ask for an appointment for someone to have a conversation with you about writing a functional resume to help you move out of hospitality and into office work again it may require you to to increase your skills if you don't at this point have really good skills and let's just say microsoft office would be a starting place to figure out how am i going to get those skills the workforce centers also have access to some really great online tutorials that they can get you hooked up with to do that too um let's see i have a job right now but i want to change careers is it bad to try something new when so many people are unemployed no it's not in fact it's a great time i mean um you know i think it has a lot to do with um first of all your motivation and how and how much do you want to change careers it is work to do that but um i think looking at what's out there what's available there are industries that are hiring that are um doing okay at this point in time and so if you're looking at some of those kinds of careers it's it's a great thing if you're gonna um change careers i think it's about networking though it's about getting out and talking to people who are employed in that um in that industry to find out more about how do i get in to it can you talk about the cost of reinventing careers it's expensive um yes and no i mean it really depends i'll just use the example of somebody earlier who said i want to move from hospitality into um office work i can tell you we have most of the the um training that you're going to need to do that at the workforce center and it's free to you um if you were looking for moving into some of the tech careers through our wioa program we have paid for any number of people to get some basic certifications to move into some of those careers so can it be expensive yes it can um but it doesn't have to be depending upon what you're what you're looking for and um and who you can connect with and and where are the where are the resources to help you along the way and this is where i will just tell you that the more you spend some time figuring out about where you want to go what is what do you need and then you start networking with people to figure out how do i get that because i think you'd be surprised at some of the resources that are available um do i have advice for keeping yourself stable especially financially doing this ambiguity i think that's a tough one i mean it really is and um this is where i talk about that sometimes as we think about where we want to go um it may mean that in the interim we have to take a position that just gets us over the hump financially because obviously we still have bills and that kind of thing to pay so we do see people taking positions that um in all likelihood they're not going to stay with for a very long time but um they are helping them financially at this point in time because they're paying perhaps more than unemployment's paying you um are there any creative jobs out there anymore well i happen to believe there's all kinds of them so again it's about doing the research it's about talking to people if i'm thinking about changing careers should i tell my boss my initial gut reaction is no let's flush that plan out a little bit more let's be on the road to getting to that point at the point at which you are actually ready to make the move um you know then i think that's a time when you share that with your employer um otherwise what you're talking about is you're in a in a state of doing research learning new skills that kind of thing you wouldn't share with your employee employer if you are necessarily learning a new hobby i see this is kind of the same there's a time for your employer to know and depending upon a relationship with employer you may see them as somebody who can help you get to that next position if that's the case you might want to have conversation with them earlier rather than later but um for the most part i i'd be cautious about that until i'm really a ways down the road and i know exactly what i'm going to do and when i'm going to make that move so other questions right now i don't see any more um i think that was the last question the last one okay great well i want to thank you all for um spending some time with us this afternoon and hopefully you have had some ideas kind of percolate in your head some some thoughts on ways that you can think about reinventing your career so thank you for the opportunity to share with you

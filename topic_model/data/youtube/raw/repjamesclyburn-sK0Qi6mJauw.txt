[Music] as we pause to celebrate blackish enough in the year 2020 I think would be very important for us to remember that so many of those who contributed to this great rich history or people we might call on some heroes I think of people like Harry and Eliza Briggs a young couple who had aspirations and dreams for their children that were on par with everybody else's dreams but they were not exactly on par with everybody else's standing or status in their community Harry Briggs worked at a local filling station as an attendant Eliza Briggs worked at a local motel both of them making incomes in the twenty-something dollars a week but they had dreams and aspirations for their children that they could grow up get an education and go far beyond that which they were able to achieve in law rule cloud and county south carolina so they took the brave step of signing on to a lawsuit a lawsuit that grew out of an organized effort by reverend jaden lane a AME minister there in that community who's also an educator he organized folks in that county and with his background and experience as an educator and a minister he lined up with her in Eliza Briggs both unlettered but unfettered together they changed history every now and then when I go to AME churches I hear people speak of refugee had Elaine seldom do I hear them speak of Harry in the lives of breaks two unsung heroes who came forward at a time when everybody else was getting attention but they were deserving of it that's what Black History Month is all about not just to celebrate Frederick Douglass Robert smalls people who were outstanding in their own rights but to pay homage to those unsung heroes who dream far beyond their circumstances and they're made significant sacrifices you

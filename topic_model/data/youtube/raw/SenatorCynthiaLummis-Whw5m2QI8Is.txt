mr chairman i'd like to begin by asking consent to enter three documents into the hearing record one is an academic study published in the proceedings of the national academy of science called environmental outcomes of the u.s renewable fuel standard the second is a study by the university of georgia called analyzing the downstream impacts of u.s biofuel policies and the third is an article entitled u.s bread and doughnut makers urge biden to roll back biofuel requirements um i'm i'm i want to share your objection hearing none thank you thank you very much we've already heard testimony that the rfs mandate is adding about 28 to 30 cents a gallon to the wholesale cost of gas on average and of course at a time when fuel prices are extremely high and inflation is extremely high it works a hardship on consumers and i believe we should look at every avenue uh to provide relief to consumers uh you know when i'm in cheyenne on the ranch i grew up in in the house i grew up in i live right next door to a small refinery that lost its small refiner exemption furthermore they were unable to when refining for hydrocarbons they were absolutely unable to purchase non-hydrocarbons to blend to meet the renewable fuel standards so they converted the oil refinery to a refinery that now refines soybean oil that refinery in our little town in the state with the smallest population in the nation went from 260 livable wage jobs to 60 livable wage jobs we lost 200 um employees in cheyenne which is uh a huge number in our little community so uh this has had an enormous impact uh on our community so and and this happened during the previous administration's uh tenure so i don't i didn't see him slow walking the loss of the small refiners exemption i saw them putting the hammer down uh and costing small communities like mine uh hundreds of jobs so um ms johnson and mr polar racy when congress created the biofuel mandate we predicted that the program would disadvantage small refineries and of course it has it increasingly precludes refineries from selling the products they produce and requires them to buy products they don't produce if they can get them so this squeezes the smallest firms first and most severely higher cost producers are harmed the most and first in time so is this an effort to just make sure that much as we've did with banks you're too big to fail or too small to succeed and in the case of small refineries are they too small now to succeed uh senator i might just there's so if you think about the the american sort of refining complex right it's uh we traditionally had a lot of uh oil production uh produced and processed on the gulf coast and then the products moved up to the up to up the continent but of course with the emergence of uh production in north dakota and the energy independence in the u.s are our smaller refiners and regional became much more important and i think they provide a vital role and as i've said i think that the solution remains in order for all these different facilities with their different cost structures and their different markets to adapt they need an open market and the fundamental problem they all face is these mandated requirements to blend for to certain targets which do not necessarily yield any benefits even to the farmers the program is as i said we are fighting over very small volumes and if we were to open it up and have some broad just some broad support for the for you know moving biofuels forward we would all be a lot better off and these kinds of dislocations would tend to disappear ms johnson same question senator i really appreciate your question it reminds me of something one of my small refineries said to me we dance between the toes of giants and what that means is the smallest refinery in cheyenne wyoming the smallest refinery in noaa west virginia the smallest refinery in whatever rural community from pennsylvania pennsylvania to california dance between the toes of giant integrated multinational oil companies until the renewable fuel standard came along and said you know what we're going to tilt competition in favor of the large integrated oil companies but don't worry we've got your back congress said specifically we recognize that the volume mandates and the inability of small refineries to have access to capital to become large integrated oil companies that don't have access to pipelines that don't have access to that disproportionately produce diesel fuel don't have access to blend stocks don't worry we've got your back you'll be okay we can provide an exemption small refineries blend every drop of blend stock they possibly can but they don't always have access and they don't always have the ability so what happens is that they are captive buyers in a wildly inflated rin market and that is how they are harmed and i just want to be clear when we talk about 2019 2020 and 2021 where epa has proposed to deny hardship relief not one more drop of renewable fuel can be blended so what we're talking about is epa compelling small refineries to make massive wealth transfers to large integrated oil companies because they don't have access to feedstock because they cannot blend it's un-american well and and that is i think that should be the focus of uh some of the work that we do to have a better renewable fuel standard program because we are just assuring that only the big integrated companies will succeed and all of the small businesses will fail they're once again moving people uh out of small rural communities uh and into uh the the bigger areas that have uh the bigger refineries it's happening in so many industries that it's having a profound effect on america's jobs and demographics there has to be a way to encourage renewable fuels at the same time that you don't make it all about the small fail and the big survive and thrive thank you mr chairman i yield back

here so let's talk about the War Powers Act the gulf and Iraq war authorizations as people may or may not realize they're still on the books and they're still being used in many cases you and Senator young introduced legislation to repeal the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force why well first these are congressional powers under article one and too many congresses of both parties have abdicated this responsibility to presidents of both parties usually because they don't have the backbone to like put their name on the line when it comes to war so both Todd and I believe article one matters Congress should be deeply involved in this it's our job second Iraq's not an enemy anymore these these were War authorizations against an Iraq ultimately leading to the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the Baptist party Iraq is now a security partner of the United States in the fight against Isis in the fight against Iranian bellicose activity in the region why have a war authorization against a nation that is your partner and finally I think it sends a good message a great thing about America we have had a capacity to take Nations we've been at war with and then end up as allies Germany the UK Japan and it's good to send that message that a nation that's been in war with the United States we're open to making the relationship better and other nations have been too I think that's an important message to say why is it important uh to you I mean I I think that theoretically uh a lot of Republicans believe in a strong executive branch and don't I don't know that that's you that that describes you but and that the legislative branch should defer what's your take we were right a lot of Republicans do and I think Tim did a really good job of outlining the legal arguments the moral arguments and some near-term National Security considerations let me focus on the latter every Republican agrees we should counter Iran and there is no more important country in that effort than Iraq so we need to partner with the newly formed government of Iraq prime minister al-sudani is prepared to work with the Americans but more importantly Middle East Partners throughout the region to ensure that the terrorist state of Iran doesn't form a land bridge through Iraq into Syria down to Lebanon endangering Israel and Beyond and and so the best way we can do that right now is to affirm our support our friendship uh with the people of Iraq but he also points out and and it's true one of the reasons this hasn't happened is because it's a lot easier to just defer to the president of the United States and if things go great you've wave the flag and if things go bad then you can criticize it and not actually have to as a lawmaker take a position we've been doing that for decades now and frankly giving up our legal prerogatives but also failing to live up to our responsibility something Tim spoke to as as members of Congress we need to make hard decisions hard decisions about when you enter conflicts how those conflicts are are carried on which we do through oversight responsibilities and ultimately after we authorize military force we need to deal authorized for us when the conflict has ended that's what Tim and I are focused on here is it going to happen is it going to succeed this time I feel very very good about it we we filed today with 22 sponsors in the Senate 11 Democrats 11 Republicans which means we have the votes to get it through the Senate and I predict when we get to a floor vote it'll be more like two-thirds that we'll get to um and then while the Senate is usually slow and the house is fast this may be one where the Senate will act first the house patrons on this are really interesting Barbara Lee chip Roy Tom Cole Abigail spanberger very broad ideological group um and and I'll just go back to something Todd said we got to have backbone Todd had backbone when he enlisted in the Marine Corps my son had backbone when he went into the Marine Corps if if our troops have the backbone to say they're going to defend this country then Congress can't be Chicken in in making decisions about war peace and diplomacy we got to put our name on the line just to illustrate how absurd this is I entered the United States Navy right after high school that was 1990 a few months later the 1991. yeah First Gulf War authorization Congress has not repealed it since then it's time we get back into the workbook 18 19 years old thank you so much thank you you have a future in politics please don't don't uh thanks to both he really appreciate it and stay in touch uh and we'll keep covering this

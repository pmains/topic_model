it is an extraordinary honor to represent oregon in the united states senate and having this special privilege i've tried to make the lodestar of my service transparency and accountability it's why i worked with the distinguished senator from missouri senator mccaskill to end secret holds here in the united states senate well i've had more than 600 open town meetings why we take legislative drafts and put them online so that citizens can comment wherever possible it's all about transparency and accountability mr president and today's campaign finance system is neither it's not transparent it's not possible for americans to see who is giving uh what some to what particular candidate and there's no accountability the united states supreme court's decision in citizens united drove the system right back into the mud through this decision the supreme court has seen fit to create what amounts to a new route for massive sums of unreported unaccountable and unexp unacceptable spending to drown out responsible discourse in my view this decision degrades our democracy and creates the appearance that american government is simply up for sale to the highest bidders the decision by the five to four majority on the supreme court overturned almost a century of precedent and undermine the intent of the founders the decision in my view reflects a lack of understanding about our political process and an inability to see the corrosive effect of massive and hidden expenditures it's incumbent on the congress whose members do understand the electoral system to begin the process of restoring balance to the mechanisms of democracy and this in my view needs to be done before our elections are entirely overrun by shadowy interests warring unchecked and using the political system and american voters as pawns my final point mr president is i do not reach this judgment lightly i believe constitutional amendments ought to be reserved for those situations when the delicate balance set up by the founders has been upset by time by circumstance or in this case a sudden and ill-considered change in the jurisprudence that governs our system that is the situation we face today and it is why i have decided to add my name to the sponsors of this amendment

Mr Speaker I yield myself as much time as I may consume Kim was recognized today is tax day mr. speaker as if you didn't know that a newly filed FEC reports show that the president's campaign paid his business is a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the first quarter of this year including sixty eight thousand dollars for the Trump Hotel in DC and fifty eight thousand dollars for rent lobbyists in foreign governments continue to spend money at these hotels we have no way of verifying what that income looks like or where it's coming from candidate Trump said on the campaign trail quote my whole life I've been greedy greedy greedy I've grabbed all the money I could get I am so greedy unquote since the election we witnessed not just his own conflicts of self enrichment at taxpayers expense but petty graft from members of his cabinet and his administration lavish travel on military jets and first-class tickets for personal reasons and expensive office decorations lobbyists have been welcomed into agencies to write their own regulations his campaign and White House has filled the ranks of folks like people who already have pleaded guilty Michael Flynn who sold his connections to Russia and Turkish dictators while working for mr. Trump and so many other associates and the connections to foreign governments as leverage and that is potentially a conflict of interest bribery and grift might have a place in a crime family but it has no place in the Office of the President or in the Congress of the United States and this Congress has been absolutely direct and complicit in the unprecedented flicks of this presidency since February of 2017 I have been calling on the chairman of the committee on ways and means to request the president's tax returns which he has the authority to do under Section 60 103 of the tax code I called up resolutions 18 times the committee and this house have voted against seeing the president's tax returns why why did the president support giving rich people in corporations a giant tax cut why is he letting Wall Street and Big Oil write their own rules why are his children still running his company why has he not divested as he was told to do by the extra ethics commissioner President Trump seems to have an unhealthy admission for authoritarian leaders he seems to have a vision of turning America into an economy and government run by his own greedy and connected circle of oligarchs but subverting our democracy for personal gain while Congress looks the other way is poisonous to our republic in our democracy and it is anathema to our values today's tax day 450 to 450 second day of mr. Trump's presidency and the 450 second day of this Congress has let him off the hook I call on the chairman of ways and means to stop delaying and get mr. Trump's tax returns now like every other president for the past several decades the American people demand it we owe it to our democracy to shed light on his conflicts and mr. speaker thank you for your indulgence I yield back the balance of my time Tilman yields members are reminded to refrain from engaging of personalities towards the president the job for Washington is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I yield second excuse me but when you yield I'll yield I want to enter what's going to come into the record okay without objection thank you

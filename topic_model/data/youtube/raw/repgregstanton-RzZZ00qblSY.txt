all right hi everyone I'm Greg Stanton I'm a Congress member but for purposes of this video I'm a dad a dad who's helped with my two young kids a 13 year old son a 9 year old daughter and we're trying to figure out what to do during this quarantine period the stay-at-home period just like any other parents I'm here with my wife Nicole introduce yourself Stanton I'm a lawyer and I've also done a lot of work with bullying and adverse childhood experiences specifically working with Phoenix Children's Hospital so I'm excited about our conversation here today but as Greg said for purposes of what we're talking about today my most important role right now is mom to Trevor and violets and so at the point of today's discussion and conversation is really the impact of this coronavirus and the stay-at-home period and the separation from friends and family the impact on children and their thinking and their mindset and their psychology and so we have an incredible expert here to help us guide through some of the thought processes and ideas that we're all going through she's a adolescent and child psychiatrist dr. Fudo puccini great to see you thanks for hanging out with us here today maybe you can tell us a little about yourself yeah thank you for inviting me I think it's important definitely to get the message out so I've been working with the team here able to provide information and support to the community and the kids and the parents I am a child and adolescent psychiatrist and I am the medical director of the inpatient unit here at Phoenix Children's Hospital well thanks again for being with us ok Nicole and I are probably your typical family dealing with the coronavirus she's a very busy successful lawyer she's taken over the family room table and turned it into her law office because she's general counsel of a successful company I've taken over the home office because we're not in Washington DC I'm here with my constituents and community leaders and talking to experts and talking to other Congress members so I'm on the phone all the times we're trying to run to busy careers at the same time we're trying to homeschool our 13 year old son who's a 7th grader and our 9 year old daughter who is a 4th grader so the first question is for advice for parents like us because we have these exact same issues for people in our situation with kids at home how do you recommend that we talk to our kids about : 19 yeah that's a great question and you're absolutely right so many of the parents that reach out and that we see are in that situation where they spouses and teachers and continue to have a profession and have a lot going on and now you have kids at home and what do you think the most important thing is to talk to them about it a lot of times parents feel that if kids aren't bringing it up but you shouldn't say anything at all there is no way that you are not aware trevor ma know what's going on right times were they're feeling calm and relaxed and you're feeling common relaxed and I just tell people to normalize it yeah you know life is different mom and I are at home working you guys aren't in school how do you feel about that or to have a discussion about it now doctor I have a question actually Greg touched upon this we are obviously working full-time but we are trying to home-school our children and I'm sure like many parents out there at least my friends who I've spoken to and maybe they're just trying to make me feel better but we have we get a lot of resistance from our kids in terms of trying to keep them focused on their education for you know a good chunk of the day I think a lot of parents are worried and trying to figure out that balance like is it more important to keep my kids on track educationally or is it more important that you know I really try to make them feel comfortable and safe during this time period so that's a question I have for you is you know obviously you're not an educator and I'm sure they might give me a different answer but my perspective has been I want my kids to feel safe during this time period and I think they can catch up so what's your thought on that that's absolutely right you know I tell moms all the time that moms have great instincts so it's important to trust those what the research shows us is that when your brain is under stress and you don't feel safe you can't learn anyway so it is really important for the kids to feel safe and supported those needs come first and then to do the learning as well I mean my kids are in kindergarten and second grade so the schoolwork and pressure getting into seventh grade or high school the pressure goes up but I tell all parents to look at the curriculum being sent home as not as a I have to every day do everything on this list that puts a lot of stress on you it puts a lot of stress on your child so look and assess you know when your kids are feeling off or anxious right so assess body essentials and do those and prioritize your wellness and their wellness yeah thank you thank you that's helpful so a lot of kids are feeling anxious they're feeling stress they probably watch CNN along with mom and dad and see a lot of very difficult stories about what people around the United States and the country are going through they're worried about the next week and they're also worried about their long-term future what advice you have for parents about how we help our kids deal with stress and anxiety so one of the important thing I think for parents and for kids is to try to minimize that exposure to things like CNN and other new source or to that you get your information on and listen to that and then let it go if that is constantly playing in the background it's very lucky so far in Arizona I think and looking at places like New York when you see those things happening that's good to minimize that exposure and they have and I think the other is to stress to your kids their kids feel a sense of hopelessness because they don't have a lot of control but there's actually a lot of things right so your kids and all the other kids are not going to school and that's a big deal that's their social recipient rib you ting to society by doing that they're practicing good hand hygiene they're wearing masks right they're all making sense to keep themselves safe and everyone else safe and having that sense of purpose is protective against anxiety also putting things into place that help mitigate anxiety is important so that's you know exercise allowing them time to do some exercise we are getting to that time in Arizona where that will be inside exercise and not so much outside exercise but for little kids it's as easy easy as putting on the music and having a dance party in your home right your older kid it's like videos that are on YouTube or other exercise videos um practicing mindfulness okay so they say your kids watch too much CNN okay I'll tell my neighbor that may have a bye not to do that anymore oops darn it I've learned my first good parenting lesson on this call I may be a violator of that not anymore you know doctor you were talking earlier about the term kind of toxic stress is one of the things that you talked about and and that is an area that that I'm also worked on with the work I've done on bully you know right now I guess it concerns me that we have you know luckily our kids are here with both of their parents and even though they might be watching too much CNN they do have two responsible adults in the house who both do have their jobs and coming out of this crisis and during this crisis you have families who you know the parents have lost their job they make experiencing significant economic challenges and I think pre coronavirus it would be easy for you know someone like us to reach out and help other families but right now when we're going through social distancing it makes it a lot more difficult are there things that we can do to help other families emotionally maybe sending cards or sending little gifts I'm assuming that that's something that that you think would be helpful as well yeah I mean that is helpful for grownups to do to help community agencies that are still providing services and they're still try to help families a lot of it is now removed right remotely provide support only can't do that in person so that's still very important to do to reach is a really helpful for kids I get questions all the time about well what if my kid can't do zoom or they feel socially anxious about doing that writing people letters and cards is great a great way to show people support and to also again cultivate that sense of hey I'm helping my community out alright now here is a question that probably every parent watching this wants to know how much ps4 is too much ps4 for kids and I say that sometimes ps4 video games are there are social opportunities to interact with other kids because they play games in which they strategize other kids and work together or play against each other but what's your advice about gaming and screen time yeah so screen time is a big issue because a lot of the curriculum that's coming out is on Google classroom or zoom or other web platforms I tell parents not to worry about that if you are using it to reach out and connect to others or you are using it to do your schoolwork I wouldn't worry about it this that parents can ease up on themselves a little bit kids are going to be on devices more whenever kids are on the internet though you want to make sure as a parent that you are aware of who they're interacting with the content the nature of the video games I mean if they're on for eight hours a day shooting people on a ps4 game right that's probably not a great idea but having them let off steam having them have social platforms is okay to do because as parents it's hard to be at home all day with hey it's hard for the kids and it's hard for the parents and everyone needs that little breakaway sometimes and that's okay so I have a question having just been out I was out about an hour and a half ago with my daughter to pick up her things from her school because they gathered her her items and and set them outside of the classroom for so we picked them up and it's clear that when you go out which we haven't done much of we've gone to the grocery store one time to get an ice cream cake um but beyond that it is clear that when you do go out now that world has changed she's nine and I'm sure in her mind even though we have not talked a lot about how the world has changed it's obvious from just seeing it you see people with masks on you see the plastic barrier at the grocery store the the dots on the floor it's clear that life has changed now you talk to your kids about a change in the future when we ourselves don't even know what that future looks like just that uncertainty and I think it's important to bring it up to them so you know you can say to her hey I notice when we went to get your stuff that these are the differences like do you have questions about what's going to happen in the future and because kids what is it gonna look like if I do come back here in August right so I think focusing with them on the fact that we don't know everything but then following it up with this is what we do know we that are experts in this area of Epidemiology and pandemics that are working really hard to make sure that when we have a even though that's different you're going to be safe so focusing on the things that we are sure of like we will get back to a new normal right that will happen we may not know what that is going to be like exactly but we'll get there someday day in which everyone will be safe and focusing on those areas that we know I think is important but the worst thing you can do is just ignore it so talking about it bringing it up is great because we also want to model resilience to our kids so the opportunity to build resilience in our children so when you talk about toxic stress and overwhelmed our capacity to deal with it but when parents are present and supportive and therefore their crossdressers in the future they'll be able to deal with them better I have a question about structure our kids had fairly structured lives before the pandemic school obviously five days a week and then basketball practice or gymnastics or swim class or Girl Scouts whatever it may be they had pretty structured lives how much do you recommend that parents try to create regular structure in children's lives you're in the stay-at-home period structure is very important for kids so especially for young kids but for all their kids too of being able to predict what comes next so things that you can keep in place like hey on school nights you know we go to bender up and do school in the morning you know these are the times that we have dinner this is you know what time we go to bed on weekends those types of structure and routines are really important I think again it's about it's like these are the times we're gonna do things but then if you notice hey I'm getting stressed and overwhelmed my child is communicate that and say you know what we're having a stressed day today and we're gonna put on our jammies and we are gonna watch a movie and teaching them again that that's okay you set up expectations for yourself but it's important to check in with yourself and no one you need a break that's great advice I'm really good so I want to ask you a question about something and I think I know what the answer is going to be it's something that moms in particular I think are not good at particularly during times like this when we're working full time we're homeschooling we're making three square meals a day can you talk about the importance of self-care for parents and caregivers of children so hmm as a mom with three little kids that works and you know all my friends moms put way too much pressure and stress on themselves dads do too but mostly moms put a lot of stress pressure and stress on themselves so it is really important to one take time for yourself when you can that may be waking up 15 minutes early before the kids wake up to just have like a right or like I said when you notice your kids are overwhelmed or you're overwhelmed being able to say hey we're gonna take right now and sit and watch this movie so you have that time with them and also decreasing the expectations okay perfect everything right we live in a world of Pinterest parenting now where everything has to be perfect all the time and my friends are always really glad to hear that I feed my kids frozen Dino nuggets nothing that's okay kids like friggin Dino nuggets my husband and I made from scratch mac and cheese one time nobody ate it right so they're okay with those parenting shortcuts and that's complete breakfast for dinner those types of things that kids love that you can do and that are easy that's fine I mean one of the things I find is that you know moms are so stressed I've had moms start to cry when I told them it was okay reduce sandwiches for dinner one night right so decreasing the expectations on all those things and being able to set good boundaries for yourself both said your own anxiety because one of the things that kids look to most for should I be anxious or not is parental and especially moms anxiety so if you can reframe it as a mom as hey me taking care of myself is taking care of my kids that can be really help where do you get frozen yeah that sounds pretty darn good oh they have a Costco sells um and they are tasty we're gonna be good tonight I'm looking forward to that all right doctor thanks so much this has been hugely helpful I gotta be honest I violated almost every piece of good advice you've given so from this day forward I can manage this table buried a lot better in all seriousness it's been great great advice thank you for your time any final piece of life why didn't we didn't cover during this conversation that you want to impart to moms and dads parents single moms single dads and uncles other caregivers anyone that's taking care of kids during this unprecedented difficult time the best piece of advice you can give them I think the most important thing is to be patient and kind with yourself and with your kids your relationship with your child is their biggest protective factor during times of stress so just spending time and being with them is the most important thing you can do doctor thank you very much we may be calling you again for more great advice we appreciate very much yeah no problem thank you for sitting down with me and taking this time thanks I can retain you that was great thank you

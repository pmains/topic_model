a senator in closing here we're running out of time um just kind of what are you seeing as far as our chances to take the senate back in november what are the other races you're looking at i know you made an endorsement in arizona um what are some of the other races where you see some really exciting young new candidates that will be able to be allies of yours in this upcoming session i've always got to start with my home state of missouri because we do have a senate race there charlie and it's a republican seat but we've got to hold it i mean there's no math that allows us to take back the senate if we don't hold missouri and i've endorsed a great candidate there vicky hartzler who i think is going to be a strong america first candidate and i think she's going to win we need her to win

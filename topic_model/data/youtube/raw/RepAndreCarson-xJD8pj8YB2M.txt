we wanted to I want to thank you man for [Music] for being open to this discussion it's so important as we're dealing with our economy and people really struggling you know for those who don't know I'm here with mr. Marty Anderson who was a deputy district director of the Indiana district office of the SBA Small Business Administration he's a scholar he's a gentleman he's very wise and we want to thank you for taking the time in well now you said the bounder stay high for me so that I appreciate well thank you for all the hard work you guys did on the last couple days too I mean thank you obviously been a big push for everybody yeah as this goes forward so well you know we've gotten a lot of questions people have have raised so many important questions I'm gonna I'm gonna get some off of my phone and anyone else who has a question they could submit very very easily very rapidly my first question is how I'm sorry there we are so my first question would be how what businesses are eligible to apply for these loans or could you talk about the loans briefly yes just differ a little bit of background information to anything we're talking about today is available if you go to wws pigo slash coronavirus all the information we're discussing is available to you right there that is probably the fastest way to get the most up-to-date information to as the congressman is aware and everybody is aware this is a very fluid situation with a lot of things afternoon at one time and a lot of information out there to to try to digest at one time a lot of different issues are hitting small business on that note I would like to also mention if you to get the most current updates also if you would go to wws PA / I an and I'll provide all this information to the congressman's office - there is a tab on there for email updates down at the bottom right if you sign up for our email updates once your name is in there as soon as we get new information that's going to be available to you and we will do an email blast to get that out there so I want to get those two things out there first and foremost also we have a vast network of local resources available through the Indiana Small Business Development Center Network our score volunteers Indian has two women's business centers also if you're listening to this and you're not in Indiana those resources are available to you in whatever state you're in also basically go to sba.gov you think your local resources they will connect you to your local district office so regardless of where you're at or what's going on with this being a you know a nationwide issue we're available to you we just want to make sure everybody is aware of that so that being said if you go to SBI do such coronavirus it will list out the eligible businesses which are all small businesses basically general rule what we're showing with the especially with the economy Ares disaster loans is a business as 500 or less employees is is going to be automatically eligible and a business even if they have more than 500 employees would still be vented eligible as long as they fit the SBA size standards not to get real detailed here but also business sizes are governed by what's called the NAICS code which is a North American tested classification system and there's a corresponding size standard that can go up for employees that can go up to 1500 employees so if you have any questions on that please reach out to our office we'll be glad to help you out with that if you're an indiana business we have a website set up for questions which is indiana at sba.gov we're monitoring that not quite 24/7 but we're getting awful close to it so we're trying to make sure you have information instantly so basically any small business is eligible there are some ineligible business out there which would be generally thanks to you think about you know obviously illegal activities if it's gambling activities of lobbying activities government entities would be ineligible so the normal thanks pyramid selling schemes etc so which which nonprofits are eligible and our houses worshipable not-for-profits most not-for-profits are in fact that private not-for-profit are in fact eligible if they've got a letter from IRS seeing the same is a public not-for-profit they may not be if there's a question on account of the not-for-profit about whether or not they can actually apply we tell them this go ahead and make application let us make an eligibility determination based upon the information you give us especially what the CI DL or idle loan as we called it churches themselves or houses of worship would not be but some religious charities may be I guess is eating this way to say that so what what what so how much could I borrow as a as a small business owner I make an injury disaster loan that is out there right now that is available up to two million dollars and that is based upon your need and the information you get us and and how much you feel is necessary and the injuries actually sustained so if a business already has an existing SBA disaster loan do they still qualify yes they can still qualify for this loan there's a lot of things that are happening out there the only sometimes barrier would be is there's a maximum that can be outstanding to a borrower at one time but a lot of those rules are in flux right now too so please please apply let us worry about that part of it so for those who are curious what exactly is an idle and okay and an idle is an economic injury disaster loan it is a working capital loan to be able to provide assistance for working capital needs payroll fixed cost that you have it's not for buying equipment it's not for expansion but it's to pay for those things that you normally would be able to pay for if we hadn't had this disaster so what would the interest rate being on an SBA right now for the Eid alone which is actually a direct loan through SBA is 3.75 percent for businesses 2.75 percent for not-for-profits so how could one use those loans basically is for any working capital needs payroll rent utilities you know your your your fixed cost basically it's not for like says it's not for buying new equipment itself but it's for your everyday working capital needs what fools are required to to file for such a loan funny you should ask that we just went online with a brand new application literally went online last night if you go to the website I gave you a better or virus you click on the learn more there is a link there for the application it is totally online you're gonna answer some questions regarding eligibility you're gonna answer some other questions say you're not in certain industries we just talked about and then it's going to bounce you through the entire application right then and there is there even a cost to apply there is no cost to apply there are no fees involved with caustic to apply so I will warn folks that are listening we've got a lot of calls about shall we say interesting emails that people have gotten regarding applying for the Eid el loans and so always tell folks if anytime it comes up about a cost being involved you are in the wrong place please reach out to SBA and we'll make sure you get to the right reflects there is no cost to apply how long could it sit sort of business or an entity wait to hear back from the SBA wants to loan us loan processes right now the turnaround time they're giving us because they are not processed in local SBA office there are actually processed in our loan disaster loan processing centers they're talking about 21 days to get a actual a decision or approval and I say up to 21 days but they are and then after that once if there's a positive response then it sucks five days for this partial now a lot of people will be asking about the cares act and I know that you get into specifics right now but this just shows if a person wanted to know what kinds of programs would be included in cares for borrowers for beauticians for smoke shops or for anyone what what what what could they expect as far as is different things that are out there environment care Zach watch the website I gave you before as new programs come online those will come there since you say that since actually we talk through it I talked to your staff this morning you will notice now on the e IDL website the $10,000 advance is now part of that application process and can be done right then and there as they go through this process so these things are coming online as we speak the I tell people the I my head is spinning from the from the amount of information that's flowing out well you know we're in the implementation stage of everything involved and we're trying to make everybody's trying to make sure we get this right and everything is going well so watch those websites as soon as things come online we are going to have it out there for you so what what does the money come from a person's existing bank or does the money comes as the loan come from the SBA the eie II idea loan idol I guess I should say is a direct loan from SBA that is what is available right now so that is it does not come from your lender do not go to apply to your lender for the IDL loan go to the website I gave you and apply right there what we're telling folks is we're encouraging everyone who suffered a loss to make sure they go ahead and imply one of the nice things about this they're not obligated to take this loan if they are approved there is always the opportunity to say hey I found something else this works better for me this is a better fit for me or they say you know you've been approved up to you know five hundred thousand dollars well I don't need that much so talk to your to the loan officer who's going to contact you and say hey I can use this amount and then you can always go back later and then pick up you know the additional amounts if you need it so a lot of flexibility here so that that's sba.gov sba.gov sba.gov morning we can't think then we want to open it up you viewer to submit they need now it before we get to that is there a specific reason why mosques synagogues churches temples other houses of worship are prohibited from participating actually that's not probably something I can answer for you other thing that's the statute that's involved right now now someone asked an amount does not have to be put on the app does it amount have to be put on the application know what they're doing they're looking at the information you have on there and and I'm going from what the application version before this one adds ahead of note section where it says you could tell them I would like to have xml what they're going to do is analyze the economic injury you suffered right now and then you're going to get it we have approved you for it amount up to X dollars and then you can decide if that's what you want or if you want to change that amount so master barber Brian Lomax as so is this the bailout or loan that's a very good question for a business person who doesn't want to get into death that's a good question this is a loan it is a economic injury disaster loan so it will have to I mean the idea it will have to be paid back and this is an SBA loan not alone from a banking institution correct this is an SBA disaster direct level at three point seven percent 3.75 3.75 percent okay let's see so someone asked why not give direct grants to businesses that is not something that I can answer I have the tools that we have available to us right now so that the and and why do businesses have to pay interest on loans then again that is the statute that we're given in a program that that SBA has to administer right now okay another question was how about CDBG funding what I'm not familiar with CDBG funding okay what one would raise the the question so as long as the entity isn't involved in gaming and and what else illegal industry gaming pyramid schemes pyramid sales sexually proven nature lobbying they are probably eligible okay so the the the CDBG funding that was referenced was his base out of HUD which would be a totally different that's a totally different program and I would have to refer back to HUD on that one there's a lot of different things out there one thing I should mention the folks do there are a lot of local chambers of commerce different states are doing different programs that there so there may be different funding options available to you so please reach out to to the resource partners we have reach out to your local organizations find out what their what they're offering - so another question now mr. luster Peter lost your ass how much is dedicated towards employees or the small businesses the small businesses is is the borrower they're the recipient of the funding what they do there are eligible uses for that funding and that may be to pay employees salaries health insurance normal working capital cost so so so to clarify the CBG CDBG funding is for cities not related to the SP a another cool another question that was asked when will the Paycheck protection program go live on sba.gov and can you answer that it is starting to come in shortly the last information I had it was going to be out there at least by the end of the week there's a lot of different things going on there so please hang fire and you know don't there right now we're an implementation the same the same person asked is just a part of the idle we talked about no this is a separate program right now the idle loan is the economic injury disaster loan mystery and that's a good program which is done in conjunction with our SBA lender so one person raises the question what what exactly is a small business debt relief program that will be forthcoming and I cannot comment on that until that program goes live do you mind talking about the cares program and what that looks like I really can at this point because that is pending legislation coming through where an employed like I said we're in the implementation stage as soon as it's fully implemented we want to make it I would tell you that SBA wants to make sure we get this right and that is for coming that's why I said you know watch our website keep up today and sign up for our email updates what do you say to those mr. Anderson with your genius and expertise and things again for participating to those smaller businesses to those who are self-employed to there to the esthetician to the massage therapist to the barber to the beauty shop owner to the one who runs a smoke shop to the one who has a food delivery service are these folks included in this program as well if they are a small business that is less than 500 employees who is doing business then they would I they should be eligible for assistance jay-z beauty Pro raises the question how about the business qualify and be approved for one of these loans basically you need to go to SBA website SP ad ago slash coronavirus click on the apply here fill out the ephraim the application online and once it's submitted then it will go into the queue for processing another question that's been raised are they any specific resources available for new businesses that have been in the process of opening but opening has been postponed because of a lockdown good question we have our normal 7a loan applications that are out there and available to small businesses we have our resources available for counseling and training through the SBDC network through the score network for women's business centers here in Indiana all can help them to try to if they need to adjust their business plan if they need to maybe change how they're going to do things if they need to update projections financial information etc all those things are still available to them and then I would tell them we have if you're looking for a lender who maybe can can help you sponge or startup which is a different program please go to its wwsz sba.gov / lender match lender matches if just to get is is like a lending tree for small business owners or basically we can they can put on they go they log into the system they put in some basic information about what they need financing for what they're trying to do lenders can then see that and then they can actually respond back to a perspective borrower they we're interested in providing this financing for you biggest things small businesses can do right now whether there's in the startup phase or actually you know looking to obtain financing make sure your financial information is order make sure your business information in this order so once you have a request for information you can provide that and get the ball rolling one more question know you can be a sole proprietor and use and have your SSN which would would still be available to you okay cheese Louise is saying the city of Boston and Chicago the cities of Austin in Chicago are using CDBG programs for small businesses we can have an additional reply for that she's the leads if if you want to reach out to either my office or another office thank you very much trip let us know let's open the floor for some questions anyone does anyone have a question please on those questions for other cities to please reach out to the local SBA office we're at all all 50 states so and sometimes we have multiple office so reach out to your local office to they may know some things that are going on also okay okay master barber says I think that the term loan is what's going to scare small businesses great point very good point very good point how could you blame the morning how could you blame oh yeah right now that's why I mean there's very flexible repayment terms I'm sure like I said this is gonna be a very fluid situation I will tell you with the EITI DL loan there is a 12 month deferment for the first payment so you're gonna have a year before you're gonna have to make that first payment and and and and and and and the length of the loan is that specific to the need or it's gonna be specific to the repayment ability of the borrower but that term can go up to 30 years okay healing healing roots raises an important question when will we know more about the cares Act being implemented need that information is coming out constantly watch our website reach out to us as that information will sign up again I can't emphasize enough sign up for our email updates as soon as things are implemented we will send that information out and if you just kind of question you know use our Indiana we were monitoring that Indiana at sba.gov email address you can still even though we're working remotely as you can see in the background I have my splash off this old my old daughter and this now has been converted so we're working area you're lucky so far the dogs haven't come in and barked or tried to barge it on a conversation either but just be aware that you know we're also even though we're not there our phone number which is three one seven two two six seven two seven two is still available please leave your name and number we will have a staff get back to you or monitor an email constantly well they got live bodies available there who respond well we also let people know to be very patient marty meses program rolls out it will take some time we appreciate the FDA for being available but we do know that small business owners who are already trying to navigate around enough don't want to have the extra burden of taking an additional loan if a loan at all that's why as additional programs come online additional informations come online so I tell folks apply now for this once you get there's going to be a lag before you get approved if something better comes along or a different Avenue comes available to you you know I say hey I don't want to do this I'm going to do this instead I also tell folks if they have questions if they've applied already or they're getting ready to fly and they need help there's also the customer its disaster customer service at sba.gov can inquire about your application and get other information also we were in junior high before we could work you know we were selling candy and bing belts and CDs he's a renowned barber in the country barber - a lot of celebrities barber to myself I need him because I haven't been able to get my hair cut I think he's I think he's he's the best his name is Marvin Taylor he raises an important question he says many small businesses are already struggling one of the long-term disadvantages that's a great question as far as the long-term disadvantages for I mean obviously the disadvantage would be you're taking on additional debt there's no thing about that right now this debt is for from making sure you keep your doors open what we're betting is when the economy comes back you'll be able to continue to be able to make your debt obligations this is a long-term fixed low interest rate financing that we can spread out over a great time so hopefully you know this will just get you through this rough time and you know you could always if things improve you can always pay it back early there's no prepayment penalty there's none of those offers then they're like said now we're giving you a year to start so hopefully that wool will help you get through some uncertain times you know obviously the American spirit and the American entrepreneur and small business folks you know that's we say it's the engine that drives the economy so they're you know we have to be optimistic that we're gonna get through this that's so true that's who I'm I'm hopeful now now it's important to know that the cares Act has already passed in Congress yes you know what what would you say that the SBA loan is is competitive with what banking institutions uh until we get you know everything set up I would say our loan is probably going to be better than some of those deals okay but until everything comes on board I can't tell you that okay she's the weakest she has a consulting business that contracts with local governmental entities some entities are using force measures to nullify contracts any advice for how to pivot with contracts falling apart we're falling to my first recommendation was we get to one of you our resource partners to try to adjust your business plan for those things try to diversify your customer base try to change your marketing plan maybe so if you're not dependent you know well I say don't ever put all your eggs in one basket sure you have a good we call it business mix that you're doing private commercial governmental that way if there's a up in one there may be a down you know down in one or maybe an up in another we anticipate we would also say you know maybe look at the option of becoming a government federal government contractor you know I know there's going to be procurement opportunities that are popping up for small business folks that's also a thing that that SBA advocates and another thing that we can help you through that process if you need information on that then again go to sba.gov and then click on the federal contracting tab Indiana also has a a resource partner funded by the Department of Defense the Defense Logistics called the Indiana PTAC

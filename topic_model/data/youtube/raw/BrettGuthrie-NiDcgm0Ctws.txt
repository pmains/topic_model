well thank you I chaired again I appreciate the opportunity to be here and preciate all of our witnesses here this morning I thank you for holding this important hearing and I share your concern about you faithing trends that have emerged in the United States in recent years the US Surgeon General has called a cigarette usage by youth and epidemic and warned that it threatens decades of progress towards ensuring that fewer young people use tobacco the most recent data from the National Youth tobacco survey show that twenty seven and a half percent of use and of course you said did you think it's higher than that from the earth your sample there reported using these cigarettes compared with twenty point eight percent in 2018 we do know it's more and the market as has increased the marketing of e-cigarette products to children must stop and youth access to e-cigarette products must be prevented this will require an all-hands-on-deck approach from all parties including the federal government manufacturers and retail stores we've already made strides to curb youth access and tobacco since we last held a hearing in September in December as mentioned by the chair Congress passed and President Trump signed into law a legislation to raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products including e-cigarettes from 18 to 21 On January the second 2020 FDA issued guidance by analyzing in its enforcement policy regarding unauthorized flavored cartridge-based these cigarettes that appeal to children including fruit and mint under this policy as of February the six 2020 tomorrow companies must cease manufacturing distribution and sale of unauthorized flavored cartridge-based a cigarette other than tobacco or menthol or risk FD enforcement action this guidance also gives the FDA the ability to pivot its its enforcement priorities as needed I hope to hear from our witnesses today whether this enforcement guidance will effectively target youth access or if there are other or more effective steps the FDA should take either alone or in conjunction with the industry further according to FDA's new guidelines manufacturers like the ones before us today must submit pre market tobacco product applications to FDA by May 12 2024 deem tobacco products including e-cigarettes they're on the market as of August the 8th 2016 through their applications manufacturers or importers must demonstrate to the FDA among other things that marketing of new tobacco products would be appropriate for the protection of public health as part of this determination FDA must consider the risk and benefits of the product to the population as a whole including users and non-users of tobacco products if manufacturers do not submit their pre market applications by May 12th any products for which an application is not submitted must be pulled from the market these legal and regulatory developments will drastically change Issa grant landscape in the coming months and year while these actions are aimed at reducing the attraction of e-cigarettes to youth and protecting broader public health wide bands and airing of what is legally available in the legitimate marketplace will almost certainly ship product use for existing users to other products that are still available we must be vigilant and respond to this potential shift in utilization which may result in an increase of black market or counterfeit demand for e-cigarettes we must ensure there are efforts to protect our youth and the broader public health do not inadvertently create a bigger and more complicated problem though not directly related today's hearing I'll continue to be concerned about the lung injury outbreak associated with vaping and e-cigarette use these illnesses must be have been closely associated with black market products in THC or marijuana derivative while the number of cases appear to have peaked when this subcommittee held its first Easter ed hearing in September we have since learned that according to the Center for Disease Control an illness outbreak was strongly linked to vitamin E acetate addictive and additive to THC or marijuana cigarettes we need to more clearly understand the cause of these illnesses it is my understanding that each cigarette manufacturers have taken have taken and are continuing to take their own actions to prevent youth prevent youth access to their products this hearing can serve as a constructive discussion first to us to learn more about what these manufacturers are doing to prevent youth utilization of these cigarettes before I conclude I would like to make a quick comment and recognize the subsidiary Reynolds that is located in my district it's Kentucky bio processing Kentucky ball processing was founded in Owensboro Kentucky with a group of visionary local entrepreneurs who wanted to find ways to use the tobacco plant that is constructive to public health and in doing so they found that was a host for growing vaccines to the Ebola a population that was used in emergency situations and the previous a bull outbreak and is now working to address potential of vaccines with the coronavirus I am glad that kbp is working on alternative uses for tobacco in order to better America's public health I think our witnesses for being here today and being part of this important discussion and I yield back

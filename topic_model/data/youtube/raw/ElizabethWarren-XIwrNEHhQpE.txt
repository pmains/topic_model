last week the wealthiest person in the world launched into space this is not space exploration for scientific discovery one small step for man it was a thrill ride we had so much fun today and look i have nothing against hobbies i have nothing against space i love star trek next generation i've got a bone to pick with rich people who avoid paying their fair share i want to thank every amazon employee and every amazon customer because you guys paid for all this paid for it with low wages and your union busting tactics let me break it down jeff bezos didn't pay any income taxes in 2007 and 2011. elon musk zero in 2018. in fact from 2014 to 2018 the 25 richest americans got 400 billion dollars richer but paid only 3.4 percent of that in federal income taxes the rest of americans pay an average of about 7.2 percent of their total wealth in taxes every year billionaires clearly have the money to go to the moon and back yet they use loophole after loophole to avoid investing in the nation that gave them the opportunity to make their wealth in the first place i say it is time for a wealth tax in america before the billionaires start crying about this let's put it in perspective my bill would tax just two cents per dollar on people with a net worth above 50 million and a few cents more for billionaires that means jeff bezos would pay 5.4 billion dollars of his estimated net worth of 181 billion and still have plenty of money to spare imagine what we could do for the wealth tax we could fund president biden's agenda to build back better policies like expanding the caregiving economy from child care for our little ones to nursing homes for our loved ones money to rebuild our roads and bridges and to fund tuition-free public college and technical schools investments we can make in all of us we build a future for all our kids right here on earth and we can make this government work not just for the rich and powerful we can make it work for everyone

I rise in opposition to H.R 26 and to its very name because it is not about what House Republicans claim it's about because what they claim it is about isn't a thing what this bill is about is an assault on the health rights equality and dignity of American women and the people who provide their reproductive health care it's an assault we've seen in my home state of Texas where women having miscarriages are being turned away from the hospitals and told to come back when they are closer to dying where doctors fear and are told that they cannot meet the standard of care for their patients providers and patients are afraid of misleading bills like this one criminalizing Health Care but of course that's the point isn't it I stand here today and I will stand here every day to oppose this bill and others like it to talk about the real Health Care crisis facing women today and to urge my colleagues to vote no thank you and I yield back

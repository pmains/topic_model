gentleman from California mr. Kaufman is recognized I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and I rise to support this important legislation speaker members I remember very clearly when President Clinton asked Vice President Gore to conduct an effort to reorganize government at the federal level to make it more efficient to look for ways in which we could cut down on bureaucratic red tape and to try to find other efficiencies that exist and this was but one of many recommendations that Vice President Gore and his group came up with mr. speaker the success of the Bureau of Reclamation to convert portions of the arid West into the largest and most advanced agriculture economy in the world cannot be overstated nowhere is that more evident than in California San Joaquin Valley the most productive agricultural region in the world we grow 60 percent of the nation's fruits and vegetables healthy diet good nutritional food for America's dinner table besides leading in so many other commodities that we grow as a matter of fact it helps the balance of payments California's agriculture economy forty-four percent of it is part of our international trade it would not be possible though without the complex and well-planned set of dams and canals and other structures that have been operated successfully for generations generations however over time the aging infrastructure needs to be repaired needs to be updated many of the reclamation projects when they were originally authorized by Congress and the funds were appropriated were intended intended to be turned over to local districts to operate once once the projects were repaid and that is an important caveat clearly there was a requirement in the authorization that these projects be repaid and many of these projects around the country are in various being repaid after the projects operation and maintenance responsibilities have been fully transferred the actual ownership would then be transferred as well the transfer of title to local operators I think have numerous benefits to water users and to the taxpayers it can reduce paperwork staff time both at the federal local levels reduce federal backlog of infrastructure repair projects and help improve the environment for Public Safety because yes the environmental laws would still be in place and I can tell you in California our environmental laws are stronger than the federal level so I don't believe that's truly an issue and frankly we know what the status of our debt in this country is and we know that so many of our departments and agencies and in the case of federal reclamation projects there is not sufficient funding to do the repair and maintenance that is necessary it's just very simple the money's not there and yet these aging projects are continuing to try to operate as best they can a transfer can also provide more flexibility to finance local upgrades and repairs because it provides an asset to be used as collateral when we passed the settlement agreement from the Friant Water users as an example with the NRDC part of the caveat was is that the foreign waters users would be able to repair the Friant current canal keeping water facilities in good conditions particularly those that recharge groundwater is critical not only to the San Joaquin Valley where I represent that grows this abundance incredible cornucopia food that's on America's dinner table every night but today there are large sections of the Friant current canal that stretch from the Friant Dam all the way down to Bakersfield that have less than 60 60 % of its capacity to move water through and so last year when we had an abundance of water almost two hundred percent above average that water could it be used to recharge the groundwater in imports part of Tulare and and Kern County but because we couldn't move the water through that portion that has subsided that is cracked and that is in badly need of state of repair we were not able to move that water that the facility initially has the capacity to move that's one example there are many other examples importantly a title transfer does not ultimately change the way the facilities are operated it just doesn't since 1995 the Bureau of Reclamation working with interested stakeholders has worked to improve the title transfer process but I believe it's very important to note that however specific congressional authorization which this legislation attempts to provide some authorization is still needed to transfer the title of any facility no matter how small and allows a separate administrative processes established by law to allow the transfer of such ownership that's what this legislation attempts to do this legislation therefore creates an administrative process while maintaining the ability of Congress yet to have the final word and that is to disapprove of any proposed transfer by passing a resolution of disapproval so if the secretary in fact works such an agreement moves forward with the transfer of the title and Congress says no we want to determine these on a case-by-case basis this legislation will allow that to happen gives Congress the final word and a NEPA like process must be a part of that administrative effort to in fact successfully transfer the title so it's got to be repaid you've got to have a neat polite process and guess what Congress has the final word this would significantly streamline this legislation title transfer process to vest the federal government of unnecessary liability and allow these projects to run I think more effectively and with better outcomes when local water districts that are publicly owned that have their own elected boards have their own fiduciary responsibility to provide water to the area they serve to make good cost-effective decisions on behalf of the water interests that they serve whether they be farmers or whether they be communities and it's all of the above so this legislation is supported by many organizations it is bipartisan and I thank that author of the legislation to help facilitate legislation that will allow reclamation to improve a title transfer process which is not a new idea it goes back to the Clinton administration for these reasons I support this legislation I urge my colleagues do the same and I thank the gentleman for yielding me time and I yield back that balance of my time

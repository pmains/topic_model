bay welcome back election results confirmed by the California Secretary of State this week show that ro Khanna won more votes than congressional incumbent Mike Honda in the 17th congressional district primary Cana collected 39.1 percent of the vote Honda 37.4 percent of the boats now what does this mean come the November election NBC various political analyst Larry Kirsten joins us and of course these two will run opposed to each other in November but this was not the number we expected no no this was different than anything a lot of people expected it was an incredibly interesting election for so many reasons look an incumbent Scott they rarely lose elections especially in the primary that's not the place to lose in this case with the 17th congressional district a challenger from the Democratic Party bested the Democratic incumbent and that's saying a lot and this is by the way only part one of a two-part drama why because California has that crazy top two primary system where these two Democrats will face off yet again in the fall yeah i mean you say you say lose technically didn't lose in the sense that he got fewer votes but they go together into the november how is this going to be different because they ran opposed to each other less number last time around yeah the 2014 primary honda clobbered connick clobbered kanha by 20 points but in November Connor closed that gap to three-point-six percent small deficit now for that reason the count of folks jeans they're pretty happy after all the Connor campaign this time around did much better than the primary campaign of two years ago and by the way as an aside this is just driving people crazy for the Democrats you know the fact that two Democrats are opposing each other has caused I mean heartburn for many of the areas of leading party leaders but but that could happen that can happen with California's truly unique well top two front we can we can say a Democrats going to win you know I mean so they've got that that party as I mean it's stunning from two years ago I how much more could kind of collect and how is he able I mean hun has been in office what 16 years the incumbent almost all almost always with but there are three factors potentially unrelated but Colin come together here if you will that really made this race different from 2014 first kana didn't have to spend money and energy branding himself in effect look he's been running against Honda since 2012 this time around he's a known quantity second kana tweaked his approach in 2014 he presented himself as a much-needed high-tech voice for the valley this time around no no no he mind the district through dozens and I mean dozens of coffee clashes and meetings throughout the district in all kinds of local communities you know what Scott you know this I know this people like attention from those folks seeking office and and third Mike Honda she's an ethics purgatory and by that I mean ethics purgatory the Congressional Ethics Committee is considering charges against Hana concerning inappropriate use of office personnel for campaign activities that's a no-no now the lack of resolution by this committee who it leaves a dark cloud over Honda which is terribly unfortunate because we know that for many people charges of improper ethics unfortunately in their minds translate to guilt even if it hasn't been proven what do we watch now obviously the ethics issue but what else do we watch me now in November okay some considerations money will kana stunning win make it easier to raise campaign funds well it also make it harder for a honda to raise money second turn out nearly a quarter of the voters in june well there were Republicans which of the two candidates will they favored in november and yes that point you raised a minute ago third the ethics charge will the ethics committee get off its Duff clear honda of the charges will it reprimand him for the charges or remain in limbo still honda needs the charges to be dismissed for this issue to go away so you put all this together this has become a classic race nobody really expected they're watching it all across the country how it turns out we made one last question for you Larian that is at this top two things relatively new so we are talking there are only two candidates right no other candidates Green Party no Republican Party no independence two candidates yes and this idea of two candidates from the same party is growing we're seeing more and more in the primary where the second major party is left out the minor parties don't have a chance and that's uh that's what's happened

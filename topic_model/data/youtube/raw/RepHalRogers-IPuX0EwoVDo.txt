i thank my distinguished colleague for yielding mr speaker the uh the border war if you want to call it the war on the border uh with mexico now is more than trying to stop illegal aliens from coming across it's trying to prevent the flood of drugs coming across and more importantly keep trying to prevent the spillover of the violence between the drug cartels in mexico competing and fighting for the control of that trade into the u.s from spilling over into the u.s 90 of the cocaine coming into this country comes through mexico comes across that border and no wonder the drug cartels in mexico are warring with each other and the government in mexico to control that trade because there's billions and billions of dollars involved of course but already those drug cartels have infiltrated most of the american cities most of the large cities in this country have cells are pieces of that drug cartel organization now in their communities you read about killings and murders and hostage taking in places like birmingham and atlanta and chicago and new york and of course phoenix and all of the cities of the west they're here now this bill doesn't contain one penny for the fbi the drug enforcement administration the alcohol tobacco firearms organization all of the law enforcement groups in this country are shut out in this bill and this rule seals it so we can't get into it and we're ignoring with our heads in the cancun sand the cartels in mexico that are eating away in this country young people in our cities as well as all people and so i urge that we defeat the previous question so that we can be allowed to bring these matters to this bill and then failing that i would hope that we would defeat this rule because there's no point in sealing us to where we don't have a voice for this extremely important gentleman's time

gentleman from minnesota mr emmer is now recognized for five minutes thank you chairwoman waters uh thank you for holding this hearing and thank you chair powell for your testimony and your time here today financial freedom is american freedom and frankly americans do not have the financial and economic freedom they need to invest in themselves their businesses and their families unfortunately americans are too busy making ends meet to focus on anything else inflation is running rampant across the united states with consumer prices rising 8.6 percent in the past year the largest price increase since 1981 from fuel to meat to housing my constituents and all americans are suffering at the hands of this hidden tax except it's not so hidden anymore it's punching americans in the face as my friend mr style put it yesterday so how did we get here it's pretty simple we gave up american energy independence we locked down our citizens and businesses for nearly two years pumped the economy with well over five trillion dollars in what called stimulus funds and now as we recover from the pandemic we simply do not have the energy resources necessary to meet the increased consumer demand there's a history of democrat policies we can point to that put us in this position from refusing to adopt an all-of-the-above energy strategy to recklessly passing two trillion in partisan spending through the american rescue plan despite the fact that nearly one trillion of bipartisan relief was unspent but the bottom line is we need solutions now because inflation is beating up the american people we have to wake up and realize that we cannot continue these spend your way to prosperity policies every day inflation threatens the financial security of american families of our constituents we need solutions let me just return to my point about the spending in december 2020 we'd authorized nearly four trillion dollars in bipartisan coveted relief yet just three months later democrats pushed through another 1.9 trillion dollar with hardly any oversight mechanism included even though a quarter a quarter of all coveted relief remained unspent when president biden was recently asked of the 1.9 trillion spending bill caused inflation he said he didn't think the bill had even a minor impact and called the idea quote bizarre chair powell do you agree with the president's conclusion that the 1.9 trillion dollars american that was included in the american so-called rescue plan and not even a minor impact on the inflation we're seeing today uh i'm sorry i i'm not i wouldn't comment on what any other elected if what any elected official said and it's really not up to us to score uh fiscal uh interventions again sir i if you would uh respectfully i'm not asking you to comment on what the president said i'm asking you personally i do you believe that the 1.9 trillion dollar american rescue plan did not even have a minor impact on the inflation we're seeing today so we we didn't comment on the tax cuts and jobs act we didn't comment on the cares act and we won't comment on on that active from that it's interesting sir that you won't comment on this but you were more than willing a year ago to talk about inflation is some transitory something that uh everyone is acknowledged now it's going to be here for a while uh even though it seems like the president's buildback better package this massive spending package is dead on arrival certain elements might not be dead chair powell do you have concerns that if congress injects a new round of stimulus into the current economy it could and in fact will add to the inflation we're seeing today again i'm really it's not our role to give you advice on what to do you know we we report to congress not the other way around it's we're sticking to our our mandate and our mission and and uh we have a lot of work to do on that front and uh not really giving you advice on what you should be doing we take fiscal policy as something that comes to us and we we deal with it as part of everything else i'm very disappointed sir i mean you are supposed to be in charge of the monetary policy of this country you're now embarking on raising interest rates because that's the only tool you think you have left uh this is not just a dog chasing its tail anymore sir this is a dog that's starting to devour its tail and it's back end because of the death that we are carrying i want to thank you you acknowledge we're in a bad spot we're knowingly walking toward an even worse inflation a recession and god forbid food shortages yet we're relying on old monetary policy tools to keep us from falling off a cliff sure we can raise interest rates over and over but the only way to curb in a disaster this bad is to raise interest rates to a catastrophic level or as like larry summers suggested we allow unemployment to go to historical highs it's not feasible we need to put ourselves on a strict spending diet and we have to have strict oversight on the funds that congress has already allocated to make sure not even one single dollar is going to waste and we need to put control back in the hands of small businesses on main street thank you

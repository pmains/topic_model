when it came to the first of all welcome mr. secretary when it came to the caring for our veterans bill we had consulted with the VSOs and in fact got supportive 26 of VSO as we actually supported with consulted with you and the VA to make sure this stuff would work members on this committee and members off this committee and in your written testimony you said the VA believes the future of community care should include 8 tenants those tenants are improved veterans Choice of community providers in meeting their health care needs to simplify veterans eligibility for the folks on Veterans clinical needs to pave the way for consolidation of all community care programs add convenient care benefits set timely payment standards include provider agreements with flexible payment rates a streamlined how we pay for care including care in state veterans homes permanent medical records sharing in the network when we need when needed for veterans care and addresses clinical staffing shortages through expansion of Graduate Medical Education and by improving VA hiring and retention of staff I would just tell you that the caring for veterans Act checks every one of those boxes and it checks every one of those boxes because when we drafted it we had those tenants in mind and so I would really look forward and I think I look forward to a strong press release and support of this bill and I'll tell you why because there's a certain amount of frustration as you can tell for Senator Moran and Chairman myself and others on this committee that that you've been silent okay so thank you section 211 of the accountability requires a VA to track the usage of new authorities granted to you and we've given you a lot of new authorities and over the past year thanks to the good work or the chairman when will we see this report the report was due in December of 2017 so so I apologize that it is not there the staff has had extreme difficulty tracking what you've required in that report prior to the implementation of the Accountability Act so I've instructed give whatever data they have to you and tell you what data they don't like when when can we expect it I'm gonna say is it reasonable to ask for two weeks two weeks it is we'll hold you to it your predecessors have testified that leadership includes working with underperforming employees to make them better at their jobs rather than just firing them is that your philosophy - yes it is it that that every good manager works with their employees to make them better to give them feedback when a employee deviates from a professional moral standard sometimes you can't coach them sometimes you have to help them find believe yeah well I think I think that we have room for improvement because when you look at our employee engagement scores they're not improving the way that I believe that they should so we're relooking at our efforts to do that better okay on the choice bill that was passed last August Congress expanded your direct hiring Authority for positions which there was a shortage of highly qualified candidates am i correct the vs - still not use this authority to hire yeah when you look at my understanding senator is is that the direct hire Authority was given to us for medical center directors and network directors yes and I think unintentionally it capped the salary that we're able to offer at a at a salary that is lower than what we currently offer so we've not been able to utilize a direct hire Authority in the way that I believe it was intended to be used so how can that how can that how can that be how can that be fixed of that area so our local Fisk Qi rule no you're gonna have to do it legislatively but it's a very small technical change that we've given some time okay and and it it gave you authority on those positions but it also gave you authority for employees you would deem critical yes and we've gone to OPM with 15 different critical occupations that they have agreed to move forward with us on direct hire authority that I believe we will start to implement in the neck several weeks so okay so we've had the conversation before I had a town hall meeting in Great Falls Montana Monday I will tell you the first question that came up was workforce vane vacancies this is just Montana so worried about being self centered on yes but I'm I'm I just want to tell you that we're in a crisis and we may be in a crisis in Alaska and we may be in a crisis in North Carolina and every other state - I don't know that but I can tell you in Montana we're in a crisis let me give you an example Billings supposed to have seven docks in that clinic we've got four and two of those are looking for another position you know well the overworked employees they tend to hit the road you know and so my question is is is what's the problem I've talked to you many times I know you're committed to this but it doesn't seem it seems like it's getting worse in fact it doesn't seem like it in my state it's getting worse yeah well in Montana as you know you have an eleven point two percent turnover rate of your employees but for physicians as twenty three percent that's that's a problem you have a twenty four percent vacancy rate for practically all that so so you're what can we do to fix it here's what what are you doing to fix here's what we're doing first of all we have to we have to hire more staff we have to make sure that we keep them we have announced for Montana a increase of up to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars for primary care physicians in educational debt reduction for nurses I'm sorry for psychologists a and nurse practitioners a ten thousand dollar hiring bonus and for social workers of five thousand dollar hiring bonus that's a beginning to start to address people to look at the VA as a place as a place to come to work then we have to as you said if we can't fully staff it puts more pressure on our current staff that are there and so it's a it's a vicious cycle so we're working to recruit so thank you for that but time is of the essence and I don't speak for Senator rounds he'll speak for himself on this as you well know there was a House bill it was going to have a RAK done they could literally shut down down every facility in Montana if they did a brac because we got no staffing right this is really really really important it is oh yes it is thank you

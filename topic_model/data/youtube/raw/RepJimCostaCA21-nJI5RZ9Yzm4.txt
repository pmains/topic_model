mr. speaker I draw attention to the human right to have water to sustain ourselves Thomas Jefferson once said about this precious resource water that when the wells dry we will know the worth of water in the San Joaquin Valley I can tell you we know the worth of water it is the lifeblood of our Valley communities and our agriculture economy we like to say where water flows food grows the valley is one of the most advanced agricultural regions of the world we produce over 250 crops that provide over 50% of the United States fruits and vegetables on America's dinner table every night the bounty of nature of food that we produce is coaxed out of the ground by some of the hardest-working people you'll ever meet farmers and farm workers and it relies on a clean reliable water resource an America's food supply make no mistake about it is a national security issue I've spent decades working for common-sense short and long term solutions to address California's broken water system when I served in the California Legislature I carried multiple bonds that were passed that provided over two billion dollars for crucial water projects and while in Congress I've advanced legislation that have improved water supplies and funding for projects in many different ways the North Valley Regional recycle program which helps irrigate over 44,000 acres in western Merced in Stanislaus County local and recycled water the San Luis Delta Mendota inner ty project which brings up to over 35,000 over 35,000 acre feet of water annually to most of our rural valley communities to advance efforts that are so important that make a difference in addition that doesn't include the success of the lynne act bipartisan legislation which i helped lead through four years of tough negotiations it became law in 2016 the win Act creates more flexibility to move water based on real time water realities and provides authorization for five hundred and sixty three million and federal funds for water projects like expanding Shasta reservoir like raising San Luis reservoir and like creating temperance flat this justice month legislation that I introduced allows local water districts to improve the efficiency of dams that pass the house I call on the Senate to move this bill to the President's desk in the valley this would allow the Merced Irrigation District to advance a project to raise the spillway at new exchequer dam this would increase supply of water over 56,000 acre feet of water much-needed however it seems like every time we're able to increase our drought resilience state or federal regulators decide that they need to take more water from the valley it's wrong and it's unfair the most recent attempt to repurpose the valley water supplies came earlier this month by the California State Water Board staff released the final draft of a plan that is simply unacceptable and I must say it's pretty easy to reallocate water when it's not your water supply and that's what the State Board did the plan if adopted will effectively double the amounts of water that must remain in the San Joaquin River tributaries this will force thousands of acres of farmland out of production ravaging communities across the valley and weaken weakening America's food security and its supply the board staff claims these changes are necessary to prevent total collapse of the fisheries in the Delta but this plan will not save fish sadly it does not address the other problems facing the fisheries namely rising water temperatures lack of food habitat and increased predators none of which have anything to do with the water flows this plan is in direct conflict with another California law that mandates what we must use our groundwater more sustainably which it must be done we must come into balance however it's impossible to use groundwater sustainability when we must pump groundwater to replace the surface water that is being taken away these actions are in conflict it doesn't make any sense our agricultural economy is showing tremendous innovation growing twice as much food a fraction of the water that we used to receive but we have reached a tipping point a point where the taking of the resource outstrips our ability to innovate without water we cannot feed America or maintain our quality quality of life our sustenance our valley our nation need long-term solutions that provides for reliable sources of safe drinking water water for our agricultural industries as well as for our cities we in the valley and the San Joaquin Valley will continue to fight for water we need to grow America's food because in the valley we know the worth of water we know it when the well runs dry as president Thomas Jefferson said so in conclusion we must work together in California to fix our broken water system for the long-term benefits of America's food supply I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back

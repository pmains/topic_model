mr. Sablan I thank you very much mr. chairman I'm mr. secretary welcome and leadeth you get mods for your service to our country um it was people like Senator Akaka sure now mr. Miller and your predecessor mr. Solis who pushed on enacted public law one tenders 229 which extended to federalize immigration to the Northern Mariana Islands and the law established a five-year transition period during which foreign workers were to be replaced by US workers um this transition period x ends this December but the law for saw the possibility that five years might not be enough time so the Secretary of Labor so you were given the authority to extend the transition period if and i quote necessary to ensure an adequate number of workers will be available for legitimate businesses end of quote and the Secretary was required to make a decision one way or the other mr. secretary within hundred eighty days of the end of the transition period so I asked we ask the question what kind of progress have we made in the Northern Marianas over the past four years when the period transition periods began in 2009 there were over 17,000 245 foreign workers according to the GAO as of October of 2013 or the Department of Homeland Security said there were 9,000 617 so I think that is significant progress in getting to entirely US workers but I also think it is clear that getting to zero by the end of this year is not possible which is that is why I wrote to your predecessor in this februari of twenty thirteen almost fourteen months ago actually asking for a decision to extend the period the extension period and I asked for that decision to be made sooner rather than later because leaving a decision to the last minute lease businesses uncertain whether they would have an adequate number of workers live make a living the decision to the NR transition period also have less number of say consumers in the Northern Marianas and and so if the businesses are done in bed the investor don't create jobs and that plays hell on an economy trying to pull yourself out of a deep recession that's the economic argument now there's the humanitarian concern as well because waiting on to the last minute leaves 9670 in foreign workers hanging in the breeze many of these people have lived in the northern marianas for decades they have families and homes there if they have to be gone by the end of this year we owe them to courtesy mr. secretary of letting them know as soon as possible they need to start looking for work elsewhere selling their belongings and moving their families their kids but for 14 months your department has been unable or unwilling sir to make a decision no mr. secretary I know that the Northern Marianas does not have an admirable history that when it comes to foreign workers mr. Miller would tell you that himself but it is possible that their department does not trust the Northern Marianas will replace foreign workers with us workers there were just buying time but I remind you sir of the onion number foreign workers permit it is not a decision of the Northern Marianas government the Department of Homeland Security sets that number and Eric and the law requires fewer and fewer each year for this homeless for this year Homeland Security set the number at 14,000 that's a long way from zero I also want to remind you sir that my office is reach out to your department to ask that you provide technical assistance to the Northern Marianas and advice on how to train up US workers we really want your help we want to complete the transition that public law one tenders 229 requires but we need to do it in a way that keeps our economy whole and does not put the jobs of us workers in that economy at risk and that uncertainty in the absence of your decision sir is not helping so I hope you would take my my words to heart mr. secretary I'm not asking a question sir I'm just making a statement hoping that you'd hear us out and then make the decision soon having said that mr. chair and I also i fully support increasing the federal minimum wage to look ten dollars intentions and i know that may sound strange coming from someone who asked for a delay in the minimum wage in my district i did so because in my view the rate increase in the northern mariana since 2008 needed to be tempered but i have never wavered in my commitment to see workers in a northern man has received the full minimum wage and i know there will be glad to see it increased to ten dollars in ten cents an hour I'm mr. chairman that's my statement thank you I thank the gentleman dr. Bhushan thank you very much why Sir Thank You mr. secretary my dad was a coal miner and I I was a physician and that will lead into some of the questions that I have regarding I'm concerned about the scientific basis upon which MSHA's proposed respire bulldust rule is predicated on and the availability of technology to reduce dust concentrations two levels contained in the proposal Gao is currently conducting analysis of this rule to include a review of the technological and other options available for lowering the level lowering the level of dust and coal mines and the cost advantages and disadvantages of these technologies do you think you'd be willing to take into consideration all the relevant information and conclusions for the pending GAO study before finalizing that rule

Richmond mark these he is with me now he's a Democrat from Texas and last week announced his support for an impeachment inquiry and sir thank you so much for joining us hey Briana so I do I want to ask you about this whistleblower first though tell us about this decision that you made to support impeachment what I mean what was the thing that pushed you over the line yeah no I was very disturbed when I initially heard the reports that Trump may have you know tried to set up a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government so to sort of advance his own political career and make it easy for him to get reelected in 2020 I thought that was just reprehensible you know and I think that he knowingly if this is true I think that he did it on purpose I mean I was in the Ukraine probably about three years ago four years ago and one of the Ukrainian elected officials there told us that this is the most corrupt place in the world and surely Trump has been given security briefings about the Ukraine and knew that if he made that sort of a deal with the Ukrainians maybe they would bite on it because of the level of corruption there I'm very disturbed by that and I thought personally from from this what again what I read and what I heard on Capitol Hill that it warranted an impeachment inquiry and I stand by that now to this whistleblower the president is attacking the whistleblower his supporters are attacking the whistleblower do you worry about the safety of the whistleblower yeah do you worry about the safety of the whistleblower and you know are worried about the mental stability of the president I mean he should know better than to try to attack the witness I mean he has called this wouldn't this whistleblower a spy he said that they should be executed I'm like really Donald Trump you think that this person should be should be executed like like you're a member of the Mafia like these are the people that provided cement for your Trump Tower back in the 1980s I mean this is not you shouldn't be taken a cue from the people that provide it submit for your Trump Tower you should be upholding the laws of the Constitution of the United States of America and we don't intimidate people and say that they should be executed or field because you think that it could cause you some sort of sort of harm I think that it's very dangerous and regardless if you're democrat or republican that is the type of thing that we should all collectively push back on and I know that Senator Grassley is apparently saying that that this whistleblower needs to be heard and I'm glad that he is I mean all that should be easy your colleague congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard who's running for president says that her fellow candidates should not be fundraising off of impeachment do you worry that their fundraising off of impeachment brings politics too much into what you all are trying to do in the house then my other credibility of it I think that the Donald Trump campaign is running impeachment videos on Facebook non-stop I think they've raised as soon as they put their 90 second video out I want to say they raised about eight million dollars and they're looking on other social media platforms to try to do the same thing it's okay I mean it doesn't bother you if Democrats do it I opinion is that when you send things out on your campaign website or your campaign email that it can actually be used as a tool to inform people about what's going on politically they may not you know have time dough to watch CNN or they may not have time to you know read an entire briefing on your official website so you know they go turn to the campaign page to actually find out knowledge and so I think that what what members have been doing so far is fine I haven't seen anything that that would say that I think that make me say that it's inappropriate I think everything has been really on par in and again informing our constituents of what's happening around the country within income in relation to this whistleblower complaint all right congressman VC thank you so much for joining us today hey thanks Greta

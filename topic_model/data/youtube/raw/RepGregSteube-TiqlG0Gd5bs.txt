Rick Scooby Congressman so it's great to see you again your reaction to the FBI doj and House GOP investigating why President Biden had top secret classified documents on Iran Ukraine and the UK at his office at the think tank the Penn Center they date from 2013 to 2016. they are marked at the highest level of top secret classification Congressman you can only read them in a skiff what was your reaction when you heard this yeah I mean there's so many things to unpack there he was vice president when those documents were available to him and they were in a place that they shouldn't have been and he criticized Trump as saying that he was Trump was completely irresponsible is the FBI going to raid the White House I don't think so is the FBI going to hold him accountable for that I don't think so and thankfully Congress has instituted today uh yesterday these new uh select committees they're going to investigate this type of thing and investigate the things that have been going on in the FBI and they knew about this uh days before the midterm nine days before the midterm election and did nothing to tell the American people about it so so that just goes to show you how politicized the FBI and the doj have been and that's exactly what Republicans are going to bring forth and bring into the light for the American people as soon as that select committee gets appointed and we move forward into business for America so the same time frame for these documents they were starting to set up the Biden family was starting to set up business deals overseas to make money off of then vice president's Biden's government job they're talking Ukraine and there's also this China had donated at least 67 million dollars to UPenn which the think tank was connected to and that's when you Pan and the Biden president vice president Brian they started talking up U.S China relations yeah and that's what's so important to get all these answers for the American people because we know that Biden is compromised and we know that his son has made millions of dollars off the Chinese Communist party and we know there's gotta there's evidence through the laptop that Joe Biden got his 10 percent so we want evidence before the American people to show that that's exactly what was happening and while he was vice president he was leveraging those relationships with the Chinese Communist party for financial benefit to him and his family members it's completely uh illegal it's a legal conduct for government officials to be doing that type of activity and now thankfully we have the majority in the house we've created this select committee uh this week and we're going to fill that Committee in the next week or so and that committee is going to get off to a very fast running start Congressman Biden has been in D.C since since Nixon you know the question is shouldn't he have known he should not keep classified documents in in a you know in a box with unclassified materials we don't know who had access to them Hunter Biden reportedly had access to this CC office you know so you so that's a question too what are your thoughts about that yeah of course he knew that he couldn't have those type of documents but we have this politicized doj that wants to raid president Trump's home uh and go through all of their belonging belongings for things that the president has the ability to declassify and here you have a vice president with SCI compartmentalized information in a place that he can't have it and this doj is sitting silent and slow walk the information to the American people so they didn't get the information before the midterms to directly affect the outcome of the midterms elections yeah so they knew about it for months right and so absolutely and also we're still waiting for the doj to come out with its findings in its probe of Hunter Biden for his alleged money laundering and tax evasion let's listen to the president talk about Trump and morale go here watch this how that could possibly happen how one anyone could be that irresponsible and I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods by that I mean names of people who helped or et cetera and it just uh totally irresponsible so he claims he's transparent attacks Trump over Mar-A-Lago documents but then stays silent when reporters question him Congressman of course I mean it's the rules for the and not for me and you have a completely different standard in the doj we're going to get to the bottom of it and and what he was criticizing as being completely irresponsible is exactly his conduct and what's more fascinating is he knew that at the time that he was questioning and making those statements about Trump and those documents when he knew he had those documents and at his own place that violated the law you know the media is making this false equivalence about more you know what about ISM you're not supposed to have unclass excuse me top secret classified documents in an unclassified setting a closet at a think tank that's connected to a university that's getting a lot of Chinese donations that's the issue we don't know what access to it you know so let's listen to Joy Behar just her take on this watch this how that could possibly happen how one anyone could be that irresponsible and I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources the wrong sound there so this is so sorry about this we had to mix up there Joy behard was saying we know that Biden doesn't lie what are your thoughts about that well I think he lies every day to the American people and the facts flush that out the evidence of the American people flushed that out like saying the border is secure and they have the border on control and he's in Mexico and they're talking about climate change and not talking about the invasion at the southern border and the national security threat that that is posing in the fentanyl overdose deaths you can't even get that number correct let's listen to this rhetoric from MSNBC watch this there's a reason why the Hideaway The Hideout for some of these Bad actors is to go to run the scientists and Donald Trump's Florida that's where they're going so that tells you everything you need to know about why they've chosen Florida and places like Mar-A-Lago as safe haven uh at this point Mar-A-Lago is nothing more than just a front for a criminal Enterprise designed to undermine democracy worldwide that's what's happening right now I've not been shy about saying that McCarthy's protracted fight over the speaker's gavel with members of his own party was a continuation of that insurrection Mar-A-Lago is a criminal front to so unrest Nationwide and the public function of the house is somehow part of a rebellious conspiracy against the government this passes for analysis on in in the media right now yeah the only criminal Enterprise is the Biden family and then making money off uh his government relationships all these years and that's exactly what the Republican conference is going to bring forward to the American people in the next year let's listen to Joy Behar we have the sound watch this what we all know that Trump is a liar and a thief you know another so it's not that there's a jump to say that he obstructed and he lied we don't think that Biden is a liar and a thief so we give him the benefit of the doubt that's probably what's going on we don't think Biden is a liar or a thief your word on that well Democrats typically accuse you of the the exact same thing that they're doing and that tells you exactly what's happening in this country and Joe Biden time and time again has lied directly to the American people Congress since do be a pleasure having you on come back soon good to see you top GOP lawmaker Jim Jordan

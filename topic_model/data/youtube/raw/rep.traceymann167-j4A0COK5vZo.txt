thank you senator moran senator marshall thanks for pulling this together um a lot of great kansans that are here uh pretty amazing to see a lot of people i know the staff the people that work for uh senator dole uh incredible time i'm glad we chose this place um when this memorial was dedicated we brought my grandfather who um fought in world war ii he landed d-day plus six from johnson kansas out here for the memorial and so clear that this would not exist if it wasn't for bob dole and the tremendous impact that that weekend had on our family i'll never ever forget it and we'll always be grateful to senator dole before i came out here monday night i'm tucking our kids in bed and talking about the week and and i was telling the kids that hey we're gonna spend a lot of time this week um honoring this guy bob dole and i was telling the story of bob dole and uh and uh it's interesting i was telling the kids story about him being injured and almost dying and then they said he'd never walk and then he went on to walk and then to serve and austin my son who's eight he said dad he said god must have had a special plan for bob dole and uh another boy that's true and more than i think god had a special plan for all of us and the blessings that our state received in our country received from having bob dole you know he never forgot and i think the legacy in many ways of bob dole is that he never forgot that he was a kid from russell kansas and he never lost sight of the fact that the heartbeat of the country is alive and well in places like russell kansas and throughout rural america you know an image is very clear to me a couple years ago when when there was all this kneeling um at national football games by your athletes for the flag people wouldn't stand for the flag and here you have bob dole and that image of him getting out of his wheelchair to stand for the flag unbelievable tremendous legacy that he's given all of us and so in many ways so i really enjoyed it here in september a few weeks ago i was able to go and meet with senator dole and i'll tell you at that time he was active upbeat he wanted to know my plan for this you want to know my plan for that you want to know about kansas he learned about agriculture it just went on and on and on and he left he gave us three pieces of advice he said number one he said treat people well number two he said work hard number three never forget where you come from and so may us all never forget that we're from places like russell and plainville and el dorado and leavenworth and dodge city and hutchinson galena osage and places like corner so senator marshall thanks for doing this i think next up we have i think congressman turner

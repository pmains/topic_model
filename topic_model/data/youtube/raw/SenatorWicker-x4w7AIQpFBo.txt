Admiral Richardson mr. Pendleton said he doesn't know what caused these accidents after the two reports come out do you think we'll have a better idea and mr. Pendleton you'll be will be crystal clear on that sir okay and when can we expect these reports the comprehensive review I put a 60-day tether on that 60 days from today 60 days should complete in mid-october mid to late October okay secretary strategic review will complete nominally 30 days after that I do want to emphasize that's an aggressive timeline I want to get these answers now but I also want to get these answers right and so we'll evaluate to make sure that we're doing a complete assessment and not just rushing to a partial assessment okay now you mentioned you mentioned leadership and particularly at the command level can you shed any more light on the two officers who were fired last week there the the Navy mentioned a loss of competence and their ability to command are you able to be more specific to the committee at this point about those two individuals sir if I could I'd like to defer until the investigations are done and then we can come or what the full okay well can you say what were those two individuals on board either of those ships the two ended the the Commodore and the Strike Group commander were not onboard the ship they were not aboard the ship okay well now and certainly the the Chairman is correct and and witnesses are correct about sequestration and and my commendation to Senator cotton for trying to solve this issue and you know I want to be his teammate on that it's it's way past time that we address this issue we have a modernization issue and we have the more immediate readiness issue I think they're both tied together and and so let me let me ask you just continue with you Admiral we have a requirement for 355 ships in our fleet today is that correct sir several studies Navy studies outside the Navy studies have pointed to a fleet size about 355 360 ships and you support that do you not secretary Spencer yes I do and and then Admiral it's a fact that we're now asking 276 ships to answer the requirement that that the minimum that a minimum of 355 ships would take this is the math behind the fact that we can only source about 40% of the world demand right and so to the extent we're asking fewer ships to do the a larger amount of working to the extent that we've they we've reduced our fleet size by 20% since 9/11 it is a fact that the Navy is busier than ever and that's got to affect readiness as well as the longer term modernization issues is that not correct sir we are maintaining essentially the same level of forward presence with that 20 percent smaller fleet that has resulted in some exceedingly long deployment links as Chairman McCain pointed out we've corrected that back down to about 7 months as a sustainable length but our ships have been run hard they are spending more time and maintenance and that pressurizes the operational time having said that again I bring it back to the fundamental importance of command here to monitor the readiness of your ships your aircraft your submarines and to report when those well I appreciate your acknowledgment of that let's just talk a little about training and let me toss out the idea of incorporating more virtual training simulator based training into the curriculum for deployed sailors are you considering in operating more of this high-tech high fidelity and simulators into regular training as a way to address that issue sir we've been on that path for some time and I'd love to take you around and show you some of the advanced simulators that we use both ashore and at sea to keep our skills where we need to be on that well we can always do more and I will tell you that the technology is allowing us to get more and more realistic in the scenarios that we present to our sailors and we're adopting that technology as fast as we can and then and finally what about this issue of sleep deprivation there have been some New York Times articles and other publications about pervasive sleep deprivation among sailors particularly young surface warfare officers standing watches that part do you think that's likely to be one of the reasons that we eventually get down to on this issue sir we're investigating a specific claim very very closely the many parts of our Navy have already mandated a 24-hour circadian rhythm watch standing rotation you know so to ensure that everybody gets sleep inside their natural circadian rhythm Admiral Rowden from the commander of surface forces just recently issued while it was recommended before he now said it'll be mandatory but we're diving into that t plane but we await your your further information and thank you for your leadership

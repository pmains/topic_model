patty thank you to Senator Stabenow for joining us here today and senator Klobuchar our for her longtime leadership on this issue you know modern warfare always involves disinformation campaigns and this this administration has been waging a war on American health care consumers since the day they showed up they have been engaged in a campaign to sabotage people's health care to disrupt insurance markets to try to cause as much confusion and heartbreak as possible over two million people have lost their insurance since President Trump took office the disinformation campaign is the rhetoric that the president uses to try to make it sound as if he cares about the issue of drug pricing he's talked over and over again about the importance of directly negotiating with the drug companies he claims that there's 300 billion dollars worth of savings and yet he has done nothing to try to actually make that happen he has done nothing to push congressional Republicans the daily allies of the drug industry to do something about the exorbitant cost that we all pay for drugs that is unnecessary and so we are here today once again to beg our congressional Republican colleagues to join with us to stop the Trump administration sabotage of the health care system to stop their lawsuit to try to unwind the entirety of the Affordable Care Act and to join with us on real pricing reform not cosmetic pricing reform not pricing reform in press releases but pricing reform that really makes a big difference lastly before I introduce my good friend max I want to just tell you about a little dive I did into the drug companies profit numbers from the third quarter of last year in the third quarter of last year there were 14 drug companies that had over 1 billion dollars in profit that's a lot of profit for one company to make nevermind 14 different drug companies and when you look at the entirety of the health care industry in the third of last year 65% of the profits made by the entire healthcare industry were made by the drug industry the drug industry can contribute to the well-being of seniors and American citizens by helping bring down these costs and if they're not willing to help then we need to use all the tools at our disposal and one of them is the direct negotiation of drug prices the National Committee to preserve Social Security and Medicare has been on the front lines of very frontlines of fighting for seniors Medicare and Social Security recipients all across this country for decades I know about it because my former congressman Barbara Kennelly was at the center of that effort for a long time but here is the CEO max Rickman

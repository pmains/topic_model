last year i put my sport coats and ties away and broke out some scrubs found my stethoscope and a lab coat and went to work fighting covid on the front lines of hospitals and community centers in wyandotte county kansas and seward county kansas this is a picture of some of the heroes i worked with i think what's important to note this was a time when none of us knew how bad this virus was it reminded me as a medical student working on hiv patients myself geared up from head to toe with patient protective equipment personal protective equipment nurses respiratory therapists radiology techs all of us not knowing how bad this virus was and how easily it could be spread today these heroes are being punished these heralds came to work every day covered from head to toe and personal protective equipment with each one knowing that they could contact kova 19 from any one of their patients at any given time this particular setting an icu an icu with eight beds and 13 patients despite the risk to them to their families think about that think about having children at home or a spouse that you were not only risking your own life but the fear of taking this virus home with you but they threw themselves into the fire so to speak on the effort to save kansans from a pandemic that was raging across our communities in the earliest months of this pandemic and still to this day our health care heroes have displayed sacrifice and dedication to the american people it's a reminder to all of us how essential these people are in ensuring the safety of our communities and they weren't left unscathed between burnout and suicide the pandemic took a heavy toll on their physical and mental health doctors nurses all the supporting staffs in these hospitals in the nursing homes in the emergency rooms the resulting exodus of fatigued and demoralized doctors and nurses and other front like workers is exacerbating a labor shortage which already existed across rural kansas across rural america long long before the pandemic occurred since february of 2020 roughly one in five health care workers have quit their job one in five according to a poll published late last year in september the american nursing association sent a letter to hhs secretary becerra urging the agency to declare the nursing shortage a national crisis and to take immediate action to confront the issue i can tell you i don't talk to any doctor back home any hospital administrator who's not going to grab me and say we've got a huge nursing shortage you have to do something about it the nursing homes the rehab centers all suffering huge huge nursing shortages the nursing colleges now having a huge shortage of teachers nearly a third of the country's 15 000 nursing homes reported a shortage of nurses or aids hospitals have been forced to recruit foreign nurses and national guardsmen have had to fill in as nursing assistants to ease these problems these shortages are particularly impactful in rural areas like my home state of kansas the senators the centers for medicare and medicaid services acknowledges they are currently and i quote endemic staff shortages for all categories of employees that almost all kinds of health care providers and suppliers despite this acknowledgment president biden and his public health officials went forward with this vaccine mandate knowing it could and would lead to more firings firings like those we saw in new york where 33 000 health care workers were fired 33 000 they were fired retired a place on unpaid leave because they chose not to abide by the state's mandatory inoculation policy labor shortages that health care facilities will impede access for the elderly and the poor those are supposed to be cared for under medicare and medicaid in addition to the impact this would have on the health care workforce this mandate puts additional burdens on hospitals and state survivors surveyors the rule requires covered entities to comply with red tape by requiring them to develop and implement policies to ensure compliance with the mandate meanwhile taking nurses away from that contact with the patients who need the attention cms estimated that the cost of this mandate on private sector entities would exceed 158 million dollars follow-on guidance issued by cms recently also required state surveyors to enforce the federal government's vaccine mandate by verifying compliance at healthcare facilities this will take away again take away limited resources at the state level and prevent them from fulfilling their traditional surveying and certification duties not to mention multiple states have laws on their books prohibiting vaccination as a condition of employment for state agencies as a physician i'm confident that the vaccine has saved lives and i'm so grateful for the vaccines however whether to receive it or not is a personal choice between individuals and their doctor not mandated via unconstitutio executive actions i still believe in the sanctity of the patient physician relationship make no mistake this federal vaccine mandate is not about public health or science and fails to account for changes in data and the circumstances of the virus if it were we'd recognize natural immunity as a highly effective way to combat the virus mountains of evidence shows that those who achieved immunity through natural infection many of them being on our front line those health care heroes from yesterday are highly protected against reinfection the mandate was also crafted when the delta variant was the dominant strain in the united states omicron is now the dominant string it's much milder and has a 91 percent lower risk of death than delta additionally research shows their traditional coveted vaccine dosing regiment provides little protection against transmission of the omicron variant basically said that natural immunity is at least as good if not better than vaccination from the original vaccines and as noted by dr fauci omicron with this extraordinary unprecedented degree of transmissibility will ultimately find just about everybody and i end quote and even those who have received the initial vaccine and subsequent booster again i coat will get infected and we saw that play out right we all saw that play out many many people who had got the vaccine again ended up with the omicron virus and certainly we also found out that the that natural immunity was much better than the original vaccines against omicron most absurdly in late january the cdc issued guidance that allows coveted positive health care workers to return to work let me say that again the hypocrisy the cdc issued guidance that allows coveted positive health care workers to return to work even if they're still testing positive how many people in america would want a coveted positive respiratory therapist intubating their loved one in an icu these examples just show how flawed the science is behind the cms vaccine mandate as previously stated that's because this vaccine mandate is not about public health or science the body administration's mandate is about fulfilling their desire to control every aspect of our lives and it's a slap in the face to the hard-working men and women who never took a day off in the front line fight of the kova 19 battle these are real people with real families they're working to feed their families and they had mortgages to pay and these are smart people these were well-educated people people would thoughtfully consider the vaccine and then decided it was not best for them these were my medical school classmates successful physicians working at medical centers experts in their fields who had looked at the data and had deeply either religious reasons or scientific reasons for not taking the vaccine each day we hear from kansans faced with the difficult decision of taking the jab or losing their job we even surveyed dozens of healthcare providers across the state that are already citing shortages and other staffing issues due to the mandate in fact 87 percent of the surveyed opposed the mandate or cited numerous concerns with it these jobs can't be replaced overnight and with the march 15th deadline for nearly all health care workers who having received two doses looming we are about to witness is a government induced labor shortage and in turn a health crisis we can't afford and that health crisis will affect every american whether you're waiting for your elective hip to be replaced or you're waiting to get your loved one moved from a hospital setting into some type of a nursing home or assisted living facility you all every one of us will be impacted one respondent put it best when he told us and i quote we are concerned that the execution of the mandate will exacerbate an already dire workforce crisis in long-term care a hard deadline with no resources for providers or glide path for unvaccinated workers is likely to push too many out the door and ultimately threaten residents access to long-term care now i know some here will say that the supreme court ruled upheld this mandate earlier this year and this is settled but that's not the full story here the supreme court opinion which lifted the stay on the rule focused primarily on the secretary of hhs statutory authority to impose conditions upon health care facilities participate in medicare and medicaid this does not mean it's a good rule or it's a beneficial condition to a place on those facilities given everything i've laid out here today in fact it's a hardship to those facilities and it's a hardship for the families of the loved ones who are in those facilities this fight against the harmful rule continues here on the senate floor and i'm going to keep fighting along with all those throughout this nation's federal judicial system quick update 16 states have joined together in a new filing last month to once again block the federal government from enforcing the mandate in their respective states sixteen states think the cms has got this wrong they think the white house has got this wrong additionally the attorney general in my home state of kansas derek schmidt is leading the fight he along with nine other attorney generals have asked a separate federal court to reopen litigation no we're not we're not even close to stopping this fight it's been an incredible tough time these past couple of years we've lost over hundred and fifty thousand americans to cover nineteen we've seen mental health issues skyrocket suicides on the rise and substance abuse increase if there's one thing that's for sure though it's the americans will keep fighting to get through this frontline workers in hospitals doctors offices community health centers and beyond will fight even harder that is what that is if we remove the burden of the vaccine mandate and our health care heroes aren't forced to leave their jobs just this week england terminated their coveted vaccination requirement for all health and social services we must do the same i urge my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval to invalidate president biden's overreaching and harmful vaccine mandate for our health care workers this is a major element of the government's over overreaching covenanting response that must begin to be scaled back not only is it coercive and unconstitutional the mandate does not take into account the fact that natural immunity is as effective as the vaccines and the vaccines do not prevent transmission of the omicron variant additionally we all know we all see it we have a massive labor shortage in our health care industry and must do everything in our power to fight for americans who ran to the sound of the battle for these are the true heroes of the pandemic and deserve our best fight and utmost respect thank you madam president i yield back

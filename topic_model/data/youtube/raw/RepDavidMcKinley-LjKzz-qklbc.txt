professor the democrats seem to be returning to the obama's mission again uh overwhelmingly focused on this war on coal as it relates to it and they want to decarbonize this power sector by 2035 and without carbon capture this would ultimately eliminate coal and natural gas for domestic energy production and some you've already talked about what was what's going to happen with it can you discuss the potential impacts that eliminating that if foster fuel production would have on budgets like in west virginia or in alaska wyoming north dakota or alabama all the states that are involved with fossil fuels do you mean if we just completely eliminated fossil fuels that's the plan to do away with because they're not funding carbon capture so there's no way for us to get the net zero by 2035 unless we eliminate it well i certainly haven't analyzed the complete uh elimination but that would be devastating for uh much of west virginia i mean that would devastate our employment base it would devastate our tax revenue base if that happened just hypothetically if we had complete elimination over the next year west virginia would be devastated you're just in closing i know running but by 2030 they want to have zero or eighty percent emission reduction of carbon are we going to be able to achieve that in west virginia 80 percent but in the next uh by 2030 no i don't think we can achieve it in that sort of panel heard that and we can go from there

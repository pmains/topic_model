thank you mr chair um and i thank you for once again putting the spotlight on how corporate greed drives up costs for working americans and hurts workers across the country as i've noted in this committee before i approach the topic not just as a member of this committee and as a member of the senate but uh as a parent uh we've seen it firsthand uh angela and i when we go to the grocery store when we're at the gas station prices are up and we know how it impacts working families we get the feeling and the feeling isn't good but these price increases right this is our job to lay out what is causing it uh in our attempts to how to address it uh these price increases that are in the news constantly uh aren't just about rising costs for small businesses that may be struggling to get by the reality is and you've pointed out the evidence mr chairman that corporations across industries are posting record profits in 2021 corporate profits hit an all-time high of nearly 3 trillion dollars up 25 from 2020. now estimates show that the earnings of s p 500 companies rose nearly 50 percent over the past year and no doubt they boast about these statistics to their boards and to their investors while they justify increased prices for american families to the public by citing the pandemic or supply chain related challenges and to add insult to injury while some major corporations are increasing costs for working families they're issuing the stock buybacks that were just mentioned and record executive compensation packages that enrich ceos and shareholders some have even tried to blame inflation on the critical assistance provided to the american people to help them endure a once in a century global health pandemic or some have even blamed workers who are fighting for the right to organize and standing up for fair pay and benefits and safer working conditions but with the growing consolidation of corporate power and increasing inequality amid record corporate profits it's evident that corporate greed is what's increasing costs for american families and as we continue our recovery we must ensure that the economy works for all americans and so with that as a basis my first question is going to be directed at secretary reich well large oil and gas companies we talked specifically about record profits while prices are going up and i wanted to focus on the oil and gas industry for a moment because while large oil and gas companies have raised prices at the pump the profits of five of the major oil companies increased by 154 billion dollars last year now these companies have also spent nearly 13 billion dollars on stock buybacks over the past year as working families are paying the price amid these higher gas prices it's outrageous that oil companies continue to reap billings and profits and use those profits to further enrich their executives and shareholders that's why i'm a proud co-sponsor of the big oil windfall profits tax act which would establish a per barrel tax to capture the windfall profits of the largest oil companies and return that money to consumers in the form of a quarterly rebate and no senator white house has talked about this earlier the measure would provide consumers much needed relief while maintaining american competitiveness and reducing pressure on inflation by targeting corporate profiteering so mr secretary i know you're joining us virtually but can you spend a minute talking how a windfall tax can help counter the outsized power of these large corporations and reduce inflationary pressure uh yes senator and i think it's very important windfall profits tax is exactly what is needed right now when oil companies for example are showing as they are historical profits they are making huge amounts of money they are raising prices at the pump at the same time they don't need to raise those prices they could easily absorb any cost increases but they are not absorbing those cost increases they are instead as you pointed out they're taking their win for their huge windfall profits and they are buying back shares of stock to help their shareholders and executives and so people are going to the gas pumps they are spending their own money at very very high and rapid rates to fill their gas tanks and that money a large portion of that money is going to executives and major investors so you want to win full profits tax profits tax that enables that stops them from doing that and actually rebates that money to consumers it's uh you know we did it in world war ii we did it world war one we did it under emergency circumstances there's no reason we should not be doing it now in fact there's every reason we should be doing it thank you very much and miss china my time is up we'll submit some additional questions for the record i just wanted to appreciate the the distinction and the emphasis on not just taxing profits taxing windfall profits because that is what's happening now through the exploitation at the pump thank you mr chair

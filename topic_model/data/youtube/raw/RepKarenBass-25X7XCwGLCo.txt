alright mono thank you very much and I want to go out front now to someone who was at the deposition of the top US diplomat in Ukraine today the build tailor deposition Democratic congresswoman Karen bass who serves on both the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees obviously as I'll say it again congresswoman an hour to read the opening statement but then nine hours to submit to questions from from your team from Republicans teams from the lawyers in the room what else did you learn from Bill Taylor that is important today well I think that it is is all in the statement which I believe he's not confirmed I thought it was just extremely troubling to hear him confirm essentially what he had said before which is it is crazy the idea that you would hold back foreign assistance for a political favor I have to tell you when this was all said and done ambassador Taylor is a patriot he is courageous he was told not to come and testify he came anyway I think it was just a very very critical day in terms of our investigation well and I should point out especially as the White House is you know he's slamming career bureaucrats as they call them you know he has as he said served under every administration Republican and Democratic since 1985 reagan appointee at that time and in some observed under the reagan administration and obviously is forced ambassadorship under george w bush how important was Taylor's deposition to your impeachment case against the president congressman bath well I think it was critically important and you know what I believe is happening here is that for the last two-and-a-half years people in the State Department have had to live with an administration that denigrated them the disrespected them that didn't take their advice I'm on foreign affairs I travel the world I go to embassies around the world and every time I go to an embassy I have to sit there and essentially encourage them and tell them that you know we the American people really support them we appreciate what they're doing I think his testimony was critical I think it just shows once again you just say there's no quid pro quo and do exactly that and then it's okay you can't just come little crying and say that you didn't and then expect that you know it's interesting you say that because one of the senses said according to mr. Morrison President Trump told ambassador Sandow that he was not asking for a quid pro quo period right the next sentence reads but president Trump insisted president zalenski go to America he's opening investigations of Biden and 2016 interference and the president Solinsky should want to do this himself that is the definition of a quid pro quo and yet it appears congressman mark meadows decided to see just the first sentence there here's what he just said in the same room as you all day congressman vas here's what he said let's be there for 10 hours I can assure you there was no quid pro quo I mean at some point in time you can't just say that something is not happening when all of the evidence is right there in front of you now you know I have a little bit of an empathy for my colleague because what could he say the evidence was clear the testimony was clear and so for him to say there was nothing new in a way that's true I mean we did have the president's chief of staff have a press conference last week and give the a perfect example of a quid pro quo and it told all of us we just have to get over it you cannot normalize criminal behavior no one is against no one is above the law so I want to ask you one other thing that's come out of all this today and you know also as your capacity is the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus congresswoman bass President Trump today tweeted his anger at the whole impeachment process and he wrote in part quote all Republicans must remember what they're witnessing here a lynching some Republicans have defended the president Lindsey Graham first said quote this is a lynching in a sense this is unamerican later he was asked if he understands why anyone would be offended by those comments and I want to play for you what senator Graham said okay lynching has been seen as somebody taking the law in their own hands and how to get somebody for no good reason you african-americans lynched other people have been lynched throughout history he Lindsey Graham a senator from a southern state where are thousands of African Americans were lynched should be ashamed of himself shame on him he knows better than that when lynching was happening in the United States and frankly wasn't that long ago the state of Texas put a man to death a couple of years ago for a lynching that happened in the last ten years but those were public events people were invited they were like sporting events come and watch an African American burned to death come and watch a hanging these were advertised as social events and this is a horrific part of our history and how dare Lindsey Graham coming from a state in which thousands of people were lynched to minimize it that way for the President to take our constitutional responsibility to provide oversight as a co-equal branch of government to take that and compare that to a hate crime he has been consistent whenever he faces a day like today he throws a racial bomb to try to divert our attention but you know the testimony today was so explosive even one of his racial bombs will not divert the attention away from a quid pro quo congressman bash thank you very much for your time tonight thank you

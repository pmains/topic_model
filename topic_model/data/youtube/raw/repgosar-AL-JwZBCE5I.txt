this is congressman gosar with another mineral monday today's critical mineral is zinc now when you think of zinc you might think of those zinc throat lozenges taken when you start to feel sick i'll be honest they taste terrible but they do help shorten the severity of a cold zinc also shows great promise as a mineral to boost immunity to fight viruses you may not know this but zinc plays a critical role in a lot of other things for example zinc is used to galvanize other metals such as steel to prevent rusting galvanized steel is used for nails car bodies highway safety barriers and suspension bridges in addition zinc is critical in making batteries and electrical systems unfortunately the united states imports approximately 87 percent of our zinc from foreign countries sadly today there is only one operating zinc smelter in the united states mining and smeltering go hand in hand and as we bring back domestic zinc mining we will need to bring back zinc smeltering into the united states zinc doesn't just fight cold stop rust and keep away the sunburn it is a critical mineral whose domestic production could enhance our national security help our energy future and create good jobs here and at home this has been another mineral monday i'm congressman paul gosar

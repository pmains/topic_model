I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime you have to remember who we're talking about when I was at the Texas border I visited with women who had fled violence a woman from El Salvador owned a small business gangs came to her and said if you don't give us all your money we're going to kill your family that's why she fled another woman was raped that's why she fled so this is who we're talking about and they're not criminals so I believe that we should have a civil violation no president before president truck enforced the law in the way he has enforced it because he's using it as the crutch to lock up women and children to separate mothers and babies to put them behind bars so I don't think we should have a law on the books that can be so misused it should be a civil violation and we should make sure that we treat people humanely Thank You syndrome

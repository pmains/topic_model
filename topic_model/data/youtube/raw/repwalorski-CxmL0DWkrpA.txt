thank you mr chairman ambassador ty it is so good to see you congratulations i want to add um like all of my colleagues and to angela as well two strong women leading in such an important position in this country um you know i don't think there's um any time that trade has ever been more important than it is right now and i'm so glad you're there and i'm so glad for your openness i look forward to working with you um as well on the resolution of 232. i won't go into the details of it because we've talked about it but um that's a an issue in my district as well on 301 exclusions i along with a bipartisan group of over 100 of my colleagues in the house recently sent you a letter requesting that ustr start that exclusion process in addition i would urge you to restore all the last 301 exclusions in order to provide relief to u s businesses and their workers in the immediate term i've heard of many instances where companies and their workers are being disadvantaged by these tariffs because they manufacture here in the united states this is an urgent matter in my world without targeted relief these tariffs will hurt our economic recovery another important issue is renewing gsp as quickly as possible its lapse is currently hitting manufacturers in my district such as the rv industry to the tune of one million dollars per month and i know my constituents are not the only ones feeling this kind of pressure mr chairman i hope you and i can work together to get gsp as well as mtb across the finish line lastly i want to touch on a proposal circulating the wto seeking to waive intellectual property protections for copa 19 vaccines and other treatments i've seen little evidence on an nip waiver will increase the global availability of the vaccine since so many of these countries are ill-equipped to produce the vaccine without technical support from the manufacturer i also don't understand the rationale of giving away american intellectual property to our economic and national security competitors like china if providing vaccines worldwide is the administration's goal there are other ways to achieve it without undercutting the companies that have invested the resources and the hard work in developing these vaccines and other treatments to fight the pandemic i support efforts to accelerate production and distribution of vaccines and other coba 19 response items but don't believe that this is the right approach my first question ambassador time so are you planning to restart the 301 exclusion process and are you willing to restore the expired exclusions while that process gets in operation again and then on a related note what can we expect when can we expect the administration to complete its broader china review thank you congresswoman on the 301 exclusions um it will be part of our top top to bottom china review and so um as i know that you know and thank you very much for the letter uh that you sent these letters are important we read them very carefully and we think through our responses pretty carefully too most of the exclusions had expired at the end of last year and um uh the posture that we have adopted again um wanting to be maximally thoughtful and taking uh advantage of the opportunity that we have right now the beginning of the administration is uh we will be undertaking um the question of the tariffs examining them examining the exclusion process together i know time is of the essence i absolutely i i feel it the urgency in terms of those in our economy who are just wanting to bounce back and uh who work so hard so um my commitment to you is that uh this is one of our top priorities we have so many of the really talented and hardworking folks at ust are working on this and i hope to be able to come back to you soon with more specifics i know how important this is to you to others and to small businesses large businesses and workers in america i appreciate it my final question is um what's your perspective on the implementation of the u.s china phase 1 trade deal in terms of medical devices which were included in the deals purchase commitments so this trade deal is also we have been conducting an ongoing assessment of china's performance um and it's uh it's mixed it's mixed with respect to your specific question on the medical devices let me go back and check so that i make sure i'm working with the most updated data which is always a little bit of a lag and get you a good answer on this as opposed to just what my impression is i so much appreciate it thank you so much i yield back mr chairman i thank the gentlelady

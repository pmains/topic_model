thank you mr chairman just briefly i i really want to thank mr desanie for bringing this forward um if there's any question that it's important for us to speak out as a congress let me tell you the reactions of the asian american constituents i have in the research triangle of north carolina we have a vibrant and large api community and in response to the horrific killings in atlanta there was a vigil with more than 200 people on the saturday after the killings and the week before that the constitutional law and civil rights subcommittee of the judiciary committee had more than three hours of hearings on aapi hate crimes and it was so upsetting that i had to get up a couple times and and get a tissue just because it was so moving to hear what had happened to people and similar things have happened in my district what was the most um impactful to me however when i got home and went to that vigil was how many of my constituents had watched what congress had done for more than three hours in that judiciary committee and how many people thanked me just for being a member of that committee and speaking out on their behalf that shows the power of our influence and it shows our obligation to stand up when something has happened to a community and been so hurtful hateful and wrong and that's precisely what this resolution does it's why i support it and why i commend the members for bringing it forward i hope the entire house will vote in favor and thank you mr chairman i yield back thank you and i should

the new member of this group it's a real pleasure to be here I look forward to developing a good working relationship with those who have cameras and microphones express my gratitude to my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to serve in this capacity we certainly will work hard to see that good things happen in a political sense for Republican senators but I fully recognize that the success of politics follows governing well and so I'm looking forward to working with leader McConnell and others within our conference to make sure that we make the right decisions on behalf of America so that if we do our jobs well as United States senators good things will happen in the in the political realm as well so we are working hard to develop the right team at the Senate campaign committee and I'm pleased to tell you that senator Rob Portman has agreed to be the vice chairman for finance to help us in in acquiring the necessary resources for success and senator elect Ted Cruz has agreed to serve as a vice chairman of the NRSC for purposes of grassroots operations in political outreach so we have already in place the beginnings of a team that will work hard to make a difference not just on behalf of Republicans but on behalf of all Americans thank you very much

I'm Lauren Underwood,
Democratic candidate for Congress in Illinois' 14th Congressional District. I'm a registered nurse,
and I am stepping forward to fight for families who
know that strong jobs, access to affordable health coverage, and accountability in
our elected officials are what we need to put
our region back on track. My family has always taught me that courage is grounded
in choosing to act. It's taking a chance
because of the deep belief in something meaningful,
or something better. I think courage comes
in many different forms. Sometimes courage is
taking that first step, making that first call, or
writing that first letter. Sometimes, courage is
learning a new skill, or starting that family business that you've always dreamed of. And sometimes, courage is just
showing up to work every day. In all instances, courage requires a sense of
urgency that cannot be ignored. It requires commitment,
and it requires heart. I'm running for Congress because I believe that this moment in history needs strong, courageous leaders to step forward and to fight for our voices,
and our values in Washington. I'm Lauren Underwood, and
I'm asking you to join me. (uplifting music)

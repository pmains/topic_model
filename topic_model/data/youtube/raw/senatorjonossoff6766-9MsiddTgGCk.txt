SENATOR JON OSSOFF ANNOUNCING A NEW VOTING RIGHTS BILL TODAY. IN IT--- IT'S OK FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE VOTERS WATER WHILE THEY'RE WAITING IN LINE. THIS GOES AGAINST GEORGIA'S NEW VOTING LAW THAT GOVERNOR KEMP SIGNED. IT PROHIBITS ANYONE EXCEPT POLL WORKERS FROM HANDING OUT WATER TO VOTERS IN LINE. TO CRIMINALIZE A GOOD SAMIRITAN NONPARTISAN VOLUNTEER PROVIDING A BOTTLE OF WATER TO A VOTER WHO MAY BE ELDERLY, DISABLED, HAVE MOBILITY CHALLENGES WHO IS BEING MADE TO WAIT FOR HOURS IN LINE OUTSIDE OF A POLLING PLACE IS WRONG." THE LEGISLATION IS CALLED THE VOTER ACCESS TO WATER ACT---WHICH WOULD ALLOW NONPARTISAN VOLUNTEERS AT POLLING LOCATIONS TO HAND OUT WATER TO VOTERS WAITING IN LINE

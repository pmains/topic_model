hello i'm congressman paul gosar this is my first foray with gab and i'm pretty excited to join people who respect real diversity diversity of opinion thoughts and views i appreciate all the work andrew torba and his team did to get this operation going when the left was canceling people deplatforming them and corruptly interfering with our elections the left along with some goofball republicans chanted build your own social platform they never thought a guy like andrew torba existed he did what they didn't think was possible he built his own social media platform and sent a giant fu to the corporate leftists i'm proud to join him here i never thought that we would live in an america where socialists took over our government our corporations our schools and our military yet here we are living in a world where a former president of the united states has kicked off social media but mr biden's son has emails documenting a paper trail of corruption from here to the ukraine and he still remains in good standing clowns world thank you andrew for the opportunity and thank you for all the freedom loving freethinkers here we go brandon

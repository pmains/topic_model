this week will mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day the end of a terrible World War a war fought to end oppression and intolerance it's a great time to celebrate that great victory and to be reminded that we have faced greater challenges than this invisible killer this terrible virus will kill thousands tens of thousands of Americans it already has but World War two saw over 11 million people killed including many that were exterminated without any weapons by an evil empire so today as we celebrate our nation and our nation's resilience remember that we face great challenges before and we will overcome this later today I will be visiting a series of companies and I'll do the same throughout next week as they come out of shutdown and begin to reopen and every one of those is a celebration in safely returning to work whether it's a dog groomer a t-shirt manufacturer or a neighborhood restaurant it's time for us to get back to work and I plan on championing that safe return to work every chance I get just as I've tried to do everything I could to help us deal with this virus during the shutdown so stay safe until next week plan to go back to work and celebrate America's greatness seventy-five years ago and today

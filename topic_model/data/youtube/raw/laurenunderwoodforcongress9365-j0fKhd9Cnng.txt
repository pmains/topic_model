representative underwood i want to ask you about the momnibus act you're working on an issue that actually has been um a huge issue for years now um what does it do who are you trying to help well in the united states black women are three to four times more likely to die of a pregnancy related cause than white women this is a disparity that has been around my entire lifetime and i'm 34 years old and so last year we introduced a comprehensive uh large bill called the black material health mommy bus act with congresswoman alma adams from north carolina and then senator tomlin harris to address this disparity we know that there are solutions whether we're talking about increasing the perinatal workforce or making key investments to address social determinants of health like housing and nutrition and transportation well we're reintroducing that legislation today we have a new partner and senator cory booker and we've expanded the mommy bus from nine bills to 12. if you can imagine 12 bills on this one issue we've included provisions to address climate change and two bills explicitly to deal with the impacts of covet 19. we've seen a a real gap in an information for pregnant and lactating and postpartum women related to vaccine we've seen a real gap in the participation in these clinical trials and we've seen a disparity when pregnant women of color get diagnosed with covet 19 they have far worse health outcomes than white women and we can save lives we can make a real impact on communities and we can help all women by targeting these investments and these you know policy interventions and i'm really excited about the bipartisan support that we've gotten so far and representative underwood before you go uh we're asking all of our guests for black history month to talk about a black american that you want to put put a frame around and you've picked um shalon irving how do you know her and why have you chosen her dr shawan irving was my friend from graduate school at johns hopkins university she was a brilliant epidemiologist who worked at the centers for disease control and prevention dedicated her life to ending health disparities and when she was expecting her first child soleil in 2017 she died three weeks after childbirth and this is a woman who did everything right had health care was highly educated had employment right went to all of her appointments and still we lost her and so she is what really motivated her death is what motivated me to do this work in the congress and i am so honored to be able to recognize her incredible life her contributions to the public health sciences and to lift up her story today in honor of black history month

your outside experts have assumed that your tax plan would cut five trillion will cost five trillion dollars as somebody who spent a couple years as you know trying to wrestle with these numbers and took on entitlement form took on additional revenues I don't see I don't think there's any way you can get there with elimination of tax expenditures particularly when you take charitable home mortgage in retirement accounts off the table there's just you know there aren't enough tax deductions to get to those numbers unless you're going to imagine you're you're now saying you're going to go ahead and dramatically cut back on the deficit deductibility of employer-provided health care plans that's a large number I'm sorry I'm sorry serve the specific question I was making the specific question is you got five trillion dollars in cost in your tax plan right unpaid for you cannot pay for it in any revenue neutral basis without double or triple counting or dynamic storing scoring on steroids if you take charitable home mortgage and retirement accounts off the table is not being cut right can't get there the numbers do not add up you know I applaud your effort to try to make our tax code more rational and try to lower corporate rates do a patreon I spent a couple years in this process and took some arrows from my own team in terms of we look at entitlements and but also look at net new revenues I just got to tell you sir the nonpartisan CR FB community responsible federal budget has estimated that your tax cuts and your outline would add about five trillion dollars to the deficit over the coming decade and with what you've answered to Senator Casey and Senator Brown when you take charitable home mortgage retirement accounts and some of these others off the table you can't get five trillion in savings and I assure you when we come out with all the details they'll be full transparency this will be scored by joint tax as well as lots of outside groups as well as we will provide our own you of the scoring we have over a hundred people in the tax department looking at lots of different scenarios and we're working hard on that we have no intention of doing something that would add trillions of dollars to the debt especially since you know it right now at twenty trillion as interest rates go up for a hundred basis points again we discussed this before that adds just an additional debt service one hundred and forty billion dollars a year in additional payments right off the top so you know I would argue bloon the debt and whatever benefit you get from a tax set is going to be erased by additional debt the additional deficit payments the editor wonder I assure you that we appreciate the significance of the debt having gone I lent freely in to twenty trillion and again both sides bear responsibility all Emmet's acer's I've spent a couple years looking through these numbers pretty closely I think based on reasonable normal assumptions with anything close to creational scoring even if you do a little bit of bump on dynamic scoring you know you can't get to five trillion dollars through their tax expenditures without going after the largest ones like employer-based taxed employer-based health care okay I really fear that this becomes a lot harder than it looks and I am worried if you is around the three percent growth rate assumptions I'll look more I'm worried as well about dynamic scoring that has to include the tax cut assumptions and yet you're then saying they're not counted in the budget so there does seem to be again to be double counting I'm also very worried that we're taking domestic discretionary spending down to 3 percent of GDP that's the lowest it's ever been and you know we were both business guys you know you invest in a business if you're in business invest in education plant and equipment and staying ahead of the competition a government does that by investing in education infrastructure and research and development and unfortunately your budget slashes investments in education in structure and research and development that's not going to lead I believe to the kind of growth that you have your underlying assumption I've seen lots of tricky budgets before but this may take the cake you assume abolishment of the so-called death tax estate tax but when you go to the year table s3 baseline by category you still count the revenues the estate and gift tax which is kind of a tricky thing I would call that double counting I don't think you told the American public yet that to even get close you're going to have to then take off the deductibility of employer-provided health care plans so that's on the table here's what's on the table which is that I think the one-page set of principles that we sent the hill I've gone cuvees oh I know you have as well right I spent years going through these numbers to try to get them to balance you've got to go where the money is if you're talking about any kind of rational revenue neutral plan and I don't think you can get there and I don't think your numbers add up I think they don't they don't pass the smell test and I think frankly the what our White House was pushing at that you were not double counting I just don't believe that as well because you have put dynamic scoring in place

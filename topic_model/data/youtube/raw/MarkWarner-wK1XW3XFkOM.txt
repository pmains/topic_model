is recognized president I ask consent to speak for as long as up to 15 minutes on two subjects without objection mr. president I rise today first of all to address the important legislation pending before this body as 3414 the Cyber Security Act of 2012 followed this debate and won a compliment particularly Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins and Senator Rockefeller Center Feinstein and folks like senturk islands on a White House who have been trying to find some common ground in this area and I hope at some point in the next day or so we will be able to proceed to this bill and have it fully debated many senators bring different levels of expertise to this issue I hope my voice is someone who spent 20 years in the technology field and in telecom and particular before before a government service and somebody who's had the honor three and a half years I've been in this body to serve on the Intelligence Committee the Commerce Committee in the Banking Committee three of the committee's that all immediately intersect with the challenges around cyber can add a bit of my perspective to this debate let me start with where some of the concerns that have been raised by some of the pier the opponents to this legislation of focused that can in this area around cyber how do we make sure we have appropriate information sharing how do we set some standards who should enforce those standards because I think most all of looked into this area would recognize it's not a question of when we're going to have a major cyber attack or if we're going out a major cyber attack it's only a question of when matter of fact we are already has been reported in the press on in a number of fashions attack daily by foreign agents criminal elements hackers that are constantly probing our country's cyber defenses on both the public and private side and one of my reasons why I think it is so appropriate that we move on this legislation and soon is that I have great fears that when we have a major cyber cyber element or cyber attack that as we in the reaction to that attack Congress may as they've done so many times in the past over react because we didn't take action before something that we knew was imminent would be taking place so I do think this piece of legislation and candidly I could have supported even a stronger piece of legislation is is a great first step in this area I'm going to come back in a moment to some amendments that I hope to offer to this legislation because to to deal with some of the concerns that other members have have raised and other folks have raised on this issue but let's talk about again why we why we need cyber legislation and why we need it now inaction is not a solution every national security expert from not just the current administration but preview administration's and most members of Congress agreed that the status quo is not sustainable over a five-month period between october two thousand eleven and februari 2012 there were 50,000 cyber attacks on private government networks private and government networks and we're told between 2009-2011 attacks on us infrastructure increased by a factor of 17 and as more and more nations and rogue actors get more sophisticated computer and technology numbers knowledge these numbers are going to exponentially grow and as the FBI has said cyber-espionage computer crime and attacks on critical infrastructure will surpass terrorism as the number one threat facing United States think how many things we have done appropriately the previous administration and this administration in terms of homeland security to protect our nation against the threat of terrace we now have the director of the FBI saying the cyber threat will soon surpass terrorism in terms of a threat to our nation and I know is a former business guy that we are already seeing manifestations of this threat in other areas intellectual property theft theft is one of the most insidious threats we face right now a former FBI agent who specialized in counterintelligence and computer intrusion was quoted as saying that in most cases companies don't realize they've been burned until years later when a foreign competitor puts out there's very same product only making it at thirty percent cheaper we've already lost our manufacturing base in many ways are we really prepared by not putting appropriate cyber protections in place to lose our R&D base as well I know there are some who say well cyber is different well I cyber is different in certain ways but in many ways it's simply similar similar just as we would never have a nuclear facility without guards and a wall and a fence or I see my good friend the senator from Louisiana we would never have power facilities or levees without appropriate protections how is it that we would not have some level of standards and information sharing of threats that are coming in amongst not only our public sector entities but our private sector entities as well matter of fact as a former business guy I have been surprised at some of the resistance from some business organizations who are saying this requirement of both information sharing and some minimum standards would actually be a burden on this and I actually in many ways think somewhat the opposite because there are a number of businesses right now that have taken the responsible step put in place significant cyber protections and competitors in their industry because they're not taking those same putting those same protections in place are actually free riders on the system yet when not if but when we have a major cyber event if one of those folks one of those companies who have not put appropriate protections in place end up causing dramatic harm to our economy or to that industry sector all the industries all the businesses in that sector well one way or the other end up paying the price again one of the reasons why we need both this information sharing and some level of standards now I know to try to move forward in terms of actual standards or mandatory standards we're not going to have that at this point and that we have set up a measuring again want to commend senator Kyl and Senator Whitehouse for working through what I think is a pretty darn good compromise where there would be an industry group that would develop an effect best practices because it agreeably it is hard for government and with bureaucracy moving so slow to keep up particularly with something like technology but would allow a industry group to come up with in a sec effect best practices and those companies that that adhere to those best practices would actually start would receive legal and or and other protections so that we could encourage folks to make sure that we have in place the kind of protections that all industries and our country needs now to make clear though that that we don't have mandatory standards we have put in place and they just make sure I've got my pages here on the right level I've been working with Senator Snowe on a couple of amendments and I believe there are other members will join us on on at least one of these amendments the first amendment is a is very important and hopefully will go some distance in terms of clarifying one of the issues that seems to be a major subject of debate in this legislation and that is to modify and again working with the the chairs of the committee we may even move beyond this modification to elimination but to modify a key section of the bill section 103 by making clear that the standards set by bill by this bill for the protection of infrastructure are indeed voluntary this amendment makes it clear that the this bill does not in any way alter the authority of any federal agency to regulate the security of critical infrastructure again there are some concerns that there might have been a mistake in the earlier draft this amendment makes clear that the standards that are developed by industry working groups will be voluntary and that nothing in this legislation will allow any federal agency to regulate the security of critical infrastructure I believe this amendment should alleviate the concerns of some that the bill might place put in place mandatory standards for infrastructure protection again despite the very clear language that already exists in the bill that standards are voluntary it is my understanding that this amendment will be considered as part of a broader set of solutions negotiated by Senator Lieberman and whether our amendment comes forward or whether it is broadened in a manager's package I hope it will clarify this this portion of the debate about mandatory versus voluntary voluntary is a good first step the fact that this will be developed by by industry working groups the fact that this will not be subject to the lagging time of government bureaucracy or rulemaking hopefully will move us in in the right direction a second amendment and one that again working with Senator Snowe on that's a bit more technical but particularly for my colleagues on the Commerce Committee I hope we'll be able to gain some support seeks to ensure that the authority provided to DHS to sole source highly specialized products will resort in the procurement of interoperable standards based products and services whenever possible what does that mean in English it means that when government goes out and particularly during soul sourcing of a solution set too often I've seen this in my old industry of telecom years in years out people will develop a particular product or solution that works for that companies only set of standards and when the government subsequently or other private sector entities go on and buy or replace or expand whatever particular system if it's not interoperable with the rest of the telecommunication system or the rest of the network then we're really not getting value for our dollar again this is a small issue in the context of cybersecurity but both senators snow and I believe it is important for the purpose of competition and it should lower the overall cost of key technologies and services for the taxpayer so mr. president as i close on my first comments i do hope that we'll be able to move forward before the break on the question of the cybersecurity i think the great progress has been made in the negotiations i know there's a lot of issues that remained to be resolved but i would reinforce with them so many other colleagues have already said it's not a question of if we're hit by a cyber attack it's only a question of when in terms of a major incident let's get ahead of the game let me take two

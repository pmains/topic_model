Congressman Clyde thank you so much for joining us today on Washington watch well Jody it's great to be with you uh thank you for having me well it's our privilege listen we've been discussing already and talking about some of the radical views the positions that Stacy Abrams is putting forth uh you know what do you think what do you think about some of these comments that somehow are other babies themselves contribute to the problem of the economy for example uh you know that's an amazing response by Stacy Abrams again it is an attempt at by the left to put abortion front and center prior to the November 8th elections uh you know they have tried to do this continuously they believe that they're going to win on this issue uh it I I think it's wrong inflation is the primary issue that Americans are concerned about and then after that it's crime and she's trying to link to link abortion to inflation which just I don't see where the link is but I certainly see that the Democrats do not value children they do not value life and that is just an unthinkable thing um for them to do that and the country needs to know that you know this is a this is a distraction uh from the the crises that we're seeing in the by the bind Administration and Stacy Abrams is uh trying to um to cover for it and saying that somehow abortion you know access to abortion is a uh is a way to lower inflation uh or is a a way to deal with inflation and make it better and that's just wrong well it absolutely is and you know is it's so difficult to even wrap the mind around that type of thinking uh just by itself and I do want to hit on some other things I want to I want to talk to you in just a second about the defense department what they came out with yesterday but before we hit that you just you just hit it uh the American people the voters right now are so concerned about other things things like the economy and crime and a host of other things are the Democrats so out of touch that they don't catch what's going on or do they really believe that abortion somehow is a winning issue now I think they believe that abortion is a winning issue Jody and and I don't think the American people believe it's a winning issue but they're trying to push it in every possible way I mean you saw the FBI uh arresting these folks these pro-life people outside of clinics uh you know who who months and months ago um you know were protesting and here they are right before the election uh making the news arresting these people uh in trying to keep abortion alive front and center just like what happened a few weeks ago in our oversight hearing there where Dr cooner and they and with Dr cooner where they tried to push abortion as health care and those states that re that restrict abortion services are therefore restricting Women's Health Care that's the narrative they're trying to drive and it's a false narrative it absolutely is completely false but that's what they're trying to do to push this front and center to the American people they think that this is a winning issue for them in November it's not a winning issue you know I'm so thankful for the Roe v Wade that it was taken down by the Dobbs decision and um I I think the American people are concerned about the real crises that are affecting our nation affecting their pocketbook you know crime open borders um all of those things that the Biden Administration policies have caused all right Andrew we've got about 60 seconds before we have to take a break and I want you if you will to stay with us uh during the break but the Pentagon yesterday announced that the Department of Defense will actually pay pregnant service members to go to other states for an abortion in about 30 seconds uh we'll we'll hit more after the break but real quickly what's your initial thoughts on that well I don't see how that um jives with the height Amendment you know I think that that uh the Hyde Amendment prevents Federal money from being or being used uh to uh pay for abortions or pay for those things that relate to abortion so I think the Pentagon is wrong here I think the Pentagon needs to to answer for this they need to um to explain how this is legal security uh uh Congressman I want to shift gears a little bit with you if we can I don't know if you saw the president or not today but in a speech he actually spoke about the economy and well let's begin with this clip and then we'll go from there today we have further proof that we're rebuilding the economy in a responsible way today my Administration announced that this year the deficits fell by 1.4 trillion dollars the largest one-year job in American history stunning I mean let's look at this Congressman the the government spending for 2022 was something like 420 billion dollars higher than what even the president requested and much of that was due to covet emergency spending which now has expired so that a tremendous amount of money that was in there that now has expired and no longer is able to be spent the president is coming along and taking credit for uh somehow he's taking a Victory lap for lowering the deficit somehow and yet this is simply much of it just uh spending that has expired give me your thoughts on this oh you're absolutely right Jody I mean the president is taking credit for something that he had nothing to do with I mean this is where Congress you know set a time limit on the amount of coveted money and when it could be spent and you know he announced that the pandemic was over therefore you have coveted money that is no longer being able to be spent and therefore it cannot be added to the deficit so he's calling this a you know a deficit reduction uh that he's taking credit for somehow his policies must have done this well his policies had absolutely nothing to do with it you know if he was really doing his job then we would have a balance budget where 31 trillion dollars in debt in in a significant portion of that you know almost five trillion dollars is under his watch I mean I think yeah that's extremely well said uh what you just said that he's taking credit uh for something that someone else has done I think that is that that just wraps all of it up in a in a nutshell you know I look at this Andrew and they're like nine out of the top 10 states that are experiencing a job recovery a nine out of the ten have Republican Governors and the tenth one has a republican uh legislature involved and you you look across the board of 21 states that are the lowest in unemployment 17 of them are republican-led states So when you say the president is taking credit that someone else has done I think you're spot on I you know when you look at the job recovery and so forth uh that's just a continuation of what you're talking about isn't it oh it absolutely it is I mean you've got our state of Georgia where Governor Brian Kemp uh you know kept us open uh or opened us really early on in the Florida I mean the states that are open the states where the Republican Governors are saying workers need to get back to work you know the pandemic uh we can deal with it but we can still keep our lives and our livelihoods in order uh that's the states that are being successful it's the blue states that uh that believe in lockdowns that believe in in um uh in making sure that their people stay home and that they're on government on the government those are the states that are not surviving very well it's the republican-led states that are doing really well and the president wants to take credit for it and that's just wrong you know the policies of this president have done nothing but create crisis after crisis after crisis for this nation and I'm hoping on November the 8th the American people send him a red tsunami and say no no more okay well let's talk about that we have the elections coming up less than two weeks away now uh you expressed your hope as uh I'm sure millions of other Americans of a red tsunami but uh give me your thoughts on what you think is going to turn out here in just over two weeks with the election well you know Jody I'm hoping that every solitary American turns out because every American has been affected by inflation they've been affected by the the the 8.3 percent inflation that we're seeing the highest inflation in 40 years caused by This president's uh terrible economic policies so they need to vote for their pocket their their pocketbooks exactly what uh what is the primary issue and after that's crime and you've got open borders these are issues that are directly affecting every citizen in the United States you know every state is a border state because of the way the federal government has been pushing these illegals into every state of the union and it is having a huge economic impact on the states and our communities um and the people need to get out and vote I believe they'll vote Republican I believe will take back the house I'm certainly hoping that we'll take back the Senate because we need to do that in order for our country to be put back on track both economically and then um as well in every other way for the safety of our nation all right well two questions and we've just again Andrew we have just a couple of minutes left so uh if you can't be a little bit briefer with the first one because I want to hit on the second one if we can a little bit more but one of the issues that I'm always concerned about at a time like this is the lame duck session uh that's coming up and you look over in the Senate right now they're dealing with issues like the so-called respect for Marriage Act uh how concerned are you about the upcoming lame duck session if we can be kind of quick on this because I have one more I want to throw to you and Jody I'm very concerned about a lame duck session uh when we take back the house and the Senate it'll be the Democrats last opportunity to drive their big socialists their big government socialist agenda into the American people and so it's very concerning and we have to stand strong against it okay so one more quick question before we go to the break uh if and hopefully it will but if the Republicans indeed take the house and the Senate uh where do you think they need to immediately go what needs to be the priority what needs to be the immediate Focus well I think number one we've got to um get rid of these 87 000 IRS agents that are going to do nothing but uh audit the middle class I think we need to secure our borders uh that needs to be a top priority as well uh you know the Republicans have their commitment to America and that is a nation that is uh secure that is an economy that's strong that is a future based on freedom and a government that's accountable all of those things uh we need to work on it'll take us probably six to eight months to get through that but I think the number one is the IRS and then this and securing the Border

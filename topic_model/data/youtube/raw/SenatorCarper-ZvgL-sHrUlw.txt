mr president uh i'm happy to file today our friend from uh from maine our colleague from new jersey and you mr uh mr president is the senator from louisiana and uh actually pointing to something we can agree on people are always saying to me and i know to my colleagues when we go home uh can't you guys gals ever agree on anything well as it turns out a number of us agree that state and local governments could use some help and there's some additional help beyond that which we've already already provided and uh that's a good thing we don't have to pit blue states against the red states we can actually work together and in this case we are uh not very few of us actually come here and start our first elected job was being a u.s senator some but not a lot another people former mayors former governors or representatives but every now and then somebody slips through without having ever run for elective office uh again but uh i'm a former state treasurer people call me a recovering governor mr president but i'm really recovering state treasurer i was elected state treasurer when i was 29 and the the uh when i was elected state treasurer and took my oath our state had the worst credit rating in the country i was elected in 76 the same year that republican name pete dupont was elected governor of our state turned out to be a terrific governor and uh at a time when we needed one and i he's a good mentor for me and so my eyes looked up to and i hope i was a good partner to him and democrats and republicans in the legislature to pull our state out of a real mess we not only do we have the worst credit rating in the country in that that year midnight 1977 actually but we had the worst credit rating we had no pension fund we had no rainy day fund we had the lowest startup rate of new businesses of any state in america we couldn't balance our budgets to if we had to and in order to actually have money to spend we uh we issued uh revenue and revenue anticipation notes and i asked my i got to the state treasurer's office said what is the revenue anticipation of and they said that is the way the state borrows money until tax monies come in the following april so that we can actually pay payroll and pensions and stuff like that i said you are kidding and they said no we are not and uh that was then this is now uh when peter palm was it was our governor and iowa's treasury had a bipartisan legislature's house in the senate split between democrats and republicans but we created a rainy day fund never invaded it created we fully amortized our pension fund we had no pension fund we fully amortized it within about about 10 years did all kinds of things all kinds of budget reforms in order to get us on the right track now i've heard some of my colleagues say that states got themselves in a mess they're going to have to get out of it that's how they can file for bankruptcy um they are badly managed let me just say my say was triple a state we got earned triple a credit rating when i was governor and we never lost it we've never lost it even to to this day most states are better run fiscally than than the federal government and you only have to look at the way we spend money around here not just in the middle of a pandemic look at the year before the pandemic of how much our nation's deficit was uh was in in debt was that was in increase but even uh fiscally responsible well-managed states like delaware and some other states that are represented on this floor right here are finding themselves in a situation that one could not have imagined uh just a few months ago that's especially true when we have an administration that's simultaneously asking state and local governments to shoulder the burden of responding to the gonovirus leader mcconnell and secretary mnuchin say that states don't need more money because they haven't used the chronovirus relief funds that congress provided in the cares act well i unfortunately that's just not true a survey conducted by the national association of state budget officers shows that states have already allocated nearly 75 percent of these funds already to find the fight the pandemic and help struggling families and small businesses through this crisis and the states across this country mr president see resurgence in infection rates the costs of addressing the health and economic crisis are not going down they're going up and at the same time that the cost of addressing this pandemic has skyrocketed businesses have shuttered tourism and commerce have come in many places to a standstill that means that hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenues for states and local governments have have occurred delaware is certainly not alone so let me be very clear this is not a red state or a blue state problem it's a united states problem it's not a consequence of poor management either and over the past couple of months weeks i've had conversations literally as my colleagues know with dozens of uh dozens of them on both sides of the aisle about what states and local communities across our country are facing as a result of covet 19. in those conversations with my democrat republican colleagues time and time again i've heard a familiar refrain the pandemic has caused state and local government revenues to plummet in a way that none of us have ever experienced or would have could have foreseen income tax revenues have fallen his unemployment numbers reached unprecedented levels over the course of just a few months and delaying federal tax deadlines while it was the right thing to do has wreaked havoc on the ability of states to balance their budget sales tax collections and revenues from tourism gas taxes tolls have dried up as the virus has compelled many people to just stay at home and states highly dependent on oil and gas revenues as a presiding officer state is have been doubly hit by a pandemic and turmoil in global energy markets unlike the federal government state and local governments have to balance their budgets and this means the governors state legislators local officials mayors and city and county councils have had no choice but to make deep cuts that will inevitably hurt the ability of their communities to recover since the pandemic hit our country state and local governments alone have lost 1.5 million jobs let me say that again since the pandemic hit our country state and local governments alone have lost 1.5 million jobs that's not private sector jobs you know that's not otherwise not federal government jobs that's just state and local county jobs state teachers firefighters police and and more this staggering statistic is bad enough on its own but what does it mean if you aren't uh one of the one in every eight american workers who is employed by state or local government here's what it means cuts to education budgets means larger class sizes it means fewer bus drivers it means fewer custodians at a time when schools are struggling to figure out how they will reopen safely this fall i talked earlier this week to a bunch of a number of our finest state superintendent school superintendents in delaware and we talked about you know they're they're struggling with how to open up reopen schools and as it turns out uh we're gonna they're gonna have to hire more bus drivers if schools reopen more bus drivers because kids are gonna be separated and they have to as they separate kids can't put as many kids on the school bus they're gonna have to hire substitute teachers and if somebody gets sick they're going to fault guy colleagues or they don't want unable to come to work they're going to have to hire substitute teachers and and pay for them as well and nurses is the same way to be there to help administer whether it's taking people's temperatures or administering tests and that kind of thing we're going to need more health professionals in our schools rather than than less but cuts to first responder budgets mean people must wait longer for emts and firefighters to arrive during emergency situations cuts to transportation budgets means cancel or delayed infrastructure transportation infrastructure projects and fewer construction jobs just as we're in the middle of a summer construction season these cuts impact all of us and create a really a ripple effect across a broader economy that's why economists across the political spectrum including federal reserve chairman jerome powell agree that state and local budget cuts will weigh down our path to economic recovery not just for a couple of weeks not just for a couple of months for years to come in fact based on evidence from the last recession one recent economic report found that every dollar in cuts costs the overall economy one dollar and fifty cents to two dollars that's one reason why the us chamber of commerce has called for additional federal aid for states and for cities chamber also recognizes that this lost revenue will force officials at the state and local level to either miss payments or raise taxes in order to make up the shortfall we know that this is impacting every part of our nation and the longer we wait to get much needed assistance to our state and local governments the more our communities will suffer and the more risk we put our entire economy we uh we're here we're sort of like almost in overtime we're looking uh in fact we are in overtime when it comes to the uh the supplemental unemployment insurance benefits having expired but uh we don't have time to wait uh let's uh pass long overdue assistance let's pass it so that our our hometowns and our states don't take an even bigger uh hit a hit that we can't afford but it if it's avoidable and with that i want to yield my uh to my colleagues some of my colleagues here are here to to present their own perspective and we look forward to hearing from them the first one right out of the starting block former governor former governor of new hampshire and uh like me a recovering governor and a terrific united states senator maggie hassan i'm happy to yield the floor to senator maggie hassan from

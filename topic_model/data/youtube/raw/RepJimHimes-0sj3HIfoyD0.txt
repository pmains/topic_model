joining us now is representative jim Himes he's a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Intelligence Committee and the Financial Services Committee good morning congressman good morning Allison we have a lot of intelligence questions for you this morning let's start in Saudi Arabia because as we speak the funeral for King Abdullah is underway are you concerned about the future of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia now that King Abdullah is gone not particularly you know King Salman is a known quantity you know he is he is one of the more senior Royals there he'd been governor of a state in Saudi Arabia we know him well now you're always a little concerned whenever you see a transfer of power in a non democratic society and of course you know Saudi Arabia has and will be a strong ally of the United States moving or particularly of course as you've been talking about this morning as they see unstability may be chaos you know to their south and Yemen you know I think one of the issues that hasn't come up which is important though is not only in Saudi Arabia and Ally but they're also you know a country that we need to push to get them away from the bargain that they have made for generations or at least four decades anyway with their own radical Wahhabi extremists in Saudi Arabia which of course if you trace back a lot of Sunni extremism goes back to that bargain that the Saudi royals made with their own extremists so that's a conversation that needs to happen you know in the background with this ally of ours let's talk about Yemen and what's happening there this morning in intelligence circles did it come as a surprise that the government so quickly gave up with to the Houthi rebels well you know we've been watching for some time now the Houthi rebels make remarkable progress in Yemen and look you know this current president who was very much a friend of the United States this is of course something that we really worried about you know Yemen has a location from which it was called a platform from which we go hard after AQAP the al-qaeda group that we have reason to believe was associated with the Paris attacks but no these guys have been making progress for a long time they're not just a random desert group that came out of nowhere they are backed by the Iranians you know they're getting training we we suspect and other support from the Iranians and so no I wouldn't say that it comes as a complete shock but yes it did happened very quickly and of course in a pretty abrupt fashion and what we've learned this morning and talking to experts about the Houthi rebels is that they were tired of being marginalized but they really don't want to run the country so now what well it's a little hard to say right they of course are Shiite Shiite I are a minority in yemen yemen is you know not necessarily what we would think of as a classic nations fortunately that maybe is a little bit more like a rock where you have different sects you know that are sort of uncomfortably put together around in within borders that they may be do or don't agree with it is obviously a venue in which the Saudis are competing with the Iranians the whole sunni-shiite break that you see all over the region so it wouldn't we don't actually know what their what their ambitions are at this point we're obviously very concerned they are aggressive towards us the one bright spot is that if there's one group that they don't like as much as they don't like us they are of course at war and don't like al-qaeda so in this bizarre region of the world where for example in Syria we find ourselves if not working in concert with Iran at least working side by side with Iran and going after isis in yemen this group that i think who does worry as quite a bit is of course an enemy of al-qaeda and that is a bright spot for us i want to talk about the Japanese hostages that are being held by Isis at this hour we understand from other media reports that Isis has actually started a countdown this morning towards the execution and beheading of these Japanese hostages what on earth can Japan or the United States due to ever stop this unfolding massacre well you know this is this is one of those really ugly boxes that any country with with hostages and Isis's hands find themselves in there is evidence that Isis has released hostages for whom ransom has been paid now the United States is very very clear that we do not pay ransom it's a gut-wrenching terrible decision because of course we saw what happens so vividly and so horribly what happens when ran some is not paid but of course when ransom is paid now you've got a business and Isis recognizes that you know while we bomb their ability to sell oil which we've been doing pretty successfully here's another business and so it's a terrible spot for anybody to be in you pay the ransom you encourage that kind of activity you don't pay the ransom and according all too horribly what what transpires and of course Isis is demanding as we understand two hundred million dollars from Japan publicly Japan has said that they're not interested in negotiating with Isis do you have any other information as to what other back channels they might be able to use you know I don't have any specific information certainly nothing that I can discuss but but you know you know from these situations that it's not just you know a country's government reaching out you know there were in situations that we faced with some of our own people who were released you know you can work through countries like Qatar you can work through religious organizations like the Red Crescent there are lots of opportunities but unfortunately of course what you're dealing with here is a group that yes wants money and I think if they suspected that there was ransom in the offing they would hold off on some pretty terrible things on the other hand as you just pointed out they're also very interested in recruits at a time when the United States and the allies are making pretty strong inroads against their people yeah Congressman Jim Hans thanks for all the information this morning nice to see you thanks Allison

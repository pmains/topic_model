i thank you mr chairman uh mr powell chairman powell if we can go back to the pre-pandemic and look at first where the economy was how it was performing were we experiencing a record economic expansion prior to the pandemic longest in our history and so we saw the lowest overall unemployment is that correct that is yeah well since in 50 years really yes since the 1960s let's say that's right um how about how it was affecting everybody i know we've had some that try to say it didn't impact all groups we've seen other numbers i've surely seen other numbers that showed that everybody benefited but especially those lowest uh lowest level entry entry levels we saw record startups uh african american unemployment hispanic unemployment at all time records is that what you saw as well yes and really that started to happen in the last two or three years of the very long expansion which shows you the benefit of a very strong labor market we saw a wreck all-time record low unemployment since 1972 or so when we started uh tracking it for african-americans and and very low for hispanics as well and obviously after the tax cuts and jobs act passed but that is when we started seeing that happen in fact uh right before the bill was signed into law we saw major companies att started and then every day there would be more announcements of companies announcing bonuses and increased wages for their employees because of uh because of a more competitive tax rate globally did you see that same thing you know we know we don't comment on particular the effects of particular bills as you can imagine uh of any kind i'll give you i'll give you that and obviously we there's enough documentation uh of those uh reports as people would announce that they were doing it strictly because america had become competitive again we had the highest corporate rate in the world we made ourselves not only competitive we had a 21 rate when the world average was 23 and then we saw all of those great benefits we also saw record high markets didn't we we did yeah i guess so when we saw the government ordered lockdowns whether it's businesses schools didn't that ultimately hurt this record-setting economy you know i don't know that i can say that i mean i think the of course the uh the economy was very hard hit by the pandemic and it's assigned to others to decide how we should have reacted it's really not something that the fed has expertise and or the ability to judge would you say that the the lockdowns were caused by a reaction to covid 19 becoming a global pandemic yes yeah and did covet 19 come from china i really i don't know well we'll hopefully this committee will have that hearing on the origin of covid we won't have to wonder about it obviously there's a lot of data out there that indicates not only did it start in china but that it also started in the wuhan lab and whether it was intentional accidental that is a question no one should have doubt about when we could be having those hearings so we'll continue to call for that but you could see that straight line between the pandemic hitting from this virus that came from china and then the shutdown that had a devastating impact not only on lives over 600 000 in america millions worldwide but also on this economic crisis that we're dealing with now i want to turn to the inflation crisis that we're seeing as you can see right behind me uh we've seen a dramatic increase in the cost of many household items everyday items that families buy milk up five percent bacon up 13 gas up 56 used cars up 30 as we're seeing a shortage of products harder for people to get products supply chain backups harder to get workers we're seeing as the result of that about a five percent inflation rate recently so i would ask you chairman powell is five percent inflation acceptable to you no um it's certainly not so clearly we want to address this crisis now when you look with the unemployment crisis there's 9.3 million job openings right now which is a record high yet the economy only added back 500 000 jobs in may we've seen the enhanced unemployment being a big factor in paying people 40 of the people that are getting these checks are getting more money not to work than work uh that was a policy decision made here in washington a very flawed one you're seeing many states try to address it but ultimately as we have this labor shortage as it's creating supply chain backups as it's starting to get worse especially on the inflation side chairman powell will the economy ever reach a full pre-pandemic level if this labor shortage continues well if it continues i strongly suspect that labor supply and job creation will be will be moving up well over the over the rest of this year and i think that'll follow as you see many governors half the governors in the country now have decided to end on their own that enhanced unemployment and that is getting people back to work in those states unfortunately some states want to continue paying people not to work and that's causing uh inflation in other areas hopefully we can confront this address it i wish you well as you look at the tools you have available to you but hopefully we as policymakers get this right as well with that mr chairman i yield back

[Music] foreign [Music] hello i'm united states senator joe manchin i regret that i'm unable to be there with you in person but it is an honor to celebrate the life and legacy of staff sergeant michael joseph p tech well i didn't have the honor of growing up with michael i did grow up with his family and i know that based on their character he was a tremendous influence and on them all michael was drafted to the army air corps on october 21st 1942 where he became part of the 345th bombardment group known as the air apaches his squadron was the 498th known as the falcons on january the 3rd 1945 michael's plane was hit by enemy fire and crashed in the philippines and it wasn't until april 1950 that his remains were brought home and interred at fort leavenworth national cemetery when visitors come to the mountain state i jump at the chance to tell them west virginians have fought in more wars shed more blood and lost more lives for the cause of freedom than most any other state we have always done the heavy lifting and never complain we mine the coal we forged the steel that built the guns and ships and factories that are protected and continue to protect our country to this day i am so deeply proud of what west virginians like michael accomplished and what they will continue to accomplish to protect the freedoms that we hold so dear michael's service speaks for itself helping his family secure this long overdue purple heart is truly an honor and it's because of brave individuals like michael that we remain a safe strong and secure nation thank you and i miss you all but god bless

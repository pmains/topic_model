clerk will suspend mr kindergarten you are recognized for five minutes to strike the last word well thank you madam chair in march 2020 as the spread of uh covenant 19 began accelerating in the u.s americans quickly came to understand just how debilitating some of our overlooked or unaddressed supply chain vulnerabilities have become as a result of china's consolidation of vital manufacturing sectors they were able to make threats to withhold some of these goods and we faced a dangerous shortage of life-saving ppe active pharmaceutical ingredients and other critical equipment my office started working on a comprehensive set of solutions consulting with experts businesses think tanks labor organizations and other stakeholders we included financial incentives ranging from tax incentives to grants and more to incentivize american manufacturers of critical products located in china and other countries of concern to re-shore or near-shore their operations it would also incentivize them to make changes to their operations to create flexibility in their manufacturing process and to have the capability to produce more than one critical good to be clear my approach was designed to address a grave national security concern not to dull out money to businesses or unions or artificially inflate certain industries or the cost of goods as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be doing here however even as a secondary concern the economic benefits of my approach would be extraordinary one additional benefit to my approach would be that where there is not a strong business case to bring the manufacturing back to the us there are smaller incentives for those operations to be moved to the other eligible countries including those in the western hemisphere where a strengthened economy in certain neighborhoods neighboring countries would provide stability and mitigate the root causes of migration to the united states so in may of this year after more than a year of work we introduced hr 3309 the bipartisan manufacturing abilities determine economies in the americas act but the work was not done we continued talks with stakeholders in addition to the committees of jurisdiction and relevant agencies in the administration in an effort to get our bill to the best possible place coincidentally it seems the administration put out its 100-day supply chain review a few weeks later in june and many of their recommendations track closely with our bill we thought this was good news and as we talked with the majority side of this committee they also expressed appreciation for our work and said they had spent recent weeks developing similar policy proposals we said we wanted to work with them to create a bipartisan product to be included in the house response to the senate's u.s innovation and competitive act the majority agreed to work with us so you can imagine my surprise when we found out they had created their own package and we're trying to get it introduced before august and we hadn't been in the loop despite the poor optics of this move we didn't walk away things slowed down we did start engaging with the majority to see how we can make it a bipartisan product or a series of products those talks have been mostly productive since august so you could imagine my surprise once again when we found out on thursday that the majority would be including a skinny version of their partisan bill in the reconciliation package before us i get it you want to get a marker out there you have to do it within reconciliation rules but the policy in this subtitle is half-baked at best more importantly it's completely partisan in short moving this language is part of this package threatens to poison the well and really if the bipartisan discussions aren't savaged aren't salvaged this committee and the house could miss a vital opportunity to make strong bipartisan policy to strengthen the nation missing that opportunity would put the security of our nation and our economies at further risk the equivalent of criminal negligence for our line of work my amendment today is an updated version of my bipartisan bill this version removes provisions that are holding within other communities jurisdictions while keeping some of the most important provisions intact madam chair i am willing to withdraw my amendment i was hoping to first seek assurances that chairman pallone and his staff will work closely with me and mine and republicans on this committee to resuscitate the bipartisan talks and i was also hoping to secure a commitment that these discussions will begin again with transparency from both sides and that the majority will make honest efforts to incorporate good policy into the package even if it may be politically tough but that being that he's not in the chair i suppose i will have to seek those offline after the markup so with that madam chair i withdraw my amendment in the hope that the chairman will work with me on this vital project again soon and i yield back mr kinsey before you withdraw it uh miss uh blunt rochester wanted to be recognized for five minutes i recognize the gentlewoman thank you mr chairman and i thank my colleague for his shared interest in ensuring that we restore the resiliency diversity security and strength of critical manufacturing supply chains affecting our nation's national security and economic welfare and i support the fundamental purpose of your amendment in fact it shares many of the same goals as the provisions under consideration restoring our nation's manufacturing might strengthening our industrial base and securing america's technological and industrial sovereignty i hope to work with you mr kenzinger in the future to further address supply chain issues and with our subtitle we're providing the department of commerce 10 billion dollars for critical manufacturing supply chain mapping and monitoring facilitating and supporting the establishment of voluntary standards guidelines and best practices for protecting critical manufacturing supply chains identifying accelerating promoting and demonstrating technological advances for critical manufacturing supply chains and providing grants and other financial assistance to support the resilience diversity security and strength of critical manufacturing supply chains that's something that i hope all of us can get put our support to today in its current form and again mr kenzinger i'm looking forward to working with you as we address these critical issues for our country uh i yield that well the general gentlelady yield just a little bit of time yes yes mr kensington well i thank you thank you for that i thank you for the commitment we look forward to working on this this is beyond any kind of a political moment i mean i think we can all agree that there's a lot we disagree on uh the one thing we should not disagree on is our competition with china we have a lot of opportunity here so i thank you for that commitment i'll yield my time back to you and i'll be ready to withdraw thank you so much i will just share with you even as i traveled my state during the recess many of the employers that i talked to many of the small businesses this is a major issue for us and we know even as a committee uh this is a big issue so i look forward to working with you as we move forward thank you and i yield back mr chairman mr kendrick i withdraw my amendment all right mr kindred has withdrawn his amendment thank you

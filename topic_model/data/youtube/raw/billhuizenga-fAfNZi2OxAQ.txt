well one of those one of those people who had done an early interview and this was actually conducted by pete Hoekstra who did the interview was Colonel bill civil and if you know mayor sukkot cycle he's been around for for a number of years of very instrumental in Hollands veterans community as a tremendous wealth of knowledge of things that have gone on some great experiences has been involved in trying to document those and rather than do sort of a you know what does an interview look like we thought we'd ask bill to say a few words about what we're sort of his experiences and what led him to doing this this interview and why it was important to him in the hopes that we're going to be able to get the south to to convince some of those that have not decided for whatever reason to to do this that this is something worthwhile doing so with that terrible so thanks Bill before I say anything I want to be absolutely sure that all of you better is understand that in my judgment everyone's important because without the team you know when a battle but it's only natural that as there are only two out of 80 who let how in the nineteen forty that are still alive and that's going to break in my cell so that creates the atmosphere for me to understand the importance of the historical significance of what the unit did our unit did now it just so happens that about 15 minutes ago a young lady walked up to me and said are you bill psycho message man she said my name is Anne Holloman what's the significant they're being New Guinea rather than going all the way over the mountains we were given the opportunity to fly to the side of a mountain and save about a half a month's walking there were two airplanes available one was flying dutchman and one was going eat ball I was a brand new lieutenant and there had to be an officer and each airplane so the chaplain from Grand Rapids and I flipped acclaim and he went on the why he doesn't and I went on to go meatball well flying dutchman furnace Mike Michael two sergeants at Holloman that plane crashed about heaven our have to take off and her dad hurt that yet you did okay Oh horn alone okay all right they did Holloman walk first a month before he finally was rescued by some pretty natives her dad was a doctor who was instructed to send us back to New Guinea as bad as we were and she refused because of our physical condition and he went in intent Sean saw those the kinds of stories you're not going to read it the general rule because of that the book that was written ghost Mountain Boys it loaded with letters from her dead to her mother and mother to dad that would never happen if I had to open my big mouth on my way back to Florida and ran into your sister your sister so that's the way history unfolds no my experience the congressman hoekstra was something like this i spent about 25 years on the Congressional Academy selection committee for military academy so we had a good relationship and one day he said to me how I would like to be interviewed for the Library of Congress that could find and now this is the point that i want to emphasize because if you haven't had a lot of experience of getting the microphone or a camera lens in in your face you might not be thinking as clearly as you wish you had so what I suggest is that you made a list of things that were important to you for example I have I almost weekly have somebody come up to me and said I wish my dad had told me this I wish I wish to wish a wish so I would ask questions like where was your dad while he is in the Pacific what yet it was the in Pacific I don't have a clue that's why this is so important get the information I've got friends and so view were in the Battle of the Bulge but specifically that something that should be documented or history so when you look at the statue of the memorial cemetery and you see the names of Civil War vets there's a story behind every one there are thousands of stories available in this area and this is exactly what you're trying to accomplish that's exactly right and we appreciate we appreciate what you have done to help preserve that I had a interesting opportunity I think to a lot of media and those kinds of things and Jim Harger from the grand rapids press called and wanted to talk a little bit about this and I got talking about my dad situation and why this got me interested the fact that dad and I had a chance to travel back in Italy and with his bomb group to go visit the airfield and just it was very special time and Jim said you know I had a similar opportunity I went my dad was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and he said my brother and I traveled back there and he said but here's the interesting thing dad was actually constricted as a 16 year old in the German army and he was able to take him and his brother to the exact spot where he gave up and put his hands up and surrender to the Americans and how that changed his life that moment and have that time to be able to spend with with his sons to explain what had gone on there that is the type of thing that we need to make sure whether it's the Battle of the Bulge about whether it's Incheon you know whether it's ho chi minh whether it's a couple or Baghdad we've got to make sure that we have those stories that are that they're captured that they're preserved and we're we're told that we could do this so you want to talk a little bit about what the interview processes or what and so my way to touch on that all right basically the way an oral history interview works is you're pretty much telling your own story in a reasonable chunk out of your life story in some cases we like to start out by having people tell us you know where were you born where'd you grow up what kind of school and get you get whether your parents do how many kids in the family that does a couple of different things one of them is they actually provides background is often very relevant for where someone winds up and what they do later on it also is an easy way to start a conversation most of that stuff you know without really even thinking about it you know what did your dad do for a living okay no he was a farmer or whatever you might have been easy enough to do and then from there you know if for the World War two veterans last hooking role so how'd you hear about Pearl Harbor and they can pretty much all tell you that just as much younger people can often tell you exactly where they were my favorite about 911 there are certain markers and four Americans World War two Pearl Harbor service one of those but we also been asked me know how do you wind up in the military to even list you get drafted do you enlist to get ahead of getting drafted what do you do and then just take us through the process of basic training and any further training you get where you go what you do we have people world war two spend a very long time training with different units in the US before going overseas you have other guys who are clumped in boats eight weeks after they report from the draft and are parked on the set off to a combat zone right away so those stories vary and then basically we're just going to follow you where do you go what do you do that's why it's good to make a timeline before your interview figure out where you were and as you try to think they're well where did I go what thank you but what order did I do with that tens unit tends to help you remember stuff now the interviewers job is to help you tell the story there are some people who just get up and they start talking say people who were politicians or something like that they can do it and talk to an old Dutch Harbor though really short answers a lot of the time but the interviewers will kind of know pretty much what sorts of questions to ask you follow through a lot of people are really nervous when they go in that tends to last about five or ten minutes you just start talking the interview was interview were listening taking it seriously asking the questions and then just kinda goes some interviews are pretty short some if you basically were serving between wars and spent all the time on one base while on pieces of paper maybe you don't have a really long story another hand I've had people go on / for five or six hours not all in one session magic and wipe me out completely so that bends the more you want to walk the longer the interview goes and you know you say in the business to take this cheap whatever you want to tell us we're happy to have but basically it's a low-key kind of thing it's okay if you forget stuff you know if you were World War 2 or Korea even the anomalous a long time ago now you're not going to remember all those you test that's fine you'll remember the things that stay with you then we're important to you and really that's what this wants to do so basically lilly annew if you have documents or pictures or things that are relevant to your story it's good to bring those along with the interview or show the people if they come to your home because that helps them understand your story and a lot of cases is possible for us to digitize pictures and things and put those up on the website along with your story so those things help if you've got those if you don't it's not a problem then once the interview is complete then we turn into dvds and we send you one and just take care of the rest of the process another thing that you can do that helps with the process long is given you get if you fill out the library Congress's biographical information form ahead of time they've got some copies of it up here in the side of the room and that has some of the basic questions and things the Library of Congress wants to know like what unit did you serve in when we graphed it and so forth and how many medals do you have but basically you fill up that advance give that to the interviewers then that also helps them to get oriented a little bit too but basically it's something where our job is to help you tell your story it's not to shave your story to promote any in particular political agenda and we don't do that if I find anybody does look it over the mouth but that's how the sport it's really just about you so you know we're not we're not doing a really narrowly focused research project only wants one kind of things whatever you can tell us and ultimately it's the combination for stories that makes a difference if I teach military history at Grand Valley and I'll tell you that I can't look at a book I wrote or two or be an on or something like that or if it doesn't have oral history as part of it I want to know where it is why it's not there because I know how much does not make it into a book so whatever you can tell us we want to have whatever you can do to flush out the storage Oh Thomas we're happy to see and take a look at and know that is really basically how it works we can take through the questions gladly nothing but that's process

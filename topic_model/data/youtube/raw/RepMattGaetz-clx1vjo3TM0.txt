joining me now on the national security risk posed by China the fight for control of the global Internet grid as well as the US Navy now under siege by Chinese cyberattacks congressman Matt gates member of the House Judiciary and Armed Services committee's congressman great to have you with us this is an extraordinarily disturbing report in this country for five years has done absolutely nothing nothing effectively to counter of the attacks cyberattacks by the Chinese in particular President Trump is the first president in the modern era to understand the fusion between China's military and strategic interests and the economic game that they have played with fools in the United States for decades China is not our friend and they're becoming a more dangerous enemy but Lou I bet many of your viewers wouldn't know that today China is actually connecting rural America to telecommunication systems here's how they do it they don't have an innovative sector of their economy because the government runs the economy so they've replaced innovation with theft they come and steal intellectual property from American innovators they then don't have the upfront research and development costs so they're able to produce and sell that technology cheaply in the United States and if you're a rural community and you want connectivity you're taking the cheapest option just yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee we got an admission that the principal rural telecommunications professional Association even allows Huawei to have a seat on their board can you believe this Lu a foreign company having a seat on the board of the people that are supposed to be connecting our country to information this is a very serious issue president Trump imposed 50 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese intellectual property for this reason but as you've laid out this is not just an economic battle this is a battle that has national security and strategic consequences and those consequences are becoming more dire with each passing day we know that the Chinese are stealing and have been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars a year in intellectual property and technology from this country is you say laying a foundation for another superpower with which to contend at our expense it's mindless it goes on we're negotiating apparently now and our trade talks with China to ask them to please pretty please with sugar on it don't steal our stuff instead of showing them what happens when you do steal our stuff absolutely right Lu and when you look at the attacks that China has put on the supply chain in our defense industries they are going after our areas of most significant importance also keep an eye on China as the Venezuela situation unfolds China has substantial assets in Venezuela I don't think they have assets there because they're betting on the future of Venezuela I think they want assets because it is geopolitically strategic for them to be able to have a force multiplier or capabilities in the Western Hemisphere close by to us so we've got to keep a very close eye on that for the very same reasons that Russia is still maintaining Cuba and also taking its what are your laughably called security forces to Venezuela to protect Maduro the Maduro is without question in place for a while so long as those Russian forces are protecting him your thoughts about the future well I don't want to see US troops on on the ground in Latin America but I do think that we cannot allow these foreign actors to come into the Western Hemisphere with no consequence so I think in your opening of this segment you raised the right question what are we going to do now and my belief is that we've got to be able to create coalition's that keep China contained because they have this one belt one road strategy that is a strategy for global dominance from China and we've got to wake up to that threat and by the way while Democrats in Congress can't stop telling their Russia lies that are all unfounded the real significant strategic competitor we have is China and yet they're there China's laughing at the Democrats who want to keep us focused on Russia instead of the the real activity that's going on that threatens Americans and the radical Dems continue to do everything they can to subvert this president in the face of all of these existential strategic challenges whether from China from Russia or Iran Matt Gaetz always good to have you with us Thank You congressman

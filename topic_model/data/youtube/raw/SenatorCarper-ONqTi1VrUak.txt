now long before I ever moved to Delaware when I got out of the Navy at the end of Vietnam War or served as a naval flight officer in Southeast Asia and other places long before I ever did any of that long before I went to Ohio State study economics long before I grew up in Virginia i was born in West Virginia i was born in a coal-mining town called Beckley West Virginia my my dad coming out of high school shady springs high school in Beaver West Virginia was a for a while short while a coal miner when I my sister and I even after we grown up and left West Virginia when I shoes I think else to being a third grade I was gone off to be in a second grade we come back and visit my grandparents my mom's parents in in Beaver West Virginia right outside of beckley and there was a coal miner who lived next door to my grandparents and he had a big field of about a two or three four acre field right next to my grandparents house and I remember um his name's mr. Mathers that's got mr. Mathers and mr. meadows would come home from what about four or five o'clock in the afternoon and he always had his coal mining clothes on he was a coal miner and he mined coal for decades and he also owned a cow and in that three or four five acre field he kept his cow and He shed and my sister and I when he'd come home he clean up and then he would come over and melt milkies cow and he would let us milk is cal mr. meadows where I made you know he didn't make his living off the cow the milk from that cow he made his living as a coal miner and he wasn't the only person in West Virginia who made their living mining coal and there's still a number of people in West Virginia whose income is derived from mining coal and there are 10 top five states in the country in terms of coal producing co-production among the others are Wyoming Kentucky Illinois and Pennsylvania West Virginia wanta top five coal producing states and the number of people working in each of those states today as opposed to win my sister and I were little kids running out with mr. meadows to milk his cow the the number of people in the coal mining business employed by coal mining companies is that come down a whole lot but for these people who have these jobs or good paying jobs and their life sustaining jobs for their families and as we try to figure out how do we reduce the threat to all of us not just in Delaware not just in America but around the world's we try to figure out how do we reduce the threat to all of us from high levels of carbon in our and our atmosphere is there a way to do that it's a way to do that there's also respectful of the needs of people in Wyoming in West Virginia and Pennsylvania Illinois and Kentucky we're trying to make a living and all they want to do is mined coal that's what they've done maybe all their lives they want to be able to continue to do that is there a way where golden rule again golden rule we can somehow adopt a policy or policies that are mindful oh there need to be able to sustain and support their own families and at the same time to make sure in doing that that they don't endanger the rest of us that's the dilemma that we're in there's sort of a you know we have a moral imperative to to look out for them but the coal miners and their families and those states i've mentioned and we have a moral imperative look out for everybody else including the folks here and up and down the East Coast the West Coast others whose lives are going to be changed if we don't do something continue to make progress we're making progress but continue to make progress with respect to reducing the amount of carbon in our air I think it's possible to to actually I don't I don't think it's necessarily true that there's a no way we can try to at least maybe address both moral imperative to try to make sure that the folks who for generations of mine call it can continue to do that in a way that's not just economically sustainable but environmentally sustainable and and do so in a way that it actually looks out for the interest legitimate interests of a whole lot of us who come from Titans states were we don't mind call one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in our and our client in our atmosphere it continues to be coal-fired plants you know we've drilled in general electricity and used to be liking about forty percent of the electricity generated in the US came from coal-fired plants maybe another twenty percent or so from from note nuclear power plants another twenty percent or so from from natural gas-fired plants and the rest from hydroelectric and solar wind and so forth that mixes changed a little bit as presiding officer knows and today at kohls down about thirty percent natural gas in terms of generating capacity up to about thirty percent nuclear still in there about twenty I had a couple of coal nuclear plants in the next few years maybe building some modular plants smaller plans we are generating every more of went electricity from wind and a bit more from solar and from geothermal and from hydro but calls down from 40 to maybe thirty percent and the projection is that maybe by nineteen number twenty thirty it'll be down from a 30-percent to maybe as low as 20 25 four percent and that's going to create some hardships for the folks in those states including my native state is there some way that we can actually help them while the same time or helping ourselves those of us hard from those five states and for as long as i can remember mr. president I've heard people talking about including from this floor for many years Robert Byrd former Majority Leader the Dean of the Dean of the Senate I think maybe maybe the longest-serving person in the house and senate in history of our country but he was a big champion of clean coal technology and we have pursued in this country mr. president since I want to say since 1997 clean called carbon capture and sequestration technology since 1997 we have spent I'm told about just in this last decade we spent about about 20 billion dollars since 2000 since 2005 something like that in last decade and that we got a success story we've had a lot of disappointments but now we have a successor I just want to share that with our colleagues today and a success story on us clean coal is a project down in south southwest Texas in Houston where there's an NRG Energy is a big nucla the big utility company and that project is a clean coal project generating electricity going to come online sometime late next next year there are other projects underway and we're continuing to invest a lot of money and clean coal technology we need to continue to do more

Republican Senate candidate Pat Toomey joins us now hi thank you for coming in thanks for having me you sure you want to be a u.s. senator from Pennsylvania I do i do these are tough times daunting serious times but one of the things that these times certainly require is a laser-like focus on job growth by that last segment underscored the importance of that I'm glad to see it appears that the administration is shifting its focus away from this health care bill to creating jobs I certainly hope so that should be the number one priority seems almost like a misstep in their calculation really pushing through health care when a jobs are screaming like a neon sign as the number one issue this is something we did yesterday a job fair at the variety of center we expect a couple hundred people maybe a thousand to 7,000 people close to 7,000 people showed up yeah and they're scared to death how do you create jobs first of all you make sure that you don't inflict the kind of policies that will destroy jobs and I'm afraid that this administration between all the tax increases huge new regulations mandates the health care bill cap and trade and those things will kill jobs and they discourage entrepreneurs from taking risks and creating new jobs what we I think we ought to do resend the unspent money of the stimulus bill that clearly failed and instead of that lower taxes especially payroll taxes if we had an across-the-board cut and payroll taxes for workers and employers then every worker would immediately get a take-home pay raise and every employer would find it less expensive to hire the next worker you know I was talking to a man yesterday and he said you know we need to get our lawmakers out here they need to see these lines you know and he brought up a really good point it seems like you know when they introduced these bills into these people sometimes it sounds like fringe but they introduce all these great ideas even if it happens by the time it happens these folks you know they need stuff they need help now is grand that's part of why the administration shouldn't have spent a year on an effort to take over the health care industry of America now as I say hopefully they'll focus now but you know one of the problems with all these stimulus bills in the house just passed another one that won't work last month they need all these so-called shovel-ready jobs where are they it's very very hard to make that work that's why I like the idea of lowering taxes especially a payroll tax cut the minute that goes into effect people have to take home pay raise it may happens that week literally and employers the matching cut means they could hire a worker that week at a lower cost so I think that's a much more direct and much more effective way to stimulate job growth you know others would say that the stimulus packages have worked they would good be against what you just said that what did you want to do the banks to fail completely well there's two separate categories but but first of all the stimulus bill has a lot of government spending is just transferring money from one pot to another taking money out of the productive private sector and putting it in a government doesn't create net new jobs the tarp program bailing out failing companies is a mistake yes I think frankly we should have allowed some companies to fail remember bankruptcy is not a death sentence it's a reorganization it's an opportunity to restructure liabilities and balance sheets sell off the viable assets but there's just no justification for forcing taxpayers to bail out failing businesses you admit that a lot of our problems is rooted in the bush administration I think the you know what I think is totally under appreciated is the fact that the problem is rooted in the monetary policy of the Fed but the Fed created a credit bubble by keeping interest rates too low artificially for too long and that's what kicked this off it helped make the housing bubble which of course burst and caused this problem let's talk about your race I was looking at some statistics this morning with the against Arlen Specter obviously for the Pennsylvania Senate it says Republican Pat Toomey you you now lead incumbent senator arlen specter 49-percent to forty percent I've talked with that with Spector and some of his folks they know they've got they've got a race here Sestak obviously we have to mention him two Joe's going yeah joe sestak so but all of you guys acknowledge that this is going to be tough and in the wake of massachusetts a lot of people are saying it's not so much that they voted for republican they just wanted something different the the attention span and the patients I think for people at this point they don't care about your side they just want something different well I agree it's not about republicanism that's certainly not what people are voting for but I think what they're trying to do is send a message to Washington that these guys are out of control I mean cereal bailouts nationalizing whole industries staggering spending unprecedented deficits trying to take over one-sixth of our economy that's not what the American people want this federal government to focus on they've been concerned that no one's listening and that's why we've seen the kind of alike results that we've seen I think that's why I have so much broad support across the Commonwealth and across party lines because the kinds of things I've been arguing for limiting the size of government getting spending under control remembering that opportunities and jobs have to come from the private sector that's the only sustainable source of job growth and prosperity I think most people agree with that and that's why my campaigns doing so well will you be like Senator Scott Brown out of Massachusetts and not have the word Republican on your tour bus I know I'm a Republican I'm happy to be a Republican I'm proud to be a Republican but I think what's more important than a party label is the principles and the ideas and I think the ideas that I've been talking about will get our economy moving again I think joe Sestak and Arlen Specter both are mired in that at Washington minds that they've supported all the stimulus all the bailouts all the big government it's that's not the right approach and we have calls out to them of course Joe Sestak and on inspector and they'll be on the show as a rebuttal in the next few weeks good to see you thanks for having

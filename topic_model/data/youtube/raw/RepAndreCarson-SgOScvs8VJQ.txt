Drake Carson of Indiana he is the second Muslim ever to be elected to Congress first Muslim to sit on the house intelligence committee congressman Carson thank you for joining us tonight what an honor to be here thanks for having us so it's been four years since the president has released his birth certificate he's often spoken of his Christian faith yet you still see these polls twenty-nine percent of Americans don't believe he's a Muslim forty-three percent of republicans how do you explain these numbers well I think it's clear that there's a deep level of anxiety in our country as it rates as it relates to race and even religion President Obama has stated very explicitly that he is a Christian and what makes President Obama's so great is that he his life story he has a global life story and he has a global vision you know the founding fathers as imperfect as they were as imperfect as we all are they were at least visionary when they established in article 6 of our Constitution that there shall not be a religious test to hold public office and anyone seeking the presidency has to know that he or she will reprimand east Muslims Christians seeks Jewish brothers and sisters this is a pluralistic society in a very diverse society and if he can't pass that test mr. Trump then it's going to be a tough road for him I want to ask you we noticed the silence today not just ab Donald Trump but of most of the GOP candidates on this only chris Christie and Lindsey Graham coming out to slam Donald Trump for those remarks Rick said senator Santorum actually said it was not Donald Trump's responsibility to respond a lot of silence there you heard David Axelrod's called a rather Josh earnest call this a cynical strategy by Republicans is it intentional to let these doubts and fears sort of live and hang out there to appeal to a certain part of their base is that an intentional political strategy not only is it intentional it's insidious I think that David Axelrod was correct and saying that Trump did not want to incite his base let's be very clear mr. Trump is not an unintelligent man I've met him before and having said that I think that there's a tendency when you looking at poll numbers each and every day and you being a gadfly even being provocative helps to push you in numbers and helps to increase your popularity I think that often becomes concretize and solidified in a way that is hurtful and harmful because when the debate gets closer and closer and there are fewer people on that stage he's going to have to delve deeply into serious policy issues that deal with education job creation and our broken infrastructure I want to ask you this is there a positive responsibility from the candidates such as in this situation last night to knock this kind of speculation down just as you know John McCain did in 2008 do they have a responsibility not just to sit back and say hey what the questioner can think what he wants to think but to knock it down if they are seriously concerned about keeping our if I can quote Ben Franklin then certainly they have a responsibility there are nearly eight million Muslims in this country many of whom hold elective offices I challenge anyone to go to any major hospital in this country they'll find the Muslim physician their muslim attorney their muslim businessmen and women who are helping to put americans back to work there are Muslims who are in our intelligence services and law enforcement community who are helping to keep our country safe surely anyone seeking the highest office in the land must recognize that muslims are not only here to stay but we are a critical and vital part of our society congressman Cartman we're fair words we appreciate you taking the time tonight

um I do want to ask you about the government's response and it ties in to congressional responsibility here to the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria even though it's not even though the sounds technical it's become a very big issue the Jones Act it's a long-standing law of course that allows only US ships to transport goods within the United States after hurricane firma and harvey the government waived the act and the requirements and the restrictions they're making it cheaper and faster to get help to victims after those hurricanes as far as we know the Department of Homeland Security says that they have not received a request to do the same for Puerto Rico meaning it hasn't been done do you know why well in general the response to Puerto Rico has not been as fast as it should be it was not as fast quite frankly it was not as intense as the response to Texas to Florida and that's very very disturbing because of course Puerto Rico is an isolated island and actually the damage to the power grid to the people there I think is actually in the long run more dangerous than what we saw in Florida and and in Texas look the Jones Act is a very complicated piece of legislation but it must be suspended now for a limited period of time because if we don't do that there could be a British built or a Chinese built ship full of food full of relief supplies that will be prohibited by law from landing at Puerto Rico and that you know forget about the complexities of the Jones Act that from a humanitarian standpoint is outrageous so it is time to really ramp up the intensity and the focus both on the part of the military the military has aviation assets and other assets that could be really alleviating the situation in Puerto Rico it was too late but finally the hospital ship that the United States Navy or the United States military maintains is on its way the response to date has not been intense specific or focused enough we'll see exactly there's a little bit of a lot of confusion around the Jones Act especially today even explaining what it is to quite frankly we'll get into a little later in the show congressman it's always great to have you on thank you

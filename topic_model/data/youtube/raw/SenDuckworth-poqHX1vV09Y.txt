Thank You mr. chairman mr. Kobe I can't help but notice that much of the discussion surrounding the national defense strategy and great power competition discusses increased investments in tactical aircraft missiles armored vehicles other large weapons platforms what I haven't heard much about our investments in transportation and logistics systems that can operate in a contested environment to support these weapons platforms for example the numbers of US flag ships has gone down significantly what is your assessment of the current state of US military transportation the logistic systems to support great power competition and do we have what it takes to be able to as you mention a jali move our forces to where we need to go and sustain them in order to react more quickly ma'am that's that's a great question I would say it's it's very problematic I think you know actually in the defense strategy logistics is highlighted as is information as an independent warfighting domain in a sense the strategy is trying to take the focus away from how many BC T's do you have how many capital ships etc and saying what are the forces that you need all through the chain from from A to Z that will allow you to complete the mission so I think logistics is crucial including civilian logistics I think the basic logic there should be that we need our forces and our logistics chain to be able to operate under plausible Chinese or Russian sustained attack that you're never gonna have the total sanctuary that we enjoyed in the unipolar polar era now that doesn't mean everything has to be perfectly secure every satellite we put into space does not have to survive but as an architecture it needs to operate and the other key thing and I think a really core piece of the logic here is we want our architecture to be able to work in a way that for the Chinese or the Russians to attack it they will have to escalate and expand the war in ways that are bad for them what are some of the investments that the department can make to ensure this logistical readiness so that our military will be able to provide the war fighters in the field with appropriate resources and to execute the national defense strategy and then you talk about this you know it's logistical architecture what do we need to do to build this logistical architecture to where we need it to be well I'm not sure what exactly it will entail into of investments I would imagine it's going to be a kind of a soup to nuts thing a couple of points that I would say are we would want exercising and realistic exercising I mean in a sense something like the operation reforge remodel of the 1980s which is basically how are you getting from the United States to the conflict zone abroad while under attack that will tell us a lot about what we need and where our vulnerabilities are I'd also say selective investments in things like Cruise and ballistic missile defense specifically designed at parts crucial nodes in our logistics architecture both in the United States and abroad that again not err that are not going to be able to give us perfect security but if the Russians have to launch a hundred missiles to take out Ramstein rather than to that's going to be very important for Germany's political decision-making thank you and and this is hopefully you from and also for dr. Radner should be to be doing something about the Chinese is low in capability such as their Coast Guard vessels their fishing fleets that have been known to interfere with maritime and naval traffic they have this whole it's not all just their military but they have all of these other low-end network of things that are out there that's exactly right and in fact they have a maritime militia that's knitted together fisheries and Coast Guard with the PLA I do think we should approach these vessels and forces based upon the based upon their behavior and not the color of though their hull so if there are Coast Guard ships engaging in coercive military activity particularly if the PLA is parked over the horizon I don't think we should treat them like law enforcement vessels we should treat them like military vessels and the other thing that we can do in this space that we haven't done nearly enough of is information warfare and strategic messaging where we have an immense amount of intelligence that's not particularly signal sensitive that doesn't require unknown sources and methods about Chinese Coast Guard and other forms of illegal and and coercive activity in the South China Sea and elsewhere and we ought to be splashing that across newspapers all across the region every day of the week and and from my experience in government it was incredibly hard to unlock this intelligence to even share it with close partners and we ought to have much faster and more widespread declassification authority on this information said if I just might pick up your first question if I might our strategy so often depends on reinforcement particularly in Europe and we've seen and demonstrated through many exercises through the Alliance some of the unanticipated difficulties we've had moving forces across borders in the European domain to prepare for the Russian challenge it's partly why we saw the NATO summit established a new logistics command to be based in Germany why we have underway a military mobility initiative that really requires working with the European Union on how to facilitate a movement of our armed forces across territories and why what we're doing with this three seas initiative in Central Europe is so important because we lack in many places the cross-border infrastructure required for this type of mobility and ID factor that into this strategy thank you Thank You mr. chairman

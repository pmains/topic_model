well supply chain hurdles were a main focus in this week's washington watch during the event congresswoman abigail spanberger spoke on efforts to address the trucker shortage highlighting new legislation to help recruit new drivers while also retaining qualified ones i sat down uh with trucking companies based in my district or with a strong workforce in my district as well as the virginia trucking association they're fully uh supportive of the bill the bill has the endorsements of national trucking organizations um and so what i'm working on right now is gathering additional co-sponsors making sure that that people who are talking about supply chain issues who are talking about inflation recognize the value of this bill in um in mitigating some of the losses that we're seeing in the trucking industry but also validating that the trucking industry is so incredibly important to our our workforce uh just some of the numbers that we discussed yesterday in my meeting of course there's a shortage of 80 000 truck drivers nationwide but it's an aging population it's a community that's kind of age by age getting closer and closer to retirement so making sure that we can you know have a bit of a stop gap into the future as we're looking to recruit new drivers into the industry uh but also retain good qualified drivers who might be considering whether to take retirement or whether to continue uh driving a few more years so bottom line answer we're working to make sure that that anybody working on a supply chain related package so that's within house leadership is aware of this bill how simplistic but purposeful it is uh and then uh rep gallagher and i are both working to uh get additional co-sponsors so that we can begin pushing this piece of legislation uh forward aggressively so it's the kind of the top of all conversations as a straightforward but important element of steps we can take well representative spanberger says she's been raising the bill directly with house leadership in an effort to strengthen the ag supply chain moving forward

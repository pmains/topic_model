I think I think there's a key ingredient if you look at the institutions that have caved and it's one word which is which is cowardice all that it would take for a lot of these institutions to not succumb to the nonsense of so much of what this ideology is about is by the person at the top simply saying no no my job is to be a steward of you know in the case of Harvard Veritas that's the motto of Harvard truth or Yale Lux at Veritas truth and light or I was recently looking up some of the mottos of these universities because the chasm between what they actually do and what they promise is just so so tragically wide and what would it look like for the head of one of these storied institutions to say no we're not going along with this in a very polite way and if you're looking for something else if you're looking to you know sit in a warm bath of you know ideological Conformity that's great there's a lot of other places where you can find that but not here and what's so amazing to me is just how rare courage is how rare it is to find a leader of an institution that was willing to stand up and say no to the nonsense if they did this would go away very very quickly but instead the people and it's a minority of people at the Times the people that are promoting this ideology are being coddled they're being promoted they're being elevated and you know the the weapon that they wield is a very powerful one it's the weapon of moral condemnation and of accusations of every ISM and a phobia in the books

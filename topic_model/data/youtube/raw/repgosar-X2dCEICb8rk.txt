test test test test one two test test good it does yeah yes I hadn't noticed it before it's very observant that is really cool test one to alysom test test tests there we go much better test test test testing one two three four mr. chairman testing microphones still too loud at sixty down to 35 that sounds better test test test hasn't and now we gotta go way up testing rig front check back up to 60s test test test okay 61 motion the subcommittee will come to order the chair notices the presence of a quorum which under a committee rule 3e is to members in the chairs informed that the acting ranking member is on his way the Water and Power subcommittee meets today to hear testimony on HR 49:24 sponsored by representative Gosar it seeks to resolve a water rights dispute in western arizona's bill williams River watershed I will begin with five-minute opening statements beginning with me the the measure authorizes and codifies two water rights settlement agreements in order to provide some water supply certainty for the Hualapai tribe a mining company the Arizona Game and Fish Commission and the federal government due to the federal trust responsibility congressional authorization and ratification of this agreement is necessary the agreements in this bill give all parties something a Freeport the mining company receives the right to pump water to continue operating a copper mine that provides over 300 million dollars in economic activity the Indian tribe receives non-federal compensation from the mining company and also receives some water supply assurances the state of Arizona receives a donated ranch to use as part of its obligations on the Lower Colorado molar species conservation program and the federal government's liability on certain claims is reduced I do note however that there are some disagreements between the administration and the rest of the parties on the sovereign immunity waiver in the bill we've asked the administration's Justice Department to appear before us today on this matter unfortunately they've declined to do so I understand efforts are underway in an attempt to resolve this issue and I hope this hearing can serve as a platform to further that discussion I also note that this bill does not impact winters doctrine rights which a tribal water rights set forth in a landmark 1908 Supreme Court case nor does it authorize federal expenditure of any kind since this bill involves just the first phase of an agreement are these two issues as my colleagues know are very complicated for years I've asked the Justice Department to determine whether the reduction of federal liability meets the federal expenditures authors were authorized in winters doctrine related bills unfortunately we've received no response from the department charged with determining this calculation and until the Justice Department becomes responsive and transparent we are left to focusing on Indian water rights bills that have no federal costs I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and will now yield to the gentleman from Arizona mr. Gosar well Thank You mr. chairman I would like to first of all say thank you very very much with the abrupt change in schedule would have been very easy for you to cancel this uh this hearing and boy from the state of Arizona the Hualapai tribe freeport-mcmoran we really want to say thank you very much in regards to keeping the word water in the West is a critical to our continued economic stability and is of course a limited resource on which there are many existing demands that need to be met HR 4924 is important legislation that will facilitate the achievement of a fair and equitable settlement of the certain claims within the bill will Williams River watershed this bill was secured important water rights for the Hualapai tribe provide certainty for the water supply of the Baghdad mine a large copper mine in western Arizona that has a 339 million dollar economic impact and supports nearly 4,000 jobs securing non-federal donation to support a tribal water supply study necessary for the advancement of a settlement of the tribes claims for the Colorado River secure a second non-federal contribution for the tribe that will secure future Colorado River rights and help facilitate a future comprehensive settlement as part of an agreement codified by this act and transfer nearly 3,400 acres for use in the Lower Colorado multi species conservation program this bill is good for private property owners settles an outstanding water rights settlement will result in a net water benefit to the basin and is good for taxpayers as it requires no federal expenditures representatives Trent Frank Matt salmon David Schweikert Ron Raul Grijalva edy pastor Kyrsten Sinema and kur Patrick are all original co-sponsors of the bill in addition US senators Jeff Flake and John McCain introduced a companion bill in the Senate as Senate bill 20 503 I can't tell you how rare it is to have the entire Arizona delegation agree on a meaningful bill I mean my colleague mr. Grijalva and I who have not agreed on much over the years have the same position on a bill for essentially the same reasons the settlement of tribal water rights claims as a priority in the state of Arizona my home state has already resolved in part or in whole 13 water claims water rights claims for the state's 22 federally recognized tribes this legislation continues to move the ball forward and recognizes the water rights of the tribe on three distinct parcels this is of critical importance as the tribe is of dire need of sustainable water supply in addition arizona state law requires that water rights must be put to beneficial use within five years or risk potential forfeiture of those water rights freeport-mcmoran purchased planet Ranch in December 2011 and the water rights must be put to beneficial use by December of 2016 as a result this legislation if enacted will ensure that those rights are put to use prior to the deadline and allow for transfer to take place that will yield significant benefits for the multi species conservation program as well as water and power users along the Lower Colorado I'm committed to seeing this bill enacted into law and the various stakeholders have worked hard to hard in negotiating the screamin to come unraveled due to the in actions by Congress I realize there are a couple very minor disagreements that need to be resolved and we can do that at market but I believe this can be easily resolved this legislation is critical to the future economic prosperity of the tribe vital to ensuring the continued development of our natural resources right here in America resolves legal disputes that have been going on for years provide certainty for water users throughout the region provides benefits for the multi species conservation program and is a balanced compromise that is a win-win for all vested parties and again the bill has no cost to the federal government once again I sincerely appreciate your leadership general McClintock on the subcommittee and for holding this hearing and I genuinely thank you again for allowing it to go forward and I yield back thank you the chair reserved time for the ranking member for his opening a statement when he arrives and in the meantime we'll move on to the panel of witnesses each witnesses written testimony will appear and fall in the hearing record so I'd ask that witnesses keep their oral statements to five minutes as outlined in our invitation letter to you and under committee rule for a we have timing rights timing lights to give you helpful guidance and staying within those boundaries the yellow light indicates that you have one minute remaining and the red light means that the attention span of members of the house has been exceeded and we're thinking about lunch so with that I'm pleased to introduce our first witness the Honorable Marietta Biagio law council member of the Hualapai tribe from peach springs Arizona to testify chairman McClintock Brent team member in italiano and members of the subcommittee I am Jamie Joel and I serve as a member of the Tribal Council of the Hualapai tribe thank you for the invitation to testify in support of HR 49:24 the bill williams river water rights settlement act of 2014 the colorado river forms 108 miles north and boundary of the Hualapai reservation through a portion of the Grand Canyon a reservation has no significant surface streams other than the Colorado River and has very limited groundwater resources well the tribe is presently able to supply its main residential community peach springs with groundwater the only feasible water supply for satisfying the future needs of the reservation is the Colorado River over the past three years we have been negotiating a comprehensive settlement of all the tribes reserve water rights with the justice and Interior Department's of Arizona and major private entities in Arizona the basic principles of the settlement have been agreed upon but the settlement is not yet ready for submission to Congress because the tribe needs to first to complete a feasibility study of the alternatives for constructing the infrastructure needed to deliver Colorado River water to the reservation in the meantime the tribe along with the United States and Freeport middle minerals corporation have reached an agreement settling our water rights claims in the Big Sandy River Basin south of our own main reservation this settlement faces a deadline which is why we are and the other parties seeking enactment of HR 20 49 24 now in advance of the comprehensive settlement of our reservation water rights this deadline is composed by the possible application of provisions of Arizona state law that could result in the forfeiture of certain water rights Freeport holes in the Bill Williams Basin to meet this deadline the tribe urges Congress to enact HR 49 24 this year ahead of considering or comprehensive water rights settlement now let me describe the important benefits the wall pay receives under HR 49 24 first as a result of this legislation the two major landowners and water uses in the Big Sandy Creek the United States and three port mill minerals corporation will confirm federally reserved water rights to the tribe totaling three hundred acre feet a year for a 60 acre parcel of reservation land along the Big Sandy River Freeport and the United States will also confirm a federally reserved water rights tolling 394 acre feet a year on to off reservation just allotments vision to Hualapai tribal members in the Big Sandy second the agreements ratified by HR 49 24 also provide vital protections for the tribes water rights to feel an it owns along the Big Sandy River called Choya Canyon Ranch this ranch contains a spring that is sacred to the tribe Cofer hot spring the floors of which have diminished in recent years due to pumping by Freeport Freeport has already seized all but the most minimal pumping in the aquifer that treats coal for hot spring and in the green was ratified and approved by HR 4924 Freeport agrees permanently to cease pumping more than minimal amounts from the aquifer Freeport will also give the tribe a right of first refusal to purchase its nearby last a protect the flow of coal for hot spring in addition to these important benefits to the Big Sandy area of Freeport has also contributed 1 million dollars to the cost of an essential engineering steady the tribe has initiated to determine the feasibility and cost of bringing Colorado River water to the Hualapai reservation this contribution to Freeport from Freeport is in combination with funding we have received from the Bureau of Reclamation and the tribes own funds will allow the tribe to complete the steady and then to finish our ongoing negotiations for a comprehensive Colorado River water settlement with the Justice and Interior Department's the state of Arizona and various private entities in Arizona lastly the timely enactment of this legislation Freeport will contribute a substantial additional sum to the tribes economic development fund these Freeport funds are designated for the tribe to use to purchase Colorado water rights these and the additional water rights to be purchased with the report contribution will be critical to the tribes ability negotiated comprehensive settlement of our Colorado River of water rights for all of these reasons the tribe strongly supports HR 49 24 I was very pleased with the provisions of this legislation that will protect its water rights and those of tribal members a lot T's in the Big Sandy Creek thank you very much for your testimony I'm afraid that we're gonna need to move on here your full written testimony will be included in the in the hearing record our thank you I now recognize that Mr Francis McAllister vice president of land and water for the Freeport minerals corporation from Phoenix Arizona to testify Thank You chairman McClintock and representative Gosar my name is Francis McAllister and I am the vice president of land and water for Freeport minerals corporation thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony in support of HR 4924 I'd like to recognize and thank congressman Gosar for sponsoring this bill in the entire Arizona congressional delegation for their bipartisan co-sponsorship in support of this bill I would also like to thank both you both thank you for scheduling this hearing to consider this important piece of legislation and we appreciate the work staff including subcommittee staff on both sides of the aisle have devoted to moving this bill through the process Freeport is one of the world's leading producers of copper and other minerals the company is headquartered in Phoenix Arizona and its workforce in the u.s. at the end of 2013 was thirteen thousand three hundred people and 1,900 contractors one of three ports five arizona operations is the baghdad mine which has been in operation consistently since 1945 and the baghdad mines direct an indirect economic contribution to Arizona's economy totaled 339 point 1 million dollars in 2013 the primary water source for Baghdad mine is the wickiup well field on the Big Sandy River although the company believes the Baghdad operation has sufficient water supplies to support current operations Bagdad faces the potential for increases in competing water demands and variability in water supplies the need to protect and ensure a long-term sustainable water supply for the Baghdad operation is the basis for Freeport's involvement in the water rights settlement with the Hualapai tribe Freeport sought to shore up its existing water rights along the Big Sandy River beginning with the purchase of Planet ranch that was completed in 2011 Planet Ranch is located along the Bill Williams River and has historically been irrigated for agricultural purposes dating back to the 1960s the Big Sandy River Planet ranch settlement agreement and the Hualapai tribe Bill Williams water rights river water rights settlement agreement were negotiated amongst the parties to facilitate some of the to facilitate the transfer of some of Planet ranches water rights to the wickiup well field HR 4924 or the Bill Williams River water rights settlement Act of 2014 approves ratifies and confirms these agreements and represents an important first step in facilitating a comprehensive settlement of the tribes water rights claims in the region in addition to confirmation of certain water rights for the tribe this Act provides for two non-federal financial contributions of which have already been discussed so I'll move on however to further protect existing water rights in the region Freeport agrees to limit its withdraws of water from its wickiup well-filled along the Big Sandy River to no more than ten thousand 55 acre feet per year for the remainder of its mining operations at the Baghdad mine this compromise by Freeport provides a significant increase to the water balance in the area and will help water flows to Alamo Lake and other downstream users in exchange for these concessions the settlement agreement provides to Freeport the necessary waivers of objections to Freeport's continued pumping of up to ten thousand 55 acre feet per year of water from the wickiup well field these waivers provide secure water rights to Freeport for its continued operations at the Baghdad mine and a reasonable level of business assurance for the future in conclusion this settlement act represents the achievements of a fair equitable and final settlement of certain claims among the parties to water rights in the Bill Williams River watershed in the state of Arizona it is beneficial for all parties for all the parties involved by providing long-term certainty and promoting a reliable water supply for the tribe for Freeport and for the lower Basin States the settlement act is a good example of a public-private cooperative resolution of long standing water disputes and will provide clarity and certainty of water resources available at a resource availability to other water users in the state of Arizona thank you again mr. chairman representative Gosar for this opportunity to present this important Indian water rights settlement which will significantly improve the reliability of regional water supplies for Freeport the US and the tribe in the region Freeport strongly supports HR 4924 and looks forward to seeing this pur this provision advance through the legislative process great thank you for your testimony I now recognize mr. Thomas bouche Otsuki assistant director at the Arizona Department of Water Resources from Phoenix Arizona to testify Thank You chairman McClintock and members of the subcommittee I am Tomba Schatz get the assistant director for the water planning division for the Arizona Department of Water Resources thank you for providing me an opportunity to present testimony on behalf of the state of Arizona in support of HR 49:24 the bill williams river water rights settlement act of 2014 Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has previously previously expressed written support for this legislation earlier this year Governor Brewer released a report prepared by the department entitled Arizona's next century a strategic vision for water supply sustainability the strategic vision will guide Arizona's efforts to secure water supplies to meet current and anticipated demands and provide a stable economy for our future the bill williams river water ID Settlement Act is consistent with the strategic vision report and advances the reports goals in at least three respects the two water rights settlements agreements authorized by this act will provide a more secure water supply for the Hualapai tribe Freeport minerals corporation the Arizona Game and Fish Commission the Hualapai tribe has water ice claims for three trust land parcels within the watershed tree port will confirm water rights for those three parcels and will agree to take certain actions to protect the physical water supply for those parcels and for cofer hot spring as part of the settlement parties will confirm certain water rights of Freeport in the watershed in addition the Act will direct the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw objections to applications Freeport filed with the Department to sever and transfer surface water rights from Planet Ranch and Lincoln Ranch in the watershed to the wickiup well field for use at free ports Bagdad mine Freeport will agree to cap the volume of water from those wells at historic levels and Freeport will confirm and agree not to challenge the Arizona Game and Fish Commission s water rights in the Bill Williamson River watershed the Big Sandy River Planet Ranch water ID settlement agreement will help secure Arizona's 2.8 million acre-feet annual allocation of water from the Colorado River through the donation of land by Freeport to the Lower Colorado River multi species conservation program the program allows water providers and power users from the Lower Colorado River in Arizona California and Nevada to achieve long-term compliance with endangered species laws Freeport release approximately 3,400 acres of farmland from Planet ranch and their water rights to the United States Bureau of Reclamation for 50 years reclamation will use the land and water rights to create and maintain habitat for endangered and threatened species that's part of the MSC P Freeport will then donate the leased land and water rights to the Arizona Game and Fish Commission subject to the lease to reclamation the addition of this land for the MSC P will create a significant benefit the continued success of the MSC P is critical to the economy of the state of Arizona and its citizens by ensuring the continued availability of Arizona's Colorado River water supplies actions to secure that water supply are therefore consistent with the strategic vision and help further its goals the third way in which the Act advances the strategic visions goals is that it will facilitate a future comprehensive settlement all the Hualapai tribes water-ice claims in Arizona including its claims to the Colorado River this Act authorizes settlement a portion of the qualifies tribes claims strategic vision report recognizes the importance of continuing the state's policy of resolving the outstanding tribal auto rights claims in Arizona through settlement rather than litigation to provide a secure water supply for tribal communities and to provide longtime certainty for all water users in Arizona the settlement agreements authorized by this act further that goal Freeport has transferred 1 million dollars to the tribe as a contribution toward the cost of the tribes study of water project alternatives that could be part of a comprehensive settlement furthermore Freeport will contribute money to a Hualapai tribe economic development fund the tribe may use that money only to acquire colorado river water rights those water rights purchased by the tribe will facilitate a comprehensive settlement by providing a water supply that will partially meet the water demands on the tribes reservation reducing the amount of water needed from other sources in conclusion the state of Arizona strongly supports this legislation the legislation authorizes a settlement that not only will provide secure water supplies for the settling parties in the Bill Williams River watershed but also will provide benefits through other water users in the state the settlement will provide land and water rights to help achieve the goals of the Lower Colorado River multi-species conservation plan and will pave the way for a comprehensive water ID settlement with the Hualapai tribe thank you again for the opportunity to present the state's state of Arizona support for this legislation thank you for your testimony our final witness is the Honorable Michael black director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the Interior Department in Washington DC to testify good morning chairman McClintock and representative Gosar as you said I'm Mike black director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the Department of Interior and I'm pleased to provide the department's views on HR 2940 our HR 4920 for the bill williams river water rights settlement Act of 2014 HR 49:24 would authorize ratify and confirm two agreements which would resolve a number of issues in the Bill Williams River Basin including issues related to a Severn transfer of water rights to serve Freeport minerals corporations mining operation in the Lower Colorado River multi-species conservation program as well as resolving certain water rate issues among Freeport United States in the Hualapai tribe while the administration supports the goals of the bill we have significant concerns about the waiver of sovereign immunity provisions that must be resolved before the administration can support the bill we look forward to working with the parties the bill sponsors in the committee's two are the committee to address these issues the Hualapai tribe claims water rights in the colorado birhday and bill williams river basins negotiations regarding potential settlement of the water rights claims of the tribe in arizona have been ongoing since 2011 one matter addressed in the negotiations has concerned applications filed in 2010 by Freeport to sever and transfer certain water rights in the basin for the benefit of the mining operations at their Baghdad copper mine the department protested those applications to protect federally reserved water rights including water rights that the department holds in trust for the tribe and rights associated with lands held by Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management HR 49:24 would approve two agreements in which among other things Freeport agrees to confirm the tribes water rights claims related to the small executive order reservation initially the tries primary objectives to negotiate a comprehensive settlement for both its main reservation and its smaller executive order reservation early in the negotiations however serious technical issues were identified with respect to the water infrastructure projects proposed on the main Hualapai reservation that required the investigation of additional alternatives before the tribes water rights in the Colorado River basin can be resolved at the same time the Hualapai tribe Freeport in the United States decided that negotiations over over certain time sensitive issues related to Freeport sever and transfer applications should proceed as a result the original contemplated comprehensive settlement will split into two phases the first phase which is the subject of HR 49:24 focuses on resolution of certain water rights issues in the bill Wayans River Basin involving the tribe the Department of Interior the Arizona Game and Fish Commission and Freeport it is expected that future negotiations to which all the parties including Freeport have committed will address additional water rights of the non tribal parties in the Bill Williams River Basin as well as a comprehensive settlement of all the tribes water rights claims for its main reservation HR 4924 would authorize ratify and confirm two agreements the Big Sandy River Planet Ranch water right settlement agreement and the Hualapai tribe bill williams river water eight settlement agreement indirect the Secretary of Interior to execute both agreements there is no ongoing general water rights adjudication in this Basin to provide a mechanism by which all the water rate users in the basin can be bound consequently of the agreements are settlements among only some of the water users in the Bill Williams River Basin including Freeport which claims significant if not the largest water rights in the basin I have summarized the key features of these two agreements in my written testimony HR 4924 provides a number of benefits for all of the parties as well as the many parties that are participants in the Lower Colorado River multi species conservation program the parties have negotiated intensively within the last year to reach agreement and have dissolved many of the issues however there is still one important issue in a few smaller matters to be worked out with respect to both of these agreements as a result the administration cannot support the legislation as introduced but we would support an amended bill that adequately addresses our concerns most significantly we oppose the bill's inclusion of a new ad hoc waiver of sovereign immunity for the United States these agreements like other settlements that the United States enters into can be a forced against the United States through existing avenues including waivers of sovereign immunity such as those provided in the Tucker Act the Administrative Procedures Act and the McCarran amendment the United States has repeatedly communicated its concerns about the waiver of sovereign immunity to the parties and proposed alternative ways to address the parties enforcement concerns although the parties in the United States have not reached agreement and on an alternative to the proposed waiver of sovereign immunity at this time we are committed to continue working with the parties in the committee to find solutions to this issue in addition the department has a number of other concerns with HR 49:24 has introduced we have been working closely with the parties to resolve a number of other concerns with the bill and we believe that we have made substantial progress on those issues including proposed changes to the bill language the department looks forward to working with the parties the sponsor and the committee to fix the one remaining significant issue in the legislation so that the United States can support the bill thank you thank you for testimony will now move to committee questions the chair will defer to the bills author or mr. Gosar for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman mr. McAllister thank you very much for making the trip now CBO has reviewed this bill in regards to direct spending and costs can you explain to us why there is no cost or a score mr. chairman representative Gosar it's our understanding that through this bill there are no new appropriations that will be created the contributions that will be made to the Hualapai tribe will come from Freeport rather than from the government now this bill has the support of the entire Arizona delegation both Republican and Democrat that's a kind of a rarity wouldn't you agree aye chairman McClintock representative Gosar I'm not an expert in that but I do believe that with regard to water rights settlements in the state of Arizona there typically is a significant amount of support for these these legislation acts and you testified that the Bagdad mind has an implication to the state's economy of about 300 350 million dollars is that true representative Gosar yes the the figure is three hundred and thirty nine point 1 million dollars that the Bagdad mine alone contributed to the state of Arizona in 2013 and how many jobs are associated with that mine the mine directly employs 870 individuals but if you extrapolate that out to indirect support there's a total of about 3,600 jobs that are created through the operation of the mine in the state of Arizona so pretty significant when we're talking about impacts particularly to that local area that's correct now there's a timetable factor in regards to this bill and why is this legislation critical to that timetable Arizona statute requires that water rights be put to beneficial use within five years we Freeport acquired the planet Ranch in December of 2011 and to be in compliance with that statute the water rights must be put to beneficial use by December of 2016 thank you assistant director blue shot ski thanks you again for traveling all the way out here to Washington DC and testifying on the importance of this bill you testified that HR 49:24 is consistent with a strategic vision report advances the report's goal of securing water supplies to meet current and anticipated demands given the lack of moisture and drought conditions except recently with their unusual hurricane aspects conditions the last over the last year can you elaborate and why securing such water supplies of critical importance representative Gosar the strategic vision and other planning documents project a 40 percent increase in the growth of demand over the next 100 years in Arizona it's imperative that we begin to develop supplies now that we have that are not being used we need infrastructure for that and also to look at augmenting our supplies for the future many of these water projects take decades to plan and put into into action and so we need to start now gotcha and you're usually ahead of the curve in Arizona are we not yes you already have a long history of very good water planning that's put us in a really good place in Arizona now settling unresolved water right claims as a priority for the state of Arizona correct yes representative Gosar and you mentioned that while we have made progress on claims for 13 tribes 11 tribes still have unresolved water rights claims you touched on in your testimony but can you elaborate on why it's beneficial for the state and the water users in the West frankly to result claims sooner than later representative Gosar the certainty that comes with adjudicated water rights may allow for water market transfers it allows for better management and more efficient management management of water supplies and for better planning so that we can use every drop to the best possible use now you testified that this bill will help achieve the goals of the multi species conservation program can you discuss why this is an important piece of the bill to the state of Arizona representative Gosar compliance with the Endangered Species Act species act as an absolute necessity to keep the water flowing to citizens in Arizona and to generate power along the Colorado River furthermore the MS CP pre-approved so to speak changes and points to diversion along the river for Arizona and that also might help facilitate the market-based water transfers I referred to earlier well thank you thank you councilman bajwa and thank you for making it to travel all the way across to Washington DC now you touched on in your testimony but can you elaborate on why the legislation is critical for the future sustainability of the tribe representative Gosar it is very important because the Hualapai nation has been for many years trying to get its water rights for our reservation and right now you know we are doing developments economic developments on the reservation and and the number one issue that we have is lack of water for further developments to increase our tourism Enterprise out there and which is our sole support for the Hualapai nation it is very successful and right now we're getting a larger number of Tours that are coming out with the completion of the diamond borrowed on the traffic is more heavy which requires a large amount of water for Green Canyon West area so it is very crucial that we do follow through with this and that the Hualapai tribe is granted water rights on the Colorado River thank you very much mm-hmm am I correct that the principal outstanding controversy is the limited waiver of sovereign immunity anyone want to I think I'd be fair to say yes okay mr. McAllister Mizpah jalwa why is that necessary in this measure would you please repeat that question why is the limited waiver of sovereign immunity necessary to make this agreement work I would think that you know of any kind of legal issues that come out that it can be taken in you know settlement or an agreement can come up to resolve this issues mr. McAllister yes mr. mr. chairman thank you first of all the limited waiver of sovereign immunity is is not unique to water rights settlements the water rights settlements in the state of Arizona the vast majority of them have limited waivers of sovereign immunity which are included within them so so this is not an unprecedented action that is correct okay and why is it necessary to refer this particular agreement when the parties to this agreement enter into the agreement and it goes enforceable we need to have an economic an enforce this agreement and we don't believe without the limited waiver of sovereign immunity we would be able to enforce this agreement so without the delimited waiver the agreements unenforceable and therefore meaningless I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily call it meaningless I would say that we if the well of an agreement that can't be enforced is simply a voluntary arrangement that can fall apart at any time you're correct mr. chairman and therefore if if there were no enforcement mechanism the agreement would be pointless because it can't be maintained or enforced correct sir mr. boo shot ski do you everybody thoughts on this mr. Chairman I would just add to what's been stated by mr. McAllister that obviously one of the key elements of these settlements are the certainty that create without the limited waiver of sovereign immunity some of that certainty kind of goes away and they're left kind of which with an uncertain future if you can't enforce the agreements I I frankly have never fully understood the justification for sovereign immunity it's the notion that the government can do no wrong and therefore cannot be sued without its consent and as we have all observed the government can do wrong has often done wrong and can often do more damage than any private party when it does wrong it also seems to me to be a bit of a despotic holdover from European monarchies where the government is sovereign this nation was founded on a completely different principle in this nation that people are sovereign the government is hired help and so frankly I'd like to see the entire notion ripped out of all of our laws but this limited waiver for the sole purpose of assuring that the agreement between all the parties can be enforced particularly when it has ample precedent in other such agreements seems to be a very reasonable provision and I frankly don't understand the controversy involved but there it is mr. black you want to add anything you know I think you know at this time as I stated in my oral and written testimony I think we've offered up all other alternatives and we do feel as the administration that there are other avenues that will meet what's asked for here that concludes my questioning Yoda mr. gosar you know director black I know your agency has been intially intimately involved in the discussions and agreements and we'll cut that will codify by our codified by this legislation can you expand just a little bit more brief the benefits to the tribe the Department of Interior as a result of this legislation yeah you know I think with some of the previous testimony the other witness has really kind of highlighted many of those those who would rather prefer early significant benefits to the Hualapai tribe under this these two agreements and one of the largest ones would be the furtherance of their overall water rights settlement for their main reservation which could be helped to be achieved through the contribution that Freeport will be making to the tribe to complete the alternative studies of the water delivery systems which would be part of a larger benefit as well as the contribution to their Economic Development Fund which would also allow them to purchase Colorado River water which could be used as part of a larger settlement thank you mr. McHale mr. McAllister Freeport Maron is one of the biggest employers in the Mojave County is it not we are a substantial employer in Yavapai County which is right next we do some of our workforce is located in Mojave County that is correct the biggest employer in Mojave County is who you know that I believe the biggest employer to my knowledge in Mojave County is the Hualapai tribe can you explain a little bit about that would you would like me to explain mhm the Hualapai tribe has done quite a bit of economic development on their reservation they've developed Grand Canyon West and it does employ quite a few people up in that in that area councilman Basra you've seen in your testimony you talked about the increased tourism particularly with the road construction come coming in to completion is that true yes right after the Diamond Bar did open we did see a 70% increase in detours that were coming out by diamond by Road and like I said you know there's quite a few tours that are coming out and the lack of water there you know it's very crucial that there has been an increase and we do employ probably more than 50% from the Mojave County so that last year when Congress couldn't get along and we had a government slowdown that you actually did have access to the park did you not yes sir so you got pretty busy so once again a nice portal for the Grand Canyon that's correct hmm so you're part of a very strong part of the economic empowerment of Mojave County would you agree yes sir and there are also individuals coming in from Las Vegas that we do employ so these so do you see the future of the of the tribe with Mojave County being an integral aspect of working together and that kind of having a terse relationship but that would that be very beneficial yes sir so it it benefits everybody to get along and understand the mechanics of water policy that's correct and I think working as partnerships that would be very great well I thank you very much for traveling all the way out here and thanks for smiling thank you and with that if there are no further questions I'd like to thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony the record will be held open for the statement of the ranking member and any other members that wish to present statements well mr. chairman will will be supplying a number of documents over the next 10 days for the record and the record will be held open for that purpose there may also be other questions submitted to the witnesses in writing we'd ask that you respond to those and the record will be held open for 10 days for that purpose as well and if there's no further business to come before the subcommittee without objection the subcommittee stands adjourned

the fact is if we don't agree to the science to crush the virus if they did what is in our bill that science dictates that we do then if we do that we can lower the incidence of the virus in certain areas open schools open businesses and the rest if we don't we're just giving money to the president to spend any way he wants and that has not been in furtherance of crushing the virus so again in terms of we all want an agreement nobody wants it more than the house democrats we represent these people we have been fighting for food for the hungry of rent assistance for those who may be evicted but most importantly we really have to stop the spread of the virus

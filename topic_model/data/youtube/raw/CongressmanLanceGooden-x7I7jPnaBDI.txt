joining us right now is Texas congressman House Financial Services Committee member Lance Gooden and Congress are it's good to see this morning thanks so much for joining us thanks for having so confirm what we've been speculating this morning and that is everything is off the table in terms of legislative progress they're gonna they're gonna pursue an impeachment obviously that means no us MCA that means no immigration no guns no health care nothing gets done is that right that's right and they started this Congress saying we want to work across the aisle and deliver for the American people they've accomplished nothing and they've confirmed with their latest actions yesterday that it's going to be more of the same through Christmas and you are introducing a resolution to remove Jerry Nadler as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in response to the impeachment proceedings that that he's overseen you say chairman Nadler is quote ripping this country apart tell us more yes so what we did back in July was we actually voted on an impeachment resolution we brought it to the floor it failed Democrats didn't even get a majority of their caucus to support it what chairman adler has done is gone forward with an impeachment inquiry that was not authorized by the house House Rules say that we have to actually vote on that and he has said it say that many times where I'm impeaching the president we are in impeachment proceedings what Nancy Pelosi said yesterday changes absolutely nothing all she did was come out and endorse the illegal act that chairman adler has been putting forward since July since all this started we have to take this up in the full house for this to be a legitimate impeachment inquiry we haven't done that Nancy Pelosi is not going to make the 31 Democrats to sit in districts that Trump won four years ago actually take that tough vote they don't care about impeaching because once they impeach they know he's acquitted in the Senate if the Senate even takes it up what they want to do is they want to drag this out and smear the president until they election congressman what happens today when the transcript is released if in fact there's nothing in there that indicates that there was any wrongdoing on that phone call the president has said that yesterday in her comments Pelosi basically condemned him and called him guilty for betraying us with his actions so what happens to her position today if in fact that transcript comes out and shows there's nothing you know I don't know that Nancy Pelosi would have done everything she did yesterday if she had Cristobal that said that transcripts coming out tomorrow it makes no sense to me that they jumped the gun on this and that they're not just waiting to see what this transcript and this whistleblower report actually says but if in fact it comes out today as I suspect it will as the president has said it will and it says nothing of material substance I think you're gonna see a lot of head-scratching at least privately complaining in the democratic caucus and i don't know how they'll spin it but i'm sure they'll find a way well congressman this is Kelly Torrance you you had a good point about do they have the votes I mean if they don't if Nancy Pelosi doesn't think she has the votes to bring the idea an inquiry for impeachment to the floor will they have the votes for impeachment but I was also wondering would they have the votes to do any of the stuff we've been talking about the trade agreement gun control gun issues I mean is it just that this was impossible for these people Democrats and Republicans to work with each other right now because Democrats are just intent on never giving President Trump and Republicans a win a few first of all yes but a few predictions one I suspect they'll end up getting there by December with their vote count on impeachment guns they never could come to an agreement u.s. MCA that's unique because it's the one issue Democrats and Republicans have agreed on Nancy Pelosi knows there's bipartisan support but they refuse to deliver a victory to the president they do not want him claiming victory in any way so that's especially frustrating especially to some of these swing district Democrats who needed to go back to their district and deliver a win the u.s. MCA was one of those issues so the the question is will voters respond to that I mean the House Democrats are expected to meet today to discuss the president's trade deal with Canada and Mexico do you think if it goes away and we don't see it ever come to the floor will the nafta revision be put on the backburner and do voters react Kelley on this and and and vote them out basically and that's you know this is a great question because trade is one of the things really getting a new agreements one thing that President Trump I ran on and this is something that people in a lot of these areas that are swing districts were wanting a win on they saw some manufacturing leaving they felt that the deal had been unfair to Americans it was something that President Trump promised to do my other question is if it doesn't pass before the end of October there's an election going on in Canada right now I'm mr. Justin Trudeau is having a little problem there it's got some Brown face black face photos that have surfaced but so what happens if he is out well the will the Conservatives win and perhaps they don't like some of the compromises that Trudeau made to get the deal with the Trump and the Mexican what about that congressman because Kevin McCarthy has been on this program than one hour earlier and he he was stressing then he wanted to see us MC a to the floor before the the Canada election so what happens to us MC a ones like if Justin Trudeau loses for example I think it's a huge problem and you know the question about will the voters punish the Congress I think you go back in history if you look after Barack Obama's bad midterm 2010 Republicans win the house I think Republicans mismanaged that because Republicans said we are not going to deliver Barack Obama any wins whatsoever voters didn't punish Barack Obama they reelected him fast forward to now Democrats are doing the same thing Republicans did I think they'll really like the president reward him punished Congress high congressman will we'll leave it there thanks very much for joining us we'll be watching concrete good and a

hi i'm congresswoman lori trahan and i want to thank you all for tuning in to our discussion series on being the change conversations with leaders to fight uh to end racial injustice if you tuned in last week you know that these conversations with experts will focus on how inequality and justice and racism affect communities of color and how we must ensure that long overdue action in several areas of public policy is finally taken this friday will mark three weeks since the house of representatives passed the george floyd justice and policing act a bill which will change the way policing is done in communities across the country yet mitch mcconnell continues to refuse to take legislation to take this legislation up for a vote in the senate but it's so important that we recognize that we can't let him stand in the way of progress this movement is bigger than him it's bigger than any one of us and this movement goes far beyond tackling the issue of police brutality and racial profiling and that's why we have to keep the momentum going and it's why i'm thrilled to be joined today by my friend and my classmate in the house congresswoman lauren underwood for a discussion about the racial disparities that persist in our health care system this is an extremely important issue that has been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic which has disproportionately affected black men and women and these past few months have highlighted what communities of color have known to be true for decades disparities in health care are deadly make no mistake racism is a public health crisis and as as a community and as a nation we know we can fix this problem but we need to start by actually acknowledging that this issue is real and that it continues to persist in every corner of our country with that i have to turn it over to congresswoman underwood who proudly represents illinois's 14th congressional district before coming to congress congresswoman underwood was a nurse and served as a senior advisor to the u.s department of health and human services where she helped communities across the country prevent and prepare for disasters bio terror threats and public health emergencies we're lucky to have her expertise in the house and during that time she's utilized her health public health experience to lead on a wide array of health care issues affecting not only families in her district but across the country last year she co-founded the black maternal health caucus with congresswoman alma adams to address the disparity in maternal mortality rates where black women are three to four more times three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy related complications than white women and are also twice as likely to lose an infant to premature death her contributions on this important topic have been pivotal in moving forward the national conversation surrounding black women's health lauren it's so great to see you welcome thanks lori it's so good to be with you so i have to kick it off uh with the question i want our audience to know your inspiring story you've been talking about racial inequality and injustice for a long time and frankly right now there are a lot of people young and old who are wondering what path do i take to make a difference in my community so how about you sharing with us how you decided your path well thanks for that question um i had to think back and you know when i was in elementary school i grew up in the community that i live in now it's a town called naperville it's 45 minutes west of chicago at that time it was like a farming community that was just beginning to transition to the vibrant suburban environment that we are right now and i was a very active kid and one day i was in a swim lesson and it was anxious because that day we had to learn how to tread water and i was scared and got a little bit hysterical in the pool and my heart started racing and it just never slowed down i ended up getting pulled out to the pool gone to my doctor's office off to the emergency department and ultimately got got diagnosed with a heart condition and the experience that i had as a young girl in our healthcare system inspired me ultimately to go into nursing and wanting to have this career in public health to help other young kids um and other families be able to you know survive what could be and otherwise just like so traumatic devastating diagnosis and process and so that commitment to health and well-being is what introduced me to this idea of health disparities and illuminating these inequalities within a healthcare system that just doesn't treat all of us the same when we present with the same symptoms or the same challenges one group of people is taken seriously another group of people is told to go home or denied pain medication or you know whatever else and you know that just never sat right with me of course uh as it shouldn't and you know specifically you have uh not only led but i think you've educated so many of our colleagues about the racial disparities that exist in maternal health uh you know as a nurse can you just explain this issue to folks tuning in and the work you're doing uh to address it yes so the united states leads the developed world and maternal mortality rates meaning the number of moms that die as a result of childbirth and the full year postpartum and the reason that the united states leads the industrial world is because of a disparity seen among black women and native american women black women are three to four times more likely to die as a result of childbirth in this country compared to white women and you can control for anything how much money you make whether you have an edu like high school degree or college degree or graduate degree the disparity persists whether or not you had health care coverage whether or not you got prenatal care where geographically you live if you delivered in a hospital right like you can control for anything and the disparity persists and my state of illinois black women are six times more likely to die and these are statistics that have been unchanging my entire lifetime and i'm 33 years old and so um after losing a friend from graduate school who was a phd level sociologist and gerontologist she was an epidemiologist actually down at the centers for disease control and prevention who had been dedicating her career to ending disparities she died three weeks after giving birth to a beautiful baby girl and after losing her in 2017 i knew that i had to do something if i were lucky enough to win my election and so teamed up with alma adams to start this caucus thank you lori for being in our caucus and you know just recently we introduced um something called the momnibus act which is this huge set of bills nine bills to comprehensively address this maternal mortality crisis in the united states and so our legislation tackles things like um mental health and behavioral health issues so for example you know we have had this conversation for a number of years about postpartum depression right everybody's familiar with that and you know a lot of people can even speak to the signs of postpartum depression but what happens if it goes beyond depression there's a suicide ideation or substance use disorder so many of our communities don't have the dedicated resources to help pregnant women or new moms be able to get treatment and care we want to be able to fix that yeah um having diverse health providers right cleaning up the data there's so many inconsistencies stink uh from you know across the country things like that so that's what we've been working on oh well thank you for your leadership on that i know that uh whenever i have a question uh or you know even just like the diagnosis is so clear and you like normalize that with all of us and now it is about you know digging in getting to the root cause of these issues and coming up with thoughtful policy prescriptions there is just no excuse for our country uh to be uh where it is um in terms of you know these disparities uh and lives are lives are lost as a result which is just um well it's what makes this uh a crisis well you know what it's interesting about this is you know this is an issue that we are able to build bridges with right so there are colleagues that represent rural communities that don't share our values on other issues that care about this issue because it impacts their communities and they see it republican democrat rural urban right old young everybody men and women right everybody can recognize that our moms should be living to be able to raise their children and you know continue forward with their lives that's exactly right that's exactly right well um you know it's been three weeks uh since we passed the justice and policing act and it was a tremendous moment in the house but it's important you know for all of us uh to root out racism in all its hiding places and finally implement fair and just policy prescriptions um in healthcare and housing transportation education the workplace everywhere besides your leadership on maternal health for black women what other areas are you looking to to make an impact on yes so access to care is a key driver towards the health disparities and maternal health but just throughout our health care system yielding poor health outcomes for african americans and people of color in this country and so congresswoman troy han and i had the opportunity to vote and pass a bill the patient protection and affordable care enhancement act the first fix to the aca that we've been able to pass out of the house in 10 years since the law has been around and within that legislation we had a provision that i authored to lower out-of-pocket premium costs so everybody here is familiar with obamacare and we know that oftentimes those plans are expensive and so if we can expand the access to the tax credits and lower that out-of-pocket payment every month we could help free up space those health care dollars for things like prescription drugs or getting a procedure or something like that which i think is so critical we talk about lowering prescription drug costs but um we also need to make sure that families have that that money even available on those prescriptions terrific and you know you and i both sit on the education and labor committee and i know we've we've talked about this issue before but would you mind sharing with folks tuning in your thoughts about the importance of building a strong pipeline of black teachers of black doctors and medical profession uh professionals uh that are crucial to closing the gaps that we see in health uh outcomes uh for black americans yes so you know i am obviously a black woman did not grow up with black teachers i didn't have a black healthcare provider i had to seek one out as an adult um and you know when we think about the pipeline and the workforce you know we just don't have the diversity in these critical professions that would allow individuals to have choice in their providers um and you know in the education space it's really a problem because we think about achievement we think about that student walks into a classroom and brings their whole lived experience and if they aren't able to connect with that educator there's not trust um if they're not there's literally barriers like language barriers or something like that that it prevents their ability to grow learn and succeed and so that's why it's important for us to be tackling these issues at the congressional level to make sure that all children have the opportunity to be as you know successful and you know healthy as they can be absolutely and and you know you can't be what you what you don't see right that's so important uh for uh we've heard on the community level i mean we've as i'm sure you have we've attended a lot of listening sessions um you know after george floyd but you know touching on everything and this is a big one right i mean there are a lot of uh school districts that they don't have teachers that are reflective of the student body that they teach and uh and it's something that's long been sort of taken for granted uh but it it matters right it matters in the doctor's office it matters in our in our community hospitals and our health centers and it certainly matters in our our school system um so okay i know we try to you know keep these uh moving and uh very judicious with uh with our guests time uh but last week i was joined by congress uh woman karen bass uh chairwoman uh karen bass and and we discussed how people can sustain this movement well into the future uh what advice do you have for people who are looking to sustain this movement for justice and what are some of the best ways for everyday people right students moms activists uh who are committed to turning protests into action you know there's so many areas in our own lives that we can examine from the stores that we frequent the products that we buy understanding who owns those establishments or who manufactures those products to you know the media that we seek to consume right are we are we viewing programs and movies that that illustrate a diverse swath of our country are we seeking out stories to learn more about the human experience that may not mirror our own experiences is our heart open to learning and growing and changing and i think that if we start there within ourselves and our practices every day we'll be busy like there's a lot of work that we all can do you know i like to challenge myself you know to be able to diversify my own patterns learn something new and about myself but also about our community and about the world and i think that how we spend those dollars how we spend our time and what what we seek to learn um can can you know change our whole perspective absolutely and making that contagious too right it's uh it's you know chairwoman bass gave similar advice right i mean sometimes it can feel daunting to try to impact you know what washington is doing but the reality is so much is done on the ground in our communities in our families small choices yeah yes and uh and they have they're probably um one the the most impactful uh because you know you're you're you're just in close proximity to the people that you can influence uh so that's terrific so hey i have to be respectful of your time and i'll wrap it up but just thank you uh for taking time out of your busy schedule to join me after this discussion i know that the folks out there really appreciate uh tuning in and hearing insights um on you know this these vitally important issues from people that they don't often get access to and i'm so grateful for all of your leadership and your friendship over these past 18 months uh and of course everyone out there thank you for watching if you know if you have thoughts

events make sure that you're following along here on our facebook page finally please keep in mind uh that we are still in the middle of a global pandemic while massachusetts has done a great job uh responding to this crisis we're still seeing dangerous spikes in cases in a number of states across the country so we need to make sure that we're continuing to do our part to keep the number of new cases down our healthcare heroes and our emergency workers are relying on us to adhere to the basics right wearing a mask washing our hands keeping our distance from others in public so with that thank you again thank you lauren stay safe and stay healthy everyone good to see you goodbye bye

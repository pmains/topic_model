joining us now with the phone is Jim Hagedorn he's running for Congress in the first congressional district he is not the endorsed candidate the universe canada in that race is aaron miller a number of weeks ago aaron miller was endorsed and jim Hagedorn led the effort to get him endorsed by acclamation now is running running against him in the primary good morning Jim well good morning it's great to be with you thank you how are you today oh just fine now why the change of heart why you now running in a primary when you had previously said you wouldn't yeah people ask what changed in the last six weeks and my answer is nothing and that's the point you know what was going on there sir just what's an active campaign brewing and I decided to get back in the race and give us a chance to go after Tim also I believed I candidacy offers the folks and opportunity to vote for a candidate who will make walls of liberal record you know the referendum of the election what is how I think you have to win is it possible that the Miller campaign was doing stuff that you just didn't see when you say there wasn't a campaign growing how do you know were you on the inside of that campaign well I think when you look at how a candidates working out there we were six weeks in which is twenty percent of the general election campaign there were no issue positions put out there by the candidate there were no issue position press releases going after walls very few of any public campaign events no real campaign events to draw in new voters to get your name out there and missing key events like the albert lee VA dedication i'm not saying to go there to campaign but you should go there to shake hands and let people know that that like congressman walz you support the veteran and so based on that based on the record based on what people were saying we decided to get back in and make it a race ok have you experienced pushed back because of your decision well any time you buck party establishment there's going to be pushback I understand that I mean this isn't the first time I've had to do what I thought was right and get at odds with her with the Republican establishment at one point I I challenged President Bush on an issue where they wanted to waste five hundred million dollars on a Treasury proposal and I risked my job and went up to Capitol Hill and got some legislation passed which still in existence today so I think we're doing it for the right reasons and hopefully over time people will understand okay now is your campaign for the primary can they campaign against Aaron Miller a campaign against Tim Walz well you can see for yourself we've been out for the last two days crisscross in the district taken race directly liberal Tim Walter been letting people know he's the most liberal congressmen the history of southern Minnesota he voted for all the big government Obama programs Obamacare cap and trade dodd-frank all these EPA regulations all the spending they doubled the national debt under walls he's even for abortion in the seventh eighth ninth month of pregnancy Wow now crank that liberal correct me if I'm wrong congressman Walz does not portray himself as a liberal when he's in Minnesota but does exactly what you've said while in DC well I'm not worried about what congressman Walz portrays himself I'm worried about what I'm portraying congressman Walz okay I think that's it a difference of the style of campaign first of all I think you got to you got to devote a hundred percent of your time and attention to a race like this you can't feed an incumbent congressman unless the challengers out there each and every day taking the race the wall and my job is to let people know about his liberal records if at the end of this campaign this election is not a referendum on walls of failed record we can't win you can't run an image race against a congressman you got to go out there and let people know what he stands for give them some bold conservative ideas to contrast that and and let the people decide how do you how do do you plan to bring Obamacare up this campaign well I did you know the first part of the race we announced in September and ran 18 hour days seven days a week going after walls I was the first one out of the gate to say a matter of fact in my announcement speech in September repeal and replace Obamacare that was kind of unheard of there were very few candidates across the country making that type of a challenge and so we need to replace Obamacare with free-market reforms like everyone talks about centered on health savings accounts basically getting back to where people are shopping and buying their own stuff and where the government is out of it this top-down government approaches and can work and before I held a press conference in front of walls is rochester office to let the people of southern Minnesota know that his Obamacare boat put a bull's-eye on Mayo Clinic put a bull's-eye on the southern Minnesota because it's going to underfund medicine it's going to be great medicine so we got to get rid of Obamacare to help the people in southern Minnesota are people getting that in Rochester people involved to Mayo Clinic are they getting that well you know Mayo Clinic and the people of Rochester have a different perspective I suppose they're hoping for the best I think in the long run the more people understand what Obamacare is not ruled out I think they're going to come along but you know it's my job as a person running for office to get out there and try to leave eat on the issue and let him know where I think things are going before Obamacare went live I predicted that it was going to drive up costs and it was going to hurt people and they're gonna lose insurance and people thought oh you know how do you know that I said well it's common sense and then it happened and so I think all along we're going to see that this chef doesn't work now prior to Tim Walz Gill Kunak a Republican represented that area for for quite a long time has the district change ideologically or is it just because of reapportionment and redistricting what makes what has made Tim Walz so hard to beat down there well politics is about trends and it's about the pendulum swinging one way or the other congressman Walz came into office in 2006 and a big Democrat wave and in since then he's been a hard hard worker as far as letting people know who he is and what he's doing and hey look he hasn't done everything wrong I'm not going to say that that Tim Walz is the worst guy ever I just think his philosophy in the votes these cast even hurt the people when they when they focus on that they're going to see the difference but one of the reasons he was able to get in the office it's because Republicans had lost their way and you know I talked about the stacking like 2005 as the Republican Party spent too much money we expand in government we didn't handle our stuff on uneven immigration after nine eleven you know we got ourselves in the wars of diminishing returns and did nation building which nobody ever thought we do and I think because of that there was a reaction and Congress when the walls were swept in but hey there's another way brewing and maybe we'll sweep them back out so Jim what makes you qualified what's your background well but backgrounds have been fighting the left at the national level most of my life worked for a Minnesota congressman named stanglin or we did good things like work for welfare Second Amendment rights broad-based tax reform right to life also had in the executive branch is a official the Treasury Department and I claim the famous said I put a bill together got it through Congress that actually downsized my own agency one of the best people ever ever to run for office that's done something like that the bill is called EFT 99 and we closed for government check writing centers eliminated five percent of my agency's budget and I mean a workforce and save the taxpayers well over a billion dollars I think you should head every department in the federal government well you're very kind but it's a tough job one of the things I think we need me to do in this next Congress is as Republicans I think the speaker whoever the speaker is should put together a select committee metal committee to go out there and analyze each of the departments and agencies as best we can and prepare reform bills that we can put together when we have another Republican president and another Republican Senate and try and try truly to reform the government and frankly I think we need to start with the Pentagon I don't want to cut paste I don't want to cut benefits I don't want to cut weapons systems but the Pentagon is filled with waste fraud and abuse well we had a was at the f-35 engine we there was talk about that the the Pentagon didn't want the engine but it was it was made because members who had factories in their districts wanted it and it was billions upon billions of dollars wasted certainly in the defense budget there's places you can cut without affecting national security sure that goes on quite a bit and you know that that happens in other areas of government as well I just think that the nuts and bolts of the Pentagon the offices you know some of the some of the way they procure things like you're talking about yeah I think that could be changed within save some cash you know if the way to win the first if the way of the win again Tim Walz is to keep is to make the campaign about Tim Walz doesn't go into a primary distract from that mission well it will depend on how both candidates act I'm in the race as I said from the beginning to take it to walls that's what I did you know in the first part of the campaign before the the nomination and that's what I'm doing now and I have no intentions of doing anything otherwise so I think if both camps stick to that then we've got two messages going after walls you know two people in the district running around going after Walt not just one not just me and I think it will be effective Tom's got Jim Hagedorn your website is Jim Hagedorn dot-org correct yes sir h a g.e.d o RN jim hagen org thanks very much for the time this morning and good luck to you in the primary well thank you i appreciate your time take care morning what you think I'm still trying to wrap my head around the idea of I haven't seen this this other guy inhumane very much even though it's the beginning of the campaign been on the inside of campaigns after you win endorsement to immediately hold a press conference an event where you like the opposition so penny say you have to throw you have to raise money mm-hmm in order to have a cat or tab like a bigger events yeah uh you have it is it is a marathon not a sprint and so it's you it's you have to you have to be doing things mmhmm yeah you should probably have some issue statements being put out stuff like that Jim Hagedorn probably has no idea what was going on on the inside of the Miller campaign but that being said he didn't mention some things that of a campaign probably should have had out authorization statements ignitions issues fine regards you had those position statements out during the endorsement right there's that but we are here's where we are in this race there's a primary right may the best man win by this but if the goal is to is to focus on walls I ask this question doesn't go into a primary distract from that it depends if they both focus on walls it's a good thing well then how do you win a primary if you don't bring up the other guy your own name ID showing that you're the gear that you the Better campaign I think you can total out that Democrat suit all the time they never attack each other when they go in for brain well then in this case Jamaica dorm is kind of putting his money where his mouth is he's saying that the kind of campaign that Aaron Miller was pointing together wasn't good enough hmm now we will see if jim hagen or can put a campaign together that's good enough because there will be a test that's right if if if you are incapable of putting a campaign together good enough you will not win that you will not win that I gave Jim an opening Jim Hagedorn an opening to dig Aaron Miller you didn't take it okay and that's that's good if they can if they can stay civil and keep the eye on the prize and keep keep their their I our focus on Tim Walz I think that they can ever wins a private have a good shot at Tim Walz it doesn't hurt that neither one of these men have been in a general election before for Congress and going through a primary will give them a dry run whoever whoever comes out of it so I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and we're to the point now where the endorsement matters less and less certainly the the more local you get the more the endorsement matters but the decisions been made we now have two Republican candidates running against Tim Walz there will be a primary have added

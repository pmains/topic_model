today to discuss a matter that is frankly getting out of hand it's more than a matter it's a problem this is a problem that has expanded beyond the borders of individual american cities and into the international spotlight it is a problem that is no longer a localized issue but a national one that is spiraling out of control this week we watched in horus baltimore burned we watched and discussed as low lives destroyed their own communities as local government helplessly stood by we watched in anger that some could even think to justify this sort of behavior i applaud president obama for calling those responsible for the destruction who they really are criminals and thugs mr speaker everyone has the right to participate in peaceful demonstration and i can respect those in baltimore who exercise their constitutionally granted right but when the actions of a few infringe on the rights of others we have a problem when the actions of a few violent protesters dominate the 24-hour news cycle it takes away from the importance of the message and it tears apart already fragile communities when businesses are trashed those responsible must be brought to justice when the national chain pharmacy is set aflame we ask if they will ever risk doing business in that community ever again as a business owner i can tell you mr speaker it would take a whole lot of convincing to get me to invest my sweat energy and treasure in a city that has demonstrated the type of lawlessness we have seen in recent days and that is a tragedy is a tragedy because these communities so desperately need structure stability support and jobs mr speaker is a law enforcement that will help reassure businesses that they will be able to safely operate in these communities it is law enforcement that will reduce the risk that is currently holding back job creators from setting up shop mr speaker communities must have law in order to succeed and prosper and i applaud those in law enforcement who have worked so hard to ensure that in god we trust i yield back the gentleman yields back

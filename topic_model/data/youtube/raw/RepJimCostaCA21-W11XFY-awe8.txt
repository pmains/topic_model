thank the gentleman the chair recognizes mr. Costa for five minutes thank you very much mr. chairman and ranking member for this important subcommittee hearing and Commissioner Berman congratulations and welcome I am going to make this as they say all politics are local and water of course to California is a absolutely critical issue as you know it tends to be either feast or famine either we have drought periods or we have an abundance of rainfall and snow in the Sierras and this year we've been blessed with the latter we have an abundance of snow and and rain and were in excess of 150 percent in some of the areas where measurements have been taking place San Luis reservoir I'm pleased I looked at it in the last week is full or practically full and our other reservoirs are above their averages and of course on ten-year averages is how we measure the water congressman Cox and I sent you a letter well actually we sent it to the Regional Director Ernest Conant and I hope you're familiar with the letter when senator Feinstein and I worked several years ago in the wind act we had hoped that there were some flexibility especially when we had an abundance of rain as we've had this year to try to maximize allocation for the respective districts now we're at a hundred percent on the Sacramento River Valley we're a hundred percent with the exchange contractors with Frank waters were a hundred percent but in the revised estimates in mid-march were at fifty five percent on the San Luis unit and for the life of me when we have an abundance of CFS going through the Delta it it it begs the question why we're at fifty five percent when everywhere else were at a hundred percent I'm wondering if you can respond to that the the timing is really critical on this stuff for our permanent crops obviously that is it's good news but we make decisions with bankers in February and March based upon a water allocation for annual crops I'm talking about the fresh fruits and the first vegetables the asparagus the tomatoes all these annual crops and we do that based upon bankers loan money based upon allocation of water so can you explain why in April and May we seem to be limited when we have this incredible amount of snowpack we're dealing with I mean thank you scented Kosta we have received your letter and we are working diligently to get you an answer right away I would say we are acutely aware of the water needs of our water contractors on the Central Valley Project and we work to maximize those water allocations and to make them as early in the year as we possibly can on the Central Valley Project we were able to move forward in mid-march a lot of times we have to wait till the end of the month to increase allocations and so we were we were very happy to say that we could increase allocations in mid-march and you did that for everyone which is good but I am at a loss to try to figure out why everybody else is at a hundred percent and even the state's increase their allocation and for the Central Valley Project on the Santa Lewis unit were stuck at 55 percent it if we can't provide maximum allocation in a bun dn't in a big hydrological years this year and obviously we'll never be able to come close to making allocation numbers so it has continued to rain and snow in California I know I'm trying to take credit for it since I got blamed for the drought I think it's only fair it's not working go ahead I so the the state's snow reports will come out the very beginning of April and we'll use those and work with National Marine Fisheries Service to see if we're able to increase allocations at that time so wait and see another two weeks which you're telling me and we will be doing everything we can to maximize those water allocation let me ask you a question about the Colorado drought contingency plan I my colleague here raised the issues that are important not only to Arizona but to California and other lower Basin States without the drought contingency plan under current operation of agreements what would happen if Lake Mead goes into shortage conditions below 1075 feet or 1025 feet so there are specific allocations I first under the 2007 guidelines the lower basin states of Nevada and Arizona agreed to make certain I certain cutbacks when the lake reached shortage level no shortage levels were named at 1075 1050 and 1025 through work with Mexico Mexico also has agreed to make certain cutbacks at those levels but the drought contingency plan does is it incentivizes and creates reason to create even more conservation and that conservation cut will come into effect if Congress moves to complete the drought contingency plans and we move and sign forward to implement that will start at elevation 1090 so for example when I checked yesterday that's exactly where the lake level is today so moving forward the parties will basically be saving more and more water and bypassing the drought contingency plans what what Congress would be doing what the parties would be doing moving forward is not only incentivizing further conservation but allowing the allowing the certainty of the parties to move forward to make those investments alright thank you my time is expired Thank You mr. chairman and we'll continue to try to work together to solve some problems thank you the

welcome back senate majority leader chuck schumer is promising to hold a vote on the women's health protection act it's a bill that would codify roe v wade despite the incredibly slim odds it passes a 50-50 senate this is on top of all the other legislative priorities the senate is facing passing the president's ukraine aid request securing more coveted funding and passing a budget meanwhile federal reserve is increasing interest rates as americans and markets continue to worry about rising inflation and other pocketbook issues so for more on this joined by democratic senator from virginia tim kaine senator i want to start with look when you first got into politics you were a self-described pro-life democrat um but there was sort of this i what i would call it was personally pro-life and and maybe legally pro-choice and i guess that probably would describe your position is that fair uh it is chuck i think i'm i'm about 30 percent of americans have the same position i do we're personally pro-life and we live that way but we think people be ought to be able to make their own reproductive decisions and so it's a huge swath of the american public even if it's not necessarily that much a represented position in congress yeah is this you know it feels like this is something that i see already susan collins isn't going to vote for this version of the bill because there's some fine piece of fine print that she thinks is not protected there is this something that politically is even possible to get 51 people to agree on what the general i mean it feels like it seems impossible that you guys are going to agree on a floor well i think you're it to get 60 votes right now in the senate is virtually impossible chuck because the republicans want to overrule roe versus wade there are a couple of exceptions susan collins and lisa murkowski but most of them want to return to pre-row where states get to decide if they want to criminalize women's reproductive health care decisions so we can't get to 60. you might be able to see us get over 50 for some version of a of a clear statement that you know griswold rowe and casey are good law and americans have a constitutional right to make their own reproductive health care decisions so we're going to we're going to make the effort to do that beginning next week uh i want to get to so i want you to share your story in a few minutes about your fight with long covet but i want to ask quickly about the economy i had a pretty high level democrat over the weekend say to me i wish the white house had a inflation czar the way they have a covet czar and get out there and sort of acknowledge that yes we're dealing with inflation this is not politically caused this was uh you know we got a lot of reasons for it but here's what we're doing every day to work on it and apparently this idea was shot down by the white house what do you think of it well chuck it reminds me i'm i'm older than you but i think it was nixon or four that had the whip inflation now buttons the windmills that people would would wear and i can't remember if they had a czar but they made it a front and center priority i think that explains what the fed is doing with interest rates we have an economy that job growth is strong wage growth is strong gdp growth has been pretty robust and i think it's going to continue to be but we do have an inflation worry there are things we can do in congress for example if we were able to pass a reconciliation bill that would bring down child care and health care costs we could really help people with too big pocket book items but i also think that what the fed is doing under jay powell's leadership is trying to without choking off the positive growth that we're seeing in jobs especially can we can we narrow down and reduce the inflation challenge um tell me what it's like to live with long covet what's it like today yeah so it's like today i mean even as i'm talking to you i got covered when we were passing the cares act more than two years ago and it was early and i got hit with non-standard symptoms but one of them was this like a light switch went off and all my nerves started to tingle it's like i've got you know my skin dipped in a in an alka-seltzer that's fizzing and it never has gone away so my other symptoms went away quick this fizzing sensation others are experiencing it it's not painful it doesn't stop me from working or exercising or sleeping but it's just weird and it's 24 7 and it's been going for two years and at this point i guess i kind of have to assume it's probably never going away what kind of i you know and i'm sure you're probably more aware of how many people have similar uh stories as yours how many of you come across and what kind of medical research has gone into this so so chuck tons of people as soon as i i shared my story you know my office has become a bit of a magnet for people who want to share theirs and i decided to share my story after about six or eight months i'd been to a neurologist i kind of felt like i understood what was going on but i was running into others with much more serious symptoms who were not being believed and and when they were not being believed i thought well you know if i'm on the committee and i say hey look i believe you because i it's real then that'll give them some comfort but then i can also on the committee try to drive towards solutions so here's what's going on in the american rescue plan we put more than a billion dollars into research for causes and cures and interestingly chuck this one we may know cures before we know causes so for example my nerve tingling thing there are other cures for nerve tingling not related to covin well maybe those cures could work for people who have it connected to covin people with long covet often have racing heart irregular heart rates well there's other cures for that would that work for somebody who got that because of coving so we're doing research but the long covert act that i put in recently is sort of four big pillars gather patient data more research into causes and cures spread the information to providers employers and families but then also let's provide support for those for example who might be so debilitated that they actually are disabled under social security or they need an accommodation to be able to work and and so i'm i'm very focused on this because i'm i'm living with it and dealing with it but there are many who are really suffering under it and and we owe them answers and we owe them treatments look you talked about getting medical uh professionals to believe they're patient you you're almost describing what but many times people who get lyme disease go through right their doctors are like we can't find it we can't find it absolutely how do you make sure insurance companies don't deny benefits based on on on these symptoms that again are are not as well known yet well well chuck it's a really good question and you're right the research that we're going to do is is going to answer some questions not just about long covert but about other conditions that may have followed viral infections because lyme disease and others often have a tale of neurological and other consequences we want to research that too but you're right the coverage issues are fascinating what if you got coveted at the start of covin before there was a lot of testing and so you never really got a test but you did have covent then you've been vaccinated so now you have antibodies in your system but somebody could say well those antibodies they they're from your vaccination they don't prove you had covet so making a claim for insurance establishing a disability asking an employer for an accommodation to help you work consistent with what you can do these are all thorny questions and that's what the fourth pillar of my bill would do patient support to help folks who've been through this tough two years we just passed a million deaths i mean my god who would have ever believed that two years ago but it but it's millions more that are going to be not dying of covid but having to live the rest of their lives with long coven and and i think this bill which does i think have some significant bipartisan support particularly on the funding side you know can help us provide some of that support well look i just i've i've seen your interviews on this and i felt as if the more people pay attention to this i think you're right people may have been shamed by doctors saying they're imagining things and things like that uh you're you're not somebody that does this this is happening to you i appreciate you coming on and sharing your story senator absolutely glad to check all right senator tim kaine democrat from virginia

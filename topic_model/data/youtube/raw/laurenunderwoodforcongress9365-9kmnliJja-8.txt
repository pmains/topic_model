- I grew up in Naperville. When I was in third grade I
was diagnosed with a heart condition and through my
work as a nurse I know how critical it is to be able
to get healthcare coverage. Our congressman has not
looked out for the folks in the 14th District,
he's voted repeatedly to take away our healthcare,
to weaken our public schools and we deserve better. I spent my career expanding access to care for communities across our country. I just like the idea of helping large groups of people have healthier lives. I am in interested in
fighting for families to make sure that they have
the healthcare that they need, the strong jobs that pay good wages, excellent public schools
and safe environments to continue to grow and thrive. People want to know that someone cares and wants to know that someone hears them. We have a responsibility to
everyone in our community. We need some one in Washington
who is going to fight for us and I am ready and up for the job. This campaign is way bigger than me, it's about the people
in the 14th District. I'm Lauren Underwood and
I approve this message

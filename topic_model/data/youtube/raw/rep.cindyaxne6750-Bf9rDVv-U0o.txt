I'm proud to have introduced bipartisan legislation with my Republican colleague from Nebraska Adrian Smith to provide relief to our rural hospitals by delaying enforcement of burdensome regulations that limit the ability of rural hospitals to provide quality care our legislation postpones the implementation of direct supervision or the requirement that a physician or non physician practitioner be physically present for outpatient therapeutic services at rural hospitals until 2021 I've heard from dozens of rural health care providers across Iowa's third District who consistently tell me that staffing shortages remain one of the biggest issues they face and if a rural hospital doesn't have the available staff for direct supervision it can limit the type of care Iowans are able to receive in our rural communities we need to address staffing shortages in rural areas but in the meantime we need to make sure that regulations aren't overly burdensome for rural hospitals

O LAY OUT THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6TH AND SHARPENING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE INSURRECTION FOR TO COME. HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN -- HOW ARE YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS BRACING YOURSELVES TO LEARN MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT TRUMP IS DOING OR NOT DOING ON JANUARY 6TH? MORE THAN THREE HOURS OF INACTION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. I KNOW THE CAPITOL POLICE, AS WELL AS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT, IN AN URGENT REQUEST DEMANDED AND BAKED FOR NATIONAL GUARDSMEN TO BE SENT TO THE CAPITOL ONCE THEY WERE OVERRUN. ESPECIALLY THE CAPITOL POLICE. HOUR AFTER HOUR IT LAPSED AND NO TROOPS WERE SENT TO THE SCENE. WE WERE ASKING THE EXACT SAME QUESTIONS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HOLD UP IN THEIR OFFICES OR IN BUNKERS, WAITING FOR THOSE TROOPS TO ARRIVE. NOW WE HAVE LEARNED THAT PAT CIPOLLONE, KAYLEIGH MACADAMIA, MARK MEADOWS, MIKE PENCE'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, KEITH KELLOGG AND IVANKA TRUMP WERE DEMANDING THAT THE PRESIDENT WELL THE INSURRECTION, SEND THE TROOPS, AND HE REFUSED TO DO SO. AGAIN, THAT POINTS TO THAT CORRUPT INTENT THAT I THINK IS AT THE HEART OF WHETHER CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY THE PRESIDENT THAT DAY. >> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO SOME COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS, ZOE LOFGREN, ABOUT THE SECRET SERVICE TEXTS. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. >> YOU COULD IMAGINE HOW SHOCKED WE WERE TO GET THE LETTER FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYING THAT HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS INFORMATION AND THAT THEY HAD IN FACT BEEN DELETED AFTER HE HAS FOR THEM. THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE BY THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT IT WASN'T TRUE, OR IT WASN'T FAIR. AND THAT THEY HAD PERTINENT TEXTS, I SAID FINE, YOU HAVE THEM? WE NEED THEM. WE EXPECT TO GET THEM BY THIS TUESDAY. WE NEED ALL THE TEXTS FROM THE FIFTH IN THE 6TH OF JANUARY. I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT THEY DIDN'T BACK UP THEIR DATA BEFORE THEY RESET THEIR IPHONES. THAT'S CRAZY, I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WOULD BE. BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS INFORMATION TO GET THE FULL PICTURE. >> THE CONGRESSWOMAN SAID THEY EXPECT TO GET THOSE TEXT FROM THE SECRET SERVICE BY TUESDAY. WHAT SHOULD COMMITTEE MEMBERS BE LOOKING FOR IN THOSE TEXTS? >> AFTER CASSIDY HUTCHISON'S TESTIMONY, SHE SAID THAT ESSENTIALLY THE PRESIDENT PHYSICALLY LUNGED AT THE SECRET SERVICE AND ONE OF THE SECRET SERVICE TO TAKE HIM TO THE CAPITOL. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THOSE TEXT MESSAGES MIGHT REVEAL ABOUT THAT INTERACTION, AS WELL AS JUST GENERALLY THE DAYS AND EVENTS OF WHAT'S SECRET SERVICE WAS DOING WITH REGARD TO HELPING TO ENABLE THE PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE HIS INACTION, OR MAYBE EVEN URGING HIM TO SEND TROOPS TO THE CAPITAL. BUT I THINK THE MOST DISTURBING PART OF WHAT YOU JUST PLAYED AND CONGRESSWOMAN LOFGREN'S PIECE, THE SECRET SERVICE APPARENTLY DELETED TEXTS AFTER THE OIG REQUEST OF THOSE TEXTS. >> AND THE SECRET SERVICE HAS TO BE SUBPOENAED IN THIS INSTANCE. AS OPPOSED TO VOLUNTARILY PRODUCING THEM. THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH A SECRET SERVICE AND WITHIN THE DHS. THEY HAVE SOME EXPLAINING TO DO AS WELL. THESE TEXT MESSAGES CAN ALONG OR REMAIN A SECRET FROM JANUARY 5TH AND SIXTH. >> WE HAVE 30 SECONDS LEFT. IF THIS TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THE COMMITTEE'S LAST HEARING THIS WEEK, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE THEM TO EXAMINE FOR THE FUTURE? >> I AM NOT SURE. I THINK THAT EACH TIME WE SEE ONE OF THESE HEARINGS WE LEARNED MORE INFORMATION. QUITE FRANKLY, MORE INFORMATION IS THEN FORTHCOMING AND MORE WITNESSES COME FORWARD WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO EITHER CORRECT THE RECORD OR AT THE RECORD. I THINK THIS PARTICULAR HEARING, LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONES, MAY END UP GENERATING MORE LEADS AND LEADING TO MORE INFORMATION THAT REVEALS WHAT H

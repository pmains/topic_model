pete heggseth he's not too bad is he oh excellent kevin mccarthy was in the back saying that i don't know i see some a good candidate there i don't know right i watched him out front i watched that passion and i'm thinking what district can i run them for speaking of that uh you know election day was rough in some ways really rough but in other ways it really gave me great optimism for the future and the greatest story of election night was getting so close to getting that gavel from nancy pelosi did it shock you that you got that close we got closer than anybody thought we could get they said we were going to lose 20 seats that night no one said we'd win seats my dearest friend who's a hardcore republican said that best we could do is lose ten but this is the little secret you know why we won that president trump worked on all these races and let me let let me give you a little secret and a little facts because i want you to tell your friends especially your liberal friends this is the first time since 1994 no incumbent republican lost we beat 15 democrats you know who the 15 democrats lost to conservative women and conservative minorities each and every one of them and what happened even when president trump was sick with covet he called me this night in the hospital he says kevin i got to keep doing this because we couldn't do the rallies right he would do these rallies over the phone for each district and he'd have the candidate on that he would talk and it would turn out the votes and that's what shocked because all the polls said we'd lose but election day the voters said no there's a new path awesome awesome and i have to say uh these two gentlemen probably won't like me saying it but i say it on a regular basis because it kind of puts you on the spot but uh i think we have a great chance of getting the majority back not a chance we're going to get your majority back we're five seats away i would bet my house listen we are we were thirty one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars my personal house don't tell my wife but i would bet it listen do you wanna retire nancy pelosi [Applause] do you want to end the socialism in this country win the house five seats the closest this is the smallest majority the democrats have had in a hundred years we could do it jim banks uh you're by the way both of you have great scores with the american conservative union you have uh been a great champion up there and this is probably even higher than mine here's the tinge it's tinged i was trying to be so careful it's a tinge higher by the way a lot of these people we've had on the stage mike pompeo had an outstanding record in the house of representatives ron desantis someone i call now america's governor [Applause] and i guess what i'm learning from that is when you see conservatives get put in positions of power what you realize about the conservative philosophy when well executed it just makes a lot of sense what is wrong with these colleagues of yours on the other side of the aisle that i hear them talk and i'm like where where did they grow up like where did they learn this stuff is talking to you yeah you got to wonder where did where do they come from in america where they don't like america like we do right that's what i love about coming to cpac i remember i'm reminded every time i come to cpac why we're the right party why the republican party is on the right side of history we hear a lot about uh the council culture these days and identity politics let me say if you identify yourself as an american you belong in the republican party yeah that's right period you know i uh i thought about you know i chaired this group called the american conservative union i love the name i love the name because the left thinks we're a union and they always invite us to their parties and then they find out we're not that kind and then i love the fact because i love the idea of being a conservative but i don't know what your response is to this but sometimes i think that like the conservative word isn't as important because yes we love america and it kind of stops there you agree agree hold on you you'll define and jim is an amazing individual this is the type of america you want he he runs this the biggest conservative group in congress republican study group he's a veteran served in the navy in afghanistan and he serves his country today because he believes in the exceptionalism of america and that's what defines this difference between the conservatives and the socialists right yeah i almost wonder if we could think about the way the press likes to say republicans are fractured here's the truth and you all know it not all of you are republicans in this crowd is we're actually getting everybody who just doesn't like communism socialism and marxism would you agree that's totally true let me tell you uh this week a poll came out i'm going to brag on him a little bit because he just bragged on me the most popular republican figure in congress today is kevin mccarthy let me tell you who the least popular republicans in the party are today they're those few very few men they're stittering there's tittering out there i just want you to know there's very few republicans um the least popular in our party are the ones who want to erase donald trump and donald trump supporters from our party let me tell you let me tell you if that happens we won't win back the majority in 2022 we definitely won't win back the white house in 2024 if we erase donald trump you have a leader right here i'm the conservative leader and you and i both know matt and for decades the conservative leader fights with the republican leader not anymore because kevin mccarthy is the right leader for the right time to win back the majority he's going to be the best speaker the house we've had in a generation good guy kevin kevin would like you to keep talking yeah i'll give you the rest of the i yield the rest okay i didn't i didn't come here to suck up to kevin mccarthy because let me i tell him the truth at times too let me tell you let me i want to tell you the truth it is great to be in florida where you guys are normal you're open i don't have to wear a mask anymore that's so much better than california did you guys like it when kevin mccarthy said it was the right thing for donald trump to be at cpac i don't know what your response is today uh and we're getting closer the um the the other thing we were just talking about backstage is and we talked about this with ambassador lighthizer and with uh uh senator um oh my god it's escaping me the new senator from tennessee come on help me bill hagerty a great man oh i got a lot of my mind folks there's a lot going on the uh what we were talking about is the fact that this new republican party this new coalition is what i really call it we're the ones focused on the working man and woman the forgotten men and women corporate america is so woke and we're focused on the actual workers that's exactly true there's a new poll that came out and it literally says the republican party grew with the blue-collar worker because it was forgotten man and woman that donald trump listened to the voice that no one else would listen to and we're never going to forget that people those people and that's what we're focused on look what happened this morning at 2 a.m nancy pelosi put about a 2 trillion dollar bill in there was a vote on the floor she put a tunnel in silicon valley that has nothing to do with covid into the bill we wanted to take that money and give it to the kids to get them back in school it's an easy it's an easy discussion right we want people back to work back to school back to health pelosi wants to put more tunnels more waste and the democrats voted for it it's a clear place who's standing for the american public and who's standing for corporations it's the republican party today and it's what we're going to be tomorrow and in the future and that's why america is going to be stronger because we'll put america first that's right yeah matt that's exactly true donald trump taught us many things more than anything else he made the republican party the work the party of the working class for the first time since reagan he changed the political paradigm the democrat party today is the the party of multinational corporations of big business of wall street of silicon valley china and they're the pro-china party putting american workers last for the interests of our greatest adversary and and and wall street interest ahead of the interest of the of working class working men and women in this country i grew up my dad is a retired factory worker he make made axles all of his life he he identified as a rep as a democrat for most of his life he didn't he didn't like a lot of the republican leaders until donald trump he was for donald trump but we have to keep voters like my dad in the fray and under kevin mccarthy's leadership under my leadership we're going to continue to be the party of the working class for a long time to come there's something really true out there i don't care if you're if you're conservative liberal or what else i do not know what the chinese party and government has on the democrats but it is so powerful it is so powerful it is scary they put eric swalwell on the intel committee i've been in a briefing just myself and nancy pelosi anyone that's ever heard that briefing would not have him on that committee and would question would even keep him in congress but that's what's happening in the democratic party what's the first thing that joe biden does he calls the chinese she and he placates to them he says now what they do on human rights oh it's okay it's a cultural thing he won't stand up for what they're doing to our universities he's not china wins that election if biden gets in that's the problem what happened and i don't know what they have on the democratic party but it's powerful and we need people like jim banks that was part of the china task force that has a plan to actually stand up to him so the next century is the american century it was great video good work so let's get to this question of this radical policy that's hitting the the house floor and hitting the senate floor i'm sure it's shocking to all of you we've been all kind of numb since the election and then you start seeing will the democrats be as radical in their policy proposals as they told us worse and we are always such nice people we say oh come on they're gonna not be that way and then it starts coming and uh it's so radical on this most recent covenant bill they can't even keep their own members together losing members from maine and stuff that must be interesting are they starting do you see a chance that maybe maybe in the house it's almost impossible because queen pelosi is too tough and she's you know she she keeps them together but if you can make the rhetorical points in the house maybe there's a couple senators who are getting to realize that being a socialist isn't so good at the ballot box the only bipartisan vote last night was against that coveted bill that's right less than nine percent of it had anything to do with covid it was all a waste but what else is happening here is when you put a bill out you'll see the hr number the they reserve the hr one for the most important bill you know what the democrats have hr one is to take over our entire election system what they've done is changed they changed the rules in congress have never been changed before to take away the right of the minority to even have an amendment because they're afraid of our idea jim banks is fighting this with the republican study group you're the very first one that came out against that election and we have a bill uh the republican study committee introduced a bill the save democracy act i hope you'll take a look at it but almost half of the american people today don't trust our elections after the fiasco for good reasons happened in november and we're trying to restore it's a we have a moral duty as republicans to restore trust in our election system let me tell you hr one would do the opposite and that's what the democrats are going to ram through the house next week and if i could give and i'm sure you you both would agree if i could give you one charge in leaving cpac it would be do all you can to any member that we have any influence over to explain to them that it's unacceptable to have this unconstitutional power grab on elections so that what we saw this election will be what you will see every single election and we have to fight it now in order to fight it we got to pick up more seats we started talking about politics let's end this conversation by talking about politics uh i i stand corrected it's not if we get the majority it's when we get the majority [Applause] tell us your your blueprint for getting that done listen we're going to continue to do exactly what we did in the last election we elected more republican women in the history of america before just last time we're going to continue to build in every other district but if you look at history there's only five seats to win the majority next election we have redistricting where we do a census every 10 years they redraw all the lines you know who loses seats all these left-running governors california illinois new york you know who gains two seats in florida three in texas history says the party in power whoever wins the white house on the first off year election on average loses 27 seats in 2009 i was the deputy whip and i was the recruitment chair it was taking us 40 seats to be able to win the majority nobody believed we could you know what happened that election we beat 63 democrats so let's not settle for 27. let's double that number and make sure we have it for the next 10 years well i think we should give a warm cpac welcome to those champions in the house of representatives who are fighting the socialist agenda we appreciate what you're doing mr leader mr chairman keep up the great work and thanks for being at cpac thank you all very much [Applause]

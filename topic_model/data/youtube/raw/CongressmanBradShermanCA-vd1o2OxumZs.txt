only event Sherman I'm going to put that question to him it would seem that Donald Trump criticizing his own party over scrapping the the ethics office that oversees them what do you make of it are you going to be able to capitalize on what appears to be descent we're certainly going to try this is a clear misstep by the Republican majority it puts us on the side of defending the toughest ethics and when you do something on ethics that's so extreme that you get criticized by Donald Trump clearly you're making a mistake Paul Ryan understood that Kevin McCarthy understood that but the Republican caucus which could have tried to make these changes in a different way at a different time perhaps you've been on a bipartisan basis as instead decided to try to impose these after just announcing him last night she could say that when they the hard work of repealing the Affordable Care Act Obamacare starts this week all that will be forgotten how are you going to save Obamacare well the best way is to go to the people of the country if repeal and replace means keep most of it and make a few changes some of which might be desirable that would be a good outcome work with Republicans to find something to replace it I will certainly work with them if they're moving in a constructive manner that I haven't seen the constructive manner but constructive from which site because one of the complaints the Republicans had over the last several years as being total gridlock Democrats wouldn't work with them to pass any legislation aren't Democrats going to be obstructive over repealing what is after all the signature piece of legislation well if repeal and replace means tweak and improve will certainly work with them we've been willing to work with them all across the board I'm from California we have weekly California meetings to which we've invited the Republicans and they have 52 weeks in a row decided to have their own separate meeting so it's I'm used to Republicans not willing not being willing to work with us but we'll certainly work with them but will also work the country and point out the parts of Obamacare that people really rely on what the Republicans have proposed is keeping the chance to join even if you have a pre-existing condition but eliminating the mandate that everybody be covered and they don't have a health problem that's like saying you want to keep the roof what you want to repeal the pillars a lot of a lot of devil in the detail there you've been in a minority government before you this is your 11th this is my 11th time and uh yes 16 years of the minority how so how has been in them being in a minority government being different how would you expect this to be different as a minority Democratic congressman this time around well this is minority and no president so this is the only way you can have an effect is either to convince individual Republicans who may not need your votes if they find you or to convince the American people and so what I do to convince the American people may be just as important as what i do on the floor of Congress the second thing though is that this is a less unified majority than I've ever seen I'm not sure you Trump is nominally a Republican he is more or less with them but one could say that this is a triangular government rather than a one side again and very briefly hearings on allegations that Russia interfered with the presidential election they're being launched by Senator John McCain who is a Republican what do you hope will be gained from that I think we're going to learn what we already know your Republican tax they got to Podesta 'he's and the DNC emails they selectively released it including Lee including releasing Podesta Z emails just as Trump needed a lifeline because the Access Hollywood tapes for being exposed and that they did their best to affect the election now the election was so close in those three states that maybe it was decisive but we made at least 20 errors that were just as significant well congressman ben sherman from California thank you very much indeed for joining me and that's it from what's going to be a

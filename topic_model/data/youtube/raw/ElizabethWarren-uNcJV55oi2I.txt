we have a police-brutality problem in America [Music] George Floyd Brianna Taylor Ahmad Aubrey eric garner's Stephan Clark Andrew Kerr Sandra bland and so many other black men and women should be alive today police brutality threatens black lives American lives and our very democracy the vast majority of people who are protesting police brutality are doing so peacefully it is their right and it comes from a long line of activism in this country that pushes our nation to be better activism is how we channel anger and injustice into change every time that activists and journalists are met with violence from the state our First Amendment is at stake this is our camera crew being arrested and any elected official who doesn't call it out is turning their back on our Constitution we have to ensure that people can make their voices heard and that law enforcement does not repeat the same practices that triggered the protests in the first place we need real accountability for everyone including law enforcement officers we need to rethink our approach to Public Safety to focus less on locking people up and more on community investments to lift people up we need to train our police to be ambassadors for peace not instigators of violence we need to vote out a president who glorifies violence so when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon please don't be too nice he told us who he was and now he's showing us who he is Joe Biden has put forward proposals for real police reform outlawing choke holds stopping the transfer of weapons of war to police forces improving oversight and accountability all of that should be made into law this month he's also committed to strong oversight and comprehensive reviews of police departments around the country in his first hundred days as president and we will continue the fight to dismantle white supremacy in this this is a moment of crisis for our nation a defining moment that reminds us that the fight for justice will never be over there is no one in done deal no quick fix every generation is called on to press for progress on the world arc of justice

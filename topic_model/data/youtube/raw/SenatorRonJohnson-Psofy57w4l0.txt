and for more on the border battle let's bring in Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson chairman of the Homeland Security Committee senator great of you to be here to start off our 11 o'clock hour as we await the president's arrival down at the southern border your thoughts as we have seen him back off those threats to completely shut down the border he was talking outside the White House a few moments ago about the progress that Mexico is making on stemming this flow of migrants good morning Sandra well it is important that Mexico as well as the Central American nations cooperate with us to try and stop the flow but we have to change our laws you know the statistics are pretty alarming here remember in 2014 where we have that surge of unaccompanied children from Central America 120,000 unaccompanied children people and family in this came to this country in 2014 and President Obama correctly called that humanitarian crisis in less than the first six months of this year the numbers are already over 240,000 we just got to the last weekly numbers so 240,000 verse 120 this is a growing problem but it's growing because we have laws on our books that if your unaccompanied child from South America or you come as a family unit once you come into our country say you have a credible fear of persecution you're basically home for good you have long-term residency and so CBP unfortunately through no fault of their own have been reduced to a mere speed bump on the path to long-term residency for unaccompanied children and people coming as families so we have to change those laws as you know senator this debate is alive in this country you hear both sides claiming crisis not crisis manufactured crisis what do you want people to hear ahead of the president's visit there about what you know is happening at the border what needs to be done well it's a totally different problem than it was back in the early 2000s back van it was Mexican economic migrants we could return them immediately sometimes apprehend them multiple times a day and so the numbers were distorted it's apples and oranges right now it's unaccompanied children and people coming in as family units and now they are staying we apprehend them where you process them and we disperse them all over the country it's overwhelming the system former DHS secretary jeh Johnson last week said when he would come in through the Obama administration and if apprehensions were less than a thousand a day there'd be an okay day over a thousand he'd have a really bad day last couple of weeks we've had over four thousand individuals on a daily basis that's a caravan sized group of people every day it's completely overwhelming CBP's capability to handle these people in Humane fashion as they possibly can all right senator I also want to ask you about what we are learning about these GOP centers moving on to the Moller report the GOP senators alerting William Barr to some of these allegations that that the Muller team was misrepresenting emails involved in the Russia put probe they talk about what they describe a selective use of emails in the Moller court filings we're talking about Chuck Grassley Lindsey Graham among those senators that apparently issued this warning to William Barr what more can you tell us about this I really don't have any further information on that I do want to see as much information as possible from from the Moller report but I also very sensitive the fact that you don't release grand jury testimony there's a reason the Department of Justice when investigates I mean and does not indict keeps that confidential you don't want to taint people so let's let this process play out but I want to work very closely with both those senators to find out what exactly was happening in the intelligence community the FBI and the Department of Justice during during the campaign during the transition the early months of the Trump administration the American people have a right to know got it so the story is and this is per our own reporting catherine herridge that the investigators involved had cherry-pick details from emails to include in court documents in this investigation and they were urging him to review those materials in the last on our reporting is that it's unclear if Barr ever reviewed the Senators letter so that is the news there but we hear you senator and we thank you for coming on the program this morning have a great day thank you you too

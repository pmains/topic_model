madam speaker i rise today also to celebrate dia de puerta gall which is a significant holiday for portuguese people all over the world my grandparents came from the united to the united states from the a's or islands in the late 19th century in the turn of the 20th century 1897 201904 illiterate non-english speaking like immigrants past and immigrants present coming to america to have a better life for themselves but they never ever left their pride of their home country portugal or their sense of culture which lives in me today portugal is one of the americans longest and strongest allies as it was the first to recognize the united states as an independent nation after the revolutionary war i'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of the amigas act introduced by our colleague and congressman david cecillini it would create more american jobs and increase investment in the united states by strengthening our bonds with portugal and as the co-chair of the portuguese caucus i think it's important that we continue to build on this relationship and the trade that already exists today so i urge the senate to pass this bipartisan legislation and again we will continue to work with other colleagues of ours who are part of our portuguese american caucus to continue to advocate for mutual interests not only for portugal but for the united states and the portuguese american community felicity of the portugal let us celebrate and let us remember that america is a stronger country because of our welcoming of immigrants past and present and this is a part of that recognition i yield back the balance of my time

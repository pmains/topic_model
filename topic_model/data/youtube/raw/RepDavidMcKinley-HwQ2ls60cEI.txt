um chairman um the floor perhaps maybe give me some direction here a little bit on this uh we have a we have a growing problem in west virginia with stranded gas um and um and the production of of the various constituents of with ngl um that we can't use necessarily the local market it has to be shipped currently a lot of it's being flared or just wasted which is a shame and it doesn't benefit the consumer and doesn't help the environment ending um so my question uh is what i'm hearing or sensing what is there's and i think it's not unique just to west virginia do with this exploration of the utica and the marcellus in in the numbers of states um there seems to be a potential jurisdictional problem starting to flare up a little bit and one of them is so my question to you is it should we should we be treating ngos as natural gas and thereby allowing the federal government your group to take care of that or should we continue having the ngls handled at the state level and and manage it that way do you have a position on that i hadn't thought of the jurisdictional question it's a good thing for the committee to be looking at um there's a lot of stranded gas capacity as well as gas that's being flared because there's not sufficient uh takeaway capacity for the liquids we only do the pricing for the liquids pipelines under the interstate commerce act but we don't do the sighting i think i suspect some of the states that think they do the sighting very well would not welcome federal siding i think we could do it well because we do it well with gas pipelines but um it might not be as popular with some of the states involved but i think we've done a good job whether or not you want are you going to take a more passive and let the states continue to do or are you going to try to assert a role that otherwise is not expected i didn't have a plan to redefine natural gas under the natural gas act but i think it's something to think about um okay could you provide us in writing records with the time frame we don't uh and especially since you said you weren't prepared to discuss that necessarily could you provide us some rationale for the federal government to be involved in this as compared to the states yes we'll certainly take that and think about it thanks for the opportunity to think more okay thank you now and last is is maybe more generic but it probably for over 10 years as an engineer in private practice prior we were concerned about the electromagnetic pulse and it's been mentioned here again i've been hearing about it for well over a decade but certainly in the last five or six years people have been talking even more here that the last three years that i've been in congress where are we with this or are we just waiting for some catastrophic event to happen because there's just an awful lot of talk but no action well i think i mentioned in my written testimony and briefly in my verbal testimony that um last year the commission voted out a rule requiring utilities to have operational plans and um response plans or what i'm saying is what's your expectation i think i think that the geomagnetic disturbance standards that we'll get and we have one pending will help somewhat with the electromagnetic pulses although they're i think there's also voluntary efforts going on in the north american transmission forum to uh talk about other aspects of the emp but i think the gmd standards are the probably the most tangible action that's gone on in this area for a long time is there progress being made in europe or elsewhere with emps because it's not unique to western united states i'm sorry i didn't is there progress being made with other in other other countries and dealing with emps it's variable a lot of progress is being made in scandinavia south africa um and the united kingdom a lot of other countries have taking a wait-and-see approach and looking israel israel is also doing a lot other countries are taking more of a wait-and-see approach i could we'll have further conversation with but thank you very much gentlemen yields back balance of his time this time recognize a gentleman from colorado mr gardner

chair i'd like to call it hagerty amendment number 21. so we know the bill that we're discussing requires every jurisdiction to use ballot drop boxes for mail imbalance and nothing precludes these ballot drop boxes from being placed on street corners back alleys any place that's not subject to surveillance or security these ballot drop boxes have to be available 24 7. if you think about in the context of the last amendment we discussed in terms of mail imbalance what this would allow is ballot harvesters to go out and you know the requirement is either a ballot has to be postmarked or dated as of election day they could collect as many ballots as they want see what they need and drop in hand-dated ballots a few days after election day into one of these unmarked ballot boxes again not subject to surveillance this creates all types of opportunity for fraud what my bill would what my amendment would do would be to eliminate unmanned unsurveilled ballot drop boxes i encourage you to support my amendment okay well this amendment strikes an important section in this bill which requires all states uh to provide a baseline number of secure accessible and in-person drop boxes and i thought about this when i read about the texas story during the election of the one drop box in harris county which includes houston which is something like five million people for me that would be like putting as i told my constituents one drop box in the middle of bemidji minnesota and everyone had to go to that one now it's geographically a bigger area but it doesn't make any sense at all and so what we've done here is to respond to this what i consider untrue untruths about these drop boxes they're safe they're secure convenient option for voters and we actually extended the timeline and made changes to the bill in response to issues that had been raised about the drop boxes but overall it's a really good way for people to be able to vote and so this would gut that part of the bill are we ready to vote excellent okay clerk will call the roll senator feinstein no by proxy senator schumer no by proxy senator warner no by proxy senator leahy no by proxy senator king senator merkley senator padilla senator oshoff senator blunt senator mcconnell senator shelby senator cruz senator capitao senator hyde smith aye senator hagerty aye chairwoman klobuchar no nine eyes nine no's the amendment doesn't pass

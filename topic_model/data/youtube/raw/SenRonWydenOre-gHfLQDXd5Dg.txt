spines thank you madam chair enough I'll be very brief and just on this point with respect to Medicare having talked about it with my friend from Wisconsin I think all senators know I feel very strongly by getting a bipartisan approach on Medicare but just so we're clear on the history the paper that was put together in December of 2011 was very different than the budget resolution which came from the chair in the house congressman Ryan just a few months later and I voted against it and let me just be real brief on it we cannot colleagues get a bipartisan agreement if the most vulnerable those on Medicaid really are in effect going to face the kind of suffering that you would see with a Medicaid a block grant the second major change was the assistance for low-income seniors that was in the paper of December of 2011 was very different than what was in the Ryan budget in the spring so that was another big factor in my voting against it there are plenty of other differences the paper didn't raise the age of eligibility the paper protected the Affordable Care Act so I just want my colleague to know that I continue to be very interested in a bipartisan approach in Medicare but the paper that was put together in December of 2011 didn't block grant you know Medicaid had a much more generous rate of assistance for the low-income people didn't touch the Affordable Care Act in short it protected the Medicare guarantee this very explicit approach that protects the most vulnerable so I just want that understood because I suspect we'll be coming back to Medicare in the course of the morning thank you madam chair

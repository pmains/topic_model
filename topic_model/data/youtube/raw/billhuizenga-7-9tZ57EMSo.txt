spending is one of the most vital issues that's facing not just this current Congress 112 Congress but us as a nation and and in us as a as a people and our way of life and they are asking us to rain are spending in reduce our massive debt and this that's why I think it's so important that we are we are holding this and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is congressionally mandated as we all know to to maximize employment as well as to hold down inflation but after witnessing this massive debt load that's been accumulated by other administration's but has ramped up in this current administration it seems to me that those are really failed fiscal policies and I'm pleased that we're now spending some time exploring the role of monetary policy and the national debt the very concerned about the liquidity that's been put in the markets by the Fed and through the purchase of those debts and most recently to the fact that the federal funds rate sit at basically zero we've had to go through or haven't had to go through the Fed made the decision to go through by purchasing additional six hundred billion dollars in Treasury securities with with utilizing the philosophy of quantitative easing and now we've gone through Kiwi one and now qe2 and this is despite purchasing 1.2 trillion dollars previously in March of 2009 and it seems to me it has not proved to be an effective method of creating jobs and I'd love to have your input on that today we'll examine what the effect of the feds government's debt plays on the Federal Reserve's open market operations in addition I look forward to inspecting how that role affects our yearly deficits when compared to the more costly tax and spend Paula fiscal policies that we've had and I take my charge here as a member as a freshman member of this hundred and twelve Congress and as a member of this important subcommittee I take my responsibility for strict oversight of taxpayer dollars with the utmost of seriousness and I know that that has to be done we have been irresponsible in the past I believe with the with the trust that we have been given by the American people and it's time that we that we step up and and take care of that I look forward to a robust conversation today I'm sure that there's a number of differing opinions here and it is we're exploring sort of the feds unparalleled intervention in the markets I'm looking forward to hearing from you so again dr.

Thank You mr. chairman first director Coase I want to compliment you and the members of your the community that you represent on on the report that you have supplied to us it is succinct and clear and troubling in some cases which is what good intelligence will always be particularly on page 16 is an extraordinary statement about the effect of climate change on national security the impacts of the long-term trends toward a warming climate more air pollution biodiversity loss and water scarcity are likely to fuel economic and social discontent and possibly upheaval through 2018 goes on to talk about the risk of humanitarian disasters conflict water and food shortage population migration labor shortfalls price shocks power outages and a possibility of abrupt climate change it the the notes indicate the current extinction rate is 100 to 1,000 times the nash the natural extinction rate i just want to point that out this as clearly as your report indicates a serious issue of national security is it not it is an issue but it always has been an issue what happens to the environment floods hurricanes etc we're seeing some intensity of that this isn't this isn't talking about general environmental conditions this is talk it's that the past 115 years I'm reading from your report have been the warmest period in the history of modern civilization the past few years have been the warmest years on record and then it goes on to state I would just hope that you would have the people that prepared this brief the Secretary of the EPA because I think this information is important it's important to national security we often talk about the risk of climate change and in the context of environmentalism but according to your analysis it is also an issue that affects national security it will increase migration patterns conflict famine and the like which is often how Wars start another part of the report on page 7 talks about Iran and the Iran nuclear agreement and there's an interesting phrase it says Iran's implementation of the jcpoa has extended the amount of time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon from a few months to about one year provided Iran continues to adhere to the deals major provisions is that the judgment of the intelligence community that Iran has thus far adhered to the deals major provisions yes as the judgment is that no material breach of the agreement and the jcpoa i'm again reading from your report has also enhanced the transparency of Iran's nuclear activities mainly by fostering improved access to those nuclear facilities for the IAEA and the the authorities under the Additional Protocol so if the Iran agreement were abrogated we would lose that visibility into the Iran nuclear enterprise is that not correct well we built a number of capacities relative to that even since the the agreement so I to say lose that would I don't think would be accurate diminish it potentially could diminish I think you can do better than that it would diminish would it not the IAE way IAEA would certainly not have the access that they currently have no they they may not on the other hand we have provided other means and we've significantly upped our game in terms of our verification procedures in your assessment on page 18 you talk about China again interesting language it talks about China's security interests with regard to the South China Sea the East China Sea and Taiwan uses the language I'm sorry reduces language of national security in those regards sovereignty claims East China Sea South China Sea and type Taiwan but then it goes on to talk about its efforts aim is familiy at fulfilling of the belt and road initiative to expand China's economic reach and political and political influence my question is what is the intelligence community's assessment of what China wants is China want do they are they moving toward military aggression and enlargement of their territory are they looking more toward political and economic influence in the region it appears to be the latter while China is modernizing its military is increasing its spending most of it appears to be done in the for a deterrence purpose rather than aggressive purpose they have clearly have a strategy of using credit and loans to countries around the world particularly in geo strategic places then combining it with some some military capacity South China Seas their new base in Djibouti we see that China is seeking I think to become a world power with great influence on a global basis and they're using a number of techniques that are far more than just the typical military land grab that we see more likely with Russia rather than China thank you sir Thank You mr. chairman

MR. CARPER: MADAM PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: GOOD AFTERNOON, MADAM PRESIDENT. MADAM PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY TO URGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN VOTING TO CONFIRM RADHIKA FOX. ISN'T THAT A GREAT NAME, RADHIKA FOX, TO BE ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR OF WATER FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS AS RADHIKA FOX HAS GONE THROUGH HER CONFIRMATION PROCESS, I HAD THE REAL PLEASURE TO COME TO KNOW HER AND, FRANKLY, TO ADMIRE HER. I AM CONVINCED THAT SHE'S AN EXCELLENT CHOICE TO LEAD THE E.P.A.'S OFFICE OF WATER AT A CRUCIAL TIME IN THE AGENCY'S HISTORY. MS. FOX BRINGS WITH HER AN IMPRESSIVE PROFESSIONAL RECORD OF SERVICE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT, SPANNING OVER TWO DECADES WORKING ON WATER ISSUES AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL LEVEL. MOST RECENTLY BEFORE SHE WAS NOMINATED, MADAM PRESIDENT, FOR HER POSITION AT E.P.A., MS. FOX SERVED AS THE C.E.O. OF U.S. WATER ALLIANCE. THERE SHE WORKED HAND IN GLOVE WITH ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY REPRESENTING A WIDE RANGE OF WATER STAKEHOLDERS FROM INDUSTRIES TO MUNICIPALITIES, FROM SSTLES ORGANIZATIONS -- SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO CONSUMER GROUPS AND FROM AGRICULTURAL GROUPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND WHAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN ABOUT RADHIKA FOX IS THAT SHE'S AN EXCEPTIONAL LEADER WHO WILL WORK DAY AND NIGHT TO COME UP WITH PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR OUR COUNTRY'S SERIOUS WATER CHALLENGES. MOREOVER, MS. FOX WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S POINT OF VIEW IS HEARD AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHEN E.P.A. ACTS TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY'S PRECIOUS WATER RESOURCES. AND HOW DO WE KNOW THESE GROUPS SAY ALL OF THESE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT RADHIKA FOX? BECAUSE THEY HAVE WRITTEN TO US URGING THE SENATE TO ACT SWIFTLY TO CONFIRM HER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. IN FACT, OVER 80 PROMINENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE KEY STAKEHOLDERS, MADAM PRESIDENT, IN THE NATION'S WATER POLICIES HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF HER NOMINATION TO THIS IMPORTANT POST. AND WHEN I SAY THAT OVER 80 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE WRITTEN, I DON'T MEAN THAT 80-PLUS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SIGNED ON TO A COMMON LETTER, ONE LETTER OF SUPPORT. NO, NO, NO. I MEAN THAT OVER 80 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TAKEN TIME TO WRITE THEIR UNIQUE, THOUGHTFUL LETTERS OF SUPPORT. IN FACT, THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS, WHICH I'M PRIVILEGED TO LEAD, ALONG WITH SENATOR SHELLEY CAPITO OF WEST VIRGINIA HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR RADHIKA FOX. EACH LETTER DESCRIBES THE SPECIFIC AND POSITIVE IMPACT THAT MS. FOX HAS ALREADY HAD ON ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS, THEIR MEMBERS AND THOSE THAT THEY REPRESENT AND SHE'S DONE IT IN HER PREVIOUS PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS CONSISTENTLY. I WANT TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES, MADAM PRESIDENT -- I DON'T DO THIS VERY OFTEN, BUT I WANT TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES HERE AND GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE LETTERS, THESE 80 LETTERS OF SUPPORT. REMARKABLY CONSISTENT LETTERS OF GREAT COMPLIMENT AND PRAISE FOR HER AND THE KIND OF PERSON SHE IS AND THE KIND OF LEADER THAT SHE IS. LET ME JUST SHARE THE WORDS OF SOME OF THOSE WHO REACHED OUT TO US. THE U.S. CHAMBER OF OFFICE, THIS IS WHAT THEY WRITE. I'M QUOTING THEM. MS. FOX HAS WORKED TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES AND THE GROUPS THAT REPRESENT THEM ARE VALUED STAKEHOLDERS IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE CONVERSATIONS. SHE'S CREATED PLATFORMS TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE WATER SECTOR AND INDUSTRY THROUGH HER LEADERSHIP, CLOSE QUOTE. THE U.S. WATER ALLIANCE, WHAT DO THEY SAY? THE U.S. WATER ALLIANCE WRITES -- THIS IS A QUOTE. RADHIKA FOX DEVELOPED A CONSISTENT RECORD OF WORKING COOPERATIVELY ALONGSIDE STAKEHOLDERS ALONG EVERY CORNER OF THE WATER SECTOR INCLUDING DRINKING WATER, INCLUDING WASTEWATER, STORM WATER, UTILITIES OF ALL SIZES, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, LABOR, FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES, AND COUNTLESS OTHERS. CLOSE QUOTE. HOW ABOUT THE FARM ALLIANCE. HERE'S WHAT THE FARM ALLIANCE WRITES. QUOTE, DUE TO HER EXTENSIVE ENGAGENGAGEMENT AND PREVIOUS POSITIONS, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF GUIDANCE AND REGULATION BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THE NEED TO ACHIEVE QUANTIFIED RESULTS ON THE GROUND. RADHIKA FOX IS THE TYPE OF LEADER TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO C -- TO ULTIMATELY SEE IT THROUGH. THOSE ARE THE WORDS FROM -- WE RECEIVED FROM THE FAMILY FARM ALLIANCE. HOW ABOUT THE IOWA SOYBEAN ASSOCIATION. WE RAISE A LOT OF SOYBEANS IN OUR STATE. I KNOW THE PRESIDING OFFICER RAISES A BUNCH IN HER STATE AND OVER TO MY LEFT, THEY RAISE A FEW DOWN IN WEST VIRGINIA. MS. FOX UNDERSTANDS HOW WATER MANAGEMENT ISSUES ARE INTERWOVEN WITH THE FABRIC OF RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND THAT FARMERS MUST BE PART OF THE TEAM AND BENEFICIARIES OF THIS WORK. IT IS KEY TO MAKING REAL AND LONG LASTING PROGRESS ON PROTECTING AND IMPROVING WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY. CLOSE QUOTE. HERE'S SOME WORDS FROM ONE OF OUR MAKES IN DELAWARE OFF TO THE WEST OF US, MARYLAND. BEN GRUMBLES, A REPUBLICAN-APPOINTED SECRETARY OF MARYLAND'S DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT WRITES THAT MS. FOX HAS, QUOTE, IMPRESSED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR WATER LEADERS ON HER ABILITIES TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND SKILLFULLY ADVOCATE FOR INTEGRATED ONE WATER POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. SHE IS WELL QUALIFIED TO ORGANIZE THE NATIONAL WATER PROGRAM AND THE MANY DIVERSE CONSTITUENTS -- CONSTITUENCIES WHO SHAPE OUR WATER FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THOSE WORDS. GALVESTON, GALVESTON, TEXAS. HERE WE GO. GAG VESTON BAY FOUNDATION -- GALVESTON BAY FOUNDATION SAYS THIS. RADHIKA IS A PROVEN LEADER WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED A DESIRE TO MAKE SURE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND ALL VOICES HAVE A PLACE AT THE TABLE. CLOSE QUOTE. AND FINALLY, LAST BUT MOTT LEAST, -- BUT NOT LEAST, THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER, AN OUTFIT IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA NOT TOO FAR WHEN I WAS STATIONED WHEN I WAS IN THE NAVY, THEY WRITE, QUOTE, MS. FOX HAS THE RARE ABILITY TO BRING MULTIPLE DIFFERING VOICES INTO THE ROOM FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO WATER AGENCIES TO AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES TO STATE GOVERNMENT LEADERS. FIND THE COMMON THEMES, AND THEN WEAVE TOGETHER A SHARED GROUND THAT HELPS ADVANCE THE CONVERSATION AND CREATE REAL PROGRESS. YOU WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND A MORE GIFTED VISIONARY AND LEADER IN THE WATER SPACE THAN MS. FOX. THOSE ARE AMAZING LETTERS. ANY ONE OF THEM BY THEMSELVES WOULD BE, I THINK, REMARKABLE AND COMPELLING. BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONS, AND YOU HEAR THIS THEME REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN, IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE TURNS OUT RADHIKA FOX IS AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING AND LEADER. THEEX EXCERPT -- THESE EXCERPTS I SHARED WITH MY COLLEAGUES IS REALLY A SMALL SAMPLE. THIS IS A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF OVERWHELMING SUPPORT THAT OUR COMMITTEE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED FROM ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO KNOW WATER ISSUES AND WHO ALSO KNOW RADHIKA FOX. THEIR MESSAGE IS LOUD. THEIR MESSAGE IS CLEAR. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO CONFIRM A TRULY GIFTED LEADER AND PUT HER TO WORK SERVING OUR COUNTRY RIGHT AWAY FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN DOING JUST THAT. WITH THAT, MADAM PRESIDENT

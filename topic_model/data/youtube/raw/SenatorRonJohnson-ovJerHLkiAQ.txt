how's kenosha recovering well before about this time last year kenosha was growing at a tremendous pace i mean from compared to throughout wisconsin and really throughout the country one of the leaders of growth in the entire country and the government here the people here the schools here the parks everything here was is fantastic and it still is uh but then in august we had we had the unfortunate situation we had the shooting and then we had the riots that followed for days afterwards and it changed i mean the location we're at right now was a was a thriving office furniture place and and it's one of the places that got burnt and it's a terrible situation we had nights of of unrest here we had people that were in their homes afraid of the thousands of people that were marching through the streets oh my god we had i would say most of the sheriff's departments in the state and police departments in the state of wisconsin kane and we had up to we had about 1800 national guard from wisconsin and throughout the four different states too they all came to help protect kenosha and we had at one point over three thousand boots on the ground just to protect us for um what boiled down to about the last week of of the riots and unrest here and it was uh it was a very difficult time it was a very stressful time law enforcement here we we would sleep we'd sleep in our cars at the command post for an hour or two hours every single night and we'd just get up and go back to what we're doing is a very difficult time and i remember just hoping and praying that it would come to an end soon you know you set up over the high school there and i visited you at that point in time i just saw the outpouring of the community though we had one grandma come with 50 cheeseburgers for mcdonald's and a great big bag came and dropped it off and gave it to me and i said thank you so much we had restaurants and businesses drop off pallets and and and make food and it was absolutely amazing the the support and the love that was here in kenosha for everybody for people who were involved in in the the peaceful protests to the people who are protecting the city of kenosha it was absolutely amazing the people that were here and they helped they helped give they gave us the support we needed to continue the the fight to keep kenosha safe you just talked about the peace for protests was there also a real divide between the peaceful protesters did they push back on the rioters did they help control the situation uh we did have some peaceful protesters that were trying to help um keep things quiet they were definitely doing that the very first night that jacob blake was shot i was out there at the scene and we were with some of the crowd control and detectives processing the scene and we had people from the community leaders from the community coming and when one of the captains from the city police department went down right in front of me i stood over the top of them and they stood around me to protect me and the captain were down in the ground so we definitely had leaders here that were helping to keep um to keep things as as calm as they could be and uh part of the unfortunate part i think the very first night or two nights we had actually right crossing the street right behind us behind me right here there were people like mothers with their kids it was like they were going to a carnival or some kind of uh festivity that was going to be going on and it turned violent it turned it turned uh it turned into a situation that no one wanted here and it wasn't a peaceful situation at all so there obviously there were locals involved in that but there are also people coming from portland going to washington dc that seemed to take a left-hand detour once they found out what happened to kenosha and found out where kenosha was did you ever get any sense in terms of what percentage roughly nah i would say half of the people that were here in kenosha and it's just it truly is a rough guess i mean we had people from coming down the interstate from the north we had people coming from the south and uh they were coming off the interstate so we were monitoring that and uh we had buses of people coming here to do protests and it was kind of amazing we had people from all over the country we had plates we had the fbi and federal agencies intercepting people that were coming here to uh they were threatening to do major harm to our community and to people here while we were here we were talking to agents from the us marshals that were here and they came from portland and they said thank you for everything that uh that you guys are doing we're feeding them they treated everyone worked like one big family here you wanted them there i'm like we wanted them there so i mean i think i think what happened kenosha shocked not only wisconsin but but america's i mean if it could happen here yeah but at the same time you know because of leadership from people like you and you know other leaders that that did flood manpower in here kind of showed the nation how you shut this thing down as well it did it did after um the first second third night uh when the when we had the triple shooting um things started to really slow down the night of the shooting we actually had we went on a more offensive stance we started uh going out and we had the protective fence around our campus we started moving armored cars we started tear gassing just to disperse the crowds uh we we warned people go home go home now because what's going on right now is now what kenosha is all about and uh some did a lot of peaceful ones that really did clear out at that point but the ones who still wanted to wreak havoc on kenosha they stayed for a short time later and and we made a difference at that point and with the help of truly everyone from the smallest police agency in wisconsin that sent one officer here to major departments in wisconsin and the national guard and federal agents we took kenosha back so before i move on to how kenosha is doing dead i'm an accountant i like numbers so in the end how many businesses were burned i mean this one oh my god completely completely destroyed i've never when i drove through right afterwards i i thought a couple dozen maybe three dozen and then how many people were arrested charged how many people been convicted do you have any oh i don't know that i think it was about 30 businesses that were looted and burned uh but i mean it's a small percentage of what kenosha is i mean a lot of people when after this happened thought that all of kenosha burnt to the ground it didn't i mean it was a small it was some small mom-and-pop businesses and it was extremely dreadful that that happened but most of kenosha was still up surviving thriving and uh that black eye that we got last august and september i think we were bouncing back very nicely one of my messages for law enforcement is you know i certainly get the sense the vast majority of americans support you absolutely i mean they are so grateful for the service for the sacrifice i mean the risk you and and your loved ones are taking each and every day i'm always begging people please don't be discouraged but but i know they are talking to sheriffs around the state and really around the country can you talk a little bit about that i mean the officers that are quitting the difficulty in recruiting just to speak to that um back when i applied for the sheriff's department there were hundreds of people that were at my test uh now in that test that list that we created lasted two years uh now we're testing every six months about 60 people apply and we have people that are after the riots that quit or even people that quit during the rides and they their families wouldn't let them go to it so it's becoming very very difficult for that and i don't know what the future is going to to hold for law enforcement it's something we all need and i know that i'm going to be retiring in a year and a half and they're going to need other leaders to take up they're going to need young people come in and move through our department and other departments agencies like us in the state of wisconsin and all over the country this isn't just a problem here it's all over but as of right now we still have quality people that are applying and we're sending 11 people off to school in a month and i'm thrilled with all of them but shortly at past those 11 the uh the quality it drops rather quickly yeah well again you know thank you for your service and sacrifice that and your family and i think it's an important message so the people who are considering law enforcement do realize it's it's not just it's not the negative drum beat i mean there's some of that that is a very small very small majority and the vast majority of americans are just so appreciative so god bless him thank you thank you okay thanks senator appreciate it very much

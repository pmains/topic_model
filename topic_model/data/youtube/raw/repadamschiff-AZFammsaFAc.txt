REPORTS WITHIN THE LAST HALF HOUR OF NEW, LARGE BLAST IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF KYIV. WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US, IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE. >> THANK YOU. >> THE UNITED STATES DID SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH INTELLIGENCE IN THE LEAD UP TO THIS WAR. THEY DECIDED TO PUBLICLY SHARE INTELLIGENCE, NOT JUST WITH OUR ALLIES, BUT WITH THE PUBLIC ASKED THE RUSSIA'S INTENTIONS. RUSSIA DENIED IT WAS GOING TO LAUNCH THIS AN INVASION, THE U.S. INSISTED THAT THESE PLANS WERE REAL, AND THE USS PROVEN RIGHT. I WANT TO ASK, NOW THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS INVASION COME TO FULFILL OUR, WHEN YOU MAKE OF THIS AS A TACTIC WITH THE USE OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE AND IF THAT WILL AFFORD US ANY FURTHER EDGED AS THIS CONTINUES? >> I THINK THAT WAS A VERY TRUE USE OF INTELLIGENCE, AND I THINK IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED, HAVING WORKED WITH THIS AREA FOR A LONG TIME, I KNOW HOW RELUCTANT THESE AGENCIES ARE WITH THEIR INFORMATION BEING DECLASSIFIED. BUT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION MADE A CALCULATED DECISION THAT PUSHING RUSSIA BACK, BASICALLY EXPOSING THE PRETEXT IT WAS GOING TO USE STUN FAITH ITS NEIGHBOR, LAYING BARE THAT THIS WAS STRICTLY PUTIN AND HIS AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE, AND NOTHING MORE. IT WAS, I THINK, VERY POWERFUL, EFFECTIVE WHEN PUTIN DID JUST WHAT THE AGENCY IS PREDICTED, IT GAVE THE LIE TO ALL THE RUSSIAN EXCUSES, ALL THE RUSSIAN CLAIMS OF UKRAINE POTENTIALLY ATTACKING RUSSIA. AND SO, I THINK IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE, IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO STOP PUTIN, BUT I THINK IT DIDN'T DISRUPT HIS PLANNING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF IT. >> WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NOT DIRECT, BUT WE LEARN TO EXPECT FROM RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR, IT'S SOME SORT OF CYBERATTACK TO GO ALONG WITH THIS CONVENTIONAL ATTACK THAT THEY'RE WAGING ACROSS UKRAINE. WE HAVE SEEN SOME CYBER WAR, WE HAVE SEEN SOME CYBERATTACKS THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS CLEARLY, AND INSTANTLY ATTRIBUTED TO RUSSIA. AND THAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING, BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPECTED, GIVEN WHAT WE SAW FROM RUSSIA IN THE GEORGIA WAR THAT THEY LAUNCHED INTO THOUSAND EIGHT. GIVEN WHAT WE SAW THEM DUE TO UKRAINE IN 2014, 15, 16, INCLUDING SHUDDERING OFF THE ELECTRICAL GUARD. I THINK PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING A LARGER CYBER OPTION TO THAT. ARE YOU EXPECTING ANYTHING LIKE THAT? >> SADLY, YES. I DO EXPECT THIS TO COME. BASED ON HOW FEARS THIS IS AGAINST THE RUSSIANS, YOU MAY SEE AN ESCALATION OF THE CYBER WAR. SO WE'RE SEEING MIGHT JUST BE THE BEGINNING. IF PUTIN REALLY WANTS TO MAKE LIFE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE IN UKRAINE, HE CAN, I THINK, USE CYBER MEANS TO CREATE MORE PANIC AND CHAOS. THE DANGER I THINK TO US IN THE UNITED STATES, IS THAT SOME OF THE MALWARE THAT THE RUSSIANS USE IN UKRAINE MAY NOT STAY IN UKRAINE. WE'VE SEEN OTHER RUSSIAN MALEVOLENT TOOLS GO INTO THE WILD, SO TO SPEAK, AND BOOMERANG AROUND THE GLOBE. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT DEPENDING ON PUTIN'S REACTION TO WHAT WE DO IN PROVIDING MILITARY SUPPORT TO UKRAINE AND ENACTING THESE TOUGH SANCTIONS, THAT PUTIN MAY DIRECT SOME OF THOSE CYBER TOOLS AGAINST US. IN WHICH CASE, WE ARE PREPARED TO RESPOND. >> CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, SIR,

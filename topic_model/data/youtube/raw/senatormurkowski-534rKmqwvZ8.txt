thank you mr chairman good morning madam secretary welcome back to the committee i look forward to the opportunity to discuss the president's budget request this morning in a number of specific activities that the budget proposes to support i appreciate my colleague and the chairman leading off with a discussion about fire it's uh it's pretty tough in alaska right now we're up to about 2.8 million acres burned already we had 13 new fires just in the past 24 hours the smoke issues particularly in the interior have been a real challenge this summer but we've seen it out in other parts of of the state as well it's dry and the good news for us right now is that the rains are coming and and that's a positive but uh we need to make sure that we're not just praying for rain as the as the policy here to make sure that the fire threat doesn't doesn't bring about further damage

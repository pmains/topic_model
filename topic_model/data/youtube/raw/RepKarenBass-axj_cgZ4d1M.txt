good evening everyone this is a day to celebrate i hope that most of you heard our president and you know what it feels so good to say that a real president hasn't it been a relief every time i see president biden get up to speak i kind of go ah we're back to normal again well i tell you it has been an incredible 50 well i guess he's been in office 50 days and our vice president homegrown vice president kamala harris hasn't it been a delight to see her stand with president biden when bills are being signed or her swearing-in folks or her giving speeches it's been very exciting to see the two of them in and just think they've been in 50 days and the goal was a hundred million shots by the hundredth uh day that he's been in office and i predict that he will absolutely surpass that well you know i haven't talked to most of you since january 6 the day that president trump attempted to overthrow the government delay the election and prevent the swearing-in of president biden it was quite a stressful evening i was in the gallery right before things were happening and i was very lucky because i left about 10 minutes before everything broke out if i had waited another 10 minutes i literally would have walked into the insurrectionists in the hall and who knows what would have happened considering they were all hunting members of congress but nevertheless we are finally turning the page and i will tell you when i got my first shot and of course i've had my first and second shot it was just a it had a psychological effect it made me feel like there is a light at the end of the tunnel i will be able to take off this mask i will be able to go to restaurants and see friends and family again and one of the most important things for us to do was to pass a very extensive serious package and i will tell you that we tried to pass a package of this magnitude before but as you remember the republicans would not go along but i tell you at the end of the day organizing always wins out and on january 5th we sent two new senators to the u.s senate if you could imagine a black man and a jewish man from the state of georgia going to the u.s senate and hats off to stacey abrams and all the other organizers but it was because of their work that had taken place for years they didn't just do that overnight stacy had been working to change georgia blue for years it was because of that that we can now have this town hall today and talk about a rescue package that really will help the american people because we were able to do it because we have the majority in the senate mitch mcconnell is back in his office who knows what he's doing he can't confirm judges anymore thank goodness and so we wanted to have this town hall tonight right after the president spoke 24 hours after we passed the package because we want you to know what's in it we want you to know how to access it and we are so fortunate to have the experts that we have and i'm very proud to say that we have a new senator senator sidney come locker dove on her first day of work as a senator and she was kind enough to participate in this town hall and we can all celebrate her victory when we hear from her in a few minutes so let me go over a few things and then i'm going to call on sydney everybody knows about the stimulus checks so 1400 will be coming your way soon uh depending on your income level and so households with incomes under seventy five thousand dollars if single without dependence a hundred and twelve thousand dollars if single with dependents are a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for married couples who would generally be eligible for the full amount so if your income is below that you will receive a check for fourteen hundred dollars um the irs this is about of course if you uh if you didn't file for your 2020 income tax which of course is still early in the year so most of them haven't filed because we're not near april 15th so if the most recent information that the irs has is your 2019 return then you can use that 2019 return so um but if your 2020 tax data is going to make you ineligible for these payments so be careful you can wait to file them until april and the irs will look at your data based on 2019. so understand that if you haven't filed for your taxes the irs is going to look at what you made in 2019 um the child tax credit that's a really big deal you've probably been hearing about how the child tax credit is going to cut child poverty in half well temporarily because the child tax credit uh is for a year now of course one of the reasons we did this is because we would love to make it permanent and when you hear the word refundable when they say you're making the credit fully refundable what that means is is that you know for people who have a child tax credit or a dependent you know you file at the end of the year and you get your return well if your tax is refundable that means instead of waiting until the end of the year the irs is going to send you a check every month and those checks would begin in july so be on the lookout for your stimulus checks be on the lookout for the child tax credit and that should happen pretty soon because the uh system was already put in place the last time you got a stimulus check i'm not exactly sure when but it shouldn't take more than a few weeks for you to get that stimulus check now with the stimulus text coming i did want to take a moment to discuss the fact that numerous constituents have complained about the post office and so post office customers are experiencing frequent and harmful delays in their mail service and that's due to slow processing times you know it's a battle nationally with the post office because remember that guy that trump put in who was dismantling the machines and cancelling overtime and all well he's still there it's going to take a while for him to be removed you know that biden has uh the confirmation of his appointees have taken an extra long time he should have had his full cabinet in place by now and he hasn't because things are moving uh slow in the senate even though we are the majority they're still running slow so i think it's probably going to take us a while before we can get rid of that guy and get the post office up to speed where it needs to be so with that let me bring on the newest senator in the state of california senator sydney come locker dove congratulations it is wonderful that you are uh sworn in and busy at work well thank you so much congresswoman um i am so thrilled that my first official uh order of business this thursday evening is to be on a town hall with you um you are everyone's hero uh in my district and in my household so i appreciate you um i am yes sidney camlogger the newly elected senator for california's 30th state senate district uh and proud former assembly member to the 54th and i'm looking forward to answering any questions that i can about how the state is helping our constituents and to give some information on edd you know my office has been working relentlessly through the pandemic to provide assistance with state agencies especially with edd and unemployment claims and we've been able to successfully help so many constituents clarify their eligibility resolve issues with their claim ensure that their claims are being processed and confirmed their identity and wage documents have been received and we know that those have been a number of hiccups that many constituents have um been challenged by i want to just say that if you're having any trouble with any state agency you can contact my district office that number is 310-641-5410 you can also go through the website so since the onset of the pandemic edd has processed over 20 million claims and has paid a total of 126 billion dollars in unemployment benefits this number exceeds five times the number of claims filed even during the worst year of the great recession um if you were on the last call that we had back in december you'll recall that edd had created a new legislative referral system which actually allows my office and other offices to more effectively communicate with edd to actually step in and serve as the middle person between constituents and edd to elevate claims and to make sure that response times are quicker edd has completed adding up to 11 weeks of benefits to pua or peuc claims finishing their commitment to complete phase 2 by march 7. phase 1 actually was finished in january approximately 185 000 claimants were included in phase two and they now have been given the opportunity to certify that these benefits will be eligible so remember when we came back we actually appropriated more money to go into the hands of constituents who were still unemployed and so we had a phase one and then we have phase two which happens in march so uh also in response to our advocacy edd has also just recently doubled the time that we have in order to talk with edd specialists one on one which will allow us to help solve your cases quicker there have been lots of reports on edb fraud that is something that the legislature and the administration are working through lots of mistakes have been made and things have fallen through the crack i will say not to defend anyone that many of these things were actually issues that had been raised almost 10 years ago by the state auditor's office but the changes that the state auditor had recommended would obviously have cost money which was something the state was not in a position to pay for to fund because we were still going through our recession and slow recovery and so the government the state had to make a decision between making sure that seniors were able to keep their health care and you know adding more um uh dialers and more hours to our centers our call-in centers for edd obviously the state chose to make sure that you know health care was a priority but now that we are through that the legislature is taking um you know new strides to make sure that we are um shoring up uh the weaknesses that are in edd one of the things that we're doing is actually pushing to allow for edd checks to come through direct deposit rather than on the debit card since we know that many cards had been frozen by bank of america when fraud had been detected i also want to share that bank of america was continuing to collect interest on taxpayers dollars while they had frozen the accounts that were connected to these cards so they took the state's money loaded up these debit cards to give the folks who needed unemployment and then froze the accounts and continued to collect interest we had a hearing and the contract with bank of america was terminated subsequently because of that i want to add that california has also passed a budget that we call our golden state stimulus and so very similar to what's happening at the federal level and thank you again congresswoman bass for that we are now going to be sending out 600 or 1200 one-time payments to californians who have faced hardship because of covet who are cal eitc recipients or and who are i 10 filers which means you earn 75 000 a year or less and so we are working hard to make sure that more money is being connected to edd and then subsequently given out in unemployment claims and we are giving out stimulus checks on our own through the state of california i know you have other callers that have presentations and so i will end with that but we'll be happy to answer any questions if they arrive later on about edd well thank you madam senator i love the way that sounds let me introduce then raju who is the director of the los angeles regional office for the sba the small business association and then i hope that you have access to the queue because there are definitely a number of questions that apply to you fantastic thank you so much congresswoman it is an honor to be here today uh to be able to speak um on this historic signing of the american rescue plan act which now enables the sba to continue to lift up uh the cornerstones of our communities the mom-and-pop businesses the non-profits that provide essential services for our everyday lives that hire from within our neighborhoods and so much more our nation's more than 30 million small businesses are the economic engine of this country and in alignment with the administration we're going to continue to focus on the uh on their equitable treatment as well as continue to work tirelessly to ensure that eligible borrowers will get access to the critical economic relief that this act provides a couple of highlights of changes and additions that the bill will provide now is over 7.25 billion dollars additionally for our paycheck protection program including expanding eligibility to additional non-profits and digitals new news services which was not available before additional funds are now allocated for our shuttered venue operators ranch which he which here in our district is going to be essential for our venue operators and now allows businesses to apply for both ppp uh and the svog which wasn't allowed before and i know it's a sigh of relief for so many different people it's going to provide an additional 15 billion dollars for our targeted economic injury disaster loan program including new uh to this bill is five billion dollars for our supplement supplemental targeted idle advanced payments for those in the low income areas and those that are hardest hit by the pandemic additionally we're going to have another 28 a little over 28 billion dollars for restaurants for our restaurant revitalization fund that are specifically for industry focused grants another 100 million dollars to establish a community navigator pilot program where grants will go to eligible organizations to support the efforts to improve access to coven 19 pandemic assistance and resources sba as you know has been focusing every day on assisting our nation's small businesses here in los angeles and our surrounding areas and throughout the country business owners have been suffering and the sba has been here to be able to assist them through our various different programs our office continues to be here to support these efforts and will continue to be here to answer these questions and provide guidance as we need it i look forward to getting an opportunity to answer those questions that are in the chat box and uh man it's an honor to be here and a pleasure to be able to serve or continue to serve our constituents under your leadership thank you very much uh ben and before you leave um what about um loans and ppp for small nonprofits so nonprofits are eligible to apply and i if there are any questions of folks that have specifically uh that have specific details regarding their individual circumstances and their individual organizations i really want to encourage folks to reach out to our office our email address is l-a-d-o at sba.gov that stands for los angeles district office so l-a-d-o-s-d-a dot gov and and have get a chance to speak with us directly if they have individual questions they know that the the rules and the different things have been changing and we've been working closely one-on-one alongside our resource partners like our small business development centers our score partners as well as our women's business centers to make sure that uh folks have a clear understanding of what they're eligible for and what they can apply for um and additionally i know that uh we've got folks that are wondering about the forgiveness and the the grants and how do i apply for different things we're here to help them and navigate through the process and so uh i would imagine that you could not as a non-profit get a loan to say build low-income houses or if you ran a group home business for drug and alcohol rehab um is that possible uh is that can that be viewed as as a small business ma'am under the covet relief programs obviously it is for the um the impact of the pandemic itself our traditional sva programs um are are in fact still still is still in effect and there are a lot of debt relief uh programs that are in there however um the building of uh of the housing and and those types of things are not uh necessarily considered under the uh the small business under the traditional sva lending programs however if business owners are looking at developing or going into those types of areas again i encourage them to reach out to us so we can see if there are any areas that we can help them in however lending under our programs for those particular areas are are are definitely limited well nick from los angeles says that our ass will they extend accepting small business applications for less than 20 employees he thinks that the 14-day window has already passed but that couldn't be the case correct yeah the two weeks that that folks had for the less than 20 employees is i think we're right at the tail end of that however i encourage folks that do have less than 20 employees to continue to work with their lenders we have some amazing cdfis in our district as well as lenders that are working to make sure that our smallest to small business owners have access to the programs that are available and are working regularly to be able to do that and if they are facing any challenges with getting their application out there again i definitely encourage them to reach out to us so we can make sure we connect them with the right resources and the right partners uh for them on this journey well thank you very much ben and why don't we go to a poll question at this point and i will call on luis mccarthy after the poll question great let's do it thank you congressmember uh our first question for our constituents on the line tonight is have you received at least one vaccine shot you can press one for yes and two for no again our first polling question we've got a few of them for you tonight is have you received at least one vaccine shot you can press one for yes and you can press two for no go ahead and vote right now we'd love to know if you've gotten that vaccine yet again if you've gotten at least one shot of the vaccine press one for yes and two for no and congressmember looks like about 55 yes 45 no so far no good well i'm glad to see a number of folks well now louise mccarthy ceo of the community clinic association of la county will be with us as she is typically always there when we need her and we appreciate her so much luis please tell us about vaccines and health care thank you very much congresswoman and uh also a very happy uh proud constituent of the 37th yeah thank you first of all for supporting the american rescue plan and for all of the prior relief packages those have been so critical i i want to thank ben personally for that ppp loan that kept our nonprofit open last year so those have all been really critical um critical things for us to to to achieve um and finally congrats senator um i like the sound of that um so there are we've got uh health centers across the 37th district there's 18 organizations that serve 133 000 patients and our members have been stepping up vaccines since december and as you all know there hasn't been enough we haven't had enough doses and it has been a scramble but in addition to this release package i'm happy to say that relief in the form of more doses is on the way we're opening up additional tiers we opened up additional tiers on the first with essential workers more folks coming up on the 15th including people with underlying conditions and now they just let us know that they added to that group people experiencing homelessness and people with hiv so starting on monday those folks are eligible to get a vaccine we're really excited about that um so additional doses are coming in we actually have um the biden administration has started to directly allocate doses to the health centers because they recognize that a lot of areas in particular places like south la were not getting vaccinated at the right uh appropriate levels especially given the level of impact that those areas have had so we're really excited that there's targeted doses coming in specifically to address some of the inequities that have occurred to date within vaccine administration so we're not getting all we have we could we could have twice as many doses and and still be cooking so we've got a lot of capacity when those doses come the other piece when the infrastructure that's created in the uh american rescue plan um so you folks residents constituents on the phone are all um going to get to experience just additional investments in the infrastructure for putting out vaccines so in addition to doses we're going to see additional sites and places and support with staffing and and all of that uh glue that helps us stand up vaccine efforts so you're going to start to see that additionally if you're on cold insurance subsidies are going to be increased as well for folks on a couple of different plans so there are things that you will experience personally in your pocketbook that you'll see in your community as far as the places to get vaccinated and the the friends and colleagues that you see getting vaccinated and we are really excited that you feel like this is going to put us back to work and help us reopen safely thank you congruent oh thank you thank you so much well let me just ask you louise you know one of the issues about signing up for a vaccine is the online registration and the difficulty that people have do you have an option if somebody cannot sign up online or does not have email to get the confirmation what do they do you know that's a really good point and it's been really an exercise here trying to help some of the folks at the systems level understand that you know the real things that help people are people often and when it comes to seniors and people who have limited access so the best thing you can do is if you don't have internet access call your provider if you have a community health center in your community contact them our community health centers are actually helping people make appointments through the website so we're on the website making the appointment and they don't have to i know um behavioral health services is one of the clinics in the district that's been doing that um and that's been specifically helpful with seniors to get those those visits the other thing i would point to um the county county website to find appointments if you are going to look for appointments go there because that includes the state appointments the federal appointments and the county appointments and so it's got a really long handle that um i i'm not sure i should even try to say with all the flashes and stuff but if you go to publichealth.lacounty.gov and in the search thing just a vaccine appointment it'll take you to a hub where there's all the different appointment systems and you can see the sites and who's taking appointments wow well thank you thank you thank you for this um and i am excited that we do have better access i've been pushing federally for the uh vaccines to be distributed in a very creative way i know councilman uh marquise harris-dawson does phone banks he phone banks people in neighborhoods and says okay in two days the vaccines will be available from nine to five at this park so that the only people that know about the vaccines are the people that receive the call and if you live in the eighth council district i would recommend you call the office and find out where there might be vaccines that are available we need to be very very creative one of the things that we did in the rescue package is that we put resources in for vaccines to be distributed at community clinics in mobile clinics at community centers just all over we want as many people to have access as possible and i i get annoyed when they talk about people are hesitant and that's the reason why people aren't getting vaccines so i did an editorial you might have seen it it was in the washington post yesterday and that editorial talked about we if you focus on the people that want the vaccine nine times out of ten they either know somebody that's hesitant or scared or they're related to them but when your friends and family see you getting the vaccine and everything is fine afterwards then that encourages them to do it as well so any and everybody that's eligible please go out and get it you know i actually when before i got the vaccine i was a little hesitant too because i thought that you know trump really pushed it with that warp speed project he had he wanted to make sure the vaccine came out before the election and so i wasn't sure if it was a political ploy but then when i did my homework i realized this vaccine has been researched for over 12 years because although 19 is new coronavex corona viruses have been around for a long time just like now we're seeing the south african version in the uk version well researchers have been working on other versions variants mutants of coronavirus for many many years so they already had the infrastructure in place and then when i learned of course that there was an african-american woman who was one of the leaders of the research team well that was helpful too and uh and so i would just encourage people i got my shots the only thing i had was a sore arm afterwards no side effects but at least i have the freedom psychologically to know that there's a 95 or 98 chance that i won't get sick and now the more people that have had the vaccines you know we're learning that um you probably don't transmit the virus after you've had vaccine and that was something that we really didn't know about so anyway the more people get vaccines the sooner they get vaccines the quicker we will get our lives back to normal let me now introduce our final speaker another community hero lori gay who is the ceo of the neighborhood housing service one of the oldest community development organizations focused on housing in the country thank you lori for always being there always being available to the community thank you congresswoman i appreciate it glad to be here and so honored to be uh speaking alongside the other non-profits who are sharing their information and certainly our newest senator uh we're grateful and so let me just mention a couple of highlights because you can get caught and be lost in the numbers with the housing piece and the new bill there's a lot of information but i think what i should say first and foremost is nhs neighborhood housing services is available to answer all kinds of questions and try to help people get in the right direction whether it's with your lender your servicer of your loan a city or county funded program the state of california because all those entities are processing the federal relief programs in some way and i think what's critical is you know you want to sometimes have a guide and these are free services it is our job to make as sure as possible that you understand how to navigate the crazy housing mess we've had going on for a while so we want to do as best we can so the the plan as it's written right now is going to add 25 billion dollars in rental and utility assistance uh for tenants who have experienced some kind of challenge or struggle with the with the pandemic it also provides uh 10 billion dollars to help homeowners who are struggling with meeting their mortgage payment to pay utility bills other housing costs and get caught up on their loans another 100 million was dedicated and a lot of people don't pay attention to this to pay for housing council throughout the country who are hud approved so that's the housing and urban development department if they have a hud approval they should then be for sure providing any services to you relative to your mortgage or enter assistance for free so there'll be as always with crisis some folks who show up and start trying to charge please don't pay to get help for housing don't do it it should be free the last thing i'll mention real quickly on the big numbers is if the the plan offers 350 billion in relief to states and local and tribal governments so l.a as a city is getting somewhere around 1.35 billion the county about 1.9 billion city of long beach 153 million and then there are some other cities further west and so i think what's important is knowing that you can call your local hud approved housing counseling entity you can start certainly with nhs but there's about 12 of us in the region and any of us can help you we'll get on the line if you need help and assistance with your mortgage you aren't sure how to talk to your lender you want to have us help you walk through that because these funds have been set up to help offset some of your costs due to the pandemic and i think there's all kinds of other local funds that have been set up as well and so our housing counselors are trained and able to talk you through that as a food service and then to say you know think about what fits you best for mom and pop property owners a lot of money coming down in this new bill coupled with the state coupled with the county and the cities putting out money for mom and pop landlords i'm so grateful for that kind of woman because in this pandemic we wanted to make sure that the people who care for our communities as property owners they own multiple units were also included so i'm going to stop there because it's a lot of big numbers but i think we're available to you at nhs and we're happy to refer to our friends if you perhaps want to talk to other agencies too that might be more nearby you well thank you thank you thank you and i do hope that our speakers stay on the line and why don't we go to another polling question sure thing congresswoman let's go to our next one lined up right here we want to know if you have decided not to take the vaccine when it was made available for you what was your reason press one if you don't trust the vaccine press two if you don't know where to get the vaccine press three if you've just been concerned lines or weights are too long and press four if you've already taken it or you're not eligible yet but you plan to take it so let me read those options one more time if you've decided not to take the vaccine when it was made available to you what was your reason press one if you don't trust the vaccine press two if you don't know where to go to get the vaccine press three if lines are just too long you're worried about wait times and press four if you've already taken it or you're not eligible yet but you're planning on taking it and i'll take a few minutes to get those votes in congressman wonderful wonderful wonderful well let me take up several uh questions that are in the queue because some people are asking some political questions but here's one that's not a political question and that is once you've had both shots how long will it last and will you have to get this shot annually moving forward bottom line is they don't know i do think that all of us need to be prepared for this to be something that becomes routine just like we get flu shots or pneumonia shots they have not said that yet i mean in a way we are all participating in a research project in the sense that they don't know everything about the vaccine but they knew enough to say that the vaccine is safe it's not going to hurt you so go ahead and take the vaccine but we will find out along the way whether or not we will have to take shots whether we will take booster shots or whether it will be an annual shot but you know how when you take a when you get a flu shot you're not covered for every possible strain of flu there is so you can get a flu shot and still get the flu the shots that are given cover the the strains that are the largest but it doesn't mean it covers every single one some people have asked me whether or not the black caucus is going to continue investigating what happened on january 6 the insurrection well the black caucus actually won't do the investigation charles might be thinking of the fact that a member of the black caucus has filed a lawsuit against trump and against the uh insurrectionist and how ironic it's done under the ku klux klan act i think that's very appropriate and uh another one of my colleagues have filed a um a lawsuit under the ku klux klan act also uh from california northern california eric swalwell and basically the klu klux klan act was uh was policy that was put forward that basically charges organizations like the clan for disrupting the work of government and something that was done after reconstruction so uh it'll be interesting because i believe no doubt that some of those people that invaded the capital were actually members of the clan and if they weren't members of the clan they were members of other white supremacist uh organizations and so some people have asked me why it takes so long given that we have the majority why are we still struggling to get legislation passed well you probably know that for routine legislation like the one i'm working on the george floyd justice and policing act it takes 60 votes in order to pass the senate what we did in terms of the rescue package was we used a a very rarely used procedure called budget reconciliation and when the republicans voted for the 1.9 trillion dollar tax cuts they use the budget reconciliation act in order to do that so even though they're squawking now about us giving 1.9 trillion dollars to the american people to working families to people that are struggling they were mad about that but they had no problem giving away 1.9 trillion dollars to the richest people in the country which is why through the pandemic while a lot of us are struggling some people did just fine because they were fine before and it didn't really uh hit them let me ask our speakers in a minute if you would like to come back on if there's any other comments that you would like to make or if there are any questions in the queue that you would like to take up uh betty from los angeles wants to know when we will be able to replace the postmaster general i mentioned that a number of president biden's appointees have not been confirmed by the senate yet and when the board for the post office is confirmed there will be enough votes to get rid of him the postmaster but right now it's not something that the president could just unilaterally do you know if our senator is still with us there is a question about unemployment um benefits that rhynda is asking which wants to know whether or not considerations have been made that taxes would be waived in the case of unemployment insurance if our senator is still with us if she could jump in and she might have an answer to that yes so unfortunately um that is not something that is currently under consideration and even during the time of covid when we were working to pass uh renter protection release and um release for uh single homeowners and baby or mom and pop landlords taxes were still due property taxes were still due um and it was something that you could request um either an extension on although most of those were not being given or you were um what one of the things that we did do was we said you were not going to be assessed any penalties for paying your property taxes late as it relates to income taxes during covid there were some extensions but none have been granted no extensions rather have been granted now the hope is that because more and more folks are getting vaccinated because we are seeing the um icu capacity numbers going down and because slowly but and surely we're seeing purple move to red and move to orange um in terms of the tiers and more and more reopenings that our economy will continue to recover for middle and low income californians which will also be able to benefit our coffers as it relates to taxes but one of the things we have seen as a result of covet is that those who are rich have been doing very well and as a result we have been getting surpluses um into our state coffers rather than deficits which was what we were anticipating and that's probably one of the reasons why there won't be any tax relief but there will be stimulus checks in addition to unemployment claims that will be um eligible for benefits um that are going to low-income and working-class families congress members yes we've got a good one lined up here i think ben will want to take it's from patrice and redondo beach you mind if i bring patrice live here sure all right and uh patrice you can go ahead and ask your question directly of ben right here uh we've got him on the line with you go ahead teresa okay great thank you for this wonderful town hall i'm the founder of a small non-profit charity and we did receive a small business loan through the sba because of covet-related issues we're wondering if there's anything in the pipeline as far as forgiving any of those loans and i'm not talking to pppm it's specifically the loans that we have to pay back i've already started paying it back actually thank you for that question let me just before uh ben asks answers that let me just ask uh if luis could follow because the other part of patrice's question is foster parents are now eligible to get the vaccine but she can't find any info regarding this and maybe louise when ben is finished can confirm whether that's accurate or not thank you fantastic and thank you patrice for asking that question as it stands right now the and i think you're referring to our economic injury disaster loan which is available in addition to our paycheck protection program um those loans are repayable and and those there was a portion of it uh as far as the advanced portion that was forgivable um and available in the form of a ten up to ten thousand dollars um that was uh forgivable uh however the rest of it is as it stands currently will need to be repaid um and i'm not aware of any uh any of the legislation or anything like that that's uh currently in place to be able to uh make that forgivable and louise would you mind uh responding about are foster parents in fact eligible now um yes actually foster parents are eligible um if they they're providing emergency housing for young people i'm i'm looking for um the best thing to do is to go to the county website that is publichealth.lacounty.gov and um and go to their vaccine appointment locator and what they do is they walk you through a checklist once you choose any of the venues you want to go to you'll say yep i fit in this category and then they'll tell you what type of documentation um you need to bring um and so it you should be of um yeah this was just recently opened and so um hit to that that county website and enter your eligibility in uh in the appointment function thank you luis and actually i can i go back to ben just real quick here can you clarify whether or not small businesses are eligible for ppp even after that two-week exclusive eligibility expires yeah and i'm glad you uh came back to that i was actually going on mutant uh um and cover that a little bit we did have a two-week period where uh that actually expired earlier this week yesterday as a matter of fact for small business owners with less than 20 employees to be able to apply for the paycheck protection program all even though that period is no longer eligible there is no longer available where it's exclusively only for business owners that had less than 20 uh employees now this was an opportunity this was a leg up for uh those smallest of the small business owners and as a matter of fact during this time period over 400 000 small business owners with fewer than 20 employees were able to get access to the to this program and the kicker on that is is that 200 000 of those were for first-time ppp borrowers throughout our area we want to make sure that business owners understand that they are still eligible to apply even though that two-week period that exclusive period is has passed you still can apply and as i mentioned earlier we have cdfis we have lenders we have a variety of different folks that are eager and working diligently to make sure that our smallest of small business owners get access to this to these funds as patrice pointed out as we kind of discussed the ppp portion of it if used properly is forgivable it is important that folks do not disqualify themselves from this by not applying please apply find out what you're eligible for find out what you how you can fully leverage all of the programs that are available to you and make sure that you're using those programs to the fullest extent so you can make sure that your business is not only surviving thriving through this pandemic let me just mention too that naomi has asked the question about the monies for schools and will those monies be eligible or will they be allowed to be used to improve ventilation systems and the answer is yes so one of the uh points of the um of the school funding is to make sure that the schools are safe make sure that the schools are safe so it is about time for us to wrap up can we get a report from the polling questions and then i would like to ask our seekers if they have any final thoughts sure thing so we ran that last poll and asked if somebody had not taken the vaccine what their reason was and uh 76 percent of our listeners already took the vaccine or they're just not eligible yet and they're planning to take it so that's most folks 14 say they don't trust the vaccine 66 say they don't know where to get the vaccine and four percent are just too worried about those long lines or waiting too long so that's the results of our poll congressman well let me just say before i bring on our speakers beginning with our senator uh if you don't know where to get a shot could you please call our office at

i think it's pretty clear that everyone that has spoken today just wants president biden to do his job and to protect americans you know they this administration is continuing to just wreak havoc on the southern border you know it tells americans that people that title 42 is no longer necessary because covet's behind us and in the same breath they're asking for billions of dollars in more coded relief how hypocritical is that our job is to protect americans our job is to enforce american laws so uh you know when it comes down to the biden administration just simply using covid as an excuse to push through these liberal policies and it just doesn't matter what it's doing to the safety of americans it is unbelievable we need to continue to have these press conferences we know what's in front of us again we're just asking president biden to do his job to protect americans and enforce the laws that have already been passed

academies the ones which require nominations and then we're also going to hear from two members of our military advisory board who have been tremendously helpful with the entire nominations process so following the individual 10-minute presentations we're going to have breakout rooms which i think will be really exciting to be able to have that one-on-one interaction and so all the presenters will be answering questions and the breakout rooms will be named according to the academy so it'll be pretty self-explanatory um you're welcome to jump between them and then we're also going to have a room

and then it looks like everyone's kind of on it already but if you could please keep your cameras and microphones off during the whole thing um that would be great and their instructions for how to like put zoom into speaker mode um in the little chat section it's also in the email that i sent you so i would now like to introduce retired lieutenant colonel steve wilson who's been essential to the entire planning process i would not have been able to do any of this without him um he's leading the surface academy subcommittee of our military advisory board and it really has been such an honor to work so closely with him so steve take it away thank you very much there are many ways a person can serve the public all of your students in high school and guess what all your teachers and all the school administrators are public service employees so public service is defined as work done by someone for the benefit of everyone examples would be the teachers and the administrators firemen policemen the court systems elected folks and of course people in the military i was a pilot in the air force for 24 years i served combat tours in both vietnam and saudi arabia during the first gulf war so public service is near and dear to my heart so i'm very pleased to be able to work on this committee and select the next generation of leaders in our military so today we're going to talk about how you can enter a service academy which leads to five years of public service as an officer in the military service one way you can enter a service academy is through a congressional nomination this would be through your u.s congressman or congresswoman or u.s senator today it was it is my pleasure to introduce congresswoman deborah walsh who represents north carolina congressional district 2. she was elected last year she serves on the science space and technology committee and also the rules and judiciary committees she lives in raleigh and is married to steve wren it is her honor to nominate deserving students to an appointment to a service academy congresswoman ross could you take it away and please tell the audience why public service in the military is important to you well thank you so much steve and thank you for serving on my military advisory committee i could not um have a better group of dedicated folks who have served in the military all over the country and in different branches of the military and your advice to me and your wisdom and your perspective have been invaluable particularly during these very difficult times so thank you for everything that you do and thank you for heading up on this service academy group because we're going to get the next generation of bright talented people to serve in our military i want to thank all the students who have joined today for your interest in serving our country and for being engaged members of the community if you're interested in serving and being part of the military academies we know you are already involved in your communities and we want to just thank you for your energy and for your enthusiasm this is an especially difficult time in our country and in our world as you know we're facing the coronavirus which is a health crisis we're facing environmental crises and we're facing difficulties abroad and you are willing to serve and that just warms my heart i also want to thank the extraordinary panelists who you'll hear from for your service to our country and for joining this discussion to ensure that students know every opportunity available to serve in our nation service academies i'm the proud daughter of a former air force physician and it's an honor and a privilege to nominate students to the service academies now you know that there's no higher duty than serving your country and the five service academies offer unparalleled education resources to students who answer this call leadership is so so crucial and we're going to need a different kind of leadership going forward we're going to need your talent we're going to need your courage we're going to need your compassion and we're going to need people who look forward to tackling our problems in a way that can help all of our people today you're going to hear from representatives from the u.s military academy the naval academy the u.s air force academy and the u.s merchant marine academy and they will share more information about their academies and the immense opportunities available to you as well as the obligations and commitments that come along with attending a service academy if you have any questions about seeking a nomination to one of the service academies please don't hesitate to reach out to my office you can contact clarissa and i look forward to reviewing the applications of all the talented bright young people who seek to serve our country and i look forward to the guidance of my service academy volunteers who will help me identify the folks who will do the absolute best job serving our country i want to thank you once again for your interest and commitment to our nation and i want to thank our panelists for your service to our country and offering guidance to the next generation now i'd like to introduce colonel brian doyle who is a member of my service academy volunteer staff and a 1991 graduate of the air force academy colonel doyle take it away thank you ma'am as congresswoman ross shared i'm colonel brian doyle recently retired from the u.s air force and a 1991 graduate of the air force academy in addition to being a graduate i've had the opportunity to work with over 200 north carolina students as an admissions liaison officer for the air force academy over the last 20 years so i'm well versed on what it takes to earn admission and to succeed at the academies as you probably know attending a service academy is a tremendously unique experience compared to a civilian university beyond that each academy has its own unique experience so we're going to start this portion of this afternoon by sharing some of the common features of the various service academies still very different from a civilian university and then like you heard the reps from each of the academies will describe what makes their academy different from the others so first up would like to show you a brief video less than six minutes which is an overview of the academies and then i'll be back with some additional detail about how the academies are similar the air force academy at colorado springs the us military academy at west point the naval academy at annapolis the coast guard academy at new london and the merchant marine academy at king's point these are america's service academies the five-pointed star each year thousands of cadets and midshipmen enter our nation's service academies they come from all walks of life and bring with them a variety of experiences the common thread is to be challenged at the highest levels and serve our country in the most noble of professions cadets and midshipmen at america's service academies accept a lifestyle that is unique and demanding though they differ in terms of their history and missions the military academies have more in common than most people think the service academies all offer a rigorous four-year program their main focus is on developing leaders to serve our nation in peace and during conflict every cadet and midshipmen receives a fully funded education including tuition room and board and health care and upon graduating with a bachelor of science degree they're commissioned as officers in the uniformed services [Music] each academy is rated as a top undergraduate college all offer majors in engineering math science and the humanities when cadets and midshipmen graduate they take with them lasting friendships they forge lifetime bonds under the intense pressure and the high moral and ethical standards demanded by our service academies they are prepared to rely on each other to get the job done our academies are not only focused on providing a first class education but on training and leading cadets and midshipmen are a part of a very special team america's team these are the young men and women we turn to in order to maintain our national defense it's a big job but these academy grads are very well prepared we look for well-rounded candidates individuals who demonstrate character academic prowess physical toughness and the potential not only to excel at the academy but also to excel as officers after graduation and likely make a career of the air force army navy marine corps coast guard or merchant marine a healthy balance of these assets is considered by our admission boards cadets and midshipmen are taught by men and women who are top in their field the ratio of students to teachers is among the lowest in the nation the primary mission for instructors and professors is classroom teaching equipment is state of the art the unique challenges are unmatched no other school offers the range of opportunities available at a service academy [Music] in keeping with a famous quote by general douglas macarthur that on the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on other fields on other days will bear the fruits of victory all cadets and midshipmen are athletes and every athlete is challenged the academies share a belief that the competition and teamwork learned on the playing fields reinforce the team spirit needed to get the job done at the service academies there is both officer and undergraduate chain of command cadets and midshipmen have a chance to develop and practice personal leadership skills to be a leader you must learn to follow that's why upperclassmen have a great responsibility in training lower classmen it's about becoming a leader who will inspire respect and obedience even under the most trying of circumstances our cadets and midshipmen are taught how to keep their heads when things get tough to make the right decision the first time they see what is required and make sure it is carried out learning through their mistakes the principal rule of conduct is based on honor cadets and midshipmen do not lie cheat or steal just as they learn to use the most advanced technology in the world these young men and women also develop an inner confidence that keeps them pointed on the path of honor and integrity in the process cadets and midshipmen join a long and distinguished line of academy graduates these graduates inspire on the strength of their vision and the courage of their team service academy graduates excel in every sphere of influence from general and admiral to government leaders and captains of industry some say that much of the history taught at the academies was made by graduates who went before [Music] our country expects a great deal from our cadets and midshipmen to make them the best in their chosen field academy graduates prove worthy of this assessment by the way they perform their postgraduate service opportunities it all comes down to this but those who want to reach their potential they have the help they need to find it america's service academies the five-pointed star excellent so hopefully that short video gave you just a feel for how the service academies are similar and they say a picture is worth a thousand words so hopefully it played out that way for you at the same time though i recognize that there's a lot of detail behind attending a service academy so let's get into that and if we can bring up my slides we'll uh we'll talk through some of these common features one sec great thanks so like the video alluded to the service academies are attended by the very top students from around the country and we'll explain what that means there are also the amazing opportunities that aren't found at any other college like you saw in the video there was flying airplanes jumping out of airplanes sailing a ship driving a tank language immersion in a foreign country and so on if you attend and graduate from a service academy you're going to learn to be a better leader and you're going to learn to manage stress like a professional there's always a point where it becomes very stressful in our lives and and what the air force academy and all the other academies is going to do is stress and stretch what you can do as a person so that when you engage in stressful activities it doesn't bother you nearly as much as it does now or to people maybe don't attend a service academy you'll earn the right to serve your country as an officer and that means you outrank about 75 of all the people in the military the day you graduate and you'll have financial independence so that means tuition your room your meals your medical and dental benefits are all paid for by the military and cadets and midshipmen are paid for their service so think about graduating from college without any debt and think about getting paid to go to college that's what you get out of the service academies if you'll advance the slide we do have some pretty unique admission requirements there's an age requirement you need to be a u.s citizen and unmarried without dependents because this is a full-time job going to school at a service academy there are medical qualification requirements and there is a group called the department of defense medical examination review board that looks at all the records and decides if somebody is medically qualified to attend a service academy and if at first blush you're not you can apply for a waiver so there are a couple different iterations of this certainly academic qualifications we'll talk about the details of these a little bit more later but we'll look at grades standardized tests like the act and sat in a normal year in this era of covid oftentimes schools are test optional and your high school rank leadership is very important and that includes sports and extracurricular activities and then being physically fit everybody will take a physical fitness assessment as part of their application process in addition it's very important that there's clean living at the service academies and from our our candidates so there is admission and then ongoing drug screening so that's something if that's a problem for you it's you know you should be aware of it now and then um like like you've heard already uh you need a nomination for everywhere except for the coast guard academy whether it be a congressional nomination like we're talking about today vice president president or from other sources on the next slide we'll talk about the academics and it's important to note that each service academy is a four-year program so while not every student comes straight in from high school about 25 percent don't it's still a four-year program everybody starts with basic training everybody starts as a freshman all graduates earn a bachelor of science degree and a commission as a second lieutenant or an ensign so again you are commissioned as an officer right at graduation each of the academies has a strict honor code and this is not just something that's up on a wall or a poster someplace that people kind of look at and ignore at service academies this is a big deal you won't lie steal or cheat all the service academies offer a broad core curriculum and so what that means is that you're going to take some extra classes as part of your academics if you want to major in engineering that's awesome you'll still take classes like english and history if you want to major in political science or history that's great too but you'll still take engineering discipline classes chemistry physics and so on so it's that broad curriculum that turns into a well-rounded person and officer the classes are very small typically 12 to 20 people and the instructors are there to teach the cadets in the midshipmen they're not there to do research they're not there to publish papers they're there to make sure that you succeed and i'm telling you having worked with students over the last 20 years if you get into a service academy and you are trying your hardest on the academics you will succeed these teachers are the most available of any colleges across the country and every one of them will offer their cell phone at the beginning of the course and if you have questions you can reach out they turn into awesome tutors during their off periods next slide please it is absolutely a military oriented lifestyle and that means getting up early having a spotless room having a spotless uniform everybody has some kind of you know quote unquote after school jobs so there's some kind of military job that you have you attend your classes you have athletics you might be in clubs and then at the end of the evening everybody study so it is a long day but it's a very rewarding experience each of the academies has unique summer military training and it starts off with the basics and then moves into more advanced training that could include you know maybe you're learning how to fly a glider like actually pilot a glider as a freshman and then as a junior or senior you are teaching other cadets how to fly that glider or teaching basic training or going overseas doing research even staying here at home and doing research at places like google or facebook as the movie shared every cadet midshipman is is an athlete so if you play a varsity sport or a club sport you're practicing every day if you play an intramural sport then you're practicing every other day are competing every other day and there are a ton of clubs three of the service academies have 90 to 100 clubs a piece coast guard and merchant marine have 18 to 20 clubs but there's plenty to do outside of just the military aspect in the academic aspect next slide as i said we're going to get into the academics a little bit more here these are the average scores from the air force academy class of 2025 the other service academies are similar to this so you can look at those sat and act scores they're they're pretty good uh they're pretty high the service academy's uh super score so it's to your advantage to retake the sct or act multiple times if you don't do great on the first one a high gpa as well you can see it's about all a's with a couple of b's on an unweighted scale about 3.9 out of 4.0 extracurricular activities are really important as well so being a leader and a leader can mean a lot of different things it can be something in student government it can be clubs at school it could be a team captain it can be church boy scouts girl scouts volunteering in your community all of these are great leadership opportunities and service opportunities because what we're looking for are leaders of character so people who are going to be great leaders and people who care about somebody other than themselves so you can see those stats and then a lot of our successful candidates have a varsity letter you don't necessarily need one but being physically fit is absolutely important next slide of course right now we're talking about the service academies and you're going to hear from the representatives from all of the service academies that require a congressional nomination so so we won't hear from coast guard today but we will hear from everybody else if the service academies aren't for you and or you don't get into a service academy there are some other options one is college rotc so there's different levels of scholarships this is when you participate in the rotc program at nc state or unc or you know any other college university basically around the country the requirements are similar to the service academies although typically just a touch lower to get the most basic of the scholarships a little bit lower academically but still leadership is important and and i wanted to note that high school rotc is not a prerequisite it's a question i get often from students i don't have rotc at my high school is that going to be okay it's totally okay because not everybody has that opportunity there's also a chance to go to a preparatory school so air force army and navy have their own prep schools coast guard and merchant marine utilize others and to apply to the prep school is the exact same application process as applying to the service academy itself so in other words when you apply to us military academy at west point you are putting in your application and they are deciding if you were a good candidate for direct entry into west point or if you would be a good candidate for their prep school it's the same application and typically the prep schools are created for otherwise strong candidates who just need a little bit more academic seasoning great leaders maybe great athletes but we want them to succeed when they get to the service academy so maybe one more year of seasoning is a good idea so that's a summary of how the service academies are similar but as you would guess each service academy has its own nuances and so next up i'd like to introduce ben lebrun from the united states naval academy to tell us a little bit more about it thank you brian i really appreciate the introduction and i appreciate you all for being here tonight uh my name is ben lebrun um just a little bit about me i unfortunately was not privileged to go to united states naval academy but i'm very eager to tell you a little bit more about what makes it special um if you will move to the next slide please i'll get right into that all right so first off the united states name academy is located on the seven river between baltimore and washington dc it's a lovely spot i love working there every day i get to look out on the bay and see the tall ships going through the water i hope that if you get a chance to come to the naval academy as a candidate tourist or you know looking at some of our virtual tours online i really really hope that you'll enjoy it um it is a wonderful wonderful place to be and also to learn as you can see from a lot of things here for you to do [Music] that's you know just it's not just a school it's a place to live uh next slide please and speaking of living you can learn a little bit more about going to the naval academy for candidate visit by going to usna.edu and looking for candid visits in the drop-down menu now i'm going to talk a little bit about majors as well because i feel like this is something that's really really important and differentiates us from some of the other service academies we are a stem school primarily we focus on the things that drive in modern navy so you'll see from this majors page a lot of this is focused on math science engineering and technology now what that means is if you wanted to go and study humanities english science uh english political science chair uh chinese arabic any of these things that is absolutely an option but please do understand that you're still going to have to get involved with these stem subjects at some point so you know prepare yourself for that and understand that a lot of people do it you can learn it too if it's something you struggle with now make that a priority and make that something that you can boast about when you apply to our academy uh if you'll click one more time oh good there the uh the miners came up there we go i don't know if you go back real quick okay we do have language miners as well these do have to be taken with another major um if you're somebody who wants to focus on uh like foreign area studies there at the bottom that's a very new one you will be required to take a language minor with that as well i also want to hit on this really quick as well what you pick here does not determine what your career is we have physicists who are helicopter pilots we have history majors who are in the navy seals it doesn't matter what it is you pick so much is that you pick something that you're going to enjoy and something that you're going to do well at uh don't pick something because you think it's what's going to help your career uh next slide please all right so we have very small class sizes here the average class size is between eight to ten which means you're gonna get a lot of one-on-one time with your professors this is not uh you know giant lecture hall uh study sections you know you're gonna get an opportunity to meet with your professors and really engage with them uh we also have a one-to-one civilian military faculty ratio and what i mean by that is most of the people you'll work with and meet are active duty military members these are people who've been out to the fleet they've been in the marines they've been on ships and they can mentor you not just in the classroom but also on your career progression as well so there's a lot to learn from these folks outside of the classroom as well i highly recommend that you know if they engage with you you take them up on it by and large they are some of the best folks you'll ever learn from at any time in your naval career next slide please so we also have sports uh brian touched on this and i really appreciate it everyone's gonna be an athlete you're gonna play a sport uh this is just a very small section of some of the sports we have from our varsity uh for those who don't want to play a varsity sport or are interested in what you see on this page that's fine we have a huge intramural and club sport program as well uh some of these clubs travel so i mean you can get the same experience even if you're not quite uh interested in going up to the varsity level or can't find a spot on there um for those of you who are interested in learning more about some of the athletic opportunities at the naval academy i recommend that you go to navysports.com uh there you can also schedule to talk with some of our coaches as well and they can kind of give you advice in the off season our next slide please so while you're at the naval academy we're going to give you everything you need to succeed right and what i mean by that is you're not going to pay for things when you come to the naval academy we're going to pay your way through school the full scholarship so what that means too is you're going to you'll get your books you'll get a laptop computer things that some of your friends at other schools are having to struggle with getting jobs after school you're not gonna have to worry about that this is an intensive program so we need to give you the tools to succeed and by and large that's what you're going to get here at the naval academy is we're going to give you what you need to succeed it's up to you to supply the effort but you'll never lack for the material things that you need to perform uh your best academically on that slide please there we go so everybody who graduates you're going to bachelor's of science yes that means you need a bachelor's of science in english right but it also means that you're going to be held to a high academic standard for those of you who may have sniffed in the news about 18 people who are separated for cheating on a physics exam honor courage commitment these are things that we don't just say we believe them and unfortunately if that's not something that you can hold yourself to please don't apply but for those who have your service commitment um and for those of you who are going into a specialized field of some kind uh there'll be additional service commitments uh that could be you know a couple of years just for pilot training or uh some additional years if you have post graduate work as well next slide please and finally here's a breakdown of the service assignments for the class of 2021. so the class of 2021 as you can see went into what we call the big four right which is surface warfare submarines pilots in the marine corps 95 percent of the class more or less will go into these fields but as you can see there on the right side in what we call the staff court we have folks who are going into more specialized fields uh this you know these are more selective they have a lot more requirements there's some more schooling involved as well so you can see we've got some really cool stuff for you to go to but notice you don't see any major requirements on this i want to reiterate again you can get into any of these career fields regardless of what you study you just have to put forth the effort and demonstrate that you have the knowledge to succeed in one of these career fields next slide please finally i also want to hit on the summer programs we have as well the first one i have is the summer stem program so this is for folks who um they're not yet a junior in high school and you know they just want to get a sense of what do we do with the naval academy so the summer stem program is a great opportunity to see some of the programs talk to some of the midshipmen some of the faculty and uh you know get to do some really cool stuff program robots as you can see some of the some of the kids working with pipettes uh they also get an opportunity to program a drone and fly it around with an xbox controller it's really awesome i highly recommend you go to the link at the bottom usa.edu admissions slash stem and please check it out on the next slide please and now we have summer seminars so much seminars for those who are what we call rising juniors so people who are between their junior and senior year uh getting ready to finish their last year in high school this is a chance to get a taste of what we do during cleve summer right which is what we call the initial training period when you first come to the naval academy plebe summer is intense don't get me wrong this is boot camp for midshipmen but this is an opportunity for you to get in see what it's about see if it's something you like meet some of the people you're going to be working with some of the instructors that will be teaching you once you get here it's intense it's competitive but it is a absolutely you know not to be missed opportunity if you can get in uh next slide please and finally i do want to hit on this as well the the fiscal qualifications are very important i'm not going to go over all these suffice to say please do not wait until the very last minute to do this we had some really really awesome folks last year who unfortunately didn't prioritize their physical qualifications and unfortunately it sunk their ship right so please focus on these now if any of you have any questions about what to do or how to do it please feel free to reach out to us we also have guides for the cfa on usa.edu as a lot of good information for you there so please don't let this be what uh takes down the wrong path next slide please and then finally i'm just going to hit on these last few bits we are stem school once again so please if you're not taking advanced sciences or advanced maths now is the time to start doing it you're especially going to want to focus on some of these pre-calc and trigonometry geometry advanced geometries if you are taking a chemistry physics or other science course make sure it is one with a lab because we want to see that you not only know the science but you can do the science uh we already covered gpa you do want to be in the top 20 of your class you do want to take your s.a.t until you're satisfied with it we encourage any advanced courses you take even if they're not in science or math and then finally be a well-rounded person don't be somebody who's going to do a thousand things but only dabble in them a little bit do something that is that you're invested in that you're working hard with something that you take pride in and can point to and say these are the things i have done right and even if you're not involved in something like that make sure that you're a participant in a way that somebody says i need this person on my team when they come to my my club or they come to my sport they are indispensable they push everybody to do their best you don't have to be the captain of the football team but be somebody who's recognized for their their commitment and their service uh last slide please all right finally these are all our socials please check us out here if you have any questions feel free to reach out to clarissa or anyone else at the staff and they can put you in contact with me or somebody who uh you know can help you at the naval academy and then finally guys the very last slide it's a picture of all the graduates throwing their caps up in the air i i was at one of these graduation ceremonies the energy there is so powerful i really do wish the best for all of you even if you don't come to the naval academy but i hope for all of you you get a chance to experience this moment it really is something special anyway guys i do want to turn it over now uh to the major so without further ado if uh major alexis jones could come on thank you thanks ben all right so good afternoon everybody my name is major alexis jones it's been mentioned i am a 2007 graduate of the united states military academy at west point i served on um active duty as a transportation corrosive for about five years and i'm currently serving in a reserve capacity um as a military academy liaison officer and in the field force supporting north carolina second district so for the next few minutes i want to talk to you about west point next slide please nate i apologize in advance for my cat that's about to jump on camera um so it's important to understand the west point experience you know what does it mean to you as a candidate what's my mission as we all know is to develop leaders of character this is not just about education this is um to develop you as a person so your leadership and your leadership skills as well and obviously we are a service academy so service the nation is inherent in what we do you're going to be asked to do selfless things you're going to be asked to put your personal priorities aside in order to help the team um this is just part of being a leader this is the things that you will be taught at west point in addition we will challenge you academically mentally physically we're going to push you to your limits and help you to find your boundaries and equip you to operate outside of your comfort zone these are great life skills to have and you're going to be able to develop these at west point next slide please all right so what does west point offer in addition to receiving a great education um we are ranked very highly you can see some of our accolades here on the slide and this is both amongst service academies and colleges across the country as well so obviously we've got a great program in place every year people are competing for and receiving notable achievements in academia next slide please so what we have here are the branch opportunities um that are available for you in active duty so the branches are listed in the white text as i mentioned earlier i commissioned as a transportation corps officer and these are the basic branches that you will initially commission into what's nice though is that with the army with the military academy there's a lot of flexibility in your career so the army is the largest branch of service um and so if for example you were commissioned into the transportation corps or infantry military intelligence you've got flexibility to change your branch and pursue a different branch if your passion changes or if you want to be like me and say transportation corps for your entire military life career you're able to do that as well um that there are points in your career where you're able to transition laterally into a different career field and so the subsequent career opportunities are highlighted in gold so for example we've got special forces civil affairs um being an attorney with jag data analytics et cetera there are numerous functional areas that are available to you to transition into next slide please so let's talk about west point in the campus in its history so if you're not familiar with the terrain the significance of west point i'm going to take a second to review that so during the american revolution uh the british forces felt that the hudson river which you can see on the right side of the screen of the slide there was of particular importance um they wanted to control the river in order to divide the colonies and give them a strategic advantage but george washington and the american forces decided that was not going to happen so they fortified west point um because of the unique bend in the river you can also see that in the the photo there that been in the river it made it really difficult for the british forces and the ships to navigate so ultimately west point was chosen as a great place to install artillery batteries and to extend the chain across the river in order to help prevent the british from controlling the hudson river so this helps shift the strategic balance of the favor of the american forces it's a very interesting and impactful history that west point stands on today you can also see from the picture that west point is a very dense campus your day starts in your barracks room and then whether you're going to class or to the mess hall to eat or to an athletic field um everything that you need is within a five to 15 minute walk from your barracks room so you're never waiting on a shuttle bus to get you across campus and class isn't ever going to be cancelled due to snow because you can walk everything is at your fingertips you're able to maximize your time on campus for training for development for what you came to west point to do next slide please let's talk about west point more generally um there is a legacy of leadership here um so the people on the slide are some notable grads of what's point um the experience on excuse me at west point is focused on equipping you with leadership skills this is broadly applicable to both your military career public and private sector service whatever your passion is you know having these leadership skills and this capability just allows you to achieve great things and i think you'd agree that many of the folks on the slide would say that development of their leadership started at west point next slide please all right so i just want to answer um a quick question a common question that we often get what does plebe mean what does a yearling mean or cow or fercy so when we say plea we're talking about a fourth class cadet or a freshman and then moving right along yearling or yuck is a third class cadet or a sophomore cow is a second class cadet or junior and then a first c is a first class cadet or senior next slide please let's talk about a normal and typical cadet day um so starting from the end um from 23 30 so about 11 30 at night until 5 20 in the morning cadets are not allowed out of their rooms um and then you know you when revelli comes you're allowed to leave your room and participate in comments pt or events or go to workout a lot of cadets like to get up and run early in the morning before classes start breakfast is about 6 57 in the morning um it is mandatory for plebes lunch is mandatory around noon for all cadets every day in the mess hall you'll sit in your designated seating area um morning classes excuse me you've got classes both before and after lunch as you can see there class and study time and that's important to note you know you might not have classes all day so depending on your class schedule you might have a few free hours to complete your homework during the day that way your evening study period or personal time is all personal time and no study time so as was mentioned earlier every cadet is an athlete at west point and at all service academies so you will play a sport um whether it's ncaa club or intramural um and so that's from about 1600 until 1800 and then of course we've got dinner at 1800 um dinner is buffet style every day it and it is optional except for thursdays thursdays is mandatory dinner or spirit dinner and then personal time in evenings as i mentioned before it's either evening study period or personal time depending on how much homework you've got and then 2300 23 30 would be taps and room check next slide please all right so the advantage of west point and other service academies we've got small classes this was highlighted before so i won't spend too much time here but this is true for most of your general education classes your core classes which will take your your previous gear as you move further into major classes the sizes if you can imagine are going to get even smaller so i was an engineering psychology major and my class sizes range from five to ten people and this was also touched on but all faculty are going to be subject matter experts so um their smes on their field they're always willing to help um you can email your teachers any time of the day or the night they're always there they're always looking for ways to help you have to ask just reach out next slide please okay so we've got 36 different academic majors as i mentioned before i was an engineering psychology major we also have 15 minors available next slide please what you see here is a typical class schedule this is year by year um so plea beer most of your classes as you can see there is a key or legend on the bottom there so all the classes in black are core or general education um plea beer is going to be mostly general education um your your with a little bit of military leadership mixed in and then um you'll see that your sciences are interchangeable depending on your major um yup year is when you will start to take some major courses and then cow year um more major courses and some electives and same on with first year you've got major classes general education classes et cetera next slide please when we talk about ncaa sports um common question that we get is hey how manageable is it to play an ncaa sport in addition to academics and you know the rigors of being at a service academy and the answer is it's doable if you manage your time well you will succeed i ran track at west point um it's it's possible next slide please here we've got our club sports um and intramural sports um for those not playing club or ncaa next slide please all right let's talk about the four-year military journey and this slide mostly focuses on the summers at west point so entry before your plebier is called cadet basic training at six weeks long you're gonna be learning the basics of becoming a soldier preparing you for west point uh before your yearling or yakier you've got um cadet field training which is four weeks long this is gonna be focused it's a little bit more tactical focus on advanced skill training before your cow in first year this is when the fun begins um your details are interchangeable so you've got options to choose between you've got uh cldt which is more advanced leadership training you've got ctlt where you have the ability to shadow a platoon leader for a few weeks in the field uh people are often really excited about that detail you've got your training details or you're able to leave cadets for cbt or cft or sle um and then you also have an iad which is similar to an academic internship um and you also have military iads such as aerosol airborne school etc so lots of options there i was able to knock out an iad and ctlt in addition to going to airborne air assault so next slide please okay so lots of broadening opportunities um we kind of talked on this in the last slide but um you do have the ability to go to different countries and study in different academies a question that we often get is hey do i have to be a language major in order to study abroad the answer is no you do not have to be a language major um there are a certain number of language classes that you do have to take but you do not need to be a language major in order to study abroad there are also a lot of iad or internship opportunities available as well next slide please let's talk quickly about admissions so um west point is looking for those who've demonstrated excellent academic ability in addition to leadership potential and your overall fitness so this this slide just talks about the architecture of your application we're looking at you as a whole person as a whole candidate so that's academic leadership and fitness and it's weighted differently for each criteria for example academics 60 of the weight right so we're looking at your high school gpa whether that's weighted or unweighted and your standardized test scores um the next bucket is leadership 30 um those four soes um the school official evaluations that are that need to be submitted for math english um a science either chemistry or physics an mpe um we also are looking at your extracurricular activities so your involvement outside of school we're looking to see if you are able to demonstrate excellence both inside and outside of the classroom and then finally interviews um this fills the gap between what's on your official transcript and then your application it gives us gives west point a better idea of who you are as a person what your interests are and why um your interests might be aligned to west point um and then finally the last bucket with your fitness you know we've got 10 weighted here um there are six concurrent events um ben touched on this and hit during his briefing so i'm not going to get into the events but um long story short you do have to pass these events and pass the cfa in order to get acceptance into west point and any of the service academy so take it seriously train for it um another thing to keep in mind that i'll point out is that it's the same test across all service academies so um if for example you're applying to more than one you don't need to take the cfa more than one time you are able to submit your scores from example for example west point into the air force academy and vice versa but just keep in mind that west point does require you to submit videos for your pull-ups and your push-ups so if you are planning to take the cfa for more than one academy um please make sure that you record those videos because westmont will require them your application deadline is the 31st of january um but please submit sooner if possible don't wait in the last minute we talked about brian talked about don merv and how long that process takes you do not want to be caught at the last minute um waiting to get cleared for dogmerm um and then miss the application deadline so just finish your application early the earlier the better the dogma process does take time reach out to myself any field course or a melo member here in the second district in order to get assistance if you have any questions and the more nominations you get the better all right so last slide i want to touch on is um thank you the um summer leadership experience so if you're high school junior or younger and you're interested in learning more about west point um we have a week-long experience hosted between your junior and senior year of high school so this does not count as a bonus or a penalty for your application it's just an opportunity for you to get to know west point better so you're able to stay in the barracks you will attend academic workshops it's a great experience that gives you a flavor of the cadet life and you're able to apply in january of your junior year and last slide please name thank you so hopefully you're already following us on social media um if not come on and join us on all the channels our handle is west point admissions thank you all for your time if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer them a little bit later in the breakout room and i will be followed by lieutenant commander wheeler from the united states merchant marine academy sure you're on mute about if i turn it on that might help them the merchant marine academy is a different animal than the dod schools doesn't mean that it's better doesn't mean that it's worse it just means that it's distinctly different we fall under the departmentation and we have several key differences um i'll try to go by the slides but i don't want to take up too much time try to stick to our 10 minutes we're located up in new york on long island about 15 miles east of new york city in what used to be william chrysler's estate it's right on long island sound next slide a lot of people wonder what uh merchant mariners do uh you must realize that you know there's no train tracks or uh anything like that that goes across the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean about 95 of the goods and services that come into this country and leave this country go by ship and congress way back in the 1930s realized that they needed to have competent and well-trained people working on these ships and so that was the original purpose behind the establishment of the merchant marine academy back in 1943 next slide you're going to earn a bachelor of science like the other schools one of the i'll throw in the difference here may pop up on another slide but it's a good place to bring it up here we have a y path here one is a civilian path that you're going to be allowed to choose and one is a military path that's a distinct difference from the other two if you choose the active duty path you can choose any branch of the service that you want for a direct commission just as if you graduated from a like service academy you can choose army navy air force coast guard or marine corps and you go straight to your next duty station for your next stage in training two-thirds of every class however choose to go into the civilian job market working since somewhere in the maritime industry uh it could be for exxon it could be for a port it could be for a harbor it could be on a ship lots of different opportunities i want to give one example here because i always like to throw money in there we had a young man who worked with admissions for quite a bit during his four years here he just graduated about seven weeks ago he went down to charleston south carolina and he registered for the maritime union workers union and i stayed in touch with him because he did do a lot with admissions 45 minutes after he was entered into the union computer he was hired by myers m-a-e-r-s-k one of the largest if not the largest container shipping companies in the world so i dug for more information and he says well they hired me for 277 77-day round trips goes from new jersey over to africa over to asia and then works its way back takes 77 days said they hired me for two consecutive 77 day trips we don't have to be a math major to realize that that's about five months 154 days i said what are you gonna what are they gonna pay you he said uh 114 000 for five months so about 22 000 a month right after graduation no college debt uh he doesn't even have to work for the rest of the year if he wants and if he makes a good name for himself that company will hire him probably on any of their 50 or 60 ships whenever he wants to work so two-thirds go that route not everybody's going to get a job like that but that's just a real-life example that just uh just happened uh the payback uh for the free education with us if you go active duty it's the five years that was previously mentioned if you get an assignment like a pilot's uh assignment that that respective service has a longer commitment because they're going to spend more money on you but the department of transportation is five years if you go the civilian route you must stay in the maritime business for a minimum of five years i always have to laugh at briefings where people think that that five years uh is a burden and i and i say so what do you plan on doing after five years are you just tired of making triple digit money uh you want to go do something else uh but you got to do it for five years you're going to earn an unlimited coast guard license here a master's certification which means you're you're qualified to work on any size ship and any horsepower ship you have to renew that at least once and you have a concurrent service commitment in the reserve component of your choice army navy air force coast guard or marine reserves you get to choose which one you want next slide we only have five majors here so we fall well below the others in that aspect and i would encourage everybody i'm not trying to sell you a used car or anything like that you if you don't think that you can thrive on these five majors and what they're ultimately going to give you at the end of your four years you should go to one of the other service academies or you should go to another private school or public school but you know if you want political science or psychology don't come here they're not going to add a major just for you we're division three in sports unlike the dod schools that are division one so if you assess your own athletic talent maybe you want to come and play baseball or basketball or something like that but you don't figure you're a division one talent you know maybe give us a consideration because then you can probably come here and play at a division three school and be and be in your competitive sport for uh for four years we are division one in in our waterfront sports of crew and offshore sailing as those are division one sports no matter where you are next slide uh see here this is another distinct aspect of our service academy one we're on the trimester system here not the semester system so three of your 12 trimesters that you're going to be at the merchant marine academy are spent at sea one entire academic year none of your first year none of your plebe years at sea none of your senior year is at sea but half the time that you are a sophomore and junior you're away from campus and you're working on ships ports harbors etc you're gaining real world real life experience so when you graduate that's one reason that young man was hired so quickly he has a master's certification from the coast guard and a year's worth of experience so he's head and shoulders above his peers so it's a very integral part we sent two two plebes two of your classmates uh including you uh on every assignment one is an engineering major and one is a marine transportation major and so you get to travel the world and uh and go with somebody that you know one of your classmates next slide uh the options i've already covered that i jumped ahead with the split in active duty and military next slide next slide it's all right next slide uh our window opens up on may 1st so we're about halfway through the application cycle like the other service academies our application ends on february 1st it's about 99 accomplished online uh and like the other schools we could probably all say that we're all looking for almost exactly the same kind of individual i mean if you have 1600 on the sat you're a very smart person but if you if that's all you've done you're probably not necessarily what any of the service academies want because they're looking for leadership potential uh the and the potentially to lead people not only in combat but in business etc and so on so you know we're looking for well-rounded individuals so there's no use going over that the on the website it has our four different regions we have a pretty small manpower we have four regional admissions officers i happen to be the red the southeast from west virginia down to louisiana so i would cover your territory feel free to drop in on the breakout room and email or call anytime that you want that concludes mine and i'll pass it on to lieutenant winfrey yes sir thank you uh like you said i'm lieutenant winfrey i'm going to be talking to you about the air force academy i'm the air force academy admissions officer for north and south carolina slide please um just a little bit about myself waiting for that slide to move sorry maybe it's me there we go um i'm originally from san antonio texas i just graduated from the air force academy in may of 2021 so i'm a fresh lieutenant um i majored in behavioral science and minored in religion studies at the academy some things that i did while i was at the academy i was a soaring instructor pilot so that's a glider to the right of that that i flew i also played club basketball so next to the glider that's my team i was part of the recreational ski and snowboarding club and then i also ran the american sign language club for a little bit some things i like to do on my off time snowboarding driving my jeep around the air force academy is located in colorado springs and it's a great place to go drive up into the mountains after this i'll be doing this admissions for about a year but after this i'll be going to pilot training so just to look at those pictures really quickly the picture beneath the pilot trainee um those are t-38s and i got to get a ride in the t-38 down uh at randolph air force base in san antonio um and that was after my sophomore year so it's a great opportunity beneath that that's uh there's a picture of me jumping into some really cold water but it's an air force academy tradition to jump in the fountains after you've finished your last assignment um of your cadet career um to the right of that that's me and my friends at a football game next to that one that's another air force academy tradition where you hit your class ring on your class crest after the seniors have graduated and they swap out the crests and then that last picture right there is just me after graduation with my new new butter bars slide please so just to talk about what makes the air force academy different from all the other service academies it's the air space and cyberspace opportunities that we have all four years um so the top left you can see that's the the jump program so it's a guy free falling and using a parachute to get back down um you get free excuse me five solo free fall jumps um to get your jump your jump wings excuse me um and it's the only place in the world where your first jump is going to be solo so after a lot of hours of training you get to jump out of that plane solo on your first your first jump beneath that is our uas that's our unbanned aerial system program which is where you learn everything about drones and how to operate them as well and then you get to do that in the top middle that's one of our um powered flight programs that's actually our our uh our flying team if you have any previous hours before um coming to the air force academy you get the opportunity to try out and fly for our flying team we also have a second powered program which is more of an introduction so for anybody who's interested in flying but has never flown before it's a great opportunity to learn the basics and and see if they really enjoy flying and want to make a career out of it at the end of that program you actually get the opportunity to solo the aircraft as well beneath that that's our cyber so in cyber you'll learn a lot about uh hacking security and how to do some coding as well to the right of that that's a rocket obviously air force academy doesn't have its own rocket um but that's just to show our space operations um and there you'll get to learn the physics of satellites uh do some real life command and control and then during satellite passes you also get data from them as well now at the bottom right that is a glider that i mentioned before for any of you that don't know a glider is a plane that doesn't have an engine so it attaches to another plane and that plane will pull it up into the air and it will release and do all the normal things a plane should do this you get 10 flights and at the end of that you get the opportunity to solo fly the aircraft as well and then after that program you also get the opportunity to become an instructor pilot which means that you're going to teach the younger cadets how to fly um so the air force academy actually produces the youngest instructor pilots in the world so i was an instructor pilot by the time i was 19 which is pretty crazy slide please i'll move on to talk about a little bit more of the air force academy as a whole um there's three tenants that we like to focus on for all four years in order to develop the character and leadership necessary to become a good air force officer so the first one is academics then we have athletics and military slide please starting with academics here's a list of our majors and minors and like everybody else said you're going to get a bachelors of science regardless of what you major in so you're just going to get a very well-rounded education while still getting to specialize in what you're passionate about one thing that i do want to note is that because the air force academy currently is the only commissioning source for the space force um we have been coming out with some new majors and minors uh specifically geared towards space so right now the newest ones in the engineering column you can see we have space operations um that's new and then the minor on underneath the social sciences we have space warfighting so obviously those aren't necessary or required in order to commission into the space force but if that's something that you would be interested in it's going to be a great opportunity to get involved to put yourself in a good position for that next slide please moving on to athletics um everybody else has been saying it as well so i won't harp on it too much um but every cadet is going to participate in one of three levels the d1 intercollegiate club which is d2 or d3 and then uh intramural which means that it's just some friendly competition um between squadrons um and then every cadet is also going to participate in at least one pe course every semester slide please um the other thing that cadets are going to have every semester is the physical fitness test and the aerobic fitness test pft and aft the pft is a series of workouts that you would do in sequence and then the aft is a mile and a half run and so those are every semester like i said unless you get above a 400 it's out of 500 and if you get above a 400 you can validate and be exempt from taking it the next semester next slide please [Music] for the military aspect of it it starts with basic cadet training like the other service academies it's six weeks long the first three weeks are going to be located at the dorms where you learn the basics and then the second three weeks will be out at jacks valley with more rigorous and intense training that's only the beginning of the four years um and so the the military training throughout the four years is gonna evolve and look different as you take on different leadership roles and and get involved in different uh different military aspects slide please um looking at the career fields we have about 35 different career fields right now uh that are available to uh academy graduates 50 of our graduates actually end up going to pilot training 10 percent will commission into the space force and then another 10 percent will end up going to graduate school fully funded by the air force slide please [Music] looking particularly at air force career opportunities the left column those are going to be the jobs that are longer than a five-year commitment and that's just because of the extra training that is required for it in the center column that's going to be five-year commitment with no specific degree required so regardless of what you choose to major in you can get any one of these jobs graduating from the academy and then on the right that's a five-year commitment with a specific degree so if you want to become an engineer you're going to have to major in in some engineering course which makes sense uh one thing i will point out it's a very common question pilot does not require any uh specific degree so if you want to become pilot you are allowed to do what you want uh what you're passionate in and still get a pilot slot so i was a behavioral science major and i got a pilot slot so you can do it next slide please now particularly for the space force as you can see there's a lot less job opportunities for the space force and that's just because uh the space force is more operational and they don't have those support jobs um so right now this is what we can commission into the space force with uh acquisition space operator cyberspace intelligence and engineering next slide please so how to get started uh just go to academyadmissions.com and click apply now i'm not going to talk through the whole application it's pretty similar to the other service academies but it'll start with a pre-candidate questionnaire and that opens up for juniors march 1st so have that on your radar juniors or seniors you can get that going already for you juniors as well there's a summer seminar that's an opportunity to go and visit the air force academy um that the application for that will open december to january of this coming year and then uh future falcon that's an opportunity for those of you who are younger even starting like sixth grade up um to get involved and to see what's going on with the air force academy and those can all be found at academyadmissions.com slide please just the last thing guys i think there was a slide before that maybe not okay maybe not that's okay um that's all i have oh okay there we go um i just wanted to point out some of these numbers because we start off with a lot of applicants at 11 000 um and the for the class of 24 we had 1100 so looking at that biggest drop from the candidate pool to the qualified candidates um don't be intimidated by it because the biggest reason that drop is so large is because uh students don't finish their application so any application to of any of the service academies is going to be tedious and long but it's doable so just finish it and give yourself the best running chance um one thing that we like to say at air force academy admissions is that you must complete to compete so start that application if you're interested finish that application and give yourself the best chance you can and maybe we'll see you in a future class slide that is all i have for you if you have any questions my contact information is there or you could scan the qr code and that will pull up my contact on your phone if you want to save it and then if you want me to elaborate on anything that you heard just ask in the in the chat after in the breakout rooms afterwards for now i will hand it over to miss clarisse oakland to close us out

CONSTRUCTION ANNOUNCED A SURPRISE HEARING. JOINING US NOW TO SHARE THE LATEST, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. THANKS FOR JOINING US. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> DAN BELLES MONTE VISTA HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE YOU GRANTED -- GRADUATED FROM. YOU LEAD THE FIRST TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL. TODAY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE INVOLVEMENT. WERE NO MORE SCHEDULED HEARINGS UNTIL JULY. WHAT IS THIS HEARING TOMORROW ABOUT? >> WE ORIGINALLY HAD A COUPLE OF HEARINGS WE HAD PLANNED TO DO THIS WEEK THAT WE PUT OFF UNTIL JULY. WE HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD A HEARING TOMORROW WITH SOME LATEBREAKING INFORMATION, SOME NEW EVIDENCE, WHICH I CANNOT GO INTO. PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO ADJUST OUR SCHEDULE DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES. >> I KNOW YOU CAN'T TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT TOMORROW, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD ALREADY BE CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC? >> I THINK WHAT SHOULD BE CLEAR IS THAT JANUARY 6 WAS NOT A DAY IN ISOLATION. IT WAS THE VIOLENT CALM ON THE ELATION -- CULMINATION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. WHEN THAT FAILED, PRESSURANT THE VICE PRESIDENT -- PRESSURING THE VICE PRESIDENT. EVEN PUT IN IN PLACE AND AN EXPERIENCED ATTORNEY TO CLAIM THERE WAS FRAUD SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. WHEN ALL ELSE FAILED, YOU HAD JANUARY 6 AND THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL TO STOP THE VOTE COUNT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO SEE ALL OF THAT EVIDENCE. >> TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT RULED A SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO PREVENT THE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH FROM PRAYING ON THE FIELD AFTER GAMES. LAST WEEK, BUT WE COULD RULED THE STATE OF MAINE CANNOT EXCLUDE RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS FROM GETTING PUBLIC FUNDING. THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY THIS IS A FURTHER BLURRING OF THE LINE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT? >> I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY THE CASE. THIS VERY RIGHT WING SUPREME COURT HAS A SOCIAL AGENDA. THEY ARE OVERTURNING DECADES OF SETTLED LAW WHEN IT COMES TO SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. WE HAVE TRIED TO SINCE THE FOUNDERS SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE, BOTH TO PROTECT THE STATE AND TO PROTECT RELIGION. HERE, THE SUPREME COURT IS BLURRING THAT LINE AND SAYING CERTAIN PRACTICES WHICH THE COURT HAS STRUCK DOWN. THEY ARE DISREGARDING THAT. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE FEARED, THAT IT WOULD NOT ADHERE TO PRESIDENT AND ADVANCE A VERY CONSERVATIVE AND RELIGIOUS AGENDA. >> WHAT CAN DEMOCRATS DO? SOME ABORTION RIGHTS SUPPORTERS ARE CRITICIZING DEMOCRATS FOR NOT FIGHTING LIKE HELL, SOME WOULD SAY. THAT THEY WANT YOU OR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO MORE. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? >> IN MY VIEW, DEMOCRATS SHOULD GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER. THAT WAY, WE CAN MAKE ROE V. WADE THE LAW OF THE LAND. THERE IS A PRO-CHOICE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. THEN WE COULD CODIFY ROW AND THE SUPREME COURT COULD NOT ANYTHING ABOUT IT. TO ME, WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH CARE OF WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY? CERTAINLY NOT THIS OLD SENATE RULE. I AGREE, IF FIGHT LIKE HELL MEANS GETTING RID OF THIS OLD PRACTICE. IN TERMS OF OTHER RULES OF THE COURT, THOSE ARE LESS DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS. -- MORE DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS BY STATUTE. THE REMEDY IS TO EXPAND THE SIZE OF THE COURT. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. YOU ARE JEWISH. JEWISH LAW HOLDS ABORTION IS REQUIRED IF NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE PERSON'S PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH. GIVEN TODAY'S RULING, DO YOU THINK THE COURT WOULD AFFIRM THE RIGHT OF JEWISH FAITH IN STATES THAT BAN IT? >> THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN'S MOST DIFFICULT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BY THE WOMAN. IT SHOULD NOT BE MADE BY STATE LEGISLATORS, MOSTLY MEN DECIDED FOR WOMEN WHAT THEY OUGHT TO DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK IT IS ABHORRENT AND DANGEROUS, BECAUSE THEY WILL PUT THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF WOMEN AND OTHERS AT RISK. I THINK WOMEN SHOULD MAKE THEIR DECISIONS. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPEAKING

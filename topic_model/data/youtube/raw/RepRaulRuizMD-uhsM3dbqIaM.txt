thank you secretary becerra it is good to see you my friend thank you for being here today i know that the administration as a whole and you personally hold health equity as a top priority i appreciate all the work that you have done on this front and i look forward to continuing to work together on policies that address this critical issue as someone who grew up in coachella and then later practiced medicine there in the coachella valley in the district i represent i saw firsthand the very real effects that health access disparities like physician shortages have on the health of underserved populations i came to congress to fight for health equity and to level the playing field so that people have the same access to affordable health care regardless of where they live or how much money they make a shortage of health care providers is one of the biggest challenges to health care access that we face and the outlook is not good according to research by the association of american medical colleges by 2034 we will have a shortage of up to 124 000 physicians that shortage is most pronounced in underserved areas and that is why we need to make sure that we are increasing provider access in the areas that need it most i recently met with regional leaders from eastern coachella valley in imperial county two of the most underserved areas of california to discuss healthcare challenges that our areas face and we must ensure that these areas do not get left behind that is why i've been a long time advocate of the teaching health center program which gets more providers in underserved areas not only are physicians who train in community health centers more likely to practice in underserved areas it also generates a more diverse workforce in underserved areas because of the program's success congress has allocated increased funding over the years to expand the program however one of the biggest challenges that the program has faced is uncertainty over funding which relies on short-term reauthorization from congress that makes planning difficult which in turn makes it harder to expand and recruit residents given the workforce shortages that we are facing across this country we need to robustly support this program and this committee has shown bipartisan support throughout the years on this issue i have worked with ranking member mcmorris rogers over several years to lead legislation on this issue and i was thrilled when chairman pallone introduced legislation last year to permanently fund and expand the program secretary becerra do you support teaching health center program parity with medicare gme which is permanently authorized and funded as well as expansion of the program beyond what was authorized in the american rescue plan congressman you first great to see you and uh thank you for all your work but on this issue of uh community health centers and allowing them to be the teaching centers as well you had me at hello it is indispensable to allow these health centers quality health centers that are providing care to some of the least able to afford it with the capacity to build and providing them with the workforce the next generation of doctors through the gme funding but doing it specifically for these community health centers is uh is not only a smart thing to do but it's the right thing to do so absolutely we look forward to working with you and others and you'll see in the president's budget we make a commitment both in the mandatory allocation and in the discretionary allocation to continue to grow the workforce through these community through these community health centers thank you i fell in love with patient care at a community health center when i was a freshman a pre-med student in undergrad now i'm going to change gears a little here i wanted to ask about an issue that i am hearing about regarding workforce issues at cms call centers specifically that workers at two of the call centers that operate cms's customer service lines went on strike last month we cannot be in a situation where these crucial services for seniors are disrupted can you commit that cms will work with me in good faith to ensure that there are not work stoppages that will lead to service disruptions congress we commit to work with you to try to address some of these issues thank you it's very important for the seniors in my district uh it's very important to the workers that provide good services uh and we want to make sure that they have a fair shot and that our seniors get the best service that they can possibly get and so i appreciate your time i appreciate the work that you have done especially during the pandemic we've seen access to vaccine disparities dissolve within hispanic communities thanks to your excellent work and i commend you and the administration on the work that you're doing on health equity thank you i yield back

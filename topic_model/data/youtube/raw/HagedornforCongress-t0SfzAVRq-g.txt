good morning Jim Hagedorn how's it going this morning not great thank you for having us it's going great we're in Winona today meaning what with what we call thought leaders and we're happy to be here at the station well the one who found his way out here on kW know a.m. he was looking for a thought leader no that's funny well we really appreciate Jim he adores time if you don't remember Jim he's had some campaigns in the past just two years ago you just narrowly got beaned by Tim Walz on the Democratic side yeah we Minnesota's first district we surged to forty nine point six percent of the vote in 2016 against congressman Walz we kept going he's out now running for governor yeah and so the seats open and it's the best pickup opportunity in the nation for the Republican Party well I tell you what you're running a good campaign so far how do the polls look so far because I was looking at your website Jim Hagedorn dad o RG if folks want to look at more about Jim and the issues and where he stands you can check that out what it looks like you're doing pretty well in the polls so far well by and large things I think are setting up nicely for us but we did conduct a poll recently of Republicans and independents here in southern Minnesota and it showed us far ahead of our only GOP competitor but we take nothing for granted we keep working and we're here today just the other just last week we run way in a western side of the district you know this is the kind of the i-90 district goes from here all the way to South Dakota and then Iowa up about 80 miles right in the middle fair ball New Prague would be the kind of the middle the top of the district so just happy to be here and shaking hands in in Winona well excellent we're talking Jim Hagedorn Republican candidate for Congress for Minnesota's first District so let's get to some of the issues that you think are gonna be foremost on people's mind coming up this fall well you know obviously the economy and people are by and large I think are happy with that tax bill that Republicans and president Trump passed recently it's a good start as I tell people it was more of a business tax cut try to bring some of that money from around the world back into the United States put it to work keep helping with wages and opportunities so I think by and large there was a Trump bump as they call after the election that's continued the economy seems to be moving in the right direction in general but this is an egg-based district you know it's a some of the best farmland and in the world great the livestock owners and everything agribusinesses a lot of a lot of our commodities for flow right out of the port here and and right down the river so you know farmers some of them have been in a recession for four or five years been low commodity prices high input costs Obama care spent a real tax on some of our farmers and so we need somebody like myself that wants to be on the AG committee go out there and promote farming agriculture sustaining our rural communities that's that's what I'm all about I'll tell you why this is gonna be pretty incredible race and it's a very vital as you mentioned the midterm elections is that home between the presidential elections this is gonna be determining a long way this seat in itself because it's been Tim Walz has been in office for quite some time and it held that for the DFL yeah congressman walz been in office for 12 years prior to that congressman Guttentag alguna who supports us he he was in for 12 years and before that it was Tim penny for 12 years this is kind of a 12 year seat but you know these midterms are setting up pretty interesting people always ask how does President Trump play in your district down there in southern Minnesota and I tell them even the Star Tribune poll showed the president's favorability in southern Minnesota at 60% and by and large the people who voted for Donald Trump in the last election they want those policies that he ran unto Beast is successful BMA implemented so this race sets up is kind of a clear contrast the Liberal Democrats trying to replace congressman Walz they want to replace resist the president they want to take us back to the Obama policies and then some which were far to the left and rebuked and I'm on the other side I want to partner with the president be a conservative reinforcement out there in the US House to keep making these big changes to move our country in the right direction to keep America safe to make America prosperous with high wage jobs to protect our god-given rights and for the me that means the right to life the right to keep and bear arms the right to religious freedom and then sustain agriculture and our rural communities our rural way of five excellent we're talking this morning with Jim Hagedorn and again his website is Jim hanging our dot o-r-g and one thing I've grown to learn a lot more about Jim in the last year hosting in the know on kiddo you know our Veterans issues we air some programming over the weekend on the station Minnesota military radio and front lines of freedom and we've had some folks in from American Legion and Jim Craig ler a Vietnam vet who had a mission of Honor paddling up and down the Mississippi River so I've become a lot more in tune and what they have dealt with and so what might you add because I know you know we've been talking about ways in order to improve medical services and opportunities for veterans first of all you know our heroes go over and fight in our Wars and they they're trained up and ready to go into battle at the call the president and others and and we really respect and admire the service that they provide to our country and and when they're finished when they retire they deserve the the benefits they were promised and in many ways I think that there's been too many veterans that have slipped through the cracks and what I propose is that all veterans should have the choice of their doctor and hospital if that's the private sector or if that's at the VA I think they deserve that that option and so that's something I stand for and I think most the people in southern Minnesota would like to see that implemented do you think that you think you get some bipartisan support for something like that well you know they've taken kind of a half step out there when when during the Obama administration and these problems that were not you know totally with mr. Obama there have been problems with the VA for many years but when when veterans were basically abused by the government were mistreated and some of them unfortunately passed away because the government turned its back the Congress stepped up and said maybe we should allow people who live a little bit further from VA hospitals to have choice the choice program has had its problems it's a very bureaucratic there I guess they're trying to work those things out but I think it just needs to be expanded further and that each each veteran go out there and choose the doctor in hospital their choice get the kid they deserve and need and and I think the taxpayers would be happy to do that for our veterans well good know for talking this morning for a few more minutes with Jim Hagedorn Republican candidate for Congress for Minnesota's first District hoping to get the nomination do you is there gonna be any type of how does that process work what are you gonna do you gonna know for sure well it's yeah it's good point in the Republican Party and the Democrats as well we have an endorsement process in Minnesota so on February 6 we just had precinct caucuses now our delegates have been elected to County conventions they're meeting I believe the Winona County GOP convention is in about a week or so on a Saturday and we're looking forward to that we'll be back in town to speak there and then from that point in Mankato on April 21st the Republican Party will select its nominee we believe that we're in a pretty strong position to win that endorsement and from there there's a primary in August in the general election and we we feel in our campaign I mean we worked very hard last year we went and walked 50 parades and went to all 21 County Fair is made hundreds of stops we have all sorts of people from the Republican Party national state and district behind us we raised over half a million dollars more by far more than anyone else in the race so we're in a really strong position to take back the seat and we just seek you seek people's support and we ask them to join our campaign well we appreciate Jim hang it on its time and I would be remiss I suppose Jimmy mentioned earlier and one of your kind of your ear or your comments about the right to bear arms I guess I would be remiss with the today's today's world the tragedies that befall our nation way too often with school shootings and I know governor Dayton I haven't had the time yet in the past 24 hours to read everything that he released here in Minnesota governor Dayton came out with his safer schools and security plan on Thursday morning mid morning what do you think Congress can can I can do some people seem to think at least if you believe social media some people seem to think if you pass a certain law that it will all will be Nirvana and there will never be another horrible shooting again you know that seems pretty unrealistic but it does seem like there might be some steps to take to me not only kids but everybody what would you say about that well I'm a strong proponent of the Second Amendment I start with that and I believe that the it is the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms and to use those firearms for self-protection and other lawful purposes that having been said you know the databases that we use so some of these systems the background checks could they be updated and improved to make sure that people with mental illness or people who are have criminal intentions shouldn't be allowed to receive weapons absolutely we have to do things of that nature I've said for many years the school district should have the option of of training and arming people to be inside the schools to have concealed carry or whatever however they would like to structure it to make sure that if there is an incident there's at least someone hopefully multiple people on-site that can go in there and keep that person at bay until law enforcement can get there and arrive and handle the situation but should we harden the schools and so forth protections I think a lot of the districts are already doing those types of things I hope they'll continue but we all mourn the loss of life it's a tragic deal I'm just one of those that doesn't believe that more gun control laws is going to stop the premeditated acts of evil and deranged people I think by and large we have to defend our rights in Minnesota interesting situation just reported by one of you're one of the network's here in the state firearms ownership in Minnesota is at an all-time high concealed carry permits in Minnesota at an all-time high and yet violent crimes in Minnesota at a 50-year low and to me that that that shows that good people acting responsibly do make a difference and I think that's what we we need and I'm happy in Minnesota that that's what's happening well Jim we really appreciate Jim hanger-ons time this morning Republican candidate for Congress Minnesota's first District and we would be happy to have you back on if you get the endorsement in April towards the end of April April 21st and you said that's gonna be held in Mankato yes the Verizon senator Mankato we really appreciate the opportunity it's nice boys chat on the phone as well if it's more convenient I know you guys were in Winona for we travel the district we love to come in the studio here we really appreciate your time I really do this was my first opportunity I think we'd met a time or two before in the past several years ago but on one of your first campaigns but first chance I've had to talk to what to Jim and anything else you want to say in closing no we're just again we're here in town to meet with folks who met with the mayor and some others and just trying to figure out what's going on in the ground here it seems like things in Winona we're in the right direction this city is just fabulous this is I think you're number 11 for me but because of the show and the format is so different than it used to be or at least it's it's not so much different it's just as expanded that we're airing and getting so many great people in the the arts for Winona a year after your district not just Winona cuz we got to include Rochester with the arts as well cuz they've kind of vibrant arts but to be fair to Winona they're a lot bigger than we are sighs oh my goodness there is a lot going on here and you have some wonderful businesses and then people who have given back to the community and I think it's it it's it's it's a really neat spot well we appreciate Jim Hagedorn Stein good luck with the campaign sir and we will talk to you soon thank you

hello I'm dina Titus your representative from the first congressional district I want to applaud all of you for celebrating women's health issues at today's summit I chose to work on the VA committee for many of the very same reasons that you all are here today the world must recognize that women's health care issues our veterans health care issues and that today's VA is clearly not your grandfather's VA the VA Amos changes our military and veteran population changes with the times women veterans are often referred to as hidden veterans or silent veterans because they're less likely to take advantage of va services or even think of themselves as veterans and the VA has failed them they were not a priority for the VA for many years but these women don't know about programs that are available and many of the programs were geared towards men some of our clinics don't provide privacy there's a shortage of OB gyns at VA clinics and they're very few studies of women with PTSD even prosthesis are fitted for men's bodies not women's according to the VA women make up the nation's fastest growing group within the veteran population there were less than 160,000 female veterans 16 years ago now there are over two million women who have served this country they make up at least ten percent of the veteran population and more than half have a service-connected disability these are women who sacrifice their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and the gulf war in Vietnam they served honorably in World War two and they are members of the nation's greatest generation these are also women who face the same health risk as the civilians that they have defended when you take off the uniform and return to civilian life that doesn't mean you should ever have to be alone or without help the VA and other community partners can offer women's health program managers primary care physicians mental health services preventive care and specialty treatments they can help to schedule mammograms and pap smear or defend against preventable diseases like diabetes and health disease the community is also here to help serve our veterans suffering from PTSD and military sexual trauma in a way that works for women so if you have any questions you need advice or you just some want someone to talk to my office is here to help you know I recently saw a t-shirt that read any girl can wear high heels but it takes a woman to put on combat boots so whether you defended our country or you work to help veterans I want to thank you for your service and let you know that the doors to my office are always will open

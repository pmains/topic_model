hi I'm Lori Trahan today I want to talk about the women and young girls in republican-controlled States who have had their Reproductive Rights cruelly and systematically Stripped Away s that women have cherished for half a century thanks to the efforts of our mothers and our grandmothers in the eight months since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade over 20 states have moved to limit access to abortion care 12 states have implemented near total bans and in many of those States women could face criminal penalties for seeking reproductive care out of state in Wisconsin and North Dakota abortion care is completely unavailable to women and young girls no exceptions and in five other states Republicans have sought took her tail abortion care earlier and earlier while two other bands are currently held up in court in total 70 million women and girls have less of a right over their own body today than they did just one year ago they now have to navigate a complex legal landscape made up of different state laws that in some cases anti-abortion lawmakers can't even fully explain and the result has been severe damage to women's health and well-being with many women being forced to face life-threatening complications while their doctors try to determine their own legal liability if they provide care in Ohio a woman named Christina was bleeding so much from her miscarriage that she had to get in a bathtub to avoid making too much of a mess when she finally made it to the emergency room she was denied care and discharged from the hospital before she even got home she began bleeding again in Texas a woman named Amanda was told she was going to lose her daughter in the womb there was nothing they could do to save her despite Her diagnosis her doctor discharged her telling Amanda they couldn't do anything for her until she went into labor and gave birth to a stillborn baby or until she developed an infection that risked her life took three days for her to become Sick Enough for the ethics board at her local hospital to determine she could legally receive life-saving care the scar tissue from the delay in care forced her to undergo another surgery and the infection she developed could jeopardize her ability to have kids in the future I want to be clear what's happening to these women is wrong it's wrong that a doctor has to deny treatment to a woman with an ectopic pregnancy until it ruptures it's wrong to force a woman to develop sepsis so that her life is in enough Jeopardy to avoid a lawsuit and it's wrong for a hospital to tell a woman experiencing a traumatic miscarriage that she has to pass the pregnancy tissue at home in a bloody bathtub now I recognize there are Republican elected officials here in Congress and across our country who hear these harrowing stories and agree that this shouldn't be happening and I know there's a fear that supporting legislation like the Women's Health protection act May mean the end of their career in Republican politics so I want to take a moment to speak directly to them if you won't join us to codify abortion rights work with us to at a minimum make sure women and their health care providers can navigate the laws in place today I just introduced the info for Reproductive Care Act to ensure women know what their State's laws mean for their reproductive health I introduced it so women don't have to go hours or days waiting for a hospital lawyer to decide what care they can receive and I introduced it so women know if their home state can try to put them in jail if they have to seek abortion care elsewhere these are basic things that 70 million women deserve to know that they need to know so work with us compel members of your party to come to the table to pass this legislation before any other woman has to experience what Christina went through or what Amanda was forced to endure this is the absolute least we should be able to do

it's been a little over a week since House Democrats stage that very dramatic sit-in over the issue of gun control congressman brad Sherman was right in the middle of it and here he is a matter of fact we are here occupying this floor not because we're stopping business but because they're stopping business the business of this house is to express find the current should recognize that this should be a debate in the formal house this microphone should order should apply and then we should have the bone congressman brad Sherman good morning too so we're watching this theater in this theater they shut you down to killed you Mike that took you off of c-span went on periscope since man picked up periscope it was in some ways an exercise in democracy had a lot of fun did you accomplish anything at all we accomplished a lot in the area of public opinion and maybe a little bit about house procedure we're talking about it and had we not done what we did on the House floor we'd be talking about something else so the country is now focused on the fact that if you're on the list of people were concerned about for terrorism to the point where we deprive you of your ability to fly on an airplane then we shouldn't let you buy a gun but then there needs to be a way to get off that list at another time that'd be a slam dunk this wouldn't even be a controversial issue but I want to ask you because you you you're friendly with people on the other side somewhat it seems that there are people who agree with you but can't take a stand because they come from districts you guys are running for office every two years as soon as you're elected you're running again they're afraid of being outed in their particular community by people more conservative than that what do you say to them well one practical problem we have is that if we're going to prevent people who are on the terrorist list from buying guns then we also have to close the gun show loophole because if you if you say if you're on this list you can't buy or there's going to be a 72 hour delay that means when you you have to buy at a place where they've got the computer and they sent it may check to see whether you're on the list almost all gun shows they don't even check the list that you show up so it's a bigger deal than to say no fly no bye it's basically close the gun show loophole and make sure felons can't buy either so um I I think I think there are colleagues who would vote for us on a secret ballot bicycle ballast but what we will probably pass is the corn and Bill I'm not even sure that that passes because I don't think it will have a democratic support which can't work because it doesn't close the dead children well let's talk about that because lawmakers are on a break now you're here through the fourth of july in your district you're going to go back to Washington Paul Ryan's going to call for a vote it's a measure that is backed by the NRA so so how can you stand up for that we will probably take action and we're trying to develop exactly what to do now to demand a vote on something that would actually work that is to say a bill that will say if you're on the terrorist list you can't buy a gun and also that when air wherever you're buying a gun they're checking to see whether you're on the terrorist list and also whether you're a felon and whether we get that vote I don't know but our efforts so far have forced them to give us a vote on a bad a bill that wouldn't work maybe we can go from there are people who say you represent the sign that really wants to do away with the Second Amendment and your response to that is I don't want to do away with the Second Amendment it's in the Constitution we've got hunters all over the country we've got people who want to defend their homes and we just want to keep guns out of the hands of felons and out of the hands of terrorists and I do want to emphasize there's got to be a way not just for purchasing a gun but for being able to board an airplane that people can get their name off list there are lots of people on this list very few of them are Americans but some of the Americans that are on the lash okay before you go back into the traffic before you go this Loretta Lynch situation would Bill Clinton obviously you support Hillary Clinton to a lot of people they use the word optics this looks bad what is your response to this I think Loretta Lynch made the right response by jacek Lee taking her out herself out of the decision-making process she's leaving this to the FBI director and she's leaving this to the long time civil servants in her department and I would ordinarily the Attorney General would be involved in that decision but I think as a result of the optics so you actually get a system that may have even more credibility right but what if you have a split decision coming from her people she's the decider that so it then it becomes our decision it's not like the Supreme Court where you do have an assistant secretary you do have an office director and I think these people who have worked for the state for the Justice Department for a long time we'll make a decision that would have more credibility than Loretta Lynch would have had even if she had intended all right and then quickly holiday weekend obviously we're coming off of the turkey attack are we making progress against Isis where do you see that quick answer we're making slow progress well it obviously not progress between now and the fourth of July we need to be a bit more aggressive in our bombing because our rules of engagement are preventing us from hitting targets that we need to hit congressman Sherman thank you so much for braving the 405 it's 750 right now coming up

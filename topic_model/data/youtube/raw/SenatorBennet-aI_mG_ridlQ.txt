uh thank you Madam Secretary for being here today I I want to ask you a couple questions about the farm bill but I do want to note how pleased I am that we secured nearly 14 billion dollars in the inflation reduction act for Rural clean energy programs at USDA including nearly 10 billion dollars for Rural Electric cooperatives that funding is going to be incredibly important to help cooperatives and other entities across rural Colorado and the in the country transition to clean energy and lower energy costs for rural families and you know I think it's critical that USDA Implement these programs swiftly and effectively while ensuring that funds can be used in Creative flexible ways for the greatest benefit for our rural communities I think this is one of the biggest opportunities that's in the inflation reduction act and I um and I just want to call everybody's attention to that today I wanted to mention something that you also mentioned uh in your opening remarks from from April to October of this year I hosted 26 Farm Bill listening sessions across Colorado and one consistent comment I heard over and over and over again was from rural community leaders businesses and farmers and ranchers of all sizes was the difficulty in accessing USDA programs including rural development grants these grants are exceedingly burdensome for coloradans to access we should not expect rural leaders businesses farmers and ranchers to spend hundreds of hours filling out federal applications for Grants what you mentioned this in in your opening remarks a little bit I just wonder what you can do and what we can do to make sure that the next Farm Bill listening sessions are about something other than the difficulty of access accessing these programs could you just describe in more detail what you're doing thank you for the chance to get into these details because it is uh it's a lot to untangle how do we it's easy to say we need more uh easier access to our programs then you've got we've got to peel back that onion and say what does it take to do that so we've seen some good examples so we're about to finalize a community facilities rule that should make some application systems easier we're also investing in a new system for a new technology uh for our single-family housing application so that's like the lowest resourced applicant right someone who's applying for an affordable home loan and changing the technology application should make the uh make it easier so they're not having to do it all written by hand can you imagine applying for a mortgage written by hand uh being able to do it on a platform will make it easier to self-populate some of that work in reconnect over the the four rounds that we've seen so far we've seen dramatic Improvement in terms of how our maps are working and interfacing and we've heard good responses from folks about those improvements the next thing that we need to do and I think the farm bill is a great opportunity to do that is to go through what are the statutory requirements that actually make an application harder and and I would happily provide any technical assistance you might have questions for that in doing that we might also identify sometimes it's our fault it's regulations that are making it harder and finding ways to address that and and maybe looking at thresholds right if it's under a certain amount recognizing that we have to balance risk as a lender maybe if it's under a certain cost we can make certain applications easier so I think there are a lot of tools that we can use to do this but it's going to take getting our hands dirty and getting into the detail I mean I wonder whether it would make sense or if it really is the interaction of what is in legislation and what is regulatory which I'm sure it is I mean it I'm not the chair of this committee but I you know it would seem to me that putting some of your folks together and some of our folks together in a room to actually figure out what that looks like and what a set of targets might be for us to be able to reduce the paperwork reduce the hours that are spent on this I mean none of this none of this is productive and and in the years that I've been on the committee it's never gotten better um so I think we'd like to make it better and anything you can do Senator please if I could offer a friendly amendment to that also including technical assistance providers so the folks who are currently filling out the applications and saying that's wrong that's people in our state and area offices it's also uh you know non-profits who are helping folks apply for some of these things they they can Redline the applications and I think they need to be part of this discussion so that we can identify the problems and then identify where they're coming from sounds like we maybe need a task force of some kind of to work on that I think that's an excellent suggestion thank you madam chair I will I will yield the balance of my time we will follow up and love to have you involved in that great thank you thank you very much

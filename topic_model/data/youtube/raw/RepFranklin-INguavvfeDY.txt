thank you mr chairman i appreciate you holding this really important hearing today and thank you to our witnesses for being here uh it's unfortunate the circumstances and the logistics didn't work out to have more people participate but it does not in any way diminish the significance of the topic here mr landberg the haqqani network is currently designated a foreign terrorist organization is that a fair assessment in your mind that they deserve to be on that list they have they are designated as a foreign terrorist organization and have been for a while and they deserve to be on that list and then do you see them still continuing the activities that they've been known uh for conducting so we see we'd be happy to talk in in more detail um with more granularity during the follow-on session but um the haqqani admin the haqqani group has been traditionally more inwardly focused in afghanistan but um absolutely they you know they are continue to be designated as an fto and we're continuing to monitor them monitor them closely okay and the the head of the alcani network is um is currently the taliban's interior minister is that correct yes all right in light of that um and also there are there are plenty of reports out there that people who we we've worked with who are sympathizers to the u.s cause have been rounded up their reports of execution i haven't verified that but you know i would certainly think in your line of work that would be important to know and that you'd be investigating that but in light of that uh should the taliban have been removed from the list of designated terrorist organizations so um we're under no we have regular reviews of fto designations um we're not at that five-year mark yet we're not under no pressure obligation to we consider that i think it's a wait-and-see situation in afghanistan and a lot of it is up to the taliban and see how they behave going forward and whether they're going to fulfill their many commitments made to the united states in in the international community specifically related to counterterrorism i'll note that as you mentioned the uh some of the the concerns about abuses in the recent meeting with the taliban um or the dialogue that our special representative had and notes this in the subsequent press release it was very it was highlighted our deep concerns about some of these reports so we're monitoring it and tracking it very closely so as of today the the taliban has not been removed from that list the taliban is designated as as a specially designated global terrorist not as an fto also for immigration purposes purposes they are actually um considered an fto those are very strong tools again this is like the talent it's really the taliban have it in their hands to fulfill their commitments and it's not just counterterrorism i think um we've been very clear about freedom of movement return of mark frederick's um inclusive government protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms so there's a a number of expectations we have and uh and that's going to determine how we deal with the taliban going forward well considering that their interior minister is still on the fbi's most wanted list i would hope give strong i have strong concern about that and hoped that the department would not take them off but miss harris moving on there um there were estimates when we had testimony before the armed services committee of al qaeda re-emerging in afghanistan within six months it's now three months later i understand you probably can't get into a lot of detail in this environment but um is or without the specifics is that is that bearing true are we seeing activity there so as as you rightly said i can't get into a ton of specifics here what i can say is that we are well positioned to monitor terrorist organizations we continue to try to improve our intelligence picture day over day to make sure that we are monitoring those threats what i can and can tell you is that we are focused on making sure we have the capability to counter any threats we see see crop up but we unilaterally blinded ourselves in afghanistan general mackenzie when he spoke before armed services had testified that you know with 2500 troops he could have held bagram we could still maintain that in-country isr capability but given the the caps the political caps of 700 people to defend the embassy the airport and bagram it just simply couldn't be done but but he wanted to make it clear that it could have been done had that uh have they been given the authority to do that in light of our inability to see what's happening in the country there now do you think that was a mistake i think we we have to consider what what we need to cultivate to understand what is going on in afghanistan i think it is is more complex than just maintaining isr coverage i think we need the full suite of intelligence capabilities we need to work with our allies and partners we need to ensure that we have a robust kind of intelligence picture across all of the intelligence ins to make sure we really understand what is going on i think day over day we are trying to iterate and improve on that picture we have a sense of what is going on in the country i think it's better than it was three months ago and i think if if i come back and see you in three months we'll have a more nuanced understanding then some of that is from the diplomatic channel some of that is from continuing to kind of understand where we are with our intelligence picture and seek to improve in different ways well from from the outside observation it appears to be diplomacy of wishful thinking and also the same on the military side and we've we've unilaterally handicapped ourselves but mr chairman i'm past my time and i yield back thank you

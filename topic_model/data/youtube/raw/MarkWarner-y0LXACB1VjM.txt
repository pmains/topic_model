we are back with senators richard lugar of indiana and mark warner of virginia so the notion that this election will you know suddenly make it all clear which you know which party the american support i i think we both have we all have sort of said this isn't going to happen so then what happens to this fiscal cliff what happens to this eight billion dollars that will be taken out of the economy at the end of the year in tax increases and spending cuts how's congress going to deal with that well essentially the congress leadership has decided not to deal with this left for the election which i think is a mistake fundamentally but let's say after the election very quickly where the debt ceiling problem would appear we have the sequester problem and money for the armed forces quite apart from the rest of it somebody taken away plus all the end of the bush tax cuts which means tax increases for every american now you can say well all of that could be postponed until two months three months six months down the trail he's elected he'd rather but that requires the congress to come to that conclusion on whatever the election is they're unlikely to be a 60 vote majority in the senate and unless you have a 60 vote majority and say my way or the highway you're going to have to deal across the aisles you'll be better to be doing some of that now picking up the simpson-bowles language or various other the gang of six or 12 or so forth i would hope that might occur and i think the american people be more relieved and their their thoughts about the congress certainly would be much better i imagine you can agree with that i want to move you on to siri just because i know you've been on if you want to say something before that feel free but something um that mitt romney said recently about uh the situation in syria the united states should work with partners to organize and arm syrian opposition groups so they can defend themselves good idea a bad idea let's start with you well i want to address the economic issue still that that the idea that we're going to continue to punt this problem uh which would be almost a european approach we've watched this slow motion train wreck take place in europe because they've not stepped up i think you know there is the will in congress to take the simpson bowls the gang of six uh to phase in a five trillion dollar over ten year deficit reduction plan that will raise some revenues reform our entitlement programs we have to do it there will be nothing that would do more to jump start our economy and get the two trillion dollars in in private sector capital off the sidelines investing if we can make those permanent changes now in syria i just came back from egypt and israel a very dangerous neighborhood at this point i think we need to continue to ratchet up the pressure on assad to get that regime out i think it is different from libya though because there's not the kind of unanimity at the united nations or around the arab league to have the kind of military intervention it seems that president mr romney's calling for well let me read you something and this came from the arab league secretary general yesterday who said more audacious steps are needed after the hula massacre in order to end the bloodshed so there is even some urgency now coming uh from the arab league does that help the us make decisions about should we try to work with folks to get some arms into the syrian opposition brutally crushed i mean it helps all of us but i would say specifically we ought to work with the turks to set up some zones in turkish territory guarded by turks that syrians can retreat to so-called safe zones we ought to increase the sanctions on the government of syria and the central bank sanctions as well as all others that people can cooperate in from the economic pressure tried to reinforce the diplomatic trade in other words as opposed to dismissing copianan and the peace people well to try to strengthen the hand so we got some talks going with the syrian government uh the pressure would have to be increased but i made two suggestions there as to how that might occur there might be others so they don't have to be military pressure of arming and i know that you were worried about the presence of al qaeda and other terrorist groups i'm worried about we don't really know who makes up the syrian opposition very different situation though and we're now seeing some of the armed smuggling take place out of libya into the sinai which affects our ally israel i think that we do need to ratchet up the pressure i think economic sanctions i think we need to continue to put the pressure on the russians let's face it syria is uh supported dramatically by the russians and we need to move the russians off of that support as well senator lugar i've got less than a minute and i have to ask you what's next for richard luger after a long distinguished senate career you are one of the president's favorite republicans which probably didn't help you in your primary race would you consider if the president has reelected a position uh in his administration say in diplomacy foreign policy no i think that my role is going to be outside of government i i look forward to opportunities but i'm not going to really think about it for three or four months because essentially i've got work to do for seven months we've been talking today about what we ought to be doing back and forth across the aisle in the senate now to help america the people that i want to serve so that's where my preoccupation is going to be senator lugar senator warner thank you both we're going to announce a lot when we lose dick lucas up next a dismal jobs report and what it could mean for the election

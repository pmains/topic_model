thank you madam chair um I think we've all been down this road before and I think that Senator Cruz in his opening remarks hit on a number of issues that I think I find disqualifying for the nominee and I would we have big differences I think is as perhaps a lot of people here know when it comes to Major policies miss someone is interested in reinstituting the Obama era heavy-handed net neutrality rules that were reversed under the nfcc chairman Pai in 2017 rules that I would remind people would regulate the internet like a public utility under Title II of a 1934 law so that in and of itself to me represents a major major problem from just a policy standpoint but I I also want to reiterate some of the things that were mentioned by Senator Cruz in his opening remarks and and that is I think Ms Sone is an FCC official um you know we're going to talk about this a little bit later but the issue of leaking non-public confidential information further speaks to the fact that if confirmed you're not going to bring the spirit of bipartisanship that present past Commissioners demonstrated your long record I would say of virulent partisanship has raised a number of questions as to whether or not you can serve as an impartial commissioner and I think those concerns remain you've been outspoken critic as Senator Cruz pointed out conservative media Outlets that you would be in charge of regulating you've supported far left initiatives such as defunding the police and you've been hostile I would add to broadband companies serving rural areas like those in my home state of South Dakota so I would just uh close by saying that almost all if not all individuals in politics have strong convictions but serious leaders demonstrate the ability to act in a fair and impartial manner you have not and Madam chair should this nomination come for a vote before this committee I'd urge all my colleagues for those reasons and many others which I'm sure we'll get into to join me in opposing the nominee before us thank you

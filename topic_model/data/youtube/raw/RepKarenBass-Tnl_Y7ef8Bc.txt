Virginia Governor Ralph Northam is fighting for his job tonight after doing a complete 180 on why this racist photo was in his medical school yearbook Northam now says the photo is not him but a member of the 1984 east virginia medical school yearbook staff tell CNN the photos were chosen by each individual student and submitted in a sealed envelope with the student's name on it and kept in a locked room which raises more questions about the governor's claim that the photo is not him joining me now Democratic congresswoman Karen bass of California she is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus congresswoman thank you so much for your time I appreciate it thanks for having me yeah let's talk about governor Northam it showed no signs of backing down he says that he wants to clear his name is there anything he could do to change your position that he must go he must resign oh no no I think that every day that passes it's even more reason that he should step down he says he does not want to leave office because then that would indicate that he was racist to stay in office and to continue this pain really shows that he does not understand the significance of what has happened here so I've heard that this you know a whole question this morning then what is is there forgiveness can one be rehabilitated sure you know if the thing is is that this happened a long time ago and when he decided to enter public life you know I hear that he belongs to an african-american church and you and I know that he could have gone to the ministers he could have said you know what when I was younger I did something that I'm very ashamed of and I really want to apologize and I need to tell you about it he essentially hid this he could have come clean he could have asked for forgiveness years ago he chose not to do this he just got busted that's all what he's saying he didn't know about it is that possible to you that's just not credible at all how do you one day say this was me I'm sorry I take responsibility and the next day say no it actually wasn't and then to say but yet the same I did do blackface but that was Michael Jackson and I'm hoping that people understand the difference of imitating Michael Jackson and blackface and standing in a picture next to a cake a person in blackface there's no difference representative you know Democrats have been drawing a clear distinction with President Trump over issues of race do you think this controversy surrounding the governor could hurt the Democratic Party well no I don't think it should at all because it's really showing that we are consistent you know I mean we called for Steven King to be kicked out of the Republican Party and removed from his committees now this is an incident with a Democrat and we're taking the same stand so to me it shows that we are not hypocritical we are consistent and really the only way to begin healing in Virginia is for him to step aside he doesn't have the confidence of his legislature so how can he assume the executive position in that state it is interesting unlike things that have happened in the recent past there has been pretty much unanimous condemnation from Democrats on this one at the highest levels Virginia is a lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax a man who would assume the governorship if north and does step down now facing an allegation that he sexually assaulted a woman in 2004 he says the reports are false samey encounter described was 100% consensual do you have concern about this well you know what I mean I think any allegations should be investigated but one of the things that I think shouldn't happen and that is saying well now there's some questions about the lieutenant governor so we should leave the governor in place I think these are two completely separate issues I think they are both serious but they are completely separate and it does not shield the governor from needing to step down representative president Trump was asked this weekend about a CBS News poll that shows 63% of Americans say they disapprove of how he is handling the handling race issues here's how he responded the african-americans have the best employment numbers in the history of our country so I think I've been given a lot of credit for that and in terms of race a lot of people are saying well this is something very special what's happening because when colleagues of yours even like Republican senator Tim Scott he said Donald Trump is not racist but he said you're racially insensitive I have a great relationship with Tim and certainly with his state South Carolina and where we do very well and I think if you look at the numbers for african-american unemployment best numbers they've had literally the best numbers they've had in history and I think they like me a lot and I like them a lot let me just tell you that we just finished in the Congressional Black Caucus doing a poll and if he thinks he has support in the african-american community let me tell you it is in the low single digits it is so offensive to me when he talks about the employment rate in the african-american population he had nothing to do with that it's not as though he had some jobs program and that led to a decrease in african-american unemployment if he wants to give credit anywhere he needs to get credit to the Obama administration that kept us from having a disaster in our economy and the economy was getting much better when he took office he had absolutely nothing to do with the african-american employment and he needs to stop using that to say that he's in love with african-americans it's silly and it's offensive Thank You congresswoman I appreciate your time thank you

currently joining me to discuss congressman jim Himes connecticut republican strategist hogan Gidley MSNBC contributor Karen Finney and rap war vet ribe arcot pleasure to have you all here let's start with you congressman Himes you remember the House Intelligence Committee an interesting voice on this right now first this big picture question do you have concerns about the long-term implications of training and advising what it sounds like from the president could be a broad range of forces on the ground I do have very profound concerns about the path that the president has outlined look bottom line you know three hundred advisors we are now going to be coaching Maliki's team Maliki of course a leader who has done all he can to stoke sectarian divisions and to stoke this sunni-shia Civil War which by the way is how the architects of Iraq need to be thinking about this this was not a win or lose proposition when the United States was in Iraq we were able to tamp in this civil war which has now broken out and so the question now is do we want to take a side there and I fear that the president is taking aside and it wouldn't be the first time we've taken sides one of the interesting aspects of this conflict right now is of course during the Al Anbar awakening we did train an arm Sunni tribesmen we're now looking at this major Sunni insurgency sweeping the country where are those tribesmen we relied on then is there any evidence as the weather part of this current uprising well we were able to do that for at least two reasons number one al Qaeda at the time overplayed their hands with their absolute brutality which turned off an awful lot of Sunnis in Anbar and elsewhere which by the way is a dynamic which is occurring today and which will naturally occur as these ISIL crazies do what it is natural for them to do but the other thing we were able to do of course we had a lot of people on the ground who could show up with money with training with weapons and that of course facilitated the awakening we are not there now in a way to do this but you know to sort of to join a team and by the way it's the opposite team of the team that we are on in Syria in Iraq today we are supporting an Iranian add leader against a Sunni insurgency 200 miles away we are supporting a Sunni insurgency around in Iranian she proxy Shiite leader there is not a lot of coherence in this strategy and do you think that cooperation of that kind with Iran should be bought the table well it depends on what you mean by of that kind Iran is a million-dollar question yeah that you know Iran is still a dangerous place but we in this instance just as we have an interest in continuing the discussion to make sure they don't achieve nuclear arms we have an interest as they do in making sure that Iraq does not turn into just a hugely violent cauldron congressman jim Himes thanks for that insight now let's bring in our fabulous

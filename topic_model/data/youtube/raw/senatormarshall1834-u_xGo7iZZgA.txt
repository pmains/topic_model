senator from kansas mr president i rise today to keep fighting for those who are still hurting from this plague i'm fighting for those who have yet to receive the vaccine i'm fighting for those who are not back to work i'm fighting to protect medicare dollars but you know who i'm really here to speak to today and to speak for my three grandsons i actually received a phone call this morning from two of them actually a facetime and they wanted to share a story with me of a fish they caught last night i'm here to protect their future to make sure that someday their grandkids will be able to call them and talk about a great moment in their lives now certainly i'm here to fight to get our children back to school but you know what i believe is the largest threat to their future to their dreams and to their success it's the national debt it's not just a threat to their education it's a threat to the infrastructure they'll be using for the next 20 years of their life as well as a threat to the national security of their families now i'm without question here to fight for those who really need the help now but i'm also called to protect the future of this country and our children and our grandchildren are the future of this country now as everybody in this room knows we've already borrowed four trillion dollars four trillion dollars from our grandchildren to fight this virus but over one trillion dollars remains on the sideline is yet to be spent now my suggestion why don't we start by repurposing those dollars and target them where they're needed the most which is exactly what we would do in the business world from which i came very recently look this great american economy is coming back the long dark cold winter is almost over unemployment's under four percent in kansas and many other states and it looks like we're going to have a strong first quarter gdp number now as an aside i have to highlight though the way this partisan bill is written it rewards those states who overreacted and totally shut down their economies and their schools bailing out mismanaged states at the expense of taxpayers is simply not american if this administration and our governors do their job we can have nationwide hurt immunity by april or may and by summer our economy can be back to pre-pandemic levels all without borrowing another two trillion dollars from our grandchildren that comes out to six thousand dollars to each child to each one of your grandchildren six thousand dollars we want to borrow so walk up to your children to your grandchildren say hey we want to borrow six thousand dollars to you to help bail out some mismanaged governments so listen we truly want to help those who need the help and i asked my colleagues across the aisle why do you want to borrow another 2 trillion dollars from our grandchildren and only spend nine percent only nine percent on direct covert relief we simply cannot print enough money up here to solve these problems long term unless we lock in on the real most pressing challenges this is what we need to do to defeat the virus and it's very simple get shots into arms get people back to work and get our kids in school if we do these three things our economy and republic will become booming back call this bill in front of us what you want a boondoggle a christmas tree a christmas tree decorated with ear marks as ornaments and full of so much pork it's dripping grease my friends across the aisle focused 91 percent of their attention in this bill to pay for things like a bridge from new york to canada an underground railroad project in silicon valley money for planned parenthood and stimulus checks for illegal immigrants and violent criminals now you can argue for this loan from our grandchildren if you'd like and if you don't care about the future but at the end of the day you're trying to borrow two trillion dollars from our grandchildren to spend on partisan pet projects and i'll never agree to that let me stress once more what i'm for getting vaccines in arms getting people back to work and getting kids back to school thank you mr president and i yield back

back on NBC 10 at issue all inspector was I guess two weeks ago Joe Sestak the week before this morning that to me is here let's pick up where we left off on entitlement so you have a responsibility to people are at or near what do you do going forward about Medicare and Social Security third rails nobody's want to touch her president talks about reform and people you know prob actually I've been talking about reforming the Social Security program for 12 years including all three terms when i served in the house and what I think we really need to do is give younger workers a choice so you can participate in the current program if you'd like but if you'd prefer will give you a different option within social security will create a reform whereby you can take a portion of the payroll tax that you currently send to Washington and actually save and invest that money will that be yours will let's look at that glad you raised that so let's look at this now if I was not our yes but let's look well now let's let's look at this I'm 48 years old when I got out of college and first started working full time the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 1,000 today we're still in the midst of one of the worst recession well the worst recession since the Great Depression did I was at 10,000 so any money that I would have been able to put in or anybody my age over the course of these decades the vast majority of those investments would have been very very positive in terms of their return the other thing that we would certainly do is require professional management required diversification and you'd have a portfolio I mean I think it would make only only make sense to have a portfolio designed to evolve over a person's lifetime so that as they approached retirement age the investment composition would be primarily very safe instruments for capital preservation like Treasury bond CDs in cash so that someone who's about to retire is not subject to a big fluctuation in the stock market that kind of system it relieves the fact that this is a program is fundamentally insolvent for the government but more importantly it creates ownership rights for every individual worker a person would retire with savings that they own it would be inheritable in the case of someone passing away which social security benefits are not now and it would offer better returns than what the taxes in the past on maybe when the vote is interesting no it really is it's important to talk about the national debt ceiling was just the one by one point nine trey you would have been against that or is it mrs. well you know what it's saying that we should have done is taken the opportunity you have to you have to honor the dead i'll but you have to honor your obligations as a country absolutely complete default have met the last year like the point is that cuts both ways that means they need a vote to pass and so what we should do is use that as an opportunity to put some spending discipline in place to have some cuts in spending like tom coburn proposed cuts cuts in spending where we can put some caps on growth use that as the opportunity to begin to get this massive deficit under control and i think they missed that opportunity was the president honest and his creature oh I don't think the president was dishonest in his speech I think the president went off on the wrong path several times but I'm not aware of any cases of actual dishonesty criticism of the Republicans in recent years is following along at least this one line which is that they look in Congress to be the party of note that they say no no no don't do this don't do this don't do this but what do they stand for because there are still problems that Americans involved yeah do you think that's still a problem with who is currently in Congress in the Republican Party well I don't want to speak for for people who are you know for other people but I know that I have consistently advocated for alternative policies I haven't just said no I do say no to a lot of what's been happening in Washington but I've also advocated what I believe in for instance with health care you know Joe Sestak and I did an hour and a half long televised debate in Allentown where we had a town hall a forum we took unscripted unprepared questions from the audience and we did that now in a dip it into the Senate if you got into the Senate would you go to your Republicans who have been there longer than you as a u.s. senator and say stop what you're doing if you can't support the president come up with something else that you're going to push war that will still solve the problem well I'm going to go one step further than that I'm go to everybody and say hey can't we all agree that individuals ought to be able to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums just as employers can that's not the case today let's change the law so that it's more affordable for individual workers to go out and buy their own policy let's change the law so that insurance companies can compete across state lines so that Pennsylvania families will have hundreds of plans to choose from rather than just a couple we might not want the Alabama plan and you wouldn't I would never force you to take it that's the thing Steve but I think it's perfectly okay created to South Alabama fine may not let mean I'm pay for that test that I thought I was going to get and y los month now why shouldn't pennsylvania families decide whether they want an inexpensive plan that maybe doesn't have all the frills or a bit more expensive plan that will cover everything they could ever want that i think should be left up to individuals and consumers Morla former congressman and senate candidate Pat Toomey that would have two new to talk about the economy mainly but they're a couple of other issues of the floor out there that are important to some people that you talked about anyway CBS is apparently has made the decision not to bow to pressure and they're going to allow the Tim Tebow head to focus on the family is asking to be run during the Super Bowl to up do you think that I don't see why you can't run an ad like that I think it's perfectly fine to run that antedates better than that they run it the network is now dealing with another issue whether or not an ad by a dating service that happens to be a gay dating service wants to put it out on and CBS is at this point it doesn't know whether to get that out on is this stuff that should be left entirely up to the network or should public pressure be involved with well you know at some point i think i think the the broad sense of the public ought to have some say on and you know a lot of kids were watching TV at at times and and that's why we have you know all kind we have all kinds of regulations now on now what can be broadcast over the airwaves saying it's appropriate to have some limits the latest criticism on another subject to do come from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee it basically says your record when you're in Congress is not what you say it is that you voted for all the bush budgets and that sort of thing that'll work final word is I defy them to fine somebody who is a more consistent advocate for taxpayers for limited government cutting wasteful spending and keeping the burden on taxpayers as modest as it can be I think I was a champion for those causes when I was in the house and my record shows it to me thank you very much thank you thanks for having again for being here thank you and we expect you back if you can in the weeks and months like the court to that's it for this edition of nbc10 edition i'm steve i'm open to the drawings that you've ever say enjoyable

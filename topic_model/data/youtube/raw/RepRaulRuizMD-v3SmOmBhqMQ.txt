i rise in support of my bill the burn pit registry enhancement act which passed the house unanimously yesterday and to urge a vote in the senate the burn pit registry enhancement act would strengthen the registry by allowing a registered veteran's data to be updated by their family with his or her cause of death this data is crucial to identify the vast array of illnesses that are causing young burn pit exposed veterans to die and will help doctors recognize early symptoms of life-threatening conditions and save lives as a nation we have a responsibility to provide our veterans with the benefits they have earned and deserve we bear that responsibility even more heavily when the use of burn pits by our own military are causing veterans to develop rare pulmonary conditions and cancers so i urge the senate to take up my legislation and uphold our commitment to taking care of our veterans

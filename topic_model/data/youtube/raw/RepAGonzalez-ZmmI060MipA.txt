hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update yesterday we did another one of those quarterly updates so I would direct you in that direction if you want to hear what we did throughout the entire previous quarter but for this week it was another busy week back home catching up with some elected officials and different members of the community had a great time doing that obviously and then in Washington we had a handful of things so number one I got to testify on behalf of our battlefield cross bill that was the first bill that I introduced it was one of congressman Renee C's old bills and that they just didn't have time to get through so I got to testify on behalf of that hopefully we can get that done that would be fantastic bipartisan bicameral really important for our veterans and for our veteran families so excited about that secondly myself and Marcy Kaptur representative Kaptur who borders my district to the north we introduced a bill to rename the plum Brook station after Neil Armstrong so the plum Brook station has some incredible facilities is associated with NASA Glenn but we thought it could use a new name so hoping to name it after heal Armstrong which I think would be very appropriate and would be great and then in addition I introduced a bill with congresswoman Underwood and Steve Stivers from Ohio it's a combat infant mortality in Tim Ryan's on it as well and and we came together I came to an agreement on a way to extend a series of programs that'll that'll be back in four mortality we have one of the highest rates in the country right here in our in our region in Northeast Ohio that's obviously a major issue and one that that we want to do all we can to solve and and then finally we had a hearing the Financial Services Committee with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook on the currency project that they're launching I have a whole host of issues with it mainly the way that they're structuring it it's kind of like a corporate currency that's controlled by Facebook and a handful of companies that Facebook recruited to do so I think Facebook has been a pretty bad steward of their platform frankly with all the abuses that have gone on all the data problems that they've had and some of the security issues and so I have some challenges with that I will say this he didn't commit which I appreciate it Mark Zuckerberg did commit say they would not launch anything until they comply with every single US law that's a pretty strong statement but having said that I think that's something we need to keep a really really close eye on when you're messing with people's money point you got to be careful there obviously so but but overall it was a great week it was a busy week as always and as usual thank you allowing me to be a representative help everybody has a great weekend Thanks

here with us now Democratic Representative maxine waters from California thank you very much for joining them back see how were you doing today welcome good morning I'm in New Orleans today oh my goodness you want tell us why you tell us why you're in New Orleans what's going on Joe I'm holding a hearing this morning for years after Katrina we're trying to find out what's wrong what's right with the road home program the money that we sent from Washington DC through the CDBG that is the block grant money to help people restore their homes there's still a lot of complaints still a lot of homes that have not been rehabilitated not been rebuilt and my committee of the subcommittee of financial services the Housing Committee is here to find out what's going on we didn't want to simply just not pay attention not leave New Orleans and Mississippi and Alabama all of these places that were so harmed by the storm without some oversight it was a lot of people here as you know doing and right after Katrina but we have to follow up and understand whether or not the people who have truly been assisting and that's what I'm doing does amazing thank you thank you so much for doing that my wife and I went over every day for the first month or so and we found the conditions shameful absolutely shameful but I think most Americans have forgotten New Orleans have forgotten Waveland Mississippi have forgotten the goalpost what's wrong why have we allowed the ball to drop over the past four years and what do you think you're going to uncover that can refocus Washington on helping New Orleans and Mississippi recover well you're absolutely right there was a lot of volunteerism a lot of sympathy from all over the world in particular here in the United States people came from everywhere but you know once it gets off the radar screen people kind of forget and some people think well they've gotten money they've gotten resources they must be all right but that's not true I was here a few months ago over in the Pontchartrain Park area and I discovered there were a lot of complaints people not only have not gotten what they requested and what they were eligible for some of those complaints are now appeals that have not been addressed so the road home program the statewide program that was supposed to subsidize the citizens here that had received substantial damage up to 150 thousand dollars some people got $10 $15 $100 nothing and we're going to find out what went wrong with the road home program what should we do now whether or not there any resources left and who's responsible we're getting it done yeah that's great magazine really quickly let me ask you are we talking about the health care debate it's gotten so angry on both sides everybody's calling everybody in Nazi or unamerican or a fascist it wasn't even that way when we were fighting over the 2000 election our impeachment or even Watergate why has it gotten so ugly this summer I don't know but Joe I really do believe that in the beginning it was organized that some of our insurance companies have to put up by I believe resources and targeted certain areas but then they connected with a lot of dissatisfied people people who are angry who are dissatisfied with the way things are going some people are concerned about this economy they have been hit hard they have lost their jobs they don't know what's happening and so between the economic crisis that we've been involved in and then the new uncertainty about health care you have a connection here between the organized and orchestrated and just people out there who want some answers but I've never seen anything like this and it's very interesting where it's coming from I have a town hall meeting that's coming up very soon next Saturday I don't expect this to happen I would be very surprised if it happened Wow don't seem to have that kind of anger all right Maxine thank you for being with us and I wanted you want to talk to you next week after your hearings and keep us updated on what's at Orleans all right take care absolutely thank you much maxi

Environment and Public Works Committee when asked whether the government should be held to the same standards as it requires of the public and the private sector you stated that and I quote actually a higher standard would be quite appropriate do you still believe today that a higher standard for government would be quite appropriate I do thank you we have a public responsibility that's larger than what I think the private sector has so I would like to highlight and submit for the Congressional Record a Wall Street Journal article from September 9th written by a former EPA employee in the article bill yram states and I quote a facility in Charleston West Virginia that was been previously brought up accidentally spilled roughly 7,500 gallons of toxic camels chemicals into the local waterway the EPA's recent discharge of toxic water was many times larger yet the agency went after the company with everything it had end quote should the Department of Justice or an independent investigator go after the EPA with everything it has when when we get the final report to understand what happened I would expect DOJ to pay attention to that and I will pay attention to it as well and and with the Inspector General's be involved in that the inspector general is also looking at bringing an independent review yes former EPA employee wireman also references an incident that occurred during the Clinton administration where a railroad supervisor overseeing a quarry project hired a contractor who accidentally struck a pipeline with a backhoe and contaminated about 1,500 gallons of river water so the supervisor Hanna was off duty at the time of the incident and had subcontracted the work the EPA pursued criminal charges against him and he was sentenced to six months in prison because he was ultimately responsible for the safety on the site you have said the EPA and you are ultimately responsible of this bill and you take personal responsibility of this incident correct so the only correction I would make is the Department of Justice is the one that pursues no criminal actions okay since you believe in parody and a higher standard for government someone should from the EPA go to jail for this incident that we're making I am not at all aware that there is negligence or that we didn't do due diligence and those are the things that the Department of the Interior I would I would beg to differ I mean we knew that there was a problem in here and we should have alerted everybody along these lines and I just from that standpoint what actions would the EPA take against a private company who was responsible for a spill of this magnitude we actually would be doing exactly the same thing with that company at this stage in looking to independently identify whether or not there was any negligent or criminal activity that led to this that's exactly the same process we're going through today okay now when the spill was reported to the National Response Center at 12:27 on August 5th the caller repeatedly emphasized how important it was to notify downstream users who would be affected by the contaminated plume headed towards him the message was relayed to the EPA why is it that the state of New Mexico the southern ute tribe and the Navajo Nation all found out about the spill from sources not the EPA who caused the incidents in the first place it was part of our contingency plan that we always use to take a real image of local information so that there are is appropriate notification whether or not it was as quick as it could be I don't know but that was an appropriate way in which to notify well so you were notified is how hard it would it be to pick up the phone well we have a whole stream this is not it's it's not us individually deciding who to call there is a contingency plan for notification that's developed with the states with the local communities and that's what we initiate this is not done on the fly this is a plan that was developed with everybody ously it was way delayed you have you have representatives that will testify accordingly act and they have Allah Nation the Utes I want to I want to first move forward a little bit this lack of trust that's now being instilled within the tribes how can you expect States and tribes to have trust and faith and faith in your agency to clean up this mess if they can't rely simply on being informed about what's going on you talk about collaboration but it shows a very poor respect and I want to ask one more question before you answer because I'm running out of time why is it so difficult I know the southern Utes were on there for tribes in the states to have seats at the table at the EPA's incident command Center having open lines of communication or get questions answers about health and sentiment impacts because I know they are well I look over at the President and Navajo Nation I this could have been dramatically were averted so I want to know why there's so much reluctancy in those applications actually there is no reluctance to have the tribes involved to the extent that they want to they actually were involved in our incident command center the southern Utes were there and embedded and the Navajo people embedded in their incident command center and other activities on the tribe something seriously went wrong in this application and I and as a CEO I hope that you would alright we're now under resource rules which means we've got a second

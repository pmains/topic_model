I thought secretary Nuland did a really good job of explaining the President's commitment to having a process that work but also to defending the country you know how much money you spend matters and it matters a lot but how you spend it also matters a lot we'll do the best we can this year to make as much progress as quickly as we can to see how much can be done between now and the beginning of the spending year I'll guarantee you when we talk to people throughout the government particularly in the defense structure last year the difference in what happens if you've got the money you're going to have to spend that year at the beginning of the year instead of halfway through the year you spend it a lot more wisely if you're able to debate these bills publicly as we now would anticipate being able to do this year and next year the people we work for get to be part of that debate and know how this money is being spent it is a significant step in the right direction we're going to make the most of this year there's no reason that next year we shouldn't have a process that allows us to fund all of the government by October 1 and we're going to do our best to do exactly that

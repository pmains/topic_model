I will yield one minute to him representative Pasquale John from New Jersey is recognized for one minute Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker it must be very painful for people to watch this when affected whether you're on a river whether you're on the ocean because it's painful to hear some of the people oppose this bill never voted voted no on the sandy relief so they're being consistent anyway after sandy many of my constituents and towns moonachie and little furry now experienced a second blow from skyrocketing flood insurance rates particularly to home sale trigger as a resulted in a drastically higher flood insurance rate for prospective homebuyers putting a wet blanket on real estate markets in flood-prone areas the bill before us today contains some very important changes providing immediate relief to homeowners by repealing the home sale trigger and reducing the rate of possible increases I'm hopeful that we can revisit flood insurance reform in a way which will provide relief to second homes in small businesses although these are important first steps we know we can do better and I yield back and thank all those who let a gentleman yields back waters and mr.

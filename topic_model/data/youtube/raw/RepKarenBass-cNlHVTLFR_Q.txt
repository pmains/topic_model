very much Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the music Modernization Act I also come from one of those districts that is a hub after meeting with songwriters and producers in my district and listening to their testimony before the House Judiciary Committee it's clear we risk losing the next generation of songwriters if we do not address the rate standards for digital screening recently I met with world-renowned songwriter Paul Williams and I've had open discussions with hundreds of songwriters from around the country songwriters from my district have voiced that it is nearly impossible to earn a fair income vigil via digital streaming they are usually not the famous performers and cannot go on tour to earn a living over 50% of their income is derived from licensing performance rights to their music one of my constituents Michelle Lewis shared that she made just three dollars and 78 cents for one point three million dollars streams millions of streams of her work on one streaming service as the Grammy award-winning artist and songwriter NiO stated even if you write a hit song that streamed in millions of times you're still not going to earn enough to pay rent from streaming and that's where the entire industry is moving which is why I support the songwriters equity act amp the classics act and Mme Mme also closes a loophole which has negatively impacted early music icons of Motown jazz blues and rock and roll according to Grammy award-winning artist Dionne Warwick how could it be that 1979's I'll never love this way again receive compensation but 1969's I'll never fall in love again does not recently legacy songwriter and performer Darlene love visited my office to express her support for closing the legacy loophole born in Los Angeles she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame of 2011 she sang backup for Elvis Aretha Franklin and Frank Sinatra after decades of listening to her hard work being streamed without being compensated with the passage of MMA she and other songwriters will finally have access to the fair compensation they reserve they deserve if we are serious about supporting a next generation of songwriters then we must continue to address antiquated the well-intentioned laws Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

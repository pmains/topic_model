FLOOR. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT,. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE IS RECOGNIZED. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE THREE REQUESTS FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET TODAY DURING TODAY'S SESSION OF THE SENATE. THEY HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY LEADERS. PROMISE DULY --. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: DULY NOTED. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT, SENATOR CAPITO HAS BEEN GRACIOUS IN HER THANKS AND PRAISE. IT'S NOW HER TURN TO BE ON THE RECEIVING END. WE'VE ALL HEARD OF THE GANG OF 20 OR THE GANG OF 22, THE GROUP OF 20 OR 22. BEFORE THERE WAS A GANG OR GROUP OF 22, THERE WAS A GANG OF ONE. THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM WEST VIRGINIA, MY NATIVE STATE. AND SHE JOINED IN WITH THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM TO REALLY GET THE BALL ROLLING AND SORT OF TOOK THE HAND OFF FROM WHAT WE HAD DONE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, MEETING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT. BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT, AFTER OUR MEETING, THEY DECIDED TO ENGAGE, THEY DECIDED TO ENGAGE WITH YOU. EVENTUALLY USED THE FOOTBALL ANALOGY HERE. YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE BALL IN THROUGH THE END ZONE BUT YOU CERTAINLY GOT INTO THE RED ZONE. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. AND YOUR GOOD HUMOR WHEN THINGS WERE TOUGH. ON MY LEFT IS MARY FRANN IS, WHO -- FRANCIS AND SHE IS JOINED BY JOHN, TYLER AND WE HAVE ADAM OVER HERE SITTING OVER TO THE -- NEXT TO THE RANKING MEMBER. I HAVE GONE THROUGH BEFORE THE NAMES OF YOUR STAFF. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT SUPPORT AND WORK YOU'VE DONE, EACH ONE OF YOU. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THANK -- YOU DON'T GET TO BE FLOOR MANAGERS WITHOUT SOMEBODY IN THE LEADERSHIP SAYING, WE'D LIKE YOU TO BE FLOOR MANAGERS SO TO SENATOR SCHUMER AND SENATOR McCONNELL, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING YOUR CONFIDENCE AN TRUST IN SENATOR CAPITO AND ME, TO THE FLOOR FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO KEEP US ON THE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL AND HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHILE SENATOR PORTMAN IS HERE ON THE FLOOR, I DON'T SEE SENATOR SINEMA, SENATOR PORTMAN SUCCEEDS SENATOR VOINOVICH, WE WERE GOVERNORS TOGETHER AND SENATORS TOGETHER AND I MISS GEORGE EVERY DAY, BUT YOU HAVE MORE THAN FILLED HIS SHOES, MY FRIEND AND SALUTE YOU. SENATOR SINEMA IS FAIRLY NEW HERE BUT SHE HAS IMPRESSED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND TOOK THE BULL BY THE HORN AND NEVER GAVE UP AND BECAUSE OF HER EFFORTS AND PARTNERING WITH SENATOR PORTMAN, WE ARE HERE TODAY. I QUOTED A COUPLE OF TIMES THE WORDS OF WINSTON CHURCHILL, HE WAS ASKED WHEN HE LEFT 10 DOWNING STREET, IS THIS THE END, HE REPLIED, IN IS NOT THE END, THIS IS NOT THE BEGINNING, IT IS THE END OF THE BEGINNING. SO IT IS WITH US TODAY. WE ARE NEARING THE END OF A DEBATE AND FINAL VOTE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT OF 2021. AND BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE ON THE ADOPTION OF THIS MEASURE, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT BRIEFLY ON HOW THIS BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL CAME TO BE. SENATOR CAPITO REFERRED TO THIS, BUT I WANT TO REINFORCE THIS. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, AT MY ENCOURAGEMENT, PRESIDENT BIDEN INVITED SENATOR CAPITO, SENATOR CARDIN, SENATOR INHOFE AND ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO DISCUSS THE NEED TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENT IN OUR NATION'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. HE ASKED US, THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, TO LEAD THE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THAT NEED, TO GET TO WORK IN OUR COMMITTEE TO CRAFT AND REPORT TO THE FULL SENATE, TO THIS BODY, SURFACE TRANSPORTATION LEGISLATION, ROADS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES AS WELL AS DRINKING WATER AND WATER SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE BY SPRINGTIME. THAT WAS THE REQUEST. IN THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED, WORKING TOGETHER WITH ALL 20 MEMBERS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID, TEN DEMOCRATS, TEN REPUBLICANS WORKING TOGETHER. IN MAY WE RECORD OUT OF OUR COMMITTEE A FIVE-YEAR TRANSPORTATION BILL WITH A UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN VOTE, 20-0, BY MORE THAN A THIRD WE INCREASED -- BY MORE THAN A THIRD WE INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN OUR ROADS, HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES WITH AN HISTORIC HIGHWAY TITLE AND FACING GLOBAL WARMING. THAT TRANSPORTATION BILL IS AT THE CORE OF THE LEGISLATION WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY. LONG WITH THE DRINKING WATER AND INFRASTRUCTURE ACT, IT WAS REPORTED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THE COMMITTEE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC WORKS AND PASSED BY THE FULL SENATE EARLIER THIS YEAR BY AN 89-2 VOTE. THAT BILATERAL TARGETS THE MOST IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR DRINKING AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT NEEDS. WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK THIS OUR COMMITTEE HAS DONE MADE POSSIBLE BY THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE ENJOY. I THINK OF THE WORK THAT WE DID, MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK IT IS LIKE LAYING THE FOUNDATION, CLEAN DRINKING WATER, WASTEWATER SANITATION, ROADS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, CLIMATE, THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH THIS PACKAGE WAS BUILT AND WE TRIED TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF THE SENATE, THE OTHER COMMITTEES OF JURISDICTION AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT MAYBE WE DID THAT. LEADERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT LEADING AND THE PRESIDENT SOUGHT AND ENCOURAGED US TO TRY TO LEAD EARLIER THIS YEAR AND I THINK WE MET THAT REQUEST AND THEN SOME. I WANT TO THANK HIM. HE DIDN'T GIVE UP EITHER. HE'S BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH SENATOR CAPITO, NEGOTIATING WITH THE TEAM OF THE GANG OF 22, NEVER GAVE UP. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THIS IS A FOOL'S ERRAND, BUT HE NEVER GAVE UP. THE BILL BEFORE THIS BODY TODAY, THE BILL -- BUILDS ON THE STRONG BIPARTISAN WORK OF THE COMMITTEE OF ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS AS WELL AS THE GOOD WORK DONE BY OTHER COMMITTEES, COMMERCE COMMITTEE, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE, AMONG THEM. MY APPRECIATION TO ALL WHO WORKED TO TIRELESSLY ON THIS HERCULEAN UNDERTAKING. LET ME BE CLEAR, THIS LEGISLATION ISN'T PERFECT. IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE, YOU WILL HEAR IT AGAIN. I'VE NEVER WRITTEN AL BILL THAT'S -- A BILL THAT'S PERFECT, AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A HAND IN WRITING IT, IT IS NOT PERFECT. IN SPITE OF MAKING PROGRESS, IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IN TERMS OF EQUITY, IN TERMS OF TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE. THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THESE ISSUES, ISSUES THAT WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO ADDRESS. REST ASSURED, I'LL BE JOINING MY COLLEAGUES IN FIGHTING FOR PROGRESS ON THESE FRONTS IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. LET'S NOT MAKE THE PERFECT THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE BILL BEFORE US DOES A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD. IT'S THE LARGEST LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IN OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE IN ALMOST A CENTURY -- ALMOST A CENTURY AND THE LARGEST FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC TRANSIT, CLEAN ENERGY, CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE. ON THIS DAY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR US TO STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES AND BUILD FOR OUR FUTURE. ON THIS DAY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT DEDICATED TO MOVING PAST BIPARTISAN DIVIDES AND MEETING THE MOMENT FOR OUR NATION AND THIS DAY LEADERS IN THIS BODY FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, WE'VE COME AND GATHERED AND SHARED A PURPOSE, A COMMON CAUSE IN A COMMITMENT TO FIND A WAY FOR -- I WANT TO CLOSE WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BRIDGE MONEY IN HERE. A LOT OF MONEY TO FIX BRIDGES, WEST VIRGINIA, OHIO, DELAWARE, MAINE, YOU NAME IT. THERE'S A LOT OF TROUBLED WATER IN OUR COUNTRY, TROUBLED WATER. AND I LIKE TO THINK OF THIS LEGISLATION CRAFTED TOGETHER ACROSS THE AISLE BIPARTISAN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, WE CREATED A BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS. THINK ABOUT THAT. A BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS. AND RIGHT AT A TIME WHEN WE REALLY NEEDED ONE AND WE COULD USE A FEW MORE AS WE GO ALONG. SOMETIMES WHEN I TRAVEL, PEOPLE ASK ME, SAY, WHAT DO YOU DO? THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO ON THE AIRPLANE OR WHATEVER. I SAY I HELP PEOPLE. THEY SAY, HOW DO YOU HELP THEM? I THINK THE BEST WAY TO HELP PEOPLE IS TO HELP THEM FIND A JOB, A JOB WHERE THEY CAN SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE CLEAN WATER TO DRINK AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE. THAT'S -- THOSE ARE WAYS THAT WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE WITH THIS LEGISLATION, BIG TIME -- BIG TIME AND WE'LL BE DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. COLLEAGUES ON THIS DAY WE CAN VOTE TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN SEIZING THE DAY IN VOTING TO ADVANCE THIS LEGISLATION TOGETHER ON THIS DAY LET US SEIZE THE DAY,

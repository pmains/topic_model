join us now is Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden he sits on the Senate health care subcommittee senator Wyden it's very good to see you thanks for having me yet so tell me a bit about when you found individual medic is you one of the early Democrats to actually embrace it when Democrats had not like this policy at all in the 90s it had been the Republican alternative and you began looking at it in the mid-2000s what was the appeal I believe it was an opportunity to break really a hundred years worth of gridlock on this health care issue as you know we have been working on this decade after decade after decade and it seemed to me that one John Chafee particularly during those Clinton years laid out an opportunity to show that there'd be some personal responsibility be required to purchase a measure of health care coverage we could tie it to what I've always dreamed about which is getting everybody in America good and affordable coverage now you have over the last few minutes describe sort of what you describe is the irony of the whole issue I would tell you I think what you describe is really a byproduct of zero-sum politics on these big issues it's always been one side has got to win the other side has got to lose that's what I think forces a lot of this polarization and what I've been trying to show over the last few years and we want a great victory early this year for Internet freedom when a Republican a conservative Republican senator Jerry Moran teamed up with me and we were able to make sure that websites didn't become web cops we've got to break this polarization and I'll tell you Ezra it is the only way out because this election is still not going to produce a supermajority for either side in the Senate what always worries me about the Senate now about politics now as you described it as zero-sum electioneering and I think you're completely right what scares me about the dysfunction we see in American government right now is it it's not clear to me anybody's wrong about that the Republican Party experienced a very large win at the polls in 2010 based at least in part on their rock-solid opposition to the health care bill which made it much less popular Mitch McConnell the leader of the Senate Republicans pretty much said straight out that we need the American people to not see these is bipartisan because if they see them as bipartisan they'll think they're good so how do minorities escape that I mean it seems we have built this kind of behavior into the system itself and I don't see how it gets out of it you have to get around the middle men in Washington DC the middlemen essentially the lobbyists the political consultants the pollsters they are one of the main reasons why you see this kind of polarization because they take these sort of instant polls they show look we've got a great opportunity to hammer the other guys we can score in this election and that's why on the big issues we see everything gridlock now I think on tax reform we've got another terrific op opportunity I and others have put together a bipartisan bills built around with Democrats and Ronald Reagan did where they clean out the clutter hold down the rates and we can create a millions of jobs to do it both sides are going to have to say we're going to be willing to do what's good for the country solve a problem and that means fighting the special interests not each other we'll see if it can be done we'll see if it can be done Oregon Senator organ Democratic Senator Ron Wyden thank you very much for being here and I hope you I hope you're proven right I hope this place can still the only way out

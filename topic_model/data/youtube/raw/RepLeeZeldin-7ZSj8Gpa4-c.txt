Thank You chairman for yielding and supporting my proposal to require the FAA to reassess the North Shore helicopter route and address the noise impact on affected communities improve altitude enforcement and consider alternative routes including an all water route over the Atlantic Ocean the FAA will be required to hold a public hearing on the North Shore route and impacted communities and open a public comment period both of which the FAA has refused to do while renewing the route without consulting the public I strongly urge a yes vote and I yield back don't

president biden's getting heat from both sides democrats and republicans for meeting with the leader of saudi arabia to ask saudi arabia to produce more oil turning his back on domestic energy production wouldn't it be great if president biden lived like real people he shouldn't have to be begging others to produce oil when we could produce more energy here in louisiana and the rest of our country if the byte administration stopped stopping north american energy production i've said it before and again i'll i call for an operation warp speed for energy i'm told there's four wells that can be drilled within completed within 12 months and i was told that six months ago in the gulf of mexico not only is that producing north american energy and gas it's creating louisiana jobs is producing natural gas and oil for our refineries and i'm struck president biden is fine with other countries producing oil but not with allowing americans to produce our energy and for us to benefit from the high-paying jobs created and by the way there's no environmental argument for this the united states has the best environmental standards in the world when it comes to producing natural gas and oil gas prices are high in part because of this administration's assault on north american production of energy

Mr President during the Civil War Walt Whitman took stock of Abraham Lincoln's appearance the president had to face the poet wrote like a Hoosier Michelangelo but Whitman sensed that underneath the lines and the Crags were Wells of wisdom intact perfectly suited to the president hard-earned long ago you see Abraham Lincoln is widely regarded as one of our country's greatest presidents a Visionary an inspiring leader who appealed to the highest ideals of America and moved our nation toward a more perfect union Sunday Mr President marked the 214th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth and even today historians still wrestle with the question how was a man of such character forged the answer I think can be sent found in Southern Indiana near the Ohio River in 1860 when as for details of his youth by a biographer Abraham Lincoln was uncooperative it could all he said be condensed into a single sentence the short and simple annals of the poor that's all you or anyone can make of it Lincoln insisted but Mr President if you'll pardon me I'd like to make a little more of it now my colleagues from Kentucky will no doubt point out that Lincoln's birth occurred in their Commonwealth and as my colleagues from Illinois will likely remind you when Abraham Lincoln departed for the White House it was from their state and I'll give them this Lincoln was indeed born in Kentucky and he did make his name in Illinois but Abraham Lincoln was a Hoosier it was there I grew up he recalled of Southern Indiana it was there in Spencer County I grew to my present enormous height he once choked true there's little left that Abraham Lincoln would recognize in our state today just reminders of a once unbroken Forest among the low Hills the soil in it the graves of loved ones in a great River separating North from South in what does remain though we can still see where his character was formed what prepared him for the trials to come the Lincolns arrived the same year Indiana became a state it was still the frontier line the woods were full of Bears and the night air alive with the Roar of mountain lions it was a hard and heartbreaking life uncertain and often short those years of Abraham Lincoln's life were characterized by lost First lost his his mother Nancy and later his sister Sarah and by constant labor which he grew to sow dislike schooling was scarce opportunities for self-improvement were few and by his own account he had no more than a year of formal education decades later when Abraham Lincoln recalled his life in Indiana he wrote my childhood home I see again in saddened with the view but he also wrote that among the memories there was pleasure in it too there were happy days in the little Pigeon Creek community captivating friends with homespun stories and there was the love of a stepmother who nurtured his curiosity the sparse schooling he had taught him to read and to write in fact he poured over what few books he could find the Bible a tattered biography of George Washington borrowed from a neighbor and later a collection of Indiana laws containing the Declaration of Independence in the Constitution of the United States and there was the Ohio River that River was a Gateway of possibilities and a Point of Departure to to the outside world Lincoln earned his first half dollar faring passengers on the river he first saw the horror of slavery traveling down it by the time Abe Lincoln and his family left the little Pigeon Creek community in 1830 Lincoln had spent a quarter of his life in Indiana he crossed the Wabash River into Illinois a grown man whose heart touched by grief was kind generous and strong who could Spin A Yarn like no other whose intellect far out outpaced his meager education and of course he carried with him a great reverence for our founding's promise of freedom and a burning desire to rise in life though Lincoln was loathed to speak of it as he Grew Older those 14 years in Spencer County Indiana the sad and the joyous shaped him the qualities that saved the union and time of its greatest Peril they were forged in the Indiana wilderness in March of 1865 only a few weeks before Lincoln's death he addressed the 140th Indiana regiment the soldiers had recently captured a Confederate flag in North Carolina which the president gave to Indiana Governor Oliver Morton Lincoln reminded these Hoosiers assembled that he was raised in their state and he praised their Hoosier Valor but he was ever mindful of the Union he said that day I would not wish to compliment Indiana above other states well Mr President for whatever it's worth I do because Lincoln belongs to all Americans but Hoosiers can claim a special connection with Abraham Lincoln so on the occasion of his birth we once again celebrate the Life and Legacy of this remarkable Hoosier he represents the best of us he was one of us thank you Mr President

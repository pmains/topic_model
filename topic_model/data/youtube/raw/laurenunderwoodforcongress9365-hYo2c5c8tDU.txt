[Music] having lauren to look up to these past few years has had a profound impact on my life because of lauren i'll never let anyone tell me that i don't deserve what i've earned my job in congress is to listen and to learn and bring northern illinois values to washington when i think about this community's values i think about the relationships that we have with our neighbors when someone in our neighborhood faces an illness what do we do we deliver a meal train and when our neighbor goes out of town for a week we collect their mail we look out for one another and we treat each other with mutual respect because this this is our community these are our friends and neighbors and they are worth fighting for

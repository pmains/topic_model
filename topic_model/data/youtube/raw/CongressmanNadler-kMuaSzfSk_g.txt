you represent people congressman what do you think about that well it's it's interesting if people reject the concept of representation but there is no other concept unless you're back to the small Greek city-state you have to have a representative government it's got it hopefully it's a democratic government with a small D because otherwise what have you got so you have to work through representative government and the question is how do you make representative government work how do you eliminate or reduce the power of money which is destroying our democratic system those are the relevant questions you can't just reject them agretti government because there's no alternatives well I actually think we need to open the conversation about what democracy means and I think that's what the Occupy movements in the US the movements in Greece and Spain and all over the world have been doing is that if we have no say in our lives we regular people around economics war social questions all questions economic social political and then what what kind of democracy is a question degree that comes back to the power of money in politics exactly the power of corporate of corporations problems let me say one other thing about that II I very much believe in countervailing power right now you've got huge corporate power huge corporations dominating the world dominating the country certainly there are only two possible centers of countervailing power to so that human beings can deal with that with that power one is government the others labor unions and and you have to increase the power of both otherwise you're going to be slaves to corporation when you when you think about the employee Free Choice Act and the fact that it didn't happen in those in those first in that first year which was the window what is your understanding of why that why didn't happen well someone who voted for it and thought it was very very important and thinks it's one of the most important losses of the last couple of generations it didn't happen essentially because on the one hand you had the use of the filibuster and I hate when the press routinely reports these days they take 60 votes to pass something in the Senate that's anti-constitutional anti-democratic and and frankly unconscionable and has to be dealt with but that's a different question but you you had 60 Democratic votes three or four them weren't really Democratic votes you had no Republican support whatsoever there's no Republican support for anything to do with labor or with workers rights in the last 20 years and the administration tried but the private didn't put it pull out all the stops really now whether it could have had it pulled out all the stops is still a question and of course the increasing power of money in congressional elections had a heck of a lot to do with that and with everything else that goes on these days there also seems to me that there's one of the the relationship between the Democratic Party and labor obviously labor still provides a huge chunk of democratic votes in a race right but you you're caught in this vicious cycle right now which is that as union density declines it's a less important constituency and as it's a less important constituency you start to look at other constituencies who you can raise money from where you can get your votes and then you don't pursue the agenda of labor so much and then it's because you don't pursue the agenda of labor labor continues to decline very much want to follow that up parties changeover times the constituencies change over time their natures change over time the Republican Party today is an extraordinarily radical right-wing party on social issues and economic issues the Democratic Party today is an increasingly very liberal party on social issues and a less liberal party one could even argue semi conservative party on economic issues certainly if you take a look at film clips of Hubert Humphrey or John Kennedy or at least students and talking the fifty to see a rhetoric that you don't hear today and increasingly white working-class voters are not working and not voting their economic class interests the voting Republican the Democratic Party is becoming a coalition of upscale educated socially liberal people and and an upper income people and we're losing the constituency and therefore the influence within the party of people sensitive to labor issues and that's a tragedy

thank you so much ms osborne the city of faldosta under mayor mathison's leadership is interested in expanding microtransit opportunities can you talk about how for smaller cities like valdosta microtransit can be an innovation that improves quality of life yeah we're seeing a lot of experimentation uh in this and in a lot of areas covet just encouraged more uh experimentation which i guess is one good outcome um i know that folks in west sacramento have been also experimenting with using micro transit uh to support uh movement of people particularly in less dense areas of uh the city and we're learning a lot and what i am hoping is as uh these various communities experiment and learn we're able to put together uh what what their experience tells us so that we can better support uh the most effective ways to move people around whether it's through buses trains microtransit you know sneakers whatever it may be

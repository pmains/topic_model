thank you on Monday ranking member Cummings and I wrote you a letter sir about the majority's ongoing investigation into the investigation of former Secretary Clinton without objection I ask unanimous consent that our letter be placed into the record without objection it will be made a part of the wreck thank you for the first part of our letter discusses the department's failure to provide the minority with access to the documents you have already provided to the majority yes or no will you commit to ensuring that the minority that we receive equal access to any materials you may provide to this committee in the future yes and I believe we my understanding is that that information may have been provided to them guys at this point thank you I wanted I'd have to be I have a lot of questions the majority this committee the White House and President Trump's private attorneys have all called for the Department of Justice to appoint the new special counsel to investigate a number of Hillary Clinton related matters I think we could benefit from your experience and how the special counsel regulations work the regulations say the Attorney General or in your case the acting Attorney General will appoint the special counsel when you determine that one criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and to the investigation either presents a conflict of interest to the department or some other strong public interest requires you to us point to Special Counsel that first part when he or she determines the criminal investigation of a personal matter is warranted is that part of the regulation is optional know that it's okay regulations thank you so a criminal investigation must first be determined to be warranted before you can assign a special counsel to the matter yes thank you and that the Department of Justice a criminal investigation requires an initial assessment and a preliminary review of the evidence correct has that assessment been made with respect to former director Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton investigation I'm not going to comment on any investigations in the normal course before we made a determination we would conduct an appropriate review and I assume your answer would be the same if I ask you about the FBI's interaction with fusion GPS would be the same for any yes then presuming for a moment presuming for a moment that the depart conducted an initial assessment and found no predicate for a criminal investigation so in plain English there is no ongoing criminal investigation under this presumption could you or the Attorney General Sessions simply appoint a special counsel to look into these matters no as I said earlier to my knowledge there's been no credible factual or legal claim that anybody at the department violated any law by deciding not to bring charges or by attempting to meet with Fuzion GPS if that is true if there is no underlying criminal investigation because there is insufficient evidence of a crime in this or any other case do the regulations permit you to appoint the special counsel no thank you according to the department the office of the Inspector General informed special counsel Muller of the existence of these text messages between Peter struck and Lisa page on July 27th 2017 the texts you sent us last night Mr Muller immediately concluded the mr. structured no longer participate in investigation and he was removed from the team the same day did mr. Muller take appropriate action in this case yes he did thank you and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee you said that you would only fire a special counsel Muller for good cause and that you had not seen any yet several months of passed since then have you seen good cause to fire special counsel Muller no thank you if you were ordered today to fire mr. Muller what would you do so I've explained previously I would follow the regulation if there were good cause I would act if there were no good cause I would not and you've seen no good cause so far correct thank you on May 1st the office of legal counsel issued an opinion arguing that ranking minority members do not have the authority to conduct oversight unquote shortly thereafter Politico reported that the white House Counsel instructed federal agencies not to cooperate with oversight requests from Democrats since then Democrats on this committee have written more than 40 letters to administration without any meaningful response thus far can you clarify your current position on responding to letters from the minority and are you concerned that the department's May 1st opinion serves to justify a policy of stonewalling by the administration my position congressman is that we make every effort to respond to any legitimate inquiry from a member of Congress obviously we prioritize inquiries propounded by the chair on behalf of the committee but we'll make an effort to respond to any inquiry we get a lot of letters I'm sure and so I apologize if there's a prioritized after letters from the chair letters from noon already our goal is to respond to all those letters in a reasonable manner in fact when our new assistant attorney general Stephen Boyd took office there's quite a backlog would you encourage the office of legal counsel to withdraw its May 1st opinion I'll take a look at it congressman but as I said the without regard to what the law may require our policy is to try to I understand that but you would take a look at whether you would encourage the office of legal counsel to withdraw that May 1st opinion no I'm not committing to do anything I will agree to look at it okay thank you and finally I just want to say and follow up with what the chairman was saying about section 702 the bill that this committee reported specifically said you basically said it where you're doing a counterintelligence or foreign or terrorism investigation you don't need a warrant to quite to query section 702 data but where you're conducting an investigation of domestic crimes then like any other investigation of domestic crimes you would need a warrant so that the danger that I think you were referring to is taken care of by the bill and I endorse the comments of the Chairman to that effect and I think you should take a look at that I urge you to take a look at me thank you

well on the emergency supplemental at the border we've already in eight months exceeded or nine months we will have exceeded the highest numbers of unaccompanied children we ever had in an entire year before the shift from single individuals coming to the border which is where we were 10 years ago is dramatically toward families with children but remember the unaccompanied children are not families with children and in fact those families with children are now being processed sooner than they ever have been before but there are just more of them than anybody anticipated and so those agencies come through the administration and ask for more money and here we are weeks later without that money but then when you listen to the Democrat talking heads on this topic it's why isn't the administration doing a better job taking care of either unaccompanied children or families and the reason is they don't have any money we have exceeded numbers we've run out of money we have had plenty of notice to do something about this hopefully the entire Senate and the entire Congress will do what 30 of 31 Senate appropriators did last week get this done and solve this particular part of that crisis

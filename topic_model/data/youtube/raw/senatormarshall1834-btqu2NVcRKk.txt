tonight I'm happy to report to my constituents back in Kansas that the House passed significant legislation to deal with the issue of human trafficking I'm grateful to the probably four or five different people as I've done town halls I've reached out to me and specifically mention that we look into this legislation who brought it to my attention so we're very glad to to try to bring some attention this matter and work on it in Congress most of us when I mention human trafficking think about prostitution but unfortunately it's it's more than just that so it's hard to imagine but they target communities in rural Kansas because of the just the far away from some of the authorities so we're glad that we're able to pass legislation to support the local law enforcement officers as they investigate and prosecute these cases and I want to highlight that there is a national human trafficking hotline if you have any concerns about this issue it's one eight eight eight three seven three seven eight eight eight thank you everybody and have a great day [Music]

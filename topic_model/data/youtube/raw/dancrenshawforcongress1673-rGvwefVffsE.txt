- It's because I don't support finding problems where none exist. So this question really speaks
to a philosophical difference between the left and the right. And that is, on the left,
they come up with problems or even hypothetical problems and immediately look to
the Federal Government to solve that for society. On the right, we take
a different approach. We ask, first, is this a problem? And, if it is a problem,
whose is it to solve it? Is it society's job? Is it the local government job? Is it the state or the Federal Government? We are cautious.

senator Graham Thank You mr. chairman I think sir McCaskill made a point that I thought was very intriguing when people come forward and talk about being assaulted or bad working environment or completely two different things is there a system in place to capture those two different things of all the numbers we're talking about can you tell us from your services point of view of the numbers the thousands of whatever allegations they are being made out there how many of them fall into the category of inappropriate conduct versus a crime can you tell me that in the Coast Guard no sir I don't but stats or figures that I can give you and we can certainly do that for the record but just intuitively and anecdotally whenever we have somebody who is removed for command climate issues inevitably it goes much deeper and we find other I would guess I would just say command climate doesn't do justice to what we're talking about command climate is a hostile workplace to me a crime is a crime so to me how do you just how do we capture the difference between the sexual perpetrator who somehow got through the gates of straining in the military who's been able to survive and sometimes flourish in the military from doing performing their duties but yet have this this disposition that will destroy the military if not I not address how do we separate those two does anybody have any ideas make sure we understand the difference well sir I I agree with Senator McCaskill completely that there are two separate things we measure that are they be reporting in in a way what about the army right right now they're required to be reported together well I think how do we have to separate them we can start a really good place to start and we and we understand that because i don't want everybody in the country to think that every allegation is of rape now every allegation of you know i was inappropriately talk to it's very important needs to be dealt with that i was not treated right but i think there's a big difference between the two systems that she's describing and i don't believe there's any tolerance for anyone to allow someone who's a sexual predator to get anything other than and just as hard a hit as as we can give them so i would like to follow up on her question and y'all report back to us how you would create to tracking systems now about lay people making prosecutorial decisions that is a bit odd to the average person i mean in the civilian community decisions to prosecute individuals are made by trained lawyers sometimes elected sometimes appointed how would you justify this in the military they have such a different system i would just say that i think what we do in the military is very unique we're asked to do things that are very different than any other profession and that's why the UCMJ was originally created for us to have this unique relationship because of the good order and discipline that we often talk about and and and the unit cohesion that is necessary to do the things that we are asked to do would you agree when the military commander has authority that is hard to find a counter to into sovine that is correct very few of us have the authority to order somebody in the battle that's correct very few of us have the responsibility commanding people where they don't really get to discuss among themselves if this is a good idea from a Navy point of view I remember writing law school paper about the absolute authority of a naval commander at sea there was a case where a guy had been up for like 20 hours he went to sleep for two hours and the ship ran aground and a court-martial the commander why would you do that well we entrust in the community officer of the ship all of the people aboard and the ship itself the part of the nation and that authority and that delegate that delegated authority to the commanding officer is absolute and they are absolutely responsible for anything that goes on and all I would tell my colleagues the military is truly a different world general gross who picks the jury senator that's the convening authority is there any such things that juries one peers in the military it's it's it's different I mean they're everybody on the panel they're not going to get a jury of your peers that's correct they outrank they outrank the individual who's on trial in the case of an officer it's an all officer panel but every officer outranks the individual in the case have been enlisted they can elect to have an enlisted panel and part of the panel will be unless they will be all senior enlisted people that's correct the point is that court-martial panels are not jury of one's peers their juries made up of people who have expertise and knowledge and experience for the unit who are assigned to do justice in individual cases but have that command perspective because the whole point of military justice is to render justice and individual cases but to make sure the system is moving the unit forward as a whole and I understand this is a bit difficult to absorb for a lot of folks or not in the military but I would say that from my point of view that commanders do listen very closely to their Jags and it seems like the only cases that go forward or the bad cases I don't know why you would want to send a case to court-martial where Jack said we didn't think was good case can you tell us why you would do that general amis I'd be happy to Senator because there are times when I've sent a case forward when my jag is said sir we don't have enough compelling evidence it's a he said she said which quite honestly is it makes up an awful lot of our sexual assault cases there's alcohol involved it's complicated and I and I in those cases often had forwarded it to a court-martial ported to an article 32 then a court-martial because I'm going to let the jury the judge sort it out but I want to send a signal to the command that it's not tolerated in here because it may be he said she said to me but it may come clear in a matter of a court gotcha and one last question i'm over at the article 60 power the ability to set aside a finding or specification reduce the sentence you all agreed that that should be taken away from commanders in most cases to me that's internally inconsistent with your message to us in terms of the power of the commander how do you reconcile that senator if i can answer that i think that when the code was promulgated in 1950 was before substantial reforms that occurred in 1968 where we brought in train judges qualified lawyers to perform those roles and so I think that the the conditions that warranted that authority back in nineteen fifty coming out of our experience in World War two no longer pertain thank you

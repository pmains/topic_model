as the director president and CEO of the Wilson Center she was also a former congresswoman from California thanks for joining us J Thank You Ellie joining us now is the number two Democrats in the house House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer of the state of Maryland first we have to start with this breaking news pentagon confirming they detected a lot of allistic missile from North Korea your reaction sir well I think it makes more dramatic and more important that we action soon we just passed a very substantial sanctions bill I agree with Jane Harman the previous guest you had clearly it's much more difficult with North Korea but I think it's going to be also more compelling for China for Russia Japan South Korea and the entire Asian Pacific region to join together to put as much possible pressure on North Korea to reverse its path if it doesn't I think it's a very very dangerous future that we we look forward to congressman and we're going to we're going to at least that's a little more bipartisan than the issue that we've just come out of we earlier we talked to Tom Cole your your representative from Oklahoma Republican representative from Oklahoma let me just play a little of what he said about the next steps in health care okay I'll just tell you what he said he said now it's really up to Democrats to come forward and say these are the places we can work together and fix it he's talking about health care I'm open to that I'm happy to do that but I think they'll find it's a pretty hard system to fix what's your reaction to that because that's a line that started on the Senate floor last night with Mitch McConnell where he said all right now it's up to you you tell us how you're going to fix it well I think that's disingenuous we've told them how we're going to fix it we adopted the Affordable Care Act but we think it's been succeeding we think people with pre-existing conditions now get insurance we think 20 million people who didn't have insurance get insurance we think that preventive care is now covered and I could mention a lot of other aspects that we think have been very successful are there problems we have said from the beginning that there are things in the ACA the Affordable Care Act that need to be addressed and seems to me that's the starting point that's what's in law they said they were going to repeal it they said they were going to replace it they have not been able to replace it no reason they haven't been able to replace it is because so many of their members understand that the Affordable Care Act is working in many respects and therefore don't want to see jettison for instance Medicaid expansion Republican governors throughout the country thought that would be very very harmful to their people so I think it's disingenuous to say okay Democrats we failed to do something and now it's your turn now the fact is what what Mitch McConnell said was as you recall look if this doesn't pass we will have to work with Democrats by well I'm sorry the things he has to work with Democrats we're open to working with our Republican colleagues certainly I'm open to working with Tom Cole was a good friend of mine and we can move forward and there are things that need to be fixed the small market is not working as well as it should there are counties that don't have coverage we need to make sure that middle-class taxpayers are not driven out of the market because of cost we do that assuming the baton is passed to you what is the first fix or improvement Democrats would put forward well first of all we want to make sure that the CRS payments the payments to insurance companies for people who can't afford deductibles and co-pays would be made and they would be permanent and be funded and would be stable that would stabilize the market the reason Blue Cross Blue Shield has had a substantial increase in the state of Maryland they said half of the increase is related to the uncertainty that has been created by the Trump administration in terms of the mandate having everybody included in the insurance process and also by the payments to the insurance companies to amortize their costs so those are certainly two other places where we would start but we'll also start with talking to the it's about some of them they have talked about in terms of health savings account competition across state lines we understand they're in charge not us they're in charge and frankly had we won the election in 2010 which we didn't we got we got badly beaten as everybody recalls our expectation was that we were going to fix those things that were not perfect in the in the bill that was passed in 2010 and signed into law so we're ready to work with them and we're ready to work across the board on the issues that they identify but we're not prepared to kill the ACA which we think is working they're wrong and saying that it's imploding it is not in floating and it is working in almost every area of the country there are some areas that it's not and we need to work on those areas congressman good to talk to you thank you so much for being with us representative Sonny Hoyer of Maryland is the Democratic whip in the in the Congress

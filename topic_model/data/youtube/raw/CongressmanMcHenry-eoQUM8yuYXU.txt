hello friends this is congressman patrick mchenry the foundation of any great country is the proper education for its youth sadly this is an area where our country has fallen woefully behind the large federally backed education initiatives that we've had have done a real disservice to america's youth and it's long past time for a change in direction that's why this week we celebrate national school choice week to bring attention to the power of school choice school choice is a great equalizer that allows parents to do what they think is best for their children i strongly believe it should be the parents choice as to whether their child stays in an underperforming school or gets a better opportunity as former florida governor jeb bush pointed out in a recent op-ed consumer choices created the most powerful economy in the world the united states economy that's why we should be able to do the same very thing for our children i encourage everyone to learn more about school choice during this very important week thanks so much and god bless

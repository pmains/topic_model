join me right now as Texas congressman House Financial Services Committee member lands good and congressman's good to see you thanks so much for joining us good to see you what do you want to see out of this deal out of this trade talk conversation these next two days you know I want to see what I've been seeing from President Trump and that is continued toughness toward China the president understands that we've got to be tough on China because China they just haven't respected us and they don't they want these tariffs lifted but they also don't want to do things like deal with their the patent infringement the cheating that they've been a part of over the years they don't want that to stop so they're willing to give but I don't know that they're willing to give enough for President Trump to be happy with this and I love what he's doing I hope he continues it yeah I mean you know it's the first president that's actually changed the conversation on China and you know we've been talking about it though I've been saying for a long time that American CEOs have been so interested in getting their products in front of one point four billion people they forgot to protect the products and they forgot to the themes that they deem is so important in America due process of you know human rights etc so what do you say to some of these companies this morning that seems to be rolling over and getting bullied from the Chinese People's Liberation Army yeah I would say remember remember the past because it's going to repeat itself I mean the Chinese we don't have any idea how these companies run they don't have an SEC they don't have financials that are available to the US we don't have any idea how much a state influence or state funds are going into these competitors that US companies are competing with they haven't been playing fair and if we're just going to roll over because we don't like the recent tariffs and we think that we can't take it anymore then we're just gonna go back to the way things were and what was the point of all of this so I think we've got to continue to be tough and and say that enough is enough let me move on to Facebook's digital currency plan you have called on Zuckerberg to testify since the original Facebook Libre hearing back in July Zuckerberg will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on October 23rd to answer your questions about the company's proposed libre cryptocurrency paypal has already withdrawn the support their MasterCard and Visa are reportedly questioning their involvement what do you want to see I know you've been pushing for Zuckerberg to testify what do you want to ask him you know I want to ask him how much involvement he has with this plan moving for it I want to ask what their plans really are for the future how do they intend to ensure that the u.s. dollar remains strong chairwoman waters Maxine Waters and Donald Trump actually seem to have agreed on the concept of these crypto currencies that there's too much unknown that the potential to destroy the US dollar is very strong and there were a lot of questions that their spokesmen didn't seem to have answers for and so Maxine Waters myself and a few other members of the committee we went to Switzerland back in August we talked with the members of the Commission that were expected to really play a part in this they didn't have great answers and so we're hoping to Facebook can really put some concerns to rest bipartisan concerns that are important for the American people any thoughts on the other issues around around social media I mean congressman Devin Nunez really sued Twitter in the Virginia court back in March and he seems to have gotten a victory this week he calls them a content creator you've got Tulsi Gabbard suing suing Google for censoring conservative conversation is really what Devin Nunez is saying but Tulsi Gabbard is not saying much different saying that their censorship going on what do you want to say yeah god this is one of the few issues that Democrats and Republicans are both in unison on Democrats don't trust Facebook for various reasons Republicans don't trust Facebook because they censor censor our communication across the country when it comes to campaigns and election so it's really fascinating that this is one of the few issues that both Democrats and Republicans seem to have an issue with you don't run by a bunch of liberals I mean can you do you believe that they should be immune from getting sued that they are just platforms yeah no I think they should absolutely be held responsible and then the other thing with all these issues with their social media if we can't run a social media platform why would we want to go out and run a gigantic cryptocurrency platform that we want the whole world to be a part that's again that PayPal MasterCard Visa these big prestigious players are pulling out I think is an indication that this is heading in the wrong direction for Facebook perhaps mr. Zuckerberg will have some enlightening information in a few weeks and I'm grateful to him for appearing I think that speaks volumes all right so you got an agreement on that but there's not a lot of agreement elsewhere this impeachment inquiry is creating uncertainty for many of president Trump's proposals like us MCA so what do you think is anything gonna get done will Nancy Pelosi bring you associate to the floor and will it pass you know I think everyday is an unpredictable unprepared for a day it seems with the Democrats the us MCA agreement is the one issue that I have found that my colleagues across the aisle are actually in agreement for they're frustrated that their speaker has not brought it up and said let's get this out but you know Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to give the president a win on anything unless her liberal wing of the caucus approves it and they haven't approved it yet so with respect to China all these agreements what a shame that our president can't go into these agreements from a standpoint of force because he's dealing with impeachment when other world leaders see that our president is having to deal with impeachment and also world leaders don't in other countries they don't know what impeachment proceedings really entail they don't realize that this whole thing is a sham and it's going to die in the Senate whenever that happens so it's it's a real shame that our president is having to deal with this when he's having these high-level discussions with China when he's in New York at the UN but back to your original question what are we going to get done between now and Christmas with the Democrats running the show I'm not real confident that anything happens that's too bad congressman it's good you see this morning thanks very much Thank You congressman Lance good and joining us coming up

at a time when we're doing all that we can do to rein in spending decrease our deficit and strengthen our economy it's imperative that we look for ways to get better results for less money through outer federal programs and all of our legislative initiatives as chairman of the Subcommittee on federal financial management I look in every nook and cranny of the federal government for ways to save taxpayer money by targeting wasteful spending fraudulent or abusive activity by focusing on reducing or eliminating waste fraud abuse and efficiency we're able to save and recover scarce financial resources that preserve and strengthen our nation's vital programs like Medicare Medicaid and our defense operations ultimately though solving our nation's fiscal challenges will require the federal government to transition from what I call a culture of spendthrift to a culture of thrift and every federal program that we administer we can be better stewards of taxpayers money unfortunately there's no silver bullet to rooting out waste and fraud but there are many bipartisan and common sense approaches the government can take to begin to see real results and that's what we're going to do a lot of people think that there's only two ways to reduce budgets deficits and one of those is to cut spending the others to raise taxes there's at least two other ways and one of those is to grow the heck out of the economy and to a lot of the things promote trade promote exports and trying to do that with the adoption of the three free trade agreements of this earlier this this month the other thing that we need to do is really look at everything we do and say in federal government and say can we do this better is there a way to get a better result out of this everything I do I know I can do better I think the same is true federal programs and we just have to figure out what works do more of that or doesn't work and do less of that just common sense and as my father used to say just use some common sense he'd be pleased to know that it finally sunk in for me select committee of 12 senators and representatives was formed in an effort to try to realize at least another 1.2 trillion dollars in deficit reduction over the next ten years in my view that's not enough and I want us to go big I want the committee to go begging to consider a whole broad range of ideas among the the ideas that I submitted bipartisan ideas that I worked on in some cases for many years among those are the the need to adopt the make the president's line-item veto powers real to to go into Medicare and Medicaid in and find ways to reduce some of the tens of billions of dollars in fraud some of the tens of billions and dollars in just over payments miss payments inefficiencies to be able to to look at all the tens of thousands of pieces of surplus properties that we don't use we don't need we ought to get rid of them and save the federal government billions of dollars to look at all the IT programs information technology programs we have we probably have twice as many data centers as we need and we need to reduce those consolidate those to save to save again billions of dollars there are a lot of common sense things that we can do they're supported by Democrats and Republicans in many cases are supported by the administration we just need to do them and I am trying to bring them to the attention of super committee so that when they make their recommendations and present everything back to the Congress the president they'll include these ideas well the Attorney General of our country Eric Holder estimates that that fraud in the Medicare alone may exceed 50 billion dollars this year in some cases we have dead doctors whose ID numbers are still being used to write prescriptions in some cases for two dead people that for controlled substances that are in some cases not used to make anybody better or well but to really generate money tens of millions of dollars of money for the for the legal drug industry we've got to be smarter about protecting first of all provide Medicare provider IDs making sure that we actually have an accurate list of folks folks providers rural I've or dead and also to make sure that when beneficiaries die that we don't continue to provide benefits to to them it's enormously expensive we we we can be we ought to be with today's technology we can be a lot smarter than it the other thing is with controlled substance we we found that that for the help of the general Accountability Office it we're wasted about 150 million dollars a year Justin prescriptions doctor shopping going to countless pharmacies for people who don't in some cases they have addiction problems but other cases they just want to get their hands on these drugs to be able to sell them into the dog market and today was today's technology we can largely stop that and we're going to we're going to be a strong vibrant economy going forward in the the 21st century we need to try to provide a a productive workforce of men and women who can read write thank yous technology proficient in math and science and a lot of cases if that means post-secondary training we spend enormous amounts of money in pell grants federal student loans GI Bill something called tuition assistance which helps the people on active duty in the military to anything get a better education some cases they get every dime we get every dime sword for Alva all the benefits that we're buying and paying for too many cases we have misaligned the incentives in what we're doing is incentivizing with federal dollars not the education of people so that they get a degree or certificate that enables them to go out and be gainfully employed and and provide for themselves and their families contribute to the society but there were incentivizing colleges and universities a lot of cases these for-profit colleges and universities just to get people through the door sign them up and not really do a very good job of getting them make sure you get an educational enable them ultimately to to contribute we're going to stop that and we're going to stop that by making sure that the no college or university whether they're for-profit private or public receives a hundred percent of the revenues from the federal government that's crazy and I we did stock the kind of thing I would count this as a governor and certainly not water I want to do is the United States Senator I mean Vince Lombardi used to be football coach for the Green Bay Packers he's a great coach he also said some memorable things one of things he used to say if you're not keeping score you're just practicing another way to say that is what we measure we manage and in the case the Department of Defense they don't measure very well and we they don't have the ability to actually produce audible financials they've never been able to they're not anytime anywhere close to doing that they don't do a very good job in accounting systems or a lot of cases inventory systems the it's burns me up that we spend ten times more for a helicopter door then we ought to be and in as it turns out we actually have a year's worth of those in inventory we did so know what cell what's in our inventory and repay these outrageous amounts of of money god bless Leon Panetta our new Secretary of Defense who used to be chairman the House Budget Committee I served with him in the house he was chief of staff to President Clinton he was also head of the Office of Management and Budget in that administration this is a guy who gets it who understands that what we measure we can manage and he's going to he's working literally hand in glove with us changing the culture in the Department of Defense so that they will not only be good war fighters but also be big but much better stewards of their financials and I'm just enormously encouraged with that

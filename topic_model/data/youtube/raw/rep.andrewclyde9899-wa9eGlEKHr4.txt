welcome to the show all right according to the CDC we've mentioned this before fentanyl poisoning is now the number one cause of death in U.S adults 18 to 45. now we have attorney generals uh from 18 different states asking President Biden in a letter to make fentanyl uh designation under a weapon of mass destruction if Biden did this as you know foot and all would become it would trigger more agencies to get involved like the Department of Homeland Security you are on the homeland security committee do you think this is the right move well Lindsay thank you for uh having me on I will tell you that fentanyl is a massive crisis for this country right now uh 107 000 people just in 2021 died from drug overdoses and and uh about 70 000 of those from synthetic opioids like fentanyl so just think about 70 000 people a year dying from Fentanyl and the the uh number that you mentioned about the amount of fentanyl that came across the border twelve thousand pounds just 2200 pounds coming across in August alone I mean this is a very very serious issue for the United States uh and most of it is coming from China our arch enemy you think that China's is sending fentanyl into our country pouring it into our country to kill our people and that's exactly what happened is happening and now you're seeing um it being died and being processed to look like candy and with that you know they're targeting the younger folks and as you mentioned just that itty-bitty amount of it the the weight of a mosquito is just enough is enough to kill an individual I mean the amount of fentanyl that has come across in just this last year would kill 2.9 billion people that's eight times the population of the United States it is a huge issue and we need to do everything that we possibly can to stop it and I think the number one way to do that is to secure our Southern border uh the bideness policies of an open border right now are what is drawing fentanyl into our country so I think the current Administration is is responsible for this you know if we had a border wall if we had a secure border we wouldn't have fentanyl coming into our country we wouldn't have 70 000 people annually dying from fentanyl or synthetic opioid poisoning this is a it's just it's inexcusable for the bind Administration to do this or to allow this and just for no as well Congressman in 2013 there were only two pounds of fentanyl that came across our Southern border just in comparison this is clearly a massive national issue DEA administrator Ann Milgram she was asked about Republicans laying blame on the bite Administration here was her response Republicans have been incredibly critical of the Border policy they say all this fentanyl is coming in because of the Biden administration's border policies what do you say to that first of all we of course defer to the Department of Homeland Security that has a responsibility for the Border our job is to dismantle the cartels yeah all right so the point you just brought up brought up she dismisses do you think this Administration is taking it seriously enough no not at all this this Administration is not taking this opioid crisis seriously uh in fact you know she did not answer the question it was a very valid question I think it's a very important question that needs to be asked in the bind Administration is literally not only not doing anything about it but they're actually incentivizing illegal immigration in our nation and with illegal immigration comes you know drugs in backpacks coming from from illegals that are coming across the border I mean her vice president um Harris to say that our border is secure is just literally you know that's that's disrespecting the American people I mean because that's just an outright lie we know it's not a secure border I mean this the border patrol knows it's not secure and above all the illegal aliens and the cartels know it's not secure so they are pushing pushing drugs across our Southern border which is wide open and that's killing Americans causing you know safety issues in every community in our nation Congressman Andrew Clyde I wish we had more time because there's so much more to talk about on this topic especially uh at uh we have Halloween approaching with this fentanyl crisis hope to have you back soon thank you for your time tonight thank you Lindsay

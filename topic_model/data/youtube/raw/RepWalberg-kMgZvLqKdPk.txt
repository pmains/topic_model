i rise in support of the amendment and the nature of substitutes and would like to thank my colleague representative blunt rochester as well as the committee for their hard work on this important topic and including our bill in today's markup the digital world has increasingly become a more integral part of our lives and sadly seniors are often the target of scammers fraudsters who seek to steal the earnings our seniors have spent a lifetime to achieve frequent frequently fraudsters will ask seniors to send the police through gift cards retailers have been doing their part to combat these crimes their ability to educate their employees with best practices and training to recognize the signs of a scam can make a huge difference in stopping scammer the stop seemer senior scam act builds upon the work retailers are doing by creating a federal adviser council at the ftc to help coordinate the efforts of government consumer advocates and industry to create a unified front against criminals targeting our most vulnerable citizens and stop this fraud before it's too late safeguarding vulnerable seniors needs to be a top priority and i am pleased the committee is taking an important action to protect our older americans not only in michigan but across the country i encourage adoption of the amendment and nature of a substitute and the underlying bill and i yield back

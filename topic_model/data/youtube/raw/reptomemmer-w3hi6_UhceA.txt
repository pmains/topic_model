i recognize the gentleman from minnesota mr emmer thank you chair sherman and ranking member heizinga uh i am well let's see i was pleasantly surprised and i'm proud to see my bill the main street growth act noticed for this hearing the main street growth act would allow the securities and exchange commission to provide for the creation of venture exchanges so that small and medium cap companies can go public through a more streamlined process this bill passed out of this committee unanimously in 115th congress and it passed the house as well in fact i'd like to thank chair sherman mr scott mr himes mr foster mr meeks mr gottheimer and mr gonzalez on this subcommittee for voting in support of this bill and i hope to have your support again look we have a capital formation problem in this country and ultimately the compliance burden borne by government over regulation is making the initial public public offering process unrealistic for a large segment of private american companies this hurts everyday american investors the most much like mr pivavar and representative gonzalez were just talking about small private companies that need capital are at a disadvantage today because the trading and listing environment is geared so much for much larger uh ipo companies than it was 25 years ago how do we know the participation the ipo process has significantly declined since the 1990s let's look at the facts the number of ipos declined more than 63 percent from the 1990s to the 2000s and has stayed relatively flat up to 2020. at the same time the united states has doubled the regulatory compliance costs the business has to take on for going public in a traditional ipo just to give an idea it costs an average of 2.5 million dollars for a company to achieve just the initial regulatory compliance for going public and then it's an additional 1.5 million on an annual basis thereafter these are sec estimates in the past two years we've seen a surge in companies going public through alternative strategies like spax indicating that the traditional ipo process is not feasible for emerging innovative companies the small startup ipo should not be on the super highway designed for trading apple and microsoft we need to move away from the one-size-fits-all sec regulatory posture and allow the market to try new innovative strategies after all capital formation starts when a company can list its shares on a quality electronic venue plugged into the full force of america's investment potential i appreciate my colleagues willingness to advance legislation that creates new exchanges tailored to small and medium cap companies because exchanges are integral in the capital formation process and america's capital markets are the envy of the world the broader discussion of this hearing i worry centers around making it harder for exchanges to operate which could impose barriers on the new small competitors in the venture exchange space and ultimately make our capital markets less competitive and accessible when we set up structures that allow for more companies to go public we give the american people more access to our capital markets we give them more opportunities to build financial wealth mr p bavar do you believe that our legislation the main street growth act can eliminate some of the barriers currently deterring small emerging growth companies from going public uh thank you congressman uh yes you you pointed out the um you know the streamlined ipo process and so those are for existing private companies that do want to go public in addition as you point out um it it also addresses the fact that um that the exchanges the the trading system is set up for the larger uh public companies and and and frankly um you know the exchanges don't have the incentive to try to do innovative things like you said an experiment because of unlisted trading privileges so in your bill you would give exclusive trading rights to the venture exchange now you know the commission looking at that they're gonna you know it's gonna be very very look at that very very carefully um and and and we need to be very careful for that the reason for that is you want to encourage the experimentation by the exchanges to compete with one another to do to make the market uh more conducive uh for that and so it is my hope that that would be the case you know that you mentioned tick sizes and potentially doing call markets instead of continuous trading but there's probably some other things the exchanges could do if they were granted that exclusivity a great point and on that note with a majority of american companies searching for alternative avenues from the traditional ipo process to form capital such as spax as i referred to earlier or simply staying private do you believe that there is a timely need for congress to pass this legislation uh in a word yes um you know whatever we can you can do at congress and in the sec can do to encourage more companies to go public at the at the appropriate time you mentioned spax right another one is direct public listings and those are instances where you have companies that have grown very large in the private sector and the only reason why they're going public is to have a liquidity event they don't even need to raise capital at that point so the more the better thank you appreciate it thank you mr chair thank you

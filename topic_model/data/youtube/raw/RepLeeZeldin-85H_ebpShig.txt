oh good morning everybody and thank you for coming out we have at least 19 members of Congress who will be introducing today a 12-page house resolution detailing misconduct at the highest levels of Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation it will be outlining FISA abuse how and why the Hillary Clinton and how and why the Trump Russia probe began solution also calls for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate the gross misconduct with the understanding that the Justice Department cannot be expected to investigate itself it's very important to note that the ranks of the DOJ and FBI are filled with amazing patriotic Americans who love their job take their oaths seriously and perform their jobs objectively with much respect for the rule of law these are historic legendary agencies that require transparency and accountability regarding the misconduct that took place it is important for these exceptional public servants to end these important agencies to continue their work moving forward stronger than ever before as the resolution states the concerns of the American people are serious and the issues requiring an immediate unbiased independent and thorough investigation are broad in just the past few days we learned that the DOJ FBI or both appear to have planted at least one person into the dot into Donald Trump's presidential campaign to infiltrate and surveil the campaign this action alone reminds us of just how necessary this resolution is as well as the appointment of a second special counsel first we will discuss some of them as conduct related to how and why the Hillary Clinton did then we will get into details relate to the FISA abuse that took place and finally we will discuss the misconduct with regard to the how and why the Donald Trump Russia Pro began with regards to Secretary Clinton thorough law and State Department rules regulations and protocol were violated with her use of a private email server in our Chappaqua New York home official communications were transmitted on an unsecured server and included emails that contain classified information when they were sent in addition other emails which were retroactively Lee deemed classified by the Department of State former FBI director James Comey has acknowledged that 65 of these illicit emails were classified as secret and 22 were classified as top secret their significant evidence that the use of the this private server by Secretary Clinton was meant to avoid compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 5 USC 552 and done to obstruct justice by not having to turn over incriminating emails in the case of a subpoena various sensitive emails subject to grand jury and congressional subpoenas were destroyed on secretary Clinton's private server through the use of bleach bit software and the destruction of hardware before they could be obtained by investigators in March 2015 in a September 2015 meeting between then Attorney General Loretta Lynch and then director Comey the Attorney General instructed director Comey to refer to the clinic mail investigation as a matter thus watering down the severity of the investigation and aligning the Justice Department's rhetoric with the messaging of the Clinton campaign Cheryl Mills who served as counselor and chief of staff to Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State was offered immunity from prosecution exchange for access to her laptop that contained many of the questionable emails before NIA transcripts obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee former director Comey was prepared to exonerate Hillary Clinton as early as April or May of 2016 when he began to draft a statement announcing the end of his investigation before up to 17 key witnesses including Secretary Clinton herself and several other closest out aides were even interviewed Comey contradicted these transcripts when he stated during sworn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on September 28 2016 that he made the decision not to recommend criminal charges for Secretary Clinton after she was interviewed by the FBI on July 2nd 2016 director Comey in the final draft of his statement allowed FBI agent Peter struck to replace grossly negligent which is legally punishable in a federal law with extremely careless which is not legally punishable under federal law federal law states gross negligence in handling handling the nation's intelligence can be punished criminally with prison time or fines there's also the June 27 2016 infamous meeting between Angie Lynch and former President Bill Clinton aboard her plane on the tarmac in Phoenix Arizona immediately thereafter Hillary Clinton was exonerated on July 5th 2016 director Comey violated DOJ rules and unilaterally exonerated then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a public statement to the media one day later on July 6 the 2016 announcement followed from a G Lynch that the DOJ investigation into then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would be formally closed with no charges in September 2016 the FBI during examination of the personal laptop a former Congressman Anthony Weiner is part of an unrelated investigation into him sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl discovered previously unexamined Department of State classified emails belonging to his spouse talked Clinton aide Hume Abidine it took until October 28th of 2016 for director Comey to announce via a letter to the chairs of the relevant congressional committees that he was reopening the investigation to Hillary Clinton an additional egregious delay after the FBI failed to even examine the illicit emails at the FBI discovered them on Anthony Weiner's computer FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe's wife dr. Jill McCabe was running for Virginia State Senate at the time and as of October 26th had received 675 thousand dollars in donations from the Virginia Democratic Party in common good VA the leadership pack controlled by Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe a longtime Clint associate an investigation conducted by the Office of the DOJ Inspector General noted that on October 27th of 2016 director Comey required that deputy director McCabe remove himself from a conference call regarding the Clinton emails discovered on Anthony Weiner's laptop to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest after media reports surfaced noting those questionable political donations further investigation to whether then FBI director deputy director McCabe and other FBI officials sought to purposely delay the release of these illicit emails for politically motivated purposes is warranted throughout the Obama administration that DOJ failed to fully investigate serious concerns surrounding former President Clinton then Secretary of State Clinton and the Clinton Foundation's connection to the Russian company uranium one which received Department of State approval to purchase u.s. uranium mines in 2010 throughout Hillary Clinton's tenure Secretary of State a Family Foundation controlled by the chairman of uranium Wan made two million three hundred fifty thousand dollars in contributions to the Clinton Foundation which were not publicly disclosed in violation of an agreement Secretary Clinton had with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors in 2010 while Russian state interests were working to both acquire a majority stake in uranium 1 and to purchase American mines Bill Clinton was paid five hundred thousand dollars for a speech in Moscow by a Kremlin linked Russian investment bank that was underwriting uranium 1 stock a confidential informant who worked with the FBI to uncover bribery and other corruption related to the uranium one matter was threatened with reprisal by the Justice Department under AG Lynch when he tried to come forward in 2016 the Senate Judiciary Committee launched a probe in October 2017 to investigate the uranium one matter including whether federal departments and agencies such as Department of State knew the FBI was looking into possible corruption before the deal was approved an investigation conducted by the Office of the Inspector General noted that a multi-state investigation into the questionable dealings of the Clinton Foundation with corrupt owners was shut down in August of 2016 when pressure was asserted on the FBI by senior officials within the Obama Justice Department the same IG report also noted that shutting down this investigation into Clinton Foundation impropriety and influence peddling was connected to high-ranking officials in the DOJ and FBI including AG Lynch director Comey and Deputy Director McCabe the same.i G's report also found the Deputy Director McCabe after consenting to the political pressure to shut down the Clinton Foundation multi-state investigation attempted to later use unauthorized leaks to the press to create a false narrative that he was opposed to the closure of the investigation that he did this an attempt to salvage his reputation following revelations of questionable Clinton connect and money being donated to the to his wife's Virginia State Senate campaign with regards to Phi's abuse in October 2016 the FBI and DOJ used politically biased unverified sources to obtain warrants issued by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of review the FISA Court they aided in the surveillance of US citizens including quarter-page the warrants grant us intelligence and law enforcement agencies sweeping power to collect bulk information and conduct about collection which results in surveillance of a broad array of private communications from the past present and future including those of US citizens not specifically targeted in the FISA authorized warrant to obtain these warrants FBI DOJ officials submitted an unverified dossier prepared by Christopher Steele to the FISA Court failing to disclose that Christopher Steele was hired by the firm fusion GPS which was hired by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign to prepare this dossier and that the source was unreliable and soon thereafter was going to be terminated as a source the FISA Court was not informed that Christopher Steele was actively opposed to the election of Donald Trump that he was the unnamed source cited in the media reports that the FBI used to corroborate his dossier and that fusion gps had been hired to perform previous anti-trump research efforts in 2015 the woods' procedures which are the FBI's mandatory vetting process required for all FISA warrant applications instituted to ensure that all the facts contained in an application are accurate and verified to clearly support probable cause for a warrant were not followed former director Comey admitted in sworn testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee On June 8th of 2017 that material contained in the steel dossier was known to be both salacious and unverified since FISA warrant applications are rarely turned down are almost never subject to appeal are presented in closed court with no public record where the government is not challenged by any defense it is imperative that the government take extra care to validate the information being utilized to build their case before they take the extraordinary step of waiving rights of a US citizen without his or her knowledge or the opportunity to present a defense at the FISA Court the government has a responsibility not only to provide the best evidence in support of its case but also the best evidence against its case these deeply flawed in questionable FISA warrant applications utilizing illicit sources and politically biased intelligence were approved by the DOJ and FBI officials at the highest levels before being submitted to the FISA Court it was further not disclosed to the FISA Court that the wife fourth ranking DOJ official Bruce or worked for fusion GPS and that Christopher Steele directly transmitted the dossier and other information through Bruce or for submission to the FISA Court with regards the Trump Russia probe to this day there has not been any evidence that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win the 2016 election in fact there is an evidence that president Trump committed any crime to win the 2016 election the initial FBI probe into the Trump campaign and alleged collusion with Russia was launched in July 2016 based on questionable and insufficient intelligence and biased motivations as we've learned in recent days the DOJ FBI or both appeared to have planted at least one person into Donald Trump's presidential campaign to infiltrate and surveil the campaign text messages exchanged between FBI agents truck and FBI counsel Lisa Paige during the period of August 16 2015 to May 17th 2017 contains serious evidence of political bias and the improper handling and investigations within the agency the texts contain egregious evidence of bias including lisa page stating quote Trump should go F himself and Peter struck stating quote F Trump those text messages were not stored within the FBI archive system an egregious oversight blamed on a technical glitch and even after these messages were partially recovered by the bureau's IG in January of 2018 many unanswered questions remain regarding impropriety and bias former director Comey prepared a series of seven memorandum containing classified information including notes on his conversations with President Trump Comey admitted in sworn testimony to the Senate Committee on Intelligence On June 8th 2017 that he had leaked this content to a personal friend and encouraged that friend to share the material with the press in order to trigger a special counsel investigation an investigation conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee later reveal that the personal friend of director Comey was professor Daniel Richmond of Columbia Law School and that director Comey provided him with four of the seven memorandum director Comey's actions are a clear violation of non-disclosure agreements he signed as a condition of his appointment and a clear violation of FBI protocols regarding a dissemination of sensitive information outside of the bureau which are based on provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 in March 2018 former FBI director McCabe was fired by Attorney General's Jeff Sessions who noted that Deputy Director McCabe lacked candor including under oath on multiple occasions and had partaken in unauthorized disclosure to the news media among other violations note in a report issued by the office of the IG after a wide-reaching investigation into deputy director McCabe's conduct a myriad of DOJ and FBI personnel had been fired or demoted or had been resigned or have resigned including FBI director Comey deputy director McCabe chief of staff to the director James rebecky FBI general counsel James Baker FBI agent struck FBI counsel page FBI special agent Josh Campbell DOJ senior official or FBI assistant director Michael Cort an and Assistant Attorney General Peter Kazakh the DOJ has failed to timely comply with several related document requests by Congress providing members of Congress with heavily redacted versions of some but not all the documents demanded an offering members limited in-person viewing of these documents as an inadequate response to repeated requests after months of delay by the DOJ as I prepare to introduce my colleagues for their remarks in conclusion I would just like to point out that while many in the media and American public have been trying to bring down the president without evidence the president Trump colluded with Russia to win the election there is a ton of actual evidence of real misconduct that those same people have been attempting to completely sweep under the rug I believe in equal scales of justice that no one is above the law that includes anyone regardless of last name and that even includes people at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI especially when misconduct is committed in the performance of their duties while trying to take down elected officials and candidates no official at the Justice Department can ever allow their own political bias to overwhelm their own objectivity and responsible performance of the duties a second special counsel must be appointed and transparency and accountability is demanded for these great legend or legendary historic agencies with that we are confident that these great agencies will be able to move forward stronger than ever were before at this time I would like to introduce congressman mark meadows please thank you so much for the resolution the leadership that it takes and so to be clear it is the intent of all of the co-signers of this resolution to make a request of our leadership to bring this resolution to the House floor to be voted on to appoint a second special counsel it is also the position of many in this group that the attorney general jeff Sessions should read look at his decision to not appoint a second special counsel the only thing that we have from mr. Huber to evidence his work so far is an accumulation of frequent flier miles there has been no reports no no investigation to speak of and I can tell you that it is deeply troubling when we talk about transparency that we're not getting transparency from the FBI and the Department of Justice that transparency that many times goes without saying rod Rosenstein in the Department of Justice on a number of occasions when they could tell the truth remain silent when director Comey was out there on his book tour talking about the fact that he had a friend that he shared the memo with rod Rosen Stein knew that it was not just a friend but indeed it was a special government employee when director Comey was out there talking about the fact that he only shared it with one friend rod Rosen Stein knew that he had actually shared it with more than that and yet the Deputy Attorney General remained silent and when a number of us brought up the fact that there were redactions of material facts back in January rod Rosen saw again was silent now perhaps he's not silent when it comes to spinning his narrative even today we continue to see leaks come out of the Department of Justice and FBI spinning a narrative that quite frankly is not supported by the facts so it's time that we get to the facts it's time that we appoint a second Special Counsel and I think the leadership of mr. Zeldin and all of those who have co-sponsored it is time for transparency and it's time to allow the American people to know the truth FBI director James Comey has been fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has been fired FBI general counsel Jim Baker has been demoted reassigned FBI director of counter Deputy Director of counterintelligence Peter struck has been demoted and reassigned FBI counsel Lisa Paige demoted and reassigned what did all these fire demoted and reassigned people do while they were in the Obama administration they're the ones who ran the Clinton investigation and they're the ones who launched an investigation into president Trump's campaign and when they launched that investigation what did they do they took this dossier dressed it all up made it look like it was legitimate intelligence took it to a secret court to get a secret warrant to spy on a fellow American citizen and when they went to the court they didn't tell him important facts like who paid for the document hmm didn't tell him the DNC in the Clinton campaign paid for didn't tell him that the guy who wrote the document had been fired by the FBI and yet they took it to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on a fellow American citizen loosely associated with the Trump campaign and now we learn that they possibly paid informants to spy on the Trump campaign when we when you and I go to court we have to give the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth they didn't do that when they took the dossier to the court and now we learn it possibly they paid informants to spy on the Trump campaign and never forget this fact in all those text messages back and forth between Lisa Paige and Peter struck we have that one on September 2nd 2016 where they say POTUS President Obama POTUS wants to know everything we're doing and the operative word there is everything that's a pretty darn big category and we're supposed to believe we're supposed to believe the Department of Justice can handle this that's what they tell us don't worry we can investigate ourselves we can handle this trust us we'll be just fine really think about this question can rod Rosenstein oversee an obstruction of justice investigation into the firing of James Comey when he's the guy who wrote the memo recommending the firing of James Comey so this this res we've been pushing for 10 months for this and I want to applaud congressman Zeldin for bringing the resolution to floor and chairman Meadows is exactly right this should be brought to the floor we should vote on it and we should tell the DOJ we are sick and tired of the runaround we've been getting from you guys it is time to have a special if this fact pattern doesn't warrant a second special counsel somebody tell me what does somebody tell me what does so this is exactly what is needed and I appreciate the gentleman's leadership and I want I want this just like the chairman said on the floor as quick as it possibly can get and we can tell the American people we're gonna do everything it takes to get answers to the questions that they have the IG is supposedly looking into a lot of this stuff and while I think that the IG there's a there's a report enroll for the IG and I don't think the IDS work is mutually exclusive from over trying to do the fact of the matter is the IG is not equipped with the tools to be able to get the full set of facts because he doesn't have subpoena power isn't able to bring people from outside the agency and he certainly doesn't have any tools to hold anybody accountable for violations of law I'm eagerly awaiting the IG report that's been going on for almost 15 16 months about the Hillary case and maybe someday there'll be an IG report with some of this that will be beneficial but it is not sufficient in order to get accountability and I've you know some people say hey these special counsels they're unruly it's just not a good idea understand there's a difference between some of the things like Ken Starr and back in the 80s when you had an actual Independent Counsel which I think was unconstitutional Justice Scalia did but that was operating out true supervision of the executive branch robert muller he's a DOJ employee basically he is not an independent they're not supposed to be he's a special counsel supposedly supervised by rod Rosenstein I think the reason why this investigation has become unruly and you're getting into anything under the Sun is because Rosen Stein never identified a crime to be investigated at the outset and he's not done anything to keep Muller on target I think basically Muller tells Rosen Stein what to do so with the special counsel with what we're asking for here I don't want them involved in all kind of extraneous stuff answer the core questions I investigate potential violations of law and then move on or hold people accountable that's the way this should be done and if you had somebody who was supervising that and was serious about keeping the trains on time then you can do this in a way that I think can be done much more expeditiously than some of these things have previously Thanks thank you I too am so grateful to leaves Elvin for his leadership on bringing this resolution we do need a vote on it quickly and that has to be on the floor you know back when Muller was appointed there was nobody any more outraged than I was I knew of the damage he had done to the FBI he had purged the FBI of thousands of years of experience purged FBI training material so they couldn't recognize radical Islam and this was falling right into the category of what Muller was good at and that is covering his own rear end and also in this case covering that of rod rosenstein-rodan Stein was a US Attorney Muller was FBI director Wiseman was working on the case as well to investigate Russia's illegal effort to get control of u.s. uranium they soft pedaled that forced their informant to sign a nondisclosure agree they had to keep things quiet so the Commission on foreign investments in the United States would be able to vote to allow the sale of uranium that would ultimately end up in the hands of Russia if Muller and Rosenstein and Weisman let the public know about Russia's illegal efforts there's no way sophia's could have approved that sale and then of course the Clinton Foundation wouldn't have gotten their forty four million dollars along with so many much other money that changed hands so these guys were disqualified if they had any decency they would have recused themselves from being able to a appoint a special counsel be be a special counsel and this is Robert Miller who was just shortly before that begging to get the job as director of the FBI he had no business doing this I think Eric Holder although he misrepresented facts before the Judiciary Committee he was not misrepresenting facts to CNN some weeks back when he said look I've known robert muller for twenty thirty years and he's not gonna stop in essence until he gets trump on something and that is the trouble we need a special prosecutor to investigate the special prosecutor to investigate rosen stein just has already been said Rosenstein is a guy that that did the memo saying let's fire Comey he had no business being involved in this but there is a reason and if Muller had any interest in making sure the public knew this was a just improper action he would have gone out of his way to hire people who were not connected to the Clintons to the Democratic Party that way people would know that this is a just and fair action no but since it was not just and fair they needed people that would cover themselves and cover Muller and Rosenstein and Weisman so that's where the that's happened it was June of last year I told President Trump you look no body needs firing more than Robert Muller but you can't be the one to fire him because we got some weak-kneed Republicans out there who will say they're come after you if you fire the guy that needs firing but you can appoint a special counsel and that's what we needed then is what we needed now and like any good idea it just takes a while for it to catch on now it is apparent to some of the people I have great respect for right here behind me and I'm hoping we'll finally get a vote and force this thing to a head thank you I'm just wondering what is the standard for the appointment of a special counsel at the Department of Justice you have Rosen Stein appoint a special counsel to investigate the president based on a slow boil suspicion of Carter page a Papadopoulos memo written by Peter struck who subsequently been demoted and reassigned and a dossier that was paid for by the DNC in the Clinton campaign and curated in part by Russians so if that gets you a special counsel where you know at one moment you got Rosen Stein sitting next to Muller pitch and Muller as the replace as the replacement for James Comey and not 24 hours later after it became clear the president was not gonna hire Muller you've got Rosenstein selecting Muller to be the second there to be the special counsel here the factual basis seems to be a lot stronger mister Zeldin showed great leadership he laid that out and speaker Ryan has always said to all of us he wants a house that has a bottom-up process that's organic in its activities ten months ago members of the Judiciary Committee began calling for a second special counsel at the committee leadership level chairman Bob Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee chairman trey Gowdy of the Oversight Committee also called for a second special counsel when mr. Zeldin sent a letter to the Attorney General he was joined by the Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy the Majority Whip Steve Scalise so we have done what has been asked of us as the membership we've uncovered the true facts we've persuaded leadership at the committee level and at the conference level and now we need Speaker Ryan to put this resolution on the floor so that the full house of representatives can answer the question about the legitimacy and the need for a second special counsel to investigate what I perceive to be very serious crimes and impropriety zat the FBI in the Department of Justice I'm Jody hice from Georgia's tenth District I also want to thank Lee Zeldin for his leadership on this and the leadership of every person on this stage for keeping this issue on the forefront and let me just kind of bring this down as to why this matters to the American people we've heard a lot of specifics but what does what does this matter specifically to the American people well truth justice and transparency are not partisan issues or concepts they are the backbone of American government and when we begin to allow people to ignore the rule of law or to set a standard of their own to abide by then it becomes our responsibility to shine light on that and in this case to conduct an impartial investigation there can be no question at this point as it appears so evident that the FBI and the Department of Justice at the bottom line wanted Hillary Clinton to not be indicted and they did not want Donald Trump to be the president of the United States this is a ought to be a grave concern to every citizen in this country in light of all the serious issues that have been raised the allegations we've got to get to the bottom of this to determine whether or not the Department of Justice and the FBI tipped the scales of justice we've got to get to the bottom of whether or not their attempts were to benefit one political candidate to the harm of another and we've got to get to the bottom of the issue as to whether or not they circumvented the rule of law and so it is time for our leadership to exhibit leadership and to get this resolution to the floor for a vote the credibility obviously at the Department of Justice and FBI is at stake but what is also at stake is the ability of the American people to trust their government the FBI the Department of Justice Congress all of us who are in this role to get to the bottom of this again thank each of you for being here this afternoon and again mr. Zeldin and those behind me it's time we get to the bottom of this thank you thank you for offering here Claudia Tenny 22nd district I'm really just grateful that my colleague from New York Lee Zeldin it's got the tenacity to keep on this issue I'm happy to join him I'm also happy to join our colleague representative Ron de Santos on our letter we outlined very clearly the points that were made that what what we think are potential violations of law and asked them to look into these these issues and we're still waiting and it's really important that we restore the integrity of the FBI and the Department of Justice so that we have equal justice under law so that the American citizens know that what we're going to be doing is looking at everything equally and not just picking winners and losers based on political lines this seems to me like if it were the tables returned this would be another modern-day Watergate and right now I think we need to really look into this I think as a Second Council is our only option at this point and I applaud all my colleagues echo their sentiments this is something we really have to do if we're going to stand up for the citizens of this nation and I just want to say thank you to Lee and to everyone here for standing strong on this issue and for all of you for hopefully reporting this and getting it out there so the American people know that we are going to be standing for equal justice under law thank you Paul Gosar from Arizona spore and you wonder why this matters fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me how many things have we had to see in government oversight from fast and furious to IRS to the reporters delegation once again article 1 section 8 gives us this power and purview to oversee this application Benjamin Franklin has asked what kind of government did you give us or a public if you can keep it and the fundamental aspect of a republic is to hold everybody equally accountable to the rule of law when you look at all the things that mister Zeldin actually orchestrated it and you start tying these pieces together this is an orchestrated campaign against a duly elected government that's why there's nothing short of treason for those that actually participated in that FISA or participated in this the American people deserve that facts they need the truth and they need to know that everybody is held to the same standard of the law morning Andy Biggs from Arizona's fifth District I'm thankful the league zeldin for bringing this forward and my colleagues behind me who have spoken and I'm reminded of what a Arizona former Arizona congressman said everything's been said just hasn't been said by everybody yet so I'm gonna take a minute to just tell you my little view of this what has been said is is dynamite it's a scandal of our time scandal perhaps of our lifetime there's two key components here that need to be really explored that were set forth but need to be really outlined more number one and Congressman Jordan mentioned it and that is a reference to the former administration where the president was to be informed of all things going on we need to know really what that meant we need to know how high this scandal went that's imperative number two the apparent motivation for all of this misconduct going right back to the Clinton scandal right on into the current scandal is political in nature that is antithetical to what the founding of this country fabric of this nation today should be and was that are those two things right there are things we need to contain to investigate we need to set a special counsel to go forward and investigate everything that we've iterated in this resolution but moreover we need to get to the bottom of what previous president knew with regard to these miss Dismas conduct and we also need to know why this abuse of power was performed for political purposes because that can never happen in this country again I'm David rouser represent southeastern North Carolina's seventh District and I want to applaud my colleagues for their leadership on this I'm proud to be here to stand with them I firmly believe that obviously our country is divided a lot of folks are divided in terms of their opinion of our president but I also think that the vast majority Americans believe in a fair process I'll be candid and say that I'm not a big fan of special counsels but I think one is necessary in this particular matter moving forward so that we can help to create a much more fair process and get to the real truth of the matter and I to encourage our leadership to bring this to the floor the American people deserve the truth and not only that it's imperative I believe for the future and survival of our Republic thank you I'd like to thank all of my colleagues who are here the chairs and committee members of the House Intelligence Committee Judiciary Committee Oversight and Government Reform the House and the Senate for all of their hard work to be able to cover all these facts and be happy to answer any questions anyone has I'm spinnin to anyone up there can you talk to us about your discussions with House leadership and if you talk to any with the White House about this idea why is it coming up with a vote that seems to be your prime audience right now we are we haven't even introduced it yet we'll be introducing it here in the coming hours we would encourage all of our colleagues interested in this issue to sign on we'll be engaging with all of our colleagues regardless of whether they sign on to be able to discuss this issue with them and we certainly would like to see a vote on the House floor the resolution will be introduced in the coming hours they have you discussed this with House leadership so there have been a number of conversations with our House leadership in terms of the frustration of where we are with these documents but also the need for second Special Counsel I think it's been outlined already that we have members of leadership that have called for members Chairman's of committee that have done so and so yes they're fully aware at this point it's a drastic step but quite frankly these are drastic facts that continue to bubble to the surface and it's time that we get a response and so I don't know that they will be surprised by any of the demands of this request the resolution obviously is something that mr. Zeldin has taken the lead on and we plan to have further conversations on that congressman meadows could you just give us a notes a little bit hour-by-hour an update on where things stand with this meeting that was worked out at the White House where you are supposedly going to be able to view some of these documents well obviously the the president had a meeting with DOJ officials yesterday and FBI officials yesterday I applaud him for his spirit of transparency I can I can tell you in my conversations with the president he is he has been concerned about one thing that's transparency with the American people that meeting yesterday obviously gives us great hope that the documents will actually be able to be reviewed by the appropriate Intel committee members not broadly by Democrats certainly I would think that you would have ranking members as well if they wanted to view those documents I think there's probably more interest on our side because the allegation of wrongdoing certainly would be supported more by our side then the Democrat colleagues but but at this point my understanding is is in the coming days indeed this week that that chairman Nunez and chairman Gowdy certainly will be able to view those documents now listen we've been here before we've had a lot of rhetoric and you know quite frankly we've had very little action and so I'm not optimistic that that will actually happen but I can tell you that at this point that's what we're hopeful for it's another meeting to talk about seeing records versus actually getting access to the records well Republicans refused to attend well I can tell you another meeting without evidence and without actually seeing the documents is worthless we've been in this there have been there are two subpoenas that are outstanding that have not been complied with from Oversight and judiciary we've had a subpoena well actually a request since November but a subpoena that is there this president has turned over 1.2 million documents to the Special Counsel monitor and yet our DOJ and FBI in a seven-month period has has delivered less than 19,000 documents out of a possible one point two million documents most of those are duplicative and it is time that we get to see the documents and so so just having a briefing is is not what we're talking about we actually need to see the documents we believe that we have a clear understanding of what's there follow supra-conscious Meadows or whoever wants to take it putting media reports to one side what does the evidence show about the number of informants that were used to target the Trump campaign yeah I think at this particular point that would be in a classified setting and and I'm not privy to that as you know we've had a number of documents that we've reviewed in a non classified settings where you can make the argument that there was more than one but that is is certainly not something that would be privy to and can't speak with authority on it's been a great go ahead go ahead um mr. meadows and mr. gates you guys talked to President Trump off and have you guys talked to him about this has he asked for this but it has Trump asked for this listen this initiative is driven by by mr. Zeldin and certainly members of the house and for us to suggest that the president has requested a second special counsel that's not the fact not in any conversations that I've had with him and I normally do not come in on any conversations I've had but I can specifically say with that one he has not requested this but have you spoken with him about this idea in general about a second special counsel as the author of this resolution I have not had any conversations at all of the president with regards to this resolution and the call for a second special counsel this has been 100 percent a product of talking to the colleagues to my colleagues who are signing on to a verification project is for congressman Zeldin on Bruce or does the evidence show that Bruce Lee was given information by his wife who worked for fusion GPS and that that information was used to either obtain or renew of FISA orders Bruce or was in direct communication with Christopher steel directly so that there is no doubt that that connection that conflict was real and one that resulted in information we passed through Bruce or to the Justice Department to the FISA Court as an intermediary just really quickly and I'm happy to throw this to whoever and I've spoken to other more moderate members of your caucus want to use the word crazy to describe all of you in this effort can you sponsor that in what context this resolution specific effort yes that wait that is separate and equal branch a government wants the information it's entitled to do the constitutional duty of oversight for the American people if that's crazy you got to take that up with the guys who wrote the Constitution because that's exactly what we're supposed to do so just give us the stuff give us the information that we're entitled to see so we can get answers to the questions that the American people have that we have and frankly that all of you in the press app so that's that's exactly what we're supposed to do this because we've been so frustrated this is an effort that has to happen to get to the bottom of all this in Casey let me just there is no one who's read more of these documents personally than I have so I would challenge any of my colleagues if they want to be informed on on the the probable cause and the real reason for us requesting that they can come and we can spend weeks reading over the documents that I've read over the last seven months and I can assure you there's a there there yeah I would I would just add that what what seems crazy is when you have the former attorney general meeting with the former president the husband of the target of an investigation on the tarmac and then immediately exonerating Hillary Clinton what seems crazy to me is that Bruce or whose wife works at fusion GPS is serving as an intermediary with Christopher steel it seems crazy to me that that James Comey would be writing an exoneration before interviewing Secretary Clinton and all of her closest aides who weren't yet to be interviewed what what seems crazy to me is that you would go to a FISA Court and be presenting this dossier and not be telling the FISA judges that the information is unverified that it was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee and providing all the other information that was important for those FISA judges not only to know what the government's best evidence were but also what the government's worst evidence was so you know as far as what's crazy about all of this is the fact that every single thing in that resolution is accurate that's crazy let's take one last question what one ought to lessen as it relates to some of these document requests that continue to be made of the Justice Department there's reluctance on the part of the Justice Department to turn those over not simply because of the classified nature of the requests and some of the materials involved but also because this is an ongoing investigation there's concern about potentially sharing with the central subjects of an investigation materials relevant to their investigation is that proper should the White House ensure that the President himself former officials are walled off from any materials that might be shared and can you commit that members of Congress are not sharing with the White House any of these sensitive documents that might be helpful to the President and his legal team as they prepare potentially for a meeting with the special counsel pardon us for our skepticism on the Department of Justice's filtering of the information they provide Congress we've already caught them redacting information that was not redacted as a consequence of any national security concern or any sources and methods concern but because it was personally embarrassing to him that they were talking about their relationship with the judge who might oversee hearing so the Department of Justice has lost their credibility to self filter based on their own conduct and and look I mean you a second Special Counsel solves back against that concern because of the second special counsel is appointed you have independent eyes that are able to collect the evidence make a review and then bring an action forward and so you could you could in essence divorce those concerns from a process that had more integrity and we think that mr. Zeldin has laid out that correct process and I would just add that all the concerns about not being able to provide information for national security concerns and then you provide the information you see that there's nothing that risks national security happens time and time again that the facts are after you actually end up reading the documents that the real reason while they were saying national security was that it would cause embarrassment to people who did the wrong thing last question really clear that you're pursuing as information because the American people deserve transparency but you didn't really get around to the question did the president incurred this effort at all I answered black and white 100% absolutely not oh this is me none of you have had conversations with the president about this from those who answered the earlier question they they said the same I can just speaking for myself as the author of this resolution 100% of my conversations of my interactions with anyone that has been working directly with my colleagues who are signing on to this resolution this was a product of those discussions entirely and I have not spoken to the president in any way shape or form as far as the subject of the contents and the purpose of this resolution

Thank You mr. chair for calling us some important hearing I only regret that it conflicts with a members-only briefing on almost the exact same title taking place simultaneously and thank you witnesses for the important work that you do every day thinking about ways to combat public health threats there's a common theme across your testimony and that's pretty much when there's a crisis all eyes turn to you but when the disease of crisis moves off the front pages the public loses interest and then the funding goes away you didn't say this part but but I'll say this also that and Washington sees a problem they the habit is to throw billions of dollars at it and say look now we've done our job and and hope for a good result and move on to the next issue and of course there's always the finger pointing and blaming based on as you well point out earlier much information and disinformation that's really regrettable and I think the American people are getting a little tired of that but dr. Murray working with partner agencies you state you successfully identified over 1200 Novell walk while Borton illnesses including a hundred and sixty-one of which belong to the same family as Kovan 19 I think most of us in the room are wondering what the risk to humans is from those viruses as well I have four related questions that I'll ask you thank you very much I'll trying to be quick in my response so in addition to identifying the viruses we also have and the team of modelers who helps us identify where to look in the world we also have a team of phylogeny and virology experts who then rank all these viruses if we had enough money to look at every country every species every animal we would what we don't so we really try and use funds effectively so we identified the countries in which are most likely to be a problem the species that are most likely to transmit lethal diseases to humans primates bats and rodents and then of those 1,200 viruses they're ranked according to the families that are most likely to cause a problem for human health and that's where we spend the majority of our time and resources influences coronaviruses fellow viruses and paramyxovirus 'as are some of the most important families just to add on to what my colleagues here have said it is the time from funds are an issue and the program that I'm describing is just in the process of being closed down we're actually holding our a closeout session on March 17th at the Museum of American Indian in case anybody would like to join us because we'll be reporting on a lot of what we've done over the last 10 years my suggestion would be this is not the time to lean out but it would be the time that we need to be leaning in what percentage of the viruses have the potential to jump to humans just swaggin I mean just so of the 1.7 as-yet-unidentified viruses about 50% of those have the potential to jump to humans and that's based on the receptor sites and where they can attach to the trachea of those but not all of those are going to spread rapidly and not all of those are going to cause severe disease so we look at there's 50% that could jump to humans and probably only 10% or 15 that can cause rapid disease and a ped and a pandemic but until we identify those viruses the species in which they occur the reservoir species and the mode of transmission to humans we're really still at a tremendous risk and then we the research has shown that these outbreaks are coming more and more frequently so while everybody a lot of us have felt like oh this is a surprise the folks in the health community have felt like this isn't a surprise we've been saying collectively for the last several years these pandemics are coming we can tell you in general the countries or the areas some of the risk factors and some of the viral families well you answered my next two questions about the percentage is already so for the final question had how do you think we best prioritize research you know is is there a good process to set research priorities in place I think a lot of what we're doing right here and thank you for this for this hearing it does bring everybody a lot of the same folks into the room to help identify some of the issues from my perspective the more that we can look at bringing experts from many different fields from the government from NGOs and universities together then that and the the confluence of human physicians well most physicians are human right so human physicians veterinarians and nurse and nursing staff researchers I think that's really what we need to be doing and looking at not only in the US but in countries in other countries as well because we look at the economy globally it's really time for us to look at health globally so that's how I would go about establishing research priorities thank you that beats crisis is yours thank you for your questions

remember that you're talking about where cities blossom and grow at the venue I did listen to what you said thank you I'm sure you all know how critical the Great Falls was to our nation's historic quest for freedom across the prosperity Treasury secretary Lew has to put up with me every week and I tell him about it so he doesn't change that then mama bill and take put somebody else on there

it's a story about our nation that's why I sought to preserve or protect the Great Falls I bring it into the National Park Service you mean by the way next year 2060 then up here second thing that 100 years of the park service i smooth that they do it outstanding job and remember we made true believers out of them and indeed we can do this themselves we did it we did it not one person or two persons we after two years of rehab design planning environmental review and implementation in the Hansons made here at Mary Ellen Kramer Park will certainly contribute way better experience the past in addition to the aesthetic and functional improvements the reconstruction included important environmental remediation work a significant step towards an eventual national park acquisition National Park Service ownership will be a vital step towards a cohesive national park lying for a seamless visitor experience and enabling future projects to be undertaken quickly and efficiently when we first introduced the legislation creating the Great Falls National Historic Park we all shared an expansive vision of a vibrant urban park which demonstrates our nation's industrial heritage and celebrates the lives of those workers who came from all over the world and got their hands dirty people don't want to get their hands dirty we need to turn them back to our uncles and aunts grandfather can work

Service would be releasing for public comment the general management plan alternatives for a great for which will guide the parks mission for the next 20 years as we move through this planning process let's keep our over marking goals in the park at the forefront this is an opportunity for thinking day we all know right now the National Park Service is feeling the strain from the harsh budget cuts imposed through sequestration that dumb idea has heard a lot of people and those who profess to support it should be throw the heck out of office this unwise policy is degrading our nation's ability to care for its greatest treasures you can rest assured I will keep fighting the good fight you get the resources needed for the Great Falls and throughout the National Park System it is critical that we continue our clothes work together this momentum will continue into next summer thanks to eight hundred thousand dollars in federal in county funds for overlooked or the work being undertaken today

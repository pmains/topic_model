Thank You mr. chairman you know throughout the opening statements and certainly throughout the witnesses opening comments it's there's a theme of the importance of recognizing global rule rules and norms and understanding the mechanisms by which to resolve disputes so I think many of us in Congress have been concerned when we look at china's unilateral moves whether in the east china sea or in the South China Sea which really go against international norms you know in unilateral moves you know whether it's the Scarborough shelves or you know declaring aid is over the East China Sea which really go outside the norms so if we just think about the the next steps and what is in our toolbox as United States to help deescalate tensions I think it's reasonable to go ahead and you know we should certainly you know I do wish we were part of I'm class we're not but we are going through the process of recognizing international norms and international mechanisms by which resolve disputes so ruling will come out shortly I think it behooves us to make sure as an international community when we see that ruling we do everything we can to enforce that ruling now you know what I would say is you know let's say that ruling is not the one China is looking for and they choose to ignore that ruling you know we look it I think mrs. Willet you talked about the the tools that we have we're already engaged diplomatically in the sense that you know we've gone to unclass I would consider that a diplomatic tool by which to resolve this dispute we can continue to engage the pan diplomatically but we've already used that tool none of us is in interested in a military or kinetic engagement we certainly are posturing by having some of our assets in the region and the importance of the size of China Sea the reason why you these small reclaimed islands are so important as that is one of the most important trade routes in the world right now it is in of incredibly economic importance to not only the United States but to our allies in that region and the number of goods and that that moved through that region are incredibly important so they're very strategic we can't try to use economic tools to get China back to the table but the worry here is you know China increasingly is moving assets to that island and the more assets they have the harder it will be to move them off of those those those islands and it is much easier for us to deal with this today then it will be a decade from now so you know mr. Denmark what outside of that what are our options well Thank You congressman night I think you can understand why I would be reluctant to discuss military options sure to any degree of specificity in an open hearing what I do feel comfortable saying in an open setting is that we remain very committed to continue to defend our allies to defend critical principles and that we see is necessary to the continued peace and stability of the region and to continue to defend our national interests in terms of what happens after a decision I think I would refer you to the statement that I submit in that we see the military role in this as being essential to deter conflict ensure that diplomacy has space to succeed and we're going to continue to to play that role and certainly there's no desire for a military option here I mean what we want diplomacy and we certainly want China to understand it it's in China's economic benefit to have open sea sea ways and and the free movement of goods and services they obviously you see that as well so you know from our perspective let's hope you know tearing to international norms and international mechanisms by which to resolve dispute that China you know we'll take that mechanism as a member of on class and you know adhere to what whatever ruling we do see next week again otherwise I think we ought to come back into a joint committee here and really you know send a strong message that you know we've got a chair to these international norms so with that I yield back

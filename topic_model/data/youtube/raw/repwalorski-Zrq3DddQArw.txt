chairman i was going to say that inflation is hammering hoosiers but i have to say after being in the district that the inflation in this country is a flat out disgrace there's no way to try to blame this or switch this on anything other than this administration's policies i cannot believe every week at the grocery store in the gas pump i mean these aren't just stories this is the american people and they are so fed up with it and they're transmitting that to us as urgently as they can but i just have to say that i've never seen anything like what's happening in this economy inflation at a 40-year peak continues to spiral out of control gas in my district went to 525 a gallon which is an absolute disgrace increasing prices on gas and everyday necessities are hurting hoosiers to say the least and i can just tell you increasing prices on gas and everyday necessities are hurting everybody in this district from seniors to working people who can barely afford on a fixed income our seniors to be forced to choose between food and fuel the administration's policies have given us climbing gas prices persistent supply chain bottlenecks workforce shortages and surging inflation the need for relief has never been greater but the question i have secretary ellen in order to provide inflation relief to america's manufacturers small business and consumers i along with many of my colleagues on this committee have pushed for a robust section 301 exclusion process which the trump administration implemented for the majority of the time the section 301 tariffs were in place i have seen your recent comments and understand that you are evaluating reviewing the existing section 301 tariffs can you provide additional insight into the administration's review of section 301 tariffs and if a more robust exclusion process is under consideration those things are under consideration you know this administration inherited a set of 301 tariffs imposed by the trump administration that i think really weren't designed to serve our strategic interests china certainly is i think guilty of unfair trade practices we need to protect against ensure our national security that our supply chains are secure and resilient and their policies need to make sure that they address that but i believe some of the tariffs did not serve really ended up being paid by americans not by the chinese hurt american consumers and businesses and we are uh taking a look at those and um looking to be able to address um so to reconfigure those tariffs in a way that would be more strategic um so that is something where timeline secretary is there any kind of a timeline as to where we can have an additional conversation on that um i think in the in the coming weeks we expect i can't give you a firm timeline but um with respect to the exclusion process and tariffs um that's something that's under active consideration thank the gentlelady

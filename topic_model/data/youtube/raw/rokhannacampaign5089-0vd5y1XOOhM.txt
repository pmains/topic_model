joining me now is Congressman Mike Honda who represents district 17 in Silicon Valley good to see you good to be here thank you you're running for a knife term in Congress what would you say from where you sit what is the biggest challenge today facing Silicon Valley I think in Silicon Valley um the two big areas are is some the iniquity and salaries for service workers and I think the others housing housing is such a big issue in our in our district and are those issues that you as a congress member can do something about well there are rules that we can play for instance working with HUD I had our King Castro come down for an extra day to visit our are homeless projects to show that there are variety of ways to address the homelessness of not only veterans but also those others who are in the streets and but I wanted to give them also a document I put together is called the inventory of surplus and underutilized lands to look at that as a possible way of building homes but you also represent of course some of the biggest names in the tech industry Apple Facebook Google is around there as well you represent the innovation economy and yet I hear you saying that your biggest concerns are really sort of low income folks is that going to make the tech industry feel a little bit left out I don't think so because the tech industry is one of the leaders in looking at issues around housing and the inequitable salaries and everything else like that they've led the way to increase salaries of their own staff and also Silicon Valley leadership group has put together a housing trust fund where they're pointing together funds I put some federal monies in there to help people first-time buyers and down payment so everybody's working together it's a district where some say that the future is invented it's in the tomorrow business when you think about all the emerging technology coming out of your district in Silicon Valley generally what excites you I think the possibility of being able to communicate with anybody globally and in a very fraction of a second I guess the I is the collapsing of time and distance allows us to be very efficient what about things like driverless cars and robotics that are replacing people well I think that that's the future and people never thought that we'd replace the horse but we did that so that's just just I think it's acknowledging the next step and how we increase the confidence and the reliability of driverless cars and other thing will be the issue so you're running a very contentious race with your challenger ro Khanna and both of you have been running television ads and I want to take a look at one of your ads from your campaign we'll come back and talk about it let's take a look show with a history of shutting down companies and destroying jobs I gotta dig this no wonder Khanna's answer their call for tax breaks for millionaires outsourcing jobs overseas in to see what I can do while refusing to protect Social Security corporate interest get enough face time in Washington we don't need Rokon it dialing it up congressman that ad portrays ro Khanna is being unethical beholden to wall street is that what you believe well it's it's a fact that he's received over four hundred fifty thousand dollars from Wall Street when he's a wall street do you mean Wall Street you know people who are involved with the financial aspects of this country people that you know normal people like myself don't use access in terms of or don't seek help from them and to say that he saw one of one of the folks said but you know Jason's up one way he is not really forthcoming in the kinds of income that he really does portrayal in that ad there is an Indian looking actor playing ro Khanna in the backseat of that limousine did you have any qualms about that as someone who has faced discrimination in your own past sure I think that the last time he accused me of being racist because he said that there was a red dot on this on his picture I didn't have anything to do with that but this one I'll take responsibility for it it's saying any any regrets about it or no I think that that's depicting someone like himself taking money for wherever he got on and this is the idea is that he's taking money from Wall Street and he's saying that he's of people's people in one of his ads your opponent ro Khanna alleges that you and all your time in Congress passed one bill that was to name a post office is that a fair charge and what's your reaction well I did have one bill that changed the name of post office to Gordon Chan and I'm proud of that but the thing about Congress is that it's not only about having a name on a bill is that an accurate characterization though that you have your name on just one bill that part is accurate but what we do as congressional members is a lot of other things too and you know we work on different projects different bills and we get those things done so you know with the results that have had over the past 16 years brought in almost a billion dollars worth of revenue and all kinds of other kinds of programs that affect education nonprofits Silicon Valley you're facing your own investigation and questions about ethics the house ethics committee is investigating they voted unanimously to investigate and there are questions about you giving favors to hide owners for things like expediting visas and that sort of thing what's your reaction is not the kind of thing people you're sort of accusing him about a favoring the rich well it's of the ethics saw issue is one of house rules whether we had violated our house rules in order to adjust I did two things want you let the people know that I made a decision that nobody on our official staff will be participate but there was a the conclusion of the report found that there was substantial reason to think that you done right the conclusion reports pass it on to the house Congressional Ethics Committee which is the real committee that really takes all their information and they're moving through right now so we're cooperating with them one hundred percent and we're not saying that we're just waiting for the outcome all right the charge I have against my own my own opponent he behaves differently alright and we're going to get a chance to talk with ro Khanna next but thank you very much for coming in you can check out KQED voter guide with information on propositions and candidates online at elections kqed org in Congress welcome thank you well you want to represent a district that is right in the middle of the innovation economy tell me what you think is the biggest challenge facing folks in the 17th congressional district it's education and jobs there is no question that jobs are being automated that globalization is putting pressure on it I teach economics at Stanford I work for the Obama administration and I've offered a plan for how we're going to educate the next generation to have the jobs in the 21st century and how we're going to put people to work given the challenges of automation you kind of alluded tell you know automation robotics and it is going to be displacing people or eliminating jobs going forward is there anything that has a member of Congress you would do or be thinking about are pushing for in terms of policies well a couple things one is more investment in career technical education unfortunately we've been cutting that but in my district and independence high school those folks who are learning automative electronics many of them have gotten jobs at Tesla we need to be really focused on the trades we also need to make college Universal and affordable and I've come out for Robert Reich's plan which is to have people go to public college for free and then pay it back once they graduate and get their first job there is so much emerging technology coming out of your part of California Silicon Valley what when you think about that what excites you the most well the the most exciting thing on my judgment is biotechnology I mean there's a chance of having personalized medicine eventually where we will know someone's genetic profile and be able to customize medicine to their unique needs of course there's driverless cars which is a positive but also a challenge the biggest employer employment job in this country is drivers and so this is where I think we have to deal with both the positives of Technology and also the dislocations you've talked about something called Universal minimum income describe what that is and I assume that's for people who may not be as fully employed as they are now because of things like driverless cars exactly the challenges we're going to often have people who may not have full-time work and maybe that's stretching to make ends meet Universal minimum income is a bipartisan idea proposed by James Tobin a liberal economist at Milton Friedman which says there's a threshold income that everyone who works in this society should achieve thirty thousand dollars 35,000 we can debate I believe we need that and it's an idea that both Republicans and Democrats sounds expensive well it would be a massive expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit currently we have the Earned Income Tax Credit which takes you from 15,000 20,000 to getting some refund and I would say we have to expand it and of course we would have to have the wealthy pay a greater tax people making over a million dollars we're currently paying capital gains tax only should be paying more tax but I think it's important to have a fair society in a world where jobs are going offshore and where jobs are being automated you are running again against Mike Honda it was a close race last time it's you did better in the primary this time than two years ago and a lot of ads have been run on your campaign and on the other side let's take a look at one and we'll come back and talk sure around too long his record and embarrassment in 15 years Mike Honda passed only one bill to name a post office honda has one of the worst attendance records in Congress now it's unanimous Democrats and Republicans on House Ethics joining together investigating Honda's abuse of office but I'm wondering you you're portraying congressman Honda who's 70 you know you're 40 years old is there an element of ageism which is often prevalent in Silicon Valley not at all I mean I've come out in supporting Hillary Clinton I've supported Jerry Brown I don't think age is relevant I think what is relevant is a person's record and the reality is congressman Honda is only passed one bill in 16 years compared to anna s you and Zoe Lofgren who have a much more prolific record we're about the same age and congressman Honda has this ethics investigation so I think our ad is factual and fair there's been some issues about your campaign as well your former campaign director accused of illegally accessing campaign data that really belonged to Mike Honda and I said you didn't know about it and he left the campaign the day those charges came out should you have known about it I think the voters should go to the mercury news in the newspapers The Mercury News editorialized a week ago that this was a publicity stunt of a desperate incumbent and the judge denied the congressman's motion the lawsuit was filed five weeks before the final election and I just hope that people will go and read the papers assessment based on what he did your former campaign manager how would you how would you characterize it ethically first well we don't know because they've been allegations he does he hasn't had a chance to respond he claims that he never accessed these documents so why did he leave the campaign well he didn't to be a distraction the 25 year old kid with a congressman is filing a federal lawsuit against has had to go hire an attorney and defend himself he can hardly run a campaign and i think it was outrageous what Mike did we had we asked Mike Honda about an out of his where you're portrayed in the back of a limousine talking to Wall Street on new cell phone there's a bottle of champagne how do you feel about that characterization and the use of an actor who appears to be Indian American well as Scott Harold in The Mercury News did a whole article saying that the ad was filled with racist innuendos imagine the outrage if we had had an ad with the Japanese American actor we would have never done that I don't think that's Honda himself I think his consultants made a terrible choice and I hope he'll pull that ad because it's not who he is yeah you are what many would call an elite you know you've got Stanford you went to law school you're well educated you probably travel in circles with wealthy Silicon Valley folks and that's not a criticism that's not know that's life but I took out student loans still paying him off I was a public school and you know I'm it's very tough for this characterization given that I'm the son of immigrants there's never been an indian-american of Hindu origin which is my faith in Congress I went to public school I took out loans I haven't had a easy path yeah so that characterization of someone who's out of touch with the have-nots you would disagree i would strongly disagree and i have spent so much time with young people in this district who can't pay for college who don't have the right opportunities and my passion is to give them a fair shot all right ro Khanna thanks so much for coming in thank you

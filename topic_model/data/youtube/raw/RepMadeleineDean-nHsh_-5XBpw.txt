congresswoman madeleine dean of pennsylvania thank you for joining us good evening chris thank you for having me how does that hit you prosecutor victim witness these people were coming for you how does that register with your head in your heart thank you for asking me i was there on january the 6th i was up in the gallery at the time of the attack at the time of the insurrection at the time of the banging on the doors and the piercing of the doors it was a terrifying time but how it hits me chris i have to be honest with you is with determination uh with sorrow and somber sadness that we had to walk that article over to the senate but with a determination that what we're doing is exactly what we were called to do i i was thinking tonight as you just talked about this what we do here matters i want to tell you a really quick story it means a lot to me in july of 2019 i was a new member of congress i plopped myself down on the floor of the house in the days you could sit on the floor of the house and i was seated next to elijah cummings we had the best conversation and you know what he said to me he said madeleine dean we talked about everything his favorite movie by the way lion king in case you didn't know it he talked about his father watching him being sworn in the gallery and i said i wish my parents could be here and he said they're here trust me they're here even if they've passed they're here you know what he said to me at the end of our conversation and i did not understand it then he said to me madeline dean 300 years from now your ancestors will remember you were here it's it's come to me what he meant he didn't mean me he didn't mean my name he meant they will remember what we did here he could see the future he could see the history the importance that we take this solemn duty seriously and that's the way i feel tonight more than once he called uh to encourage the job of accountability and saying that this is the worst i've ever seen yes what is the hardest part for you emotionally in processing where we are right now i'm sad for our country but i don't know what has happened i feel just a steely determination to do my duty i feel so honored to join jamie raskin and this team of nine to have been called by speaker pelosi to this moment in history so my greatest emotion right now and maybe it'll be different later is a determination to do my best to make sure that my constituents and my family and my country is proud that we prosecute a case against a president so desperate to hang on to power that he assembled a mob incited a mob lit the match and as a result five people are dead 130 plus police officers are wounded and it was a dual attack both on our constitution and our constitutional obligation but also on a joint session of congress the world witnessed as you said i'm a witness i'm a victim i don't feel a victim i i i'm it was terrifying don't get me wrong but i was a witness the senate were witnesses we were hunted they wanted to hang the vice president of the united states they wanted to assassinate the speaker of the house what i feel is a determination and an optimism for our constitution the founders gave us the tools we just have to use them what did it mean to you after all that happened to see colleagues stand up and decide to stand up for a lie even after they had seen the wages of that lie and to know that now there's almost no chance that you will get 17 votes from the other party to confirm what you know to be true to every bone in your body chris i won't agree with you i believe we will put forward a very strong case that of course is already in the public view of what took place here a president violated his oath in in incredible ways on january 6th we will put that case forward i was thinking of last week chris and i know you paid close attention to the swearing-in of joe biden just five days ago it's an amazing american week an amazing american moment and of course four years before donald trump took that same oath we must hold anyone me a president everyone accountable to that oath what did his oath say his oath said that he would preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states so help me god that meant from day one until day last if we fail to make sure that we get this jury of senators to vote to convict what does that say about them and their belief in this oath i have a confidence i will not give up i'm not doing the math of 17 we'll put forward the strongest case i hope we get every single vote do you put any credence in the idea that a republican senator could say look you know the case is compelling but it doesn't matter we can't have this trial he's already out of office you know you're a smarter lawyer you know that that's actually constitutionally not so the framers of the constitution were very aware of demagogues and mobs and so what they put in the constitution for impeachment is not only removal from office they put in disqualification but very importantly even though this president is no longer here or in past cases a person tried to resign to beat impeachment it just doesn't work that way he can be further disqualified so it's incredibly and and very truly constitutional that we will move forward with this article of impeachment you guys going to call witnesses and if so might mccarthy be one of those witnesses as he was on the phone with the president and might have some kind of present sense impression of where his head was at during those events well thank you for asking but chris you might imagine i will not be previewing the trial i just said the same thing to my ep but then i decided to ask anyway because we're all the same in the media and we want to know even if we know we're not going to get an answer we ask anyway i ask you a question now that i know you'll answer you pronounced your name madeline is that how elijah said it or is that how you say it that's funny chris i have five i'm from a big irish catholic family i have five older brothers i don't think all of them pronounce it correctly what is the name i'm named for my grandmother my name is madeline and i try to help people it rhymes with dean madeline dean but i'll answer to madeline i'll answer to mad anything you will answer the congresswoman on my watch because i have great respect for the office and for what you're about to do and how you're doing it i also have a sister named madeline so i get a pass although if i said her name wrong she'd probably beat me down before i got it out of my mouth congresswoman good luck to you going forward let a little bit of levity bridge us to a very very sober and somber time we'll be watching thanks for having me and thanks for asking good luck thank you all right so what is the case the evidence is clear is it compelling it depends if you want to be convinced now how

good evening tonight President Obama addressed America and delivered a misleading outlook about our economy and what our government's priority should be his priorities like raising taxes have no chance of being adopted and merely served to divide the nation now I'm even more frustrated the Obama economy is one where stocks may have hit record highs and Wall Street is celebrating but hard-working taxpayers in West Virginia are still struggling to get by finding a job remains a real problem in this economy as more and more people give up and leave the workforce here in West Virginia more than half of our people are not the labor force the first time for any state in the history of our nation and real wages are not keeping up the cost for education health care and food have all gone up along with taxes on those they can least afford them while those with jobs struggle to get by others fall even further behind too many hard-working americans are living paycheck to paycheck today over 46 million Americans receive food stamps each month now let's put that in context before Obama we had at most 28 million in need of food stamps as Americans watch the president boost boast about the economic recovery tonight they're asking themselves what recovery the American people are sending a message in November but President Obama has not listened instead he has put out more job-killing regulations acted outside the Constitution and refuses to work with Congress Americans deserve better they simply want government to be more efficient effective and accountable most people i talked to whether it's a business owner in sistersville or working mom and morgantown want us to focus first on growing the economy and creating jobs the new American Congress is listen and renewed its efforts on behalf of those families expecting better from their government in our first two weeks the house has passed five major bipartisan pieces of legislation these are common-sense solutions to improve the economic opportunity such as approving the Keystone pipeline streamlining regulations and restoring the 40-hour work week which was undercut by Obamacare despite Democrats support on each of these bills President Obama's is promised to veto them all how does that give peace of mind and hope to struggling families across America the new Congress will continue work for its people who sent us here to get work done Obama can go on blocking job bills threatening vetoes and causing gridlock in the meantime we'll get to work for the people who sent us here the hard-working taxpayers who deserve better than what they've experienced in the last six years thank you good night

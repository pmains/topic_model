so last month my next guest along with his colleague senator richard durbin introduced a bill known as the credit card competition act of 2022 in an effort to inject real competition into the credit card network market the bill found support from the national federation of independent businesses those are the small businesses but of course that means the big players are pushing back joining me now senator of kansas roger marshall senator bank rate also came out against your bill saying it would harm consumers and they listed all kinds of things they said it would harm rewards programs data security access to credit what are your thoughts about this i mean obviously you knew they would come after you and circle the wagons right right i'm always going to fight for main street when it's main street versus wall street i'm going to fight for consumers and right now consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation these credit card swipe fees increase that inflation so on a gallon of gas we were paying about a six percent tax for the swipe fee now we're paying 12 percent so swipe fees are an inflation multiplier i think that this will be good for the market capitalism needs competition competition is the backbone right now two credit card companies control 83 of the market despite despite their their profits going up by 25 they still increase their rate this year so what we do is introduce competition not price caps we want more competition right and i it seems like an idea that would take off considering all the backing behind things like overdraft fees and things like that uh i want to talk about the the country in general there was a tweet that you put out that made me think of you uh you know listen we know we're in a tough period right now uh on one end of the spectrum you got taxpayers who are we're paying off college loans right these are folks who are going to end up making five million dollars a year unfortunately though and sadly on the other end of the spectrum we have deaths of despair they're skyrocketing this to me is the real national emergency is anything on capitol hill being done about this yeah well not enough charles we certainly do have an epidemic right now of mental health issues of depression of suicide of fentanyl poisoning we're still having five to ten thousand excessive deaths per week so we're begging though the white house to close down our southern border 95 percent of that fentanyl comes across the southern border this is a result of the lockdowns it's a lot it's a result of the masking on people that they just have they continue to have social problems adapting to getting back into the real world this isolation was horrible so this is the result of many of the uh the mandates by the president and setting governors in today's washington post there's a headline that reads the gop wants to be the education party democrats have to fight back you know this is something of course the gop is very passionate about in fact there's a gallup poll that points to an all-time low satisfaction k-12 within the republican party however i think it would be better to say that republicans want to be the parent party the parent the party that represents parents isn't that more more accurate charles we'll hire you as our messenger that's exactly right look i'm a first generation college student my wife and i both educated in public schools our four children in public schools public universities everything i owe professionally as becoming a position i owe to those those public school teachers i had but unfortunately we have record numbers of people in kansas leaving the public school system and i think that this is a result of those same lockdowns i mentioned earlier that impacting mental health it's time to hold those governors accountable but i think my message of hope would be this we need young adults with traditional kansas american values to be running for school board and we need to go out and recruit those superstars to make sure that they guard the the education our children are getting there's only so much i can do to stop the minutia coming out of washington that's why we want parents in charge of their own kids education yeah i think a lot of parents have the opportunity to actually you know see what their kids are learning look over their shoulders and say what uh for me you know again this has been an important topic for me for years because i've seen watered-down versions of education hurt so many people and our kids are ready for it they're ready for tough curriculum and they're ready you know to be taught a proper way not to be indoctrinated for lack of a better word senator you're doing some great work i appreciate you taking the time senator marshall thank you thank you charles

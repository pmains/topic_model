Thank You Secretary's inky it's good to see you again I want to start with renewable energy I know we've had this conversation the state of Nevada eighty-seven percent of the land is owned by the federal government so our partnership is key and the interaction that we have with all of the federal agencies is important to the state of Nevada one of the areas that we have been focused on is renewables and responsible development of wind solar and geothermal energy on public lands has long had a broad bipartisan port support including from you during your time in Congress as a co-sponsor of the public land renewable energy Development Act and it's played a growing role in our economy Solar now supports more jobs than natural gas and over twice the jobs in coal according to a 2017 Department of Energy report yet for the second year in a row the administration's proposed budget looks at cutting DOI renewable programs by almost half I proposed 50% cut for fiscal year 18 and a 40% cut for fiscal year 19 looking at these numbers it appears that rule renewable energy development is not an important part of the department's charge if this administration is committed to what I've heard you say time and again all-of-the-above energy strategy then why is renewable energy the only energy program that is proposed to being cut thank you for the question and that's a great question we looked at the expected demand and expected a man by all our modelling was about seventy three million dollars and that's what we we funded that it's down from 20 was solar there's some projects out west particularly in California that are proposing 338 thousand acres of a solar field on federal land that's 500 square miles so every energy as you know every energy source has its consequences when chops up birds I was criticized for saying 750,000 I have the study that says about let's see 800,000 over 800,000 bats and 570 3,000 bird so that's the study from the USGS so wind chops up a lot of birds solar when you put a solar field in its single use you're not gonna hunt on it you're not gonna wreck read on it and it's tough for habitat but our policy is all the above and there are appropriate places for for when there's an appropriate place for solar we just have to make sure that we understand the consequences and have a national dialogue it is better produce energy in this country under reasonable regulation than watch it get produced overseas with none energy is core to our economic well-being and quite frankly morally to produce energy in this country is morally right cuz I don't want to see your kids there if they have to go overseas and see what I've seen so can I just clarify my understanding your concern is the environmental impacts that solar and wind have and that's why you've taken a look at cutting this this know our our budget reflects the expected demand there was a great demand in in solar early solar demand did I not just hear you say an offshore oil-drilling there's low demand but yet you're increasing the budget know what I'm saying what I said no I'm sure energy policy no what I said was an offshore we'll see with the lease is about in March I think it's gonna be a bellwether of interest offshore vise onshore there's no question that offshore oil and gas is riskier than onshore secondly is the shale plays environmental impact or the fact that nobody will come out because it doesn't pencil out cost prohibitive it's riskier for a number of reasons one is environmentally when BP it's well over twenty or thirty billion dollars BP is is paid but yet the budget has increased for that so let me move on because I won't will submit these on the record the reorganization you and I have talked about this and I so appreciate this is a tough this is a tough thing to do I've talked to you about the fact that the Duc Valley Indian tribal reservation is both on Idaho and Nevada State Line land straddles that right and so BLM and Idaho treats them differently than the BLM in Nevada yet what I'm looking at now and your map is cutting Nevada in half for your BLM regions I don't quite understand that and so what I'm asking for is a commitment from you and DOI to work with the stakeholders and the governor in the state of Nevada to address our concerns will you be committed to doing just that I am I have taught the governor and now I understand he's in support of our plan if you have a map in front of you Nevada is already divided in in multiple regions we're gonna our plan has it right now is keeping the BLM directors because almost all the states that have BLM enjoy the relationship with having a BLM director a state director but our larger issue is trying to bring B or bi a Park Service the different bureaus within Interior and realigning to make sure we're on unified districts unified regions based on watershed in science and you can see them the map on the right is our current organization and you look at Nevada Nevada is carved up probably seven or eight different lines and the map on the left is how our proposal what we've done is we've looked at science watersheds wildlife corridors about 13 variables ecosystems then we brought our SES is in and these are career professionals career professionals and so let me my time is running out and I don't want to get into anybody else's so let me yeah so can I just ask for a commitment that you'd come back to us and go through this and be willing to talk to us more about what is going on here because we have not had the opportunity to explore this with you and in your staff is absolutely key and Congress has a critical role in this that's why it says draft so we're introducing it to you will go through I've just kind of outline the steps we've taken thus far we are to the draft of where we are but both the House and the Senate have an enormous amount of say in this and we think we need to reorganize in unified districts we're willing to work with it and and murder board it out if there's some adjustment that needs to be made great thank you

PERMISSION. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: DULY NOTED. MR. CARPER: THANK YOU SO MUCH. MR. PRESIDENT, LIKE A LOT OF OTHER AMERICANS, I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH LAST NIGHT. I DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL. I COULDN'T SHAKE THE OVERWHELMING FEELING OF SORROW THAT I FELT FOR THE COMMUNITY OF UVALDE, TEXAS. 19 INNOCENT CHILDREN -- FOURTH GRADERS -- WERE GUNNED DOWN IN THEIR CLASSROOM THREE DAYS BEFORE SUMMER BREAK. THREE DAYS. TWO TEACHERS WERE MURDERED AS WELL. COUNTLESS CHILDREN WITNESSED THEIR CLASSMATES AND TEACHERS SHOT AND KILLED AS THEY CLIMBED THROUGH WINDOWS TO TRY TO ESCAPE THE MASSACRE. THESE 21 FAMILIES ARE LIVING EVERY PARENTS' WORST NIGHTMARE -- THE LOSS OF A CHILD. INSTEAD OF PLANNING THEIR SUMMER VACATIONS, THOSE FAMILIES ARE NOW PLANNING THEIR CHILDREN'S FUNERALS. THEIR NIGHTMARE IS OUR NATIONAL NIGHTMARE. MY OPINION OWN BOYS WHO ARE NOW -- MY OWN BOYS WHO ARE NOW GROANL ADULTS, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF WHEN MY WIFE USED TO HELP THEM WITH HOMEWORK AND TUCK THEM INTO BED AT NIGHT. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK WHEN THEY WERE THE SAME AGE OF THE 19 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN GUNNED DOWN AT THEIR SCHOOL YESTERDAY. LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICAN PARENTS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, MY WIFE AND I ARE BROKENHEARTED TODAY. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DROPPED THEIR CHILDREN OFF AT SCHOOL THIS MORNING, AND MY GUESS IS THEY PROBABLY HUGGED THEM EXTRA TIGHTLY. THEY SAID GOODBYE AND WATCHED THOSE KIDS WALK INTO SCHOOL, AND THEY LEFT TO HOPE AND PRAY TODAY THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE THERE ALIVE AT PICKUP AT THE END OF THE DAY OR THAT THEY'LL BE ON THE BUS RIDE COMING HOME AT NIGHT. THEY ARE LEFT TO HOPE AND PRAY THAT THEY NEVER GET THE SHATTERING CALL THAT THOSE FAMILIES IN UVALDE RECEIVED YESTERDAY. MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE PARENTS HAVE TO HOPE AND PRAY THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL NOT BE MURDERED AT SCHOOL BY A GUNMAN. WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE A FOURTH GRADE CLASSROOM CAN BE TURNED INTO A BATTLEFIELD BY A MADMAN WITH AN ASSAULT WEAPON. THIS HAS TO STOP. WE CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY. WE ARE MOURNING THIS TRAGEDY, AND I REFUSE TO ACCEPT INACTION. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT THE MASS SLAUGHTER OF CHILDREN IN THEIR FOURTH GRADE CLASSROOM IS SOMEHOW NORMAL. THIS HAS TO STOP. WE CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY. MADAM PRESIDENT, FOR ABOUT AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN IN THIS CHAMBER -- AND THAT'S SOME 21 YEARS -- WE'VE BEEN FAILING TO ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS HAS TO STOP. WE CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS CAN'T REFORM OUR GUN LAWS IN A WAY THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC BROADLY SUPPORT. I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT CHANGING OUR LAWS WON'T REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND MAKE THESE TRAGEDIES LESS LIKELY FROM RECURRING IN THE FUTURE. WE'RE LONG OVERDUE TO MAKE COMMONSENSE REFORMS TO OUR NATION'S GUN LAWS. MADAM PRESIDENT, TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. I KNOW IT. I THINK WE ALL REALIZE THAT. MANY OF OUR FRIENDS IN THIS CHAMBER REVERE THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND RESPECT THE TRADITIONS OF LAWFUL GUN OWNERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY. I MYSELF OWN A GUN, BOUGHT A BB GUN WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD. IT DOES NOT GIVE US THE RIGHT TO GUN DOWN CHILDREN AT SCHOOL OR KILL AFRICAN AMERICANS AT A GROCERY STORE. OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE THESE WORDS THAT WE ALL REMEMBER. HE WROTE ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THESE 19 CHILDREN WERE DENIED THE RIGHT TO LIFE, TO LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. SO MADAM PRESIDENT, IN UVALDE, THERE IS NO LITTLE LEAGUE GAME THIS WEEKEND. THERE IS NO FIFTH GRADE NEXT YEAR. THERE WILL NEVER -- THEY WILL NEVER GET TO BE TEENAGERS, GO TO THEIR PROM, GRADUATE, GO ON TO COLLEGE, HAVE A CAREER, OR HAVE CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN. AND, IF LUCKY, MAYBE GRANDCHILDREN SOMEDAY. THEIR LIVES ARE STOLEN FROM THEM BY A GUNMAN, AND TRAGICALLY WE CAN NEVER BRING THEM BACK. WHAT WE CAN DO, THOUGH, WHAT WE CAN DO, THOUGH, IS TO TRY HARD -- REALLY HARD -- TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WE'VE HAD ENOUGH , THIS HAS TO STOP, WE CAN'T GO ON THIS WAY, WE WON'T GO ON THIS WAY. TODAY WE ARE A NATION IN MOURNING. WE ALSO NEED TO BE A NATION WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC. WORKING TO REFORM OUR GUN LAWS AND DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PREVENT ANOTHER MASSACRE IN AN AMERICAN SCHOOL, IN A PLACE OF WORSHIP, OR IN A GROCERY STORE. MAY GOD BLESS THE COMMUNITY OF UVALDE. MAY THE LORD BE WITH THOSE 21 FAMILIES DURING THIS TIME OF UNFATHOMABLE HEARTACHE AND ANGUISH. WITH THAT, MADAM PRESIDENT, I YIELD

nice gentleman from minnesota mr elmer thank you mr chairman and uh ranking member heizinga for hosting this hearing today mr growl you frequently acknowledge that public trust and confidence in our capital markets has eroded in fact on october 13 2021 you stated quote the decline in trust undermines the investor confidence needed for the fair efficient and orderly operation of our capital markets put simply if the public doesn't think the system is fair they are not going to invest their hard-earned money close quote i agree but time and time again you place the cause of blame for this erosion of trust almost squarely on the shoulders of industry participants and companies mr gruwal the sec is in no way blameless here chair gensler's political regime at the sec carried out by its division of enforcement has been characterized by a focus on using enforcement to expand sec jurisdiction at the expense of public resources public investment in our country and public trust in our markets it seems clear to everyone except maybe those at the commission that the sec is not regulating in good faith although many sectors of the industry have grappled with the sec's politicians politicization of regulation over the last 14 months it can be seen most clearly when it comes to the digital asset industry take for example industry sweeps as you know industry sweeps are not novel to the digital asset to the digital asset industry they are a series of voluntary document production request letters as a regulator sends to everyone in a given industry who is similarly situated or is involved in the same type of activity mr grewal does the sec division of enforcement do industry sweeps we do uh industry sweeps from time to time when we have additional thank you the answer is yes i've reclaimed my time are there currently any industry sweeps underway so i can't talk about uh investigation you you can't talk about it legally or you won't talk about it it's our policy not to confirm or deny it so you won't talk about it all right what do you do if a company sir cannot respond to a sweep letter because they're not in your jurisdiction if we uh issue a voluntary request for information uh there's not much we can do we can proceed with the subpoena and then the subpoena enforcement action so you do extra jurisdictional requests then voluntary requests uh are just that they're voluntary they're an important part again sir i'm not asking about the request now i'm asking about the people you direct those to there are some that would be within the sec's jurisdiction there are some that are not my question is and i think you've confirmed it that you do industry sweeps to extra jurisdictional uh market participants people you do not have uh enforcement authority over we subpoena individuals and witnesses who may be in the market market participants are they within your jurisdiction and without outside of your jurisdiction we're not limited by our jurisdiction when we're collecting evidence we we follow the evidence wherever it leads into whomever it leads there may be someone who doesn't work in the uh i would i would say sir go after them yeah i would ask so you do uh extra jurisdictional work uh some would argue that that's not appropriate but mr gruwell has chair gessler ever directed you or to your knowledge asked any of your colleagues to make it a bloodbath for companies who don't respond to a sweep letter which are voluntary no that's not happened interesting i we become aware that chair gensler has in the past directed the division of enforcement to send a sweep letter to a particular sector of the crypto community designed to jam them into a violation that is allegedly unconstitutional and if any company does not respond to said sweep letter which i'll reiterate as you've said several times are supposed to be voluntary then the sec would make it a quote bloodbath for them if true i imagine such a tactic would significantly erode trust between the public and the sec here's the problem the sec isn't interested in clarifying what areas of the crypto industry fall under sec jurisdiction we know that because fin hub that you've referred to the sec division focused on crafting crypto regulation has essentially dissolved under gensler nonetheless while abandoning good faith attempts clarify how to clarify how the commission's existing authority applies to digital assets the sec is hell-bent on expanding the size of its crypto enforcement division and using enforcement to unconstitutionally expand its jurisdiction under chair gensler the sec has become a power hungry regulator politicizing enforcement baiting companies to quote come in and talk to the commission then hitting them with enforcement actions and discouraging good faith cooperation understand sir there is a new day coming thank you i yield back

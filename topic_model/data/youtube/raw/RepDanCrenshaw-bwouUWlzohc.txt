we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey everybody welcome back to the greatest podcast ever where we inform you on all policy issues and we're back to current events here on what's really going on in in israel and look i've had uh an israeli general on um me and uh my staff have talked about it we've given you the background but i wanted to get perspective from an israeli arab as well because there's this growing narrative in the united states obviously especially amongst the left that arabs are are downtrodden they are they are the victims here whether they're in israel whether they're in palestine and so let's get that perspective from someone who's actually there uh so i've brought on um i've brought on someone to help us exactly with that uh yusuf haddad thank you so much for being on thank you for having me so for the audience just give us a little bit of your background and then we want to talk then we want to go into it you know what what's the truth people have so many concepts and perceptions of the situation in israel most people have never been there of course um it's it's a hard place to understand without really being there on the ground it's very complex but give us your background first well you know once you're in israel then you really understand everything that's for sure uh anyway my name is yusuf haddad i am 35 years old i was born in haifa which is the biggest mixed city in israel means that you have jews you have arabs christians muslims jews and then my parents i moved to the biggest arabic city in israel which is in nazareth and i am currently there and through my whole life my friends were jewish arabs christians muslims so i grew up in a diverse society uh which is actually the israeli society and all my friends when when we started they were growing up together and all that we grow up as you know we don't care if you're jewish you don't we don't care if you're an arab we're just friends and we love to play uh soccer we call it here football so uh that's by the way i have no idea why in the united states you call football football and most of it you play with your hand but that's a different issue we'll leave it there for a different different topic i actually don't know the history of that so um and by the age of 18 when i arrived at the age of 18 my drew's friends and my jewish friends uh drafted to the idf now the idf it's israel defense force it's not the jdf it's not a jewish defense force so as an arab i'm not obligated to serve in the army and i asked the question why because again as i said it's an israeli defense force not a jewish defense force eventually i i volunteered and i was a combat fighter in the gulani brigade and i've actually become also a commander so i hear a lot of in the united states calling israel an apartheid country and then they meet an arab who was a commander and the idf commander of jewish soldiers and then we'd say wait but how is that possible because like it's it's an apartheid country well it's not and and and i actually can give thousands of examples to to to refute that accusation and we can talk about it by the way yeah so i become commander and we actually have something in common because just two months before i was supposed to finish my service i was injured badly i was in lebanon and uh four days before ceasefire i participated in the second lebanon war in 2006. wow four days before fire hezbollah launched a current anti-tank missile towards me i was very lucky they didn't hit directly you know me had like a wall that was very close to me so from the explosion i was injured very badly my foot was cut off i had a huge shrapnel in my face and bodies uh but eventually the best doctors arabs and jews they managed to react that's my own food and now i play football again and run 10k every week wow um and lately i am yeah and after that i mean i went conquered life business and all that studied and at my last position i was a ceo of a marketing research company but then i dropped everything to focus on my work as a social activist for my society because i saw that my society is going backward so i've decided to found the organization together about for each other which is an arab israeli organization the whole target is to bring the arab society closer to the israeli society bridge gaps between arabs and jews and at the same time as we see lately is also to talk about israel because we want to show the truth uh present the facts and stand against everyone who twists uh the facts about israel and we're saying it as a from our perspective so so and let's talk about that like what is it like being an israeli arab in israel like if you listen to our congresswoman who is uh you know she comes from a palestinian refugee family you know you would think uh one thing if i listen to you think another thing and i i have to assume that the the opinions are mixed um but you know amongst there's two so there's about 2 million arabs out of 8.3 million people in israel it's a lot of people so i mean give us uh just just give us an indication of of what it's like i mean do they have the same voting rights property rights speech rights religious rights or is it totally different i mean what's what's the truth actually actually before with your permission before i answer this question uh i've seen a lot of uh when you mentioned rashida talib and obviously there's elhan omar and and there's corey bush and cortes i'm i i remembered this because lately i see in the united states a lot of uh you know anti-semitism riots and violence and i must tell you right now i do see a connection between their incitements and lies and twisting the facts to what's going on on the street in the united states and i'm very very worried about that and i really hope that someone will put a stop and end to it because it is start to look like a very dangerous thing and i'm saying this because as an arab i am telling you it's either they are ignorant and they have no idea what's going on here or they are absolutely lying knowing that they are lying and this is very dangerous because in israel and this and and now i can actually answer your question in israel there's 2 million israeli arabs living in israel in the green line what we call it 1.6 million muslims 145 000 christians 145 000 druze and 130 000 benjamin muslims the tribes mostly in the north in the south but they are muslims and each and every one of us has a full voting rights free speech free religion practice we can become whatever we want now don't get this idea that everything is perfect here i'm not saying everything is perfect and even though i'm saying that you know despite the fact that everybody is twisting facts for instance we do have racism here but i mean congressman come on even in the united states you have racism even in south africa africa it's the world it's the world yeah i hate it but it's true yeah so so so like but but it seems like the world likes to focus on israel and it's easy also especially like in the u.n and and and other organizations and bodies so so in israel you know what let me give you an example i've already said that i was a commander i commanded over jewish soldiers but here's an example it's probably a name that for americans doesn't say anything but beside that it's a muslim name but is in fact the chairman of the biggest bank in israel the biggest bank in israel this is something huge not a lot of people know that one of the judges that sent our president to prison was and actually an arab so like like just imagine in an apartheid country an arab a judge sends the israeli president to prison because of his action doctors we have more we are only 20 of the population here but we have more than 35 percent of doctors in israel are israeli arabs wow pharmaceuticals the pharmacists are 40 and another thing sports we like sports the captain of the national soccer team he is a muslim half of the squad israeli arabs christians muslims jews i mean 15 israeli are up in the parliament in the israeli parliament and by the way guess who pays their sa who paid them it's the israeli taxpayers jews and arabs you get to vote you get the speech you have even a huge uh huge positions within the parliament you get to see even an arab representative kicking out a jewish minister from the knesset from the parliament if he wants to if obviously if he's running the the decision so what i'm trying to say here it's not like what you think when i when i when i say that it's when you when people see on the tv and and don't really explore about what's going on in israel so again there's a lot of opportunities but those are those the people who are criticizing israel they're just twisting those facts i'm not really there talking to the point and if i may one last sentence understand that those people who are twisting the facts actually harm us the arabs in israel because instead of focusing and saying the truth and trying to find the solution for our problems they want to cause more problems and yes i am talking about someone like rashida talib who is a native palestinian i am talking exactly to some someone like her she is actually doing more damage to us and she's also making more damage to the palestinians in the west bank in gaza than helping and she doesn't realize that because she doesn't have to live with the consequences because she's in america not here that's my biggest problem and my concern biggest concern yeah that's powerful man uh i'm gonna i'm gonna ask you if we could use those clips for uh social media um it's powerful and it's so true and like that truth needs to be set up like we've got demonstrations all over america for you know the the cause and and like you said that just that that just instigates more violence where we're these people here don't have to feel the consequences of it and um you know look it the leftism in america is you have to understand it to understand why they take sides on this and they view everything through an oppressor an oppressor and a victim and they've chosen that the palestinians are the victims here and um and then everything is okay after that like once you've decided that that you viewed this issue through that lens then it justifies all further extreme action it doesn't matter what it is and that's that's a really crazy place to be well let me play devil's advocate a little bit more with you so you've debunked the notion that arabs and israel don't have the same rights they clearly do but but they are poor um right on just on a i guess on average in the aggregate uh economic opportunities in west jerusalem or better than east jerusalem so like you said you're not saying anything's perfect there's problems you know and are those problems i mean we have the same problems right in america so society actually every society yeah but you know so how do you fix that i mean what are what's the what's the way out of that i want to surprise you you know a lot of people when when we come and talk about and and again we're talking specifically about the israeli arabs and if you want later to talk about the palestinians in gaza and the west bank it's also possible but for the israeli arabs a lot of people comes and and and when they criticize israel they forgot they forget that there is actually another side that need to be criticized as well and this is what actually why we founded the organization together about for each other we criticized also our leadership our arab israeli leadership right now which they are more concerned and more focusing on what's going on in gaza instead of being more focusing focusing on what's going on here in israel with us they're shouting gaza and not nazareth they're shouting janine and not for instance [Music] those all places with other mixed cities where jews and arabs live together or are villages or arab cities and and and we need to understand in order for us to be in a better position in order for us to fix those problems and this is exactly what our gold we need to work side by side and we need to cooperate between the both societies and this is what we decided to do we said that enough with the you know division enough being a a separate we see as israel as an united israeli society arabs and jews and what we want is to live side by side and make sure that we fix our problems together not by you know acting like we are oh my god you know we are we're we're we're the victim here uh we are very uh weak no we're not we can we can actually with uh side by side we can actually demand our rights and and even have it and that's what i want and hopefully that in the future the young generation uh like us and more will find the way to go to that path and we are on the way by the way well give me an idea though like if i have the same conversation with um 10 israeli arabs how many are going to speak like you how many how many are going to speak like rasheed at the leave and how many are going to be kind of in the middle that's the key question if you'd speak with them without microphones you're gonna get eight nine out of ten speaking like me really once you get once you put a camera they either will not talk to you or they might even change their mind we have a huge problem that we are seeing currently in israel and by the way it is actually now we were talking about what happened here in israel people that mostly they saw the in the united states they talk about the clashes between a palestine and israel by the way which is not it's between israel and hamas the terrorist organization israel have no problem with palestinians israel have a huge problem with a terrorist organization like hamas but we will talk about it if you want later what i'm saying right now is beside that there were clashes and there were riots within israel between two extreme minority groups one from the jewish side and one from the arab side uh but they both those those two groups we have to understand that they are a minority minority in both societies the arab and the the jewish now our problem is in the majority of the israeli europe we are silent and we are afraid but we are afraid specifically from the actually from the minority extremists in our society not from the jewish in our society because unfortunately they have illegal weapons unfortunately they are violent i have been taking death threats and curses and hate comments and messages in the last two weeks like you have no idea i have an idea i have an idea you know you know what i but i believe you you're right i i bet you have i mean seriously yours are probably worse i'll be honest yours are probably worse mine are kind of stupid the thing is that it is it is real it is real now if you look at it just like this and not in a you know in a wider perspective you will it will seem like they are the majority but the problem is the only one who is cursing online and the only one who is actually uh replying and commenting it's only them that's why it seems that there are a lot because the silence because the silent voice is not responding do you know where they are responding they're sending me private messages to my account telling me yusef just keep doing what you're doing and we're sorry that we're not you know able to support you publicly but i understand that my sister supported me do you know what happened to her they start cursing her husband her her kid it was terrible i asked her to delete the comment i you know what i have a lot of strength i'm willing to get all these hateful comments and and if they threaten me well i would say that they good luck to them as an ex-idf soldier a fighter soldier if they wanna you know come in bring it on that's what i say too i i talk openly i'm like i'm always carrying a weapon and i'm ready for you so just don't don't f with me so so but but for me if this is a huge platform to say please don't believe that the majority of the arabs are are you know they they hate jews or they don't want to be part of the israeli society and please don't think that the majority of the jewish people here are racist because they're not it's only two small minority extremist groups that you just see a lot on the online and on the social media and it's actually no it says you know this thing brings waiting when you put something like that immediately everyone's want to see on the social media they want to talk about it they want to share it uh so so that's why it feels like they're so uh so much uh you know powerful and more a lot more than others but there's so many parallels there's so many parallels to what you're talking about um and and what has recently started happening in the united states and by recently i mean maybe the last five years maybe a little bit longer and you mentioned it earlier when you gave me that great you know segments uh on on the squad that i really want to use um and what you talked about what was happening on our streets here in the u.s and there's this uh the term is the um the the green red alliance which is you know green being hamas and red being marxism communism and that alliance is real and why is there an alliance there well because it's all because the essence of marxism is about identity politics it started out as class warfare but it's morphed into you know many other identities associated with that usually race and religion being a really first and foremost and you're seeing that bubble up here i mean race relations have gotten worse not better in america and it's entirely because of this toxic identity politics which in israel has been it's been there forever i mean you know it's it's it's unfortunately it's woven right into your founding you don't have a choice um and it's still really detrimental to us one other thing i want to say is you mentioned we're not an apartheid state it's important for people to understand what apartheid actually was so let me just i'm just going to read it real quick it's it's being separate first of all it is it is enforced separateness south africa was institutionalized segregation based on race it banned africans from serving in government political office military or police marriages across racial lines were outlawed africans were forced into segregated neighborhoods it came down to a completely different set of rights based on race so that's apartheid everybody everything uh you said i don't think anything you just said is associated with that in fact after fact you can really check me and here i'm i'm even ready to like uh uh swear on it if you find any of my facts being like twisted or not real i'm quitting i'm quitting that's how i'm sure of the facts that i'm saying and i'm saying it like this because i want you to understand that this is the reality in israel and everybody needs really just to do the research and if not i mean we beat corona as soon as possible you want to come and visit israel especially now where we have a ceasefire and it is a beautiful beautiful country come on out and see it for yourself and talk to the people here simply so now now playing devil's advocate again with what the other side would say is we're not we're not maybe we're not talking about east jerusalem or or or or nazareth we're not talking about that we're talking about the west bank and gaza it's a prison we're talking about all right you know in west bank like they don't they can't leave they there's no you know the airport i don't know what like what would you say to that and and maybe and maybe if you don't mind i'd well i'll ask you afterwards go ahead and go ahead with that one let's let's start with gaza israel withdraw from every inch in gaza yeah leaving gaza to the palestinians what did the palestinian do hand it to a terrorist group hamas is a terrorist group and it's it's it's recognized as a terrorist group in the eu by the way in the united states obviously all over the world recognize hamas as a terrorist group hamas doesn't want peace and i understand by the way why because if there is peace between israel and gaza then hamas is no longer needed and if there's no longer needed hamas how are they going to get the hundreds of millions of dollars each year they need the money and in order for them to get the money they need to make sure that there is clashes between gaza and israel further than that the hideous talk that gaza is locked but i don't see people criticizing egypt i mean gaza is also have a border with egypt and egypt closed the border with gaza so why it's okay for egypt to close the border but if israel closes the border it's not and by the way if you're asking wait an arab country like egypt close the border with an arab city like in gaza why why arab will do something like this it's because egypt doesn't want terrorists to go through from in and out and obviously israel the same but you know what let me surprise you did you know that the more than 150 000 people from gaza have a work permit and they can come to south israel and actually work actually i actually did not know that i know a lot about this situation that's not something i do stan that's crazy not only that during muslim holidays israel would give permission to palestinians in gaza thousands of them to go and pray in al-aqsa in jerusalem people never mention something like this israel is responsible for the electricity for the water hamas actually in the last last battle i have no idea if people know that but hamas fired three four days ago fired a rocket towards israel landed in gaza and actually destroyed the electricity they destroyed their own electricity the one that israel supplies them yeah do you understand how crazy it is and people think that oh my god gaza is under a seizure israel is doing congressional control give me five years with the money that hamas taking from from from all those organizations give me five years i'm i swear to you i will make gaza little singapore the metro terror that they built i will build actually a real metro yeah our real facilities is better frustrations school system they have beautiful beaches but they are occupied in terror that's the problem and i think that's what people in a west bank it's it's it's different but it's similar in the sense that it's autonomous uh you know gaza is completely self-ruled uh there's not there's no israelis in there um they were they were actually taken from their homes by the israeli government they said you had you got to move we're going to remove you from your homes like thousands of people uh it happened it happened forcibly removed from their home right because they didn't want to and the same actually happens in the west bank uh you know it happens both ways right it's very complicated um but there is this constant movement in this effort to sort of find a balance and it's it's not easy right there's little pockets of jewish settlements throughout the west bank and um but these people have been there for a long time it's very hard to to you know to just find that right right solution and so i kind of want to go ahead i i have to tell you something israel more than one more than once uh stepped up and actually gave back supplements for peace it's the palestinian leaders time after time messed it up because they don't you know because they because they never say what they actually want that's the problem more than that look at that like let's because the west bank is more complicated i would like to to to to explain about the west bank that it's divided to three uh uh uh places which we have like a b and c and a and b it's actually controlled by the palestinian authority which means they as you say they have full autonomy and they have police and health department i i just remembered because during the corona pandemic they they they there there were a lot of claims why israel is not uh providing uh uh uh vaccines to the palestinians and and and as an as an occupier power a someone who's you know occupying someone we have the the uh responsibility to do that but by the way which is completely nonsense because under the oslo accords uh palestine gained full control in terms of all the health system and everything so so we need to understand that it's also not important because it's the palestinian authority who is controlling and managing their own people but you know what i had a conversation with a palestinian from the west bank do you know what he said he said listen obviously i want my own state and i'm and it's not about the one-state solution i do want my own country you know that's what he told me but he said if you now would tell me to choose between being on the israeli authority or the palestinian authority like i i actually have it on video by the way i have it on video i recorded him and he know by the way he knew that i'm interviewing him and he said i would prefer to live under the israeli authority because of one reason our authority is corrupted the palestinian authority is corrupted so this is where it gets really complicated um when you're talking about a two-state solution one state solution and here's the here's the issue i i've heard that a lot by the way a lot a lot of a lot of palestinians in the west bank are like i'd rather just be part of israel that sounds good but then if you're in his but if you're an israeli jew you have to think about what that means you're now in the minority uh and and it fundamentally changes the democracy in israel and so oh it's it seems obvious so why is it so that's why maybe it's opposed i'm gonna surprise you yeah most of israeli arabs don't want the palestinians in the west bank to be a part of of one state not only that for the reasons i just said i mean it would fundamentally change the balance of government the israeli arabs themselves are concerned about that as well and in fact if you remember uh when uh when donald trump um you know had the deal of the century if you're you know a few uh a year ago something like this one of the options was that to give the triangle villages just like to pass them to palestine not to take out the the people from their houses or something like this they would stay in their houses those israeli arabs would become a palestinian and and and and on that all of the people all the israeli arabs on that he said there's no way we're doing this which which triangle which which villages it's the the triangle villages that they are very close to the center of israel center east israel uh and and the idea was is to just you know give them to palestine to be part of palestine uh by the way it was conditioned by the fact that all all the uh residents of this village or city need to vote on it and need to accept it yeah none of them they would say none of them at that at that week one of the biggest websites in israel the arab israeli website a a conducted a survey which participated 30 000 israeli arabs and they asked would you um would you give up your israeli identity to have a palestinian identity are you ready for the result more than 86 percent out of the 3 000 people who participated in this survey more than 86 percent said no wow and only 14 said yes and trust me at judgment day they will also say no yeah if it really comes down to it that's fascinating that that's very helpful it just illuminates for people what what the what the deal is you know uh okay but what's your personal opinion i mean like this is an unbelievably hard question to ask but what's your personal opinion on one state two state how this should how it should play out right and but now there's a couple of assumptions right for us to do this thought exercise i think we have to to have some hypotheticals in place one and that hypothetical i think has to be that all security concerns are taken care of because i am well aware of what your answer is going to be and every israeli's answer is going to be it's like we can't even have that conversation until they stop doing terrorism right got it so let's assume that every single member of hamas is now in jail and they're gone and fatah has like is like oh it's so peaceful now and like we're just we're just really ah we're so loving this piece now what right so what what would be ideal is this a palestinian state i mean what would what would work i'm going to actually surprise you yeah why do you like to do that i'd like to do that i thought that the deal of the century the trump deal was actually a good start to negotiation yeah it was reasonable it was it was a different approach than what we've taken in the past the clinton parameters like for instance for me the idea of moving the triangle uh villages to palestine that's a big no by the way it doesn't matter because also it was conditioned by all that the residents of this village or city need to vote and accept that it's not like uh israel or palestine agree and that's it and and obviously they wouldn't agree to that but in in in terms of all of it it's it was a very good uh very good deal um let me tell you but let me tell you my idea on it it's a two-state solution because the last thing that we need is another uh two million from gaza or and two million or two million point five depends you ask from the west bank to be part of israel as a one state and from there actually then if we if let's see it is one state and everyone will because this is a democratic state and then you have to give everyone full rights like the israeli arabs then very soon the demographic situation will very you know change and this is a danger on israel also being as a jewish and democratic state so this solution is not it's it's out of the the equation because if you don't give them equal rights then israel becomes exactly the one state solution is not terrible but by the way those so sorry for being straightforward but those idiots who say that israel is an apartheid country and doesn't understand when actually israel might become an apartheid country which is two different things and and and sometimes i question how they become a congress men and women i really don't understand and i'm from my humble position here in israel and we don't understand how maybe you can answer that question it's a long story so so eventually for me the solution is two-state solution exactly what you said with the hypothetically saying that everyone leaves terror and israel secure its you know border and have full security but it's actually also simple it's it's a connection between gaza to ramallah palestine will be exist and and the the capital city is jerusalem is the capital city of israel point uh and in terms of the army uh obviously the palestinians will have a police force not an army force and whatever it is in in in in the west bank you can have a solution actually it's not a problem israel proven themselves more than once er that they are willing to go an extra step for peace the problem is we've seen it through course of the history time after time we've seen the arab leaders and the palestinian leaders after that messing it up imagine imagine i've i've visited in the u.n just two weeks ago i was in the u.n and then i saw there was a wall uh called the palestinian wall in the u.n and you see that you see the original map that was supposed to be israel and palestine based on the partition plan do you understand if the arab and the jewish and the israelis accepted that plan but the arab didn't accept that do you understand if they accepted the plan what would be palestine right now this place here nazareth would be palestine based on the petition plan do you understand how much they lost because of their i don't know even how to say it because of their stubbornness and lack of and transience exactly and and and then you go back you go forward in the years and every time they decline and every time they climb this is why we have here in israel even the in in in the you know in the middle east they love to say this sentence the palestinian never miss a chance to miss a chance and it's sad right and it's sad and i mean the the violence from hamas clearly obviously it hurts israeli jews i mean it you got rockets raining down on you it's not great but yeah but but that's my point it's like who it really hurts i think it hurts probably gazans more than anybody um but it but this is what everybody needs to understand is it's it victimizes gazans probably the worst victimizes israeli arabs israeli jews and and we just we we want to you know the left in america just wants to believe something different and it's very unhealthy you know you know we have to we have to say it again and again israel is not fighting palestinians and it wasn't like this and when people are talking about it and not seeing the clear picture that hamas hamas is actually killing his own people hamas is actually killing arab from israel and hamas is killing jewish in israel and by the way we've seen that they're launching thousands of rockets on civilians and then you know what they go and call israel who is picking the targets and calling the palestinians before actually bombing the buildings and then they say that israel commits a war crime and while hamas launching thousands of rockets on israel and they'd say oh no it's nothing i mean come on let me go would you believe that the united states would allow thousands of rockets towards your country and be silent no we would uh that that place would not exist much longer at least if i was in charge i mean uh i mean there's just it's the amount of restraint shown um is is is unbelievable i mean granted i mean this administration lets a quarter million people across our border no problem uh in the last two months so who knows what they would allow but i but look i mean even joe biden i do think if they were launching a rockets it'd be a different story uh it's just it's it really is an unbelievable it's unbelievable how false the narrative has become i mean this is what just like i i just can't understand um and and again it it's deeper right it's it's it's much deeper than just ignorance it it really goes into deep seated narratives that are rooted in marxism and and the narrative building and and israel is a victim of that of that kind of worldwide growing because like the longer we're away in history from marxism the more society forgets it forgets how bad it was and and is more willing to embrace it again and i think as human beings that they were going to forever have this problem because it is natural to to want to be tribal it's natural and it's it's deep seated in our brains look our brains are no different than the than the people who cheered in the roman coliseum as lions were ripping apart gladiators like our brains are the same so so it's it's and and we're we're susceptible to these emotional arguments and so we're always going to be dealing with this and and it's up to truth tellers to say look western civilization and the enlightenment uh based in judeo-christian values works and we're gonna have to keep fighting for it and um and the the truth shall set you afraid it usually does um i appreciate that man any anything else to add before we before we pop off i think we've pretty much covered a lot

good morning everyone uh thank you for joining us for the virtual ag summit it's great to have you participate uh this is a little different format than we've done before but i'm very grateful to have some expert panelists all week beginning with this morning and just uh very grateful that we even at have midscove technology with you face to face but this technology allows us with covid and with miles in between for us to gather like this and i think it can be particularly productive i should probably apologize in advance that uh in technology what it is i hope we don't have any hiccups we've tried to plan for this but uh there might be so we appreciate your your patience as we as we do move forward here with us today we have three special guests to update us on what their organizations have been doing to help nebraska continue to grow in the housing area housing and rural development and i know we have a lot of challenges economically especially these days with unemployment and workforce issues and i'm just grateful to have folks here these experts as we do kick off the virtual ag summit starting with rural housing and rural development so from usda rural development today we have nebraska state area director christa metcher and christa joined usda rural development in 1997 working in the beatrice and lincoln area offices directly with the processing underwriting and approving of loans and grants for home purchase and repair she works extensively with the regulation delivery oversight approval and outreach of the single-family housing programs including the 502 direct and 502 guaranteed home purchase and 504 repair programs joining us from the nebraska investment finance authority as we called knife we have outgoing executive director tim kenney and incoming executive director shannon horner so just in the last few days we've seen that transition but very grateful tim for certainly your your participation over the years and and as you uh do uh shift gears here a little bit we're grateful that you're with us here today and as especially as you hand off the baton to to shannon and nifa provides financing for affordable and workforce housing development medical facilities community infrastructure industrial development projects and first-time farmers and ranchers tim served as executive director of nifa from 1994. to august to 2020 just the last few days tim also served as program director and executive director for housing finance agencies in two other states with large ag constituencies under tim's leadership nifa has provided financing for approximately 100 000 single and multi-family homes and that's just in nebraska incoming executive director of nifa shannon harner grew up in imperial sometimes i refer to folks uh you know like that as imperialist but uh we won't have to do that today uh shannon attended the university of nebraska-lincoln and then attended law school at georgetown university law center she returned to nebraska clerked with nebraska court of appeals and then went into private practice in lincoln with a focus on real estate and most recently shannon served as ceo of home services of nebraska before joining nifa so i would ask everyone uh we're going to go through our presenters here today they will uh share some remarks and updates and as you think of questions if you wouldn't mind going into the chat feature uh here on the on the zoom program here just go on your screen choose that chat feature and fire off a question to eric i should introduce eric from my staff he works across the district here out of the grand island office but eric is from geneva and we certainly appreciate his service so he will kind of be the moderator of questions so if you want to share your question with eric just go into that chat feature and feel free to type in your question and then eric will read the question to to the entire to all the participants and we will go from there but first let's let's hear from our presenters to kick things off krista from rural development will you lead us uh with a general update what you would say you and your agency have been doing to work on housing issues and promote rural nebraska thank you thank you we really appreciate you having a usda rural development be a part of this i've been working in the housing department for you know 20 plus years so this is kind of my passion and i get really excited when we talk about housing in rural communities so i do have a presentation here and we'll see if i can get my screen shared and there we go so usda rural development this is our mission statement we're committed to helping improve the economy and quality of life in rural america and i usually just like to say life in rural nebraska because i'm passionate about nebraska america is great but you know we want to focus on nebraska so we help through our programs in a lot of ways and we do have a lot of programs through rural development i like to say that it's kind of a best kept secret but we don't want it to be a secret we don't have a budget for advertising so this is how we get the word out on our programs we go to those rural communities we talk to the the leaders and the people in the rural communities because we want to have these programs known about so when you think of usda rural development what's the first thing that comes to mind and i know a lot of you are going to say what's on the screen probably not home purchase and repair financing when you hear the words world development it's probably not the first thing that comes to mind but it is indeed a big part of what we do at usda rural development a lot of people just don't even realize that we have these home programs so again that's what we want to get the word out about these are fantastic programs we do also have in addition to those home programs we do have business and energy programs that can help our rural communities we have community facilities programs and then we have multi-family housing programs so you can see we've got a lot of different programs that work in the rural communities but what i want to focus on today is our single-family housing programs you can't have communities grow if you don't have housing you can't bring jobs into a community if you don't have housing to put those people in some of the barriers that we see to affordable housing is people having a lack of cash for down payment people aren't able to save as much as they used to back in i like to say in the olden days it's just a lot it's a lot harder to make those paychecks stretch an inability to meet the housing costs lack of available housing or substandard existing housing a lot of the homes in our rural communities are getting to be a little run down need a little work we need to bring some additional new housing to those rural communities and then the availability of suitable financing so that's where rural development comes in to help with some of these rural communities and providing some financing for for homes some of our partners in uh home ownership and and repairs of course our realtors and lenders our builders and our contractors we do have loan packages that assemble uh packages of loans for us of course the rural communities nifa we do work a lot with nifa our nebraska housing developers our non-profits we can use down payment assistance or closing cost assistance we can work with a purchase rehab resale program ded we can get funding through the home funds trust funds federal home loan bank has money that we can partner with uh assistive technology just a wide array of people that we can partner with to get the word out to get some additional funding for applicants and put together the best package that we can for them the big wow factor about our home purchase programs is that we are a hundred percent financing there's really no other programs in nebraska or the nation for that matter unless you're a veteran and you can qualify through the va there just aren't a lot of programs out there that have 100 financing so we are not going to require you to have that down payment hud has some programs that you can get into a home pretty uh affordably but they still require about three and a half percent down payment so again this is this is the big draw to our programs is that it is 100 financing so what is the meaning of rural for our single family housing programs so basically all the communities in nebraska are eligible with some exceptions we can't loan in fremont grand island hastings carney lincoln north platter omaha and sioux city and and dakota city so all of the other little rural communities in nebraska are eligible for our programs it's just what we would consider the bigger metropolitan areas that don't qualify it's generally communities of 20 000 in population or less so again a lot of nebraska qualifies and we can get a lot of people into homes across nebraska through these programs so we have two very distinctly different programs i like to equate that to a lot of the young kids wear these non-matching socks these days it kind of drives me crazy but we they are very distinctly different so the first one that we have is our 502 direct program again 100 financing so no down payment required so the primary goal of this program is to provide affordable quality housing to income eligible households and as an example for income eligibility um our direct program a household of one through four people could make up to fifty seven thousand three hundred dollars in a year's time and a household of five through eight people could make up to seventy five thousand six hundred and fifty dollars so um pretty generous income limits a lot of the rural communities may qualify um under those income limits we do have to count all household members in those income limits so if you have grandma living in the in the bedroom down the hall or you have uncle joe in the basement we do have to count their income too be it social security or if they have you know income from a job we do have to base it on the income of all household members now under the direct program we can do new construction or existing dwellings we do have mortgage limits under this program uh but they're pretty high they're up in the two to three hundred thousand dollar uh range so you can still construct a pretty nice home if you want to go with new construction excuse me frogging my throat this is a 33-year loan our current interest rate right now is the lowest it's ever been in the entire life of this program it's at 2.5 so that is pretty amazing then based on your household size and income you can qualify for a subsidized rate which can take you to as low as one percent excuse me um a lot of people on a fixed income like social security um they can still be a home under homeowner under this program because of that subsidized rate and that low rate we can finance repairs and closing costs up to the as improved appraised value so a home doesn't have to be in perfect condition which a lot of them probably aren't uh so we can do some repairs and bring it up up to standards for people under the program excuse me and here are those mortgage limits that i mentioned for mcpherson logan in lincoln counties is 346 thousand eight hundred dollars and all other counties in nebraska are two hundred and sixty five thousand four hundred dollars so that's going to be your maximum mortgage limit under this program but again you can see those are pretty generous limits and we're talking modest housing here so so we think we can do a pretty good modest home under those income limits the next program that we have is our guaranteed program it's the sock on the other foot the other colored sock so under this program again it's a hundred percent financing no down payment required this is not just for first-time home buyers generally our direct program we see a lot of first-time home buyers under that program but this program we have i like to call them repeat offenders but that doesn't sound very nice um but they do come back and use the program over and over it's just a really good program for them we do have income eligibility requirements under this program as well and as an example of that a household of one through four can make up to thousand three hundred dollars and a household of five through eight can go up to a hundred and nineteen thousand so much more generous income limits under our guaranteed program we can get a lot of rural nebraska people finance for homes under the guaranteed program again we do have to count all the household members in that income calculation this is a 30-year fixed-rate loan rates are really great right now we're seeing record lows so i mean this is a fantastic time to buy a home right now the interest rate is negotiated with a lender you actually make application with an approved lender which is basically just a bank that participates in our program so that interest rate is negotiated with the lender there is a one percent guaranteed fee that can also be financed so we can actually do a hundred and one percent loan there is also a point three five percent annual fee which i like to say is a lot like mortgage insurance but it's a lot cheaper rate than what your typical conventional mortgage insurance would be we have no maximum mortgage limits under this program so where the direct program had the two to three hundred thousand this has no cap on it it's basically what those applicants ratios can support and again we can finance any necessary repairs and eligible closing costs as supported by that appraisal the other little neat tidbit since they're on the webinar today is we do a lot of partnership with knife on this program so we get a lot of guaranteed knife alone shout out to nifa so basically under this program like i said the applicant is the customer of the lender and then the lender is the customer of role development we do a quick review once they submit the package and just make sure that they've underwritten it to our uh criteria and then real development issues the guarantee on the loan to that lender so it's a 90 guarantee so this is a very popular program with the lenders because of the guarantee and of course with the applicants because of the low of the low fees uh the no down payment requirement so again this is kind of a little hidden gem it's not real hidden because we do about a thousand plus loans a year in nebraska under this program but uh so much more we could do out in those rural communities once we get this information out and people people know about it the last program i want to just mention briefly here is we do have a 504 repair program a lot of homes we see in the rural communities are getting getting a little rough a little worn down and we do have a program to make some repairs to those home in this picture you can see on the right side there it's a before and after and it's just amazing to see the difference that that makes you know what a what a difference for the community uh you can tell that pride and home ownership has kind of been reborn there it looks so good for that real community a little bit on that 504 program it is for owner-occupied homes we have loans and we have grants the loan program is a 1 fixed interest rate we can amortize it for up to 20 years so a very low payment can be made the maximum outstanding we can do at any one time is twenty thousand dollars so we can put a lot of repairs into into a home like you see there the grant program you have to be 62 and older and then there's some income and debt formulas that you have to meet as well the lifetime grant assistance is hundred dollars and as an example on the income limits just like the other programs has income limits whole household um as an example one through four uh people in the household they could make up to around forty thousand dollars and five through eight people can go up into the fifty to sixty thousand dollar range of inc income in a year's time but you know under the repair program the the loan program we can do about any kind of repairs that a homeowner wants to that home under the grant program it is for health and safety only but we can do furnaces we can do roofs we can do windows we can do bathroom conversions and like the example of the house we can even do some exterior work to to bring those homes up to standard so just a really neat tool that's out there for homeowners and for rural communities i know we all would like our communities to look look the best that they can so here's the most important thing probably here is my uh email address if you have questions want additional information also our website is up there uh make sure you get the slash ne on the end so you get to the nebraska page and you know i'm always available if you have questions or want and more information about the programs we also like to you know when we get a little bit back to normal we like to come out to those communities and do presentations and share this information with the with the people in the rural communities um we're always um open to do like a zoom meeting this is kind of the way of the world right now so um always welcome to uh contact me we'll get some information out do a presentation for communities or for groups uh but again it's just kind of a little secret tool that's out there for our rural communities that we really want to get the word out on and have everybody know is available there's been a lot of funding the past few years and we want to get those funds out to rural nebraska if we don't use them in rural nebraska they're going to go take those funds and give them to bigger states they're going to go to texas and california and we want to keep as much of those federal dollars here in nebraska because that's that that's our home and we love it so with that that kind of ends my presentation so i will turn it on back and uh let the next person go thank you krista i appreciate sharing your perspective there next let's go to tim and shannon if you could give an update on what programs that you've been working on and have especially found successful across nebraska with affordable housing and development shannon go ahead there we go the nebraska investment thank you congressman the nafa the nebraska investment finance authority is delighted also to be with you again on this conference nafa just as a little background it's a state instrumentality or not a state agency or an instrumentality that helps nebraskans access federally enhanced programs and resources so our principal goal is to bring federal resources to the people of the state of nebraska we have a great board appointed by the governor we have three real strong ag interests or three real strong ag proponents on our board of course uh steve wellman who's the nebraska chair of the head of the nebraska department of agriculture is one of our board members as well as galen friendsman jalen frinsen and warren argenbright both in the third district who are members of the ag community quite prominent and active members in the ad community so with their guidance and with the uh the work of our great staff we buyer is here we've been really involved in ag programs and housing programs we have a great array of housing programs as christa articulated with respect to multi-family housing single-family housing we work actively in disaster recovery programs and workforce housing we also have a strong community development arm inside of our outreach department that provides technical assistance to communities like geneva eric who would be interested in you know finding resources to improve their community and improve the quality of life in their community in addition to technical assistance we make planning grants we create resources for housing partnerships for active employees in those communities and we're very proactive in tax increment financing to help people monetize those resources that come from local sources we also do a lot of work in the medical community and in the industrial community with respect to solid waste disposal hospitals and medical and non-profit and all of those are done in conjunction with taxes and bonds and taxes and financing that we make available to communities and we provide technical assistance for people to use that but i think the program that we really want to talk about today is our nebraska beginning farmer and rancher program we have a great relationship and we've talked about it for years in your communities and also in our relationships probably now in 16 or 17 years with 4-h and ffa but the beginning farmer and rancher program is a program that we've done for i believe since the late 80s and to present on that i would like to introduce our new executive director shannon harner who's going to give you a rundown on the beginning farmer and rancher program shannon great thank you tim i'm really happy to be with you this morning i know it's an hour earlier where most of you are than it is where we are so we appreciate you getting on to the session congressman thank you for asking naifa to present today the beginning farm and rancher program which we refer to as the aggie bond program helps beginners obtain low interest ad loans for the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to the beginner's lender and that means that the interest income from the federal and nebraska state tax is tax-free allowing the lender to offer a lower interest rate to the beginning farmer than otherwise they would be able to um have the beginner's net current worth can't exceed 500 000 and they can't have owned a substantial amount of farm land previously and substantial is defined differently depending on where you live um on it's not more than 30 percent of the medium farm size in the county that you're seeking to own property in a typical scenario for a beginning farmer would be that they're trying to purchase land that might have some farm buildings on it and some farm equipment and possibly there might be a house also on that land so knife would be able to help them with items that are considered agricultural in nature but not actually the house itself so up to 552 500 for land and the permanently fixed structures barn silos sheds that kind of thing but not the house and then another up to 62 500 for used equipment and machinery um breeding livestock would fall under that same category as as equipment the beginner would then need to begin operating and they need to operate as a sole proprietor not in a corporate entity not in an llc just actually as a sole proprietor um and they can hire custom help that's fine they just can't be part of an ownership structure uh in the business another um point to note is the beginner has to find their own lender so you go to whoever you you typically would use uh as your as your bank a private seller lender even uh or a private investor lender so it could be any of those types of ways to get into it generally it's a bank but knife also has the ability to wrap the tax exemption around a land contract between the beginning farmer and the seller as long as the parties aren't linearly related so it can't be a father passing to a son and um getting the funds in the middle that way um option one would be for the beginner's lender to provide all of the funds themselves using our program and option two would be for the beginner to use some joint financing from both their lender and then the usda farm service agency there's a 50 50 program where the farm service agency provides half of the funds and the beginner's lender provides the other half of the funds and the tax exempt the tax exempt portion is provided by nifa and that would be wrapped around the non-federal portion of the fund so just the knife side if there is a house on the property uh then none of the the knife funds the tax exempt loan can go toward the house but um the fsa funds can go toward the house so you can structure it that way if you do have a house that you want to purchase with it so it can can work that way the fsa funds can be applied as a down payment money that covers the value of the house so all of the loan terms would be negotiated between the beginner and the lender so nifa doesn't get in the middle of that we just once you've made the um the agreement with your lender about what your interest rate is going to be then we jump in we um fund it with the bond and provide that that tax-exempt benefit the beginner can have a guarantor on the loan and if conditions change in the future so that the prevailing rates dip below the beginner's current rate the loan can be formally modified through nifa to obtain that better rate um program activity so in the third district we have served with this program 71 counties so 748 loans for over 95.1 million since the inception of the program so it is something that um that is is active we encourage people to utilize the program um the average interest rate in the last five full calendar years was 4.17 that seems really high today but if you look at it over the last five calendar years that's a pretty pretty good rate today obviously it would be lower than that uh we would like to um thank the congressman for helping get through uh the house the moving forward act which actually increases the amount um i noted that it was sixty two thousand five hundred dollars for used equipment and machinery that uh under the uh the bill that has been passed in the house would actually equal the amount for land so 550 2 500 we still have to do some more getting that passed in the senate however but we do um appreciate the efforts of our congressional delegation and um particularly representative smith so thank you for that um if there i do know that there's a question in the chat that actually goes um back to krista um so maybe i'll throw it briefly back over to krista to answer that question about the funding opportunities you talked about whether they're available within communities in the village or city limits or outside of village and city limits yeah that's a great question as long as the community is 20 000 or less in population we can absolutely make them inside and that's the majority of what we do is make the loans within those small communities we can do some rural properties i know it's called rural development but in our programs rural means our rural community so yeah we absolutely can make them in any rural community that that qualifies another thing that i will note is norfolk and columbus kind of went out of that 20 000 with the last census but they are still grandfathered into our programs so those actually qualify as well but yup absolutely rural communities as long as they qualify we're there we can make those loans and while we're there too we do have one other question i wanted to show and um the question is what is your opinion on a ffh i believe that stands for affirmatively furthering fair housing i think that's for everyone on the panel here i did anyone want to take that question i would just mention that we are obligated under all of our programs to be proactive with respect to the fair housing rules as they are promulgated by congress you know congress advances in congress and the administration advance and pull rules back on us all the time so whatever the current rule is that's the rule we will enforce and uh we're very proactive in that matter yeah and that's i'll echo tim's um sentiments there you know fair housing we're a federal program so we're of course going to abide by any of those rules as well we have no you know it's open to everybody regardless of who you are or uh you know those those programs are available for rural nebraska communities citizens so yeah same thing here yeah i think the uh obviously the the uh concept of fair housing we we certainly uh we certainly promote that eric i put our knife a graphic up on the screen is it coming through on your side uh it is actually not yet if you i think you'll have to hit the share screen option there there it's coming up now there you go perfect so the the federal program matrix seems to be a little confusing when you hear it verbally but we actually have put together for your file eric and for distribution to the community two slides that go through all the information that shannon shared with you with respect to the beginning farmer and rancher program this first page just tells you the advantages of the program and then the second page talks about some of the benefits and some of the eligibility issues again these change just a little bit each year as congress uh tweaks on this program but it's it's been a very effective program over the years for uh for beginning farmers and ranchers to acquire resources uh to to start their to start their operations and so we're dudley buyer's information there is at the bottom and if anybody wants this more sooner than the package comes out please contact uh either dudley at nyfa or do info nyfa.org or there's a reference there learn more learn more at knife.org farmer all this information is on there and krista like you mentioned we have a we have a great array of housing programs too that we deploy in urban areas your loans are actually the best for unincorporated areas our loans work very good inside of incorporated areas but between our two organizations we have just a whole bunch of loan products for people that want to become home buyers in nebraska and then we also have as you do resources for communities who want to do multi-family housing because that's an important part of our community as well so eric that's um about all the information i think we have on the knife aside other than to say thank you for the invitation we do have one other question that's popped up into the queue the question is does anyone in this group know any examples of rural housing areas using an opportunity zone to raise capital to increase housing stock i'm familiar with some opportunity zone efforts in omaha and you know we worked diligently to try and create the governor's office work diligently in the department of economic development work guilty diligently to create opportunity zone uh opportunity zones all across the state an equal number in each congressional district so i i would say that the best source for the location of those districts uh is at the ded website i will tell you that the the benefits of the opportunity zone are just now beginning to be recognized there were a lot of time constraints with respect to them and i i think we're seeing more people becoming interested in them but the ones i'm familiar with so far just in the omaha area i think we might have a couple of pending in lincoln but the ones i think that are furthest along are in the omaha area yeah just to tag on to that um so la la i think it was last week could have been the week before um the department of economic development did actually have an opportunity zone um session a seminar that was virtual i'm not sure if that was recorded or not but we can we can find out and send that information out um the the final rules just really came out on opportunity zone so i do anticipate while neither tim nor i are aware right now of an example in nebraska i think there are some that will be there will be coming um because it is it's a good tool it's just a tool that we haven't until now really had the rules around it fully fleshed out so more more coming on that so andy i see that's your question and um if you can throw your email up there i'll try to get to you the information from the opportunity zone great thank you all right any other questions i guess i will ask one um i noticed that the legislature passed a a bill i think they're calling it the micro tiff and i'm just wondering of course this is pretty fresh so uh you may not have been able to sort through all the details yet and i certainly understand that but basically it would empower individual landowners to access the tax increment financing strategy and i'm just wondering if you see opportunities for what and you know with your work to to include things like that congressman we're actually actively engaged in micro tif conversations in two nebraska communities and knife is pretty excited about it for two reasons uh reason number one is it looks like it empowers us to get that resource to is more directly to the home buyer or the homeowner or the actual actual owner of the property without a lot of of discount on the resource and so that's pretty exciting to get that resource to the home buyer on a house by house basis as opposed to a developer into the kind of a macro basis so we think we get more money there to them quickly until we're working on that secondly it enables us to record that that property at fair value on the tax rolls as opposed to a reduced value which gives us the proper appraisal value many times in the non-metro areas we have problems getting appraisals because tif finance properties are transferred at a lower value and the real value is not in there so it's hard to get the proper appraisal on it so we think that that helps too i think thirdly there's one other thing that we're talking about and that is the capacity to use that resource to create a longer term of affordability over time many times the tif financing benefit is lost after the first owner our houses that we build can last for 100 years we'd really like to have that value of affordability continue over time to create an affordable resource and so this microtif capacity gives us the ability to do that as well for communities that want to preserve affordability in their communities over time so we're really excited about it and look forward to working with communities uh tim there's another question that andy long had up there about the planning grants to move housing forward not sure if that is the housing [Music] studies or specifically andy what do you mean by planning grants so we have um uh this let's see there we are the planning grants okay so i'm reading the second part of andy's question uh so nifa has a regular system of planning grants that will fund half of the planning dollars for communities uh with respect to the portion of their housing program approaching their planning program that relates to housing many times communities are doing a comprehensive zoning restructure we don't finance the whole comprehensive zone infrastructure but we do finance up to half that's related to housing issues and housing needs and then for communities that complete that we have a second stage and we will fund up to one half of the compensation of a housing uh uh housing uh staff member in the community we'll fund fifty percent of that salary for three years in order to empower that community to get somebody who works full-time on housing in their community and we've probably done several hundred planning grants across the state of nebraska and i think at any point in time we have about a dozen communities in our housing partnership i think the one that you probably hear most about is schuyler where we've been very proactive in helping them do not only affordable housing using the housing tax credit but also workforce housing of which we got congressman a renewal of the workforce housing program for rural areas and i understand the governor signed will be 866 which works this morning with respect to urban areas so we now have a pretty strong resource in both rural and urban areas for workforce housing as well and uh knife as resources can be used to deploy that uh deploy that money into actual programs okay very good very good eric are there any more questions no further questions are in the queue everything's been answered surprising it looks like we're right on time well i uh again i want to thank all of our panelists and certainly everyone who participated really appreciate this opportunity to have a conversation if any of you have further questions please feel free to reach out to my office i know that there are a lot of moving parts to these issues and if we can be of assistance please please let us know we're living in some challenging times right now and even amidst the challenges there are several bright spots and and uh you know we can't uh just gloss over our challenges either so that's why your perspective and insight is important and certainly to all of our participants i i really appreciate what the fact you would take the time here and just as was suggested with a chat here i want to add my thanks to tim kenny for your many years of service it goes without saying that we appreciate your work not only personally speaking uh can i say that i appreciate your work but uh the way you have done your work i think is especially um admirable and we're grateful for your service and i would imagine that you'll still be around and we're glad for that too so thank you as you hand off the baton i i want to start on the baton there you go today the remote control or whatever yeah well thank you congressman it's been a great joy working with you and your team and and i can't tell you you know just uh what a wonderful job this is you can't have a better job in the world than than helping nebraska nebraskans grow so it's been a thrill to work with you and your team thank you thank you and certainly the work you've done and the success is very measurable and uh that that the numbers speak for themselves in terms of what of what you've done and krista thank you for your your service at the usga rural development as well it's vital as we uh you know uh america is a big country right nebraska is a big state and as you up there's there's diverse needs a across nebraska and you know i always want to be mindful that the federal government doesn't get in the way oftentimes that the best of intentions uh congress gets involved and oftentimes the exact opposite result is achieved from what was intended just because of the unwieldy you know kind of clumsiness of uh the federal government and so uh oftentimes you know i hear from well constituents across nebraska i would say the most common request is to be left alone they can't achieve what they want to achieve and generally other questions are kind of forms of that and so we we don't want the bureaucracy to to stand in the way we know that uh we want to work together to create more opportunity and that what i know you're working on right now and that's what all of us are working on so with that i just want to again thank everyone for participating our panelists and our participants across nebraska and even beyond so uh thank you for your work i look forward to keeping in touch thank you thank you congressman thank you thank you eric thank you christian thank you

thank you Mr chairman and thank you to our Witnesses I appreciate y'all being here I want to give a special thank you to representative language Lane Jovan excuse me um for your testimony today for being here and for sharing your personal experiences with travel to help improve legislation to ensure that the experience has improved for all passengers um it's no secret that we fly a lot even before the pandemic flying in this country at a number of challenges and you often hear people that isolate certain parts of the travel experience maybe it's something bad that happened with TSA maybe it was their luggage maybe it was a bad experience parking or something along those lines I think what's most important is that we look at this entire experience cumulatively I think you have to think about the the packing that the families have to do the getting to the airport the parking at the Lots the shuttle to the airport the checking in potentially paying for baggage going through security uh paying ten dollars for water and twelve dollars for a granola bar at the airport uh if you're late maybe you get to pay a change of ticket fee you have to line up in many cases like Cattle Calls getting in sitting in in seats that in some cases cause challenges look this this whole experience has to be looked at cumulatively then you land at the other Airport and you go through it all over again we can't look at just one single piece of it we've got to look at the cumulative experience and ensure that every party whether again it's the parking lot vendors it's the shuttles it's the airport security the airports or other components of the experience are all working together in a complementary Manner and and help to decompress that experience especially for those with additional challenges the end of the day you've paid hundreds of dollars or maybe even thousands by the time you add in the tax dollars going to the airports and other entities involved um and for the privilege of of this experience that in many cases as we all know has negative consequences keep in mind that's the Baseline experience for most passengers now imagine if you're disabled disabled or differently abled passenger individuals with disabilities already face unique challenges in everyday life and it's especially true during air travel it's no wonder many disabled passengers choose not to travel by air and in turn miss out on important family functions or work opportunities we're here to discuss those overwhelming challenges everything from the check-in kiosk and baggage claim at the destination just last month was the 36th anniversary of the passage of the air carrier access act an important piece of legislation that prohibits the Discrimination of persons with disabilities during air travel well great advancement has been made in addressing barriers to access for those in the disability community as we're going to learn today many barriers still exist in August of this year there were 195 disability related complaints reported during air travel 195. furthermore there were over a thousand reports of mishandled wheelchairs or scooters as air travel continues to grow and be a necessary mode of transportation it's important that we address these issues the 2018 FAA reauthorization act included a bipartisan subtitle addressing issues related to Aviation consumers with disabilities as the chairman noted we we covered a number of improvements including the GAO report that was issued last year recommending some additional actions um this included establishment air carrier access act advisory committee tasked with investigating different aspects of of travel experience and providing recommendations to address air travel needs it required a review of practices for ticketing pre-flight assignments and stowing of assisted devices to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive necessary accommodations furthermore called for a disabled passenger Bill of Rights among other Provisions it's important to understand what has been accomplished and what work remains to be done as we look forward to the future and decide how we can improve collaboration from the aviation industry and relevant stakeholders as I noted at the beginning it's absolutely key to this comprehensive experience that air Travelers uh go through whenever they're they're getting on planes or going to the airports or leaving airports and I think it's key to our shared goal of addressing issues that passengers with disabilities face we should continue to work together on Provisions in the 2018 FAA reauthorization and ensure that passengers with disabilities have a dignified experience again thank you Mr chairman for holding this hearing yield back

turning to today's hearing i appreciate uh mr malley your appearance today i appreciate your service to our country and i appreciate the administration's efforts in attempting to negotiate a longer and stronger jcpoa but the facts are the facts as we meet here on may 25th 2022 iran is closer than ever to developing a nuclear weapon it is on the brink of enriching enough 60 uranium for a nuclear weapon the iran of may 2022 is a much more dangerous threat and a far less interested party in negotiating than the iran of 2015. a deal under which iran has far less than a six-month breakout time with sanctions relief in return that will unlock millions of dollars and no sunset extensions is definitely not longer and stronger it is shorter and weaker now clearly this reality is in part due to president trump's decision to walk away from the jcpoa without a plan a strategy or any allies alongside the u.s having left the agreement iran decided it no longer needed to abide by it and rushed forward with accelerating its enrichment capabilities to the doorstep of nuclear grade uranium iran made this decision even though our european allies had stayed in the deal as the administration worked with our allies to negotiate a return to 2015 nuclear deal iran worked to stockpile nuclear material as the administration negotiated iranian drones loaded with ball bearings and shrapnel hit american facilities as the administration negotiated iran has developed what former centcom commander general frank mckenzie says is quote overmatch in its ballistic missile program so it can launch more missiles than the united states and our partners can shoot down missiles that iran points at u.s troops in the region missiles that iran points at our ally the state of israel which iranian leaders have said should be quote wiped off the face of the earth meanwhile iran unlawfully detains american citizens and citizens of our european allies on trumped up charges for political chits unless we forget iran abuses oppresses and violates the human rights of its own citizens in short iran has dragged out this process driving up its demands and exerting its leverage convincing the world that the united states wants the jcpoa more than the iranian regime does after months of negotiation this is the iran we must contend with not the iran you hoped would be driven by practical considerations at the bargaining table today's iran is buoyed by china who it is reported just in april imported 650 000 barrels a day of oil from iran oil which should be subject to u.s sanctions even at discounted prices this has resulted in a flood of cash for the regime tens of millions of dollars per day today iran is protected by russia iran thinks it has options if iran wants to extract a better deal or concede less than u.s national security demands it can turn to its autocratic allies now the administration said months ago that without a return to the original 2015 agreement by the end of last february the non-proliferation benefits of the deal would be greatly diminished to quote secretary blinken on january 21st of 2022 which is four months ago he said quote the talks with iran about a mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa have reached a decisive moment if a deal is not reached in the next few weeks iran's ongoing nuclear advances will make it impossible to return to the jcpoa close quote it's late may it's three months later than that determination so how is it that iran is still advancing its nuclear program by leaps and bounds the knowledge iran is gaining from these advancements can never be a race and we continue to wait and hope but hope is not a national security strategy now i believe in a diplomatic path but we must ask using every tool we have how do we serve the u.s strategic interests here if iran were to break out tomorrow what is the united states prepared to do if iran begins to enrich uranium to 90 percent what is the united states prepared to do using every bit of leverage and deterrence how do we stop iran from mastering the weaponization for a nuclear device i want to hear the administration's plans to better enforce the sanctions regime we have put in place that now looks like a sieve i want to hear your plans for working in lockstep with our european and other allies around the globe to sharpen iran's choices i'd like to hear the administration's plans in detail for what the administration is prepared to do to stop the growing oil trade between iran and china and iran's oil trade with venezuela and syria i want to hear your plans for how to end iran's hostage taking of our citizens and i want to hear your plans for how the administration is going to bring home americans wrongfully detained in iraq in iran siamak bakker namazi ahmad shagri murad tabaz with or without the jcpoa and of course we could never forget about about bob levinson and his family so i want to hear your plans to bolster the security of our partners in the region so they can defend themselves with or without a return to the jcpoa the united states must demonstrate we have the will as well as the military capabilities if absolutely necessary to defend our people in our interests we must back up president biden's statement that iran will quote never get a nuclear weapon on my watch close close i think we must prepare for the increasingly obvious reality we face in 2022 a return to the 2015 nuclear deal is not around the corner and i believe it is not in the u.s strategic interests we need to tackle what comes next and we need to hear your plan i hope your testimony today can begin to lay the groundwork of such a strategy but if that plan includes the possibility of a deal with iran i want to make clear that it must be subject to congressional review under the iran nuclear agreement review act of 2015. congress has and will continue to play an important role with respect to iran policy and i would expect the administration to follow the law with that let me turn to the ranking member his comment well thank you very much mr chairman

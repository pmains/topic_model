my daughter katie was born with a serious eye condition then denied coverage for surgery i fought the insurance company in one but no one should have to go through that that's why i'll always protect those with pre-existing conditions but my opponent backs a radical plan that would force texans off their private health insurance and into a one-size-fits-all government plan we need more options not less and government-run healthcare isn't the answer i'm beth van dyne and i approve this message

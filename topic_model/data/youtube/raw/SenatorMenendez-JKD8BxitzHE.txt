uh we are here today because of a promise that I and Senator Booker made to judge Salas in the days after she was targeted in a hateful attack which took the life of her son Daniel we promised that we would do all we could to protect judges like her from future attacks and so for over two years we have worked to pass legislation through Congress that protects federal judges and their families today we're proud to say that we delivered on that promise and secured the passage of the Daniel anderol judicial security and privacy act our journey began exactly 883 days ago on July 19 2020 when hate and violence found its way to the home of Judge Esther Salas and her husband Mark n and agreed to perform a litigant using information found online track judge salice down at her home he walked up to her front door with a firearm and opened fire injuring Mark and murdering their beloved Son Daniel In Cold Blood it is every herod's or sniper it is a loss far beyond our capacity to put into words but incredibly Against All Odds judge Salas and her husband found purpose following the worst day of their life in the midst of immeasurable pain they resolve never to let another judge another family like theirs experienced what they had gone through which is why judge Salas and Mark met with their three Federal Representatives Senator Booker myself and congresswoman Cheryl who could not be with us but I want to say that she was an important part of our ability to succeed at this working it in the House of Representatives and I want to acknowledge that they explained what they wanted to see done to honor Daniel and his life they wanted this bill to become his legacy and as a result of the these conversations we made a personal vow to them we swore we would never stop until we passed a law that protected federal judges and their loved ones from future threats and in that moment the Daniel Admiral judicial security and privacy act was born over the past two years we have worked with our colleagues with other federal judges civil liberties and privacy experts to draft a bill that would protect judges from threats to their physical or physical security as well as to their privacy that could ultimately create a risk to their physical security with bipartisan support we included the bill in must pass legislation and finally it has been sent on to the president's desk where we expect him soon to sign it into law as members of Congress this is our fundamental responsibility to keep our constituents safe but no action we took to pass this bill can compare to the Courage the patience and the commitment the judge Solace and her husband have demonstrated they are the real heroes of today judge Solace who continued to manage an incredibly busy court docket pounded the pavement in the house and the Senate to tell Daniel's story she walked with Steely resolve and incomparable strength as the bill faced procedural hurdles and despite the obstacles she and Mark did not let any lawmaker pass by them without asking them to support this bill to protect judges judge Salas and Mr Andrew all the very definition in that respect of Public Service turning their pain into years-long effort to protect the federal Judiciary and fortify our democracy I cannot understate How brave their commitment to this bill has been we cannot forget that judge Salas was not just targeted for being a judge she was targeted for being a woman on the bench and specifically one of only two Latina judges on The District Court of New Jersey judge Salas and her family were victims of a horrific hate crime yet through her Advocacy she appealed to the broadest possible coalition to get this done that is what our democracy is all about and so to stand here to be able to look at them in the eye and say that we got it done we kept our promise I'll tell you in all my 30 years of Congress there are a few moments as profound as this make no mistake today is a good day it is a day to celebrate the fact that thanks to this legislation judges of all backgrounds will be able to administer Equal justice under the law without fear of retaliation Daniel's law will protect judges by prohibiting the selling trading transferring or purchasing of Judges personally identifiable information online we do this by allowing judges to request their information be taken down if it is publicly available we increase their protection by authorizing the U.S Marshals service to hire additional analysts security Specialists and other Personnel to help prevent threats to federal judges these are just some of the nitty-gritty details of the bill but ask any judge and they'll tell you why they're necessary threats to the Judiciary have been on the rise in the last few years federal judges dedicated public servants who are enshrined in article 3 of The Constitution have increasingly had to look over their shoulder wondering if they can deliver judgments without fear the ability for judges to be free to deliver life-changing judgments is a critical pillar of our democracy it is absolutely necessary to maintain the rule of law so yes our bill the Daniel Anvil judicial security and privacy act is about protecting judges it's about dedicating more resources and attention to their well-being it's about making sure that public servants can do their job safely and securely on behalf of the communities they serve but it's hard this bill is a tribute to Daniel Andrew to his parents who have done the greatest service for their country out of a love for their son nothing in my view can be more important than that so let me conclude by saying as we celebrate that the Democratic process has delivered Justice after two and a half years as we celebrate the life of Daniel and the bill which Bears his name let us never falter in our effort to create a better country and better Community let us never stop pushing and prodding until we reach days like today when we can fulfill the promises we've made and ensure that no judge in America has to experience what judge Solace and our husband Mark have gone through I'm honored to have played a part in honoring their son's Legacy and with that let me turn over uh the uh the program to my colleague who was essential in helping us achieve this moment he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee where this legislation had to go through and at some times there was a lot of job bonding to do with some of our colleagues to understand what this bill did and did not do and we couldn't have achieved it about Senator Cory

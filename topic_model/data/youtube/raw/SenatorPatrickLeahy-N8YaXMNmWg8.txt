order it in the chamber thank you I'm president I I met dick years and years ago I was a lot actually long before he held his most recent post of special envoy for Afghanistan Pakistan we had so many conversations of a meeting so many trips over the years as his career progressed and particularly during the war in the former former Yugoslavia his skillful diplomacy ended the siege of Sarajevo and finally the end of the war it's helped what he did is legendary nobody else could have done what he did he was motivated above all by compassion intent on stopping the suffering of innocent people were being terrorized for no other reason than in their ethnicity he combined the force of his convictions with the force of his personality and that was an enormous force along with his boundless energy to do what others have been unable to do pastor Hobart did not accept no for an answer I remember meeting dick we had planned a meeting i was in macedonia he was in Kosovo is a very foggy rainy day we could not go by helicopters with plans we met on a slippery narrow slippery road several hundred foot drop off on one side we stood there with nervous security guards around we sat in the hood of a card he described what he'd absorb observed and he told me what he believed need to be done it was fascinating because he put everything into perspective and it was fair to say we took advantage unlikely meeting to reminisce and laugh about other times in other places some of which were just as unlikely as when one of those rare conversations an unlikely place it makes an unforgettable impression you most of all because it was Dick Holbrook he was so passionate or animated yum of the determination and sense of humor that made the challenge of solving the thorniest problems hard to resist his latest position I heard most often from him when he'd call me to keep me apprised of his efforts to try to get the most out of our aid to Afghanistan and Pakistan has not an easy task but you called me often on weekends my home in Vermont and we would talk about it he loved the reshaping of US policy in Afghanistan Pakistan during a difficult transition period he charged headfirst in the maelstrom of Afghanistan Pakistan seven years after conflict began raising key and sometimes unpopular questions about our efforts their press would talk about his combative style or another heated exchange with some foreign leader but in his final hours his wife katie martin received calls the sympathy from Afghan President Karzai and Pakistani president side sidari which is a lot about dick so my thoughts and prayers over the county and ticks sons and stepchildren and with dicks loyal staff at the department of state during the sad time I another's here have lost a dear friend the American people have lost one the greatest diplomats of our time an extraordinary man to love this country devote his life to it as much as any person could a Madam President yield the floor

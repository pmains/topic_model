hello everyone I hope you're doing well as you know Washington DC is very divided Congress seems to be constantly fighting in the House and Senate which once held to strict rules of decorum and respect have more and more erupted into verbal fights which more looks like the British Parliament than the Congress of the United States however this isn't the first time we've experienced such division or infighting in our nation in fact divisions were so prevalent we nearly lost our nation shortly after the end of the war for independence that Division and our eventual unification came about in Philadelphia Pennsylvania during the Constitutional Convention this week on September 17th we will celebrate the 235th anniversary of the adoption of our constitution so this week I want to share with you the story of that division that nearly cost us our nation and more importantly how we finally came together to adopt the Constitution it had been 11 years after the second continental congress had declared our independence from England the delegates from 12 of the 13 states have once again assembled in Philadelphia to consider a new form of government for our Young Nation the Constitutional Convention as it would become to known have been in session for nearly five long and mostly unproductive weeks and from all appearances this would possibly be the final week so far little progress have been made because the delegates were deadlocked on many issues with the most prominent being how each state should be represented in a new national government the fighting became increasingly bitter with every session as northern states argued that representation should be based solely on population while the southern agricultural States argued that representation should be based on the amount of cultivated land the representation issue also sparked arguments between small and large states small states demanded there be a fixed number of representatives from each state regardless of size or population now all sides were firm on their convictions and none were willing to compromise at the beginning of the convention George Washington had been unanimously elected to serve as the president of the convention in hopes that the respect all delegates had for this hero of the Revolution would create a sense of unity it was the dignity and statesmanlike demeanor of the former General that was responsible for holding the convention together thus far but even Washington wondered how much more quarreling they could withstand before more delegates headed back to their home States Washington through a letter writing campaign had been one of the primary reasons this convention had taken place in the Years following the revolution disputes between the states had reached a critical level and Washington proposed convening a Congress to resolve their differences in May of 1786 Washington expressed his feelings in a letter to John Jay he said there are errors in our national government which call for correction something must be done or the fabric will fall Washington had fought hard for this convention and as much as he wanted it to succeed he maintained his dignity remained reserved in his position as convention president Washington refused to join the heated debates and when he desired to make his opinions known he would do so privately outside the convention Chambers on June the 28th the convention took a catastrophic turn once again the debates regarding representation ignited a fiery diatribe which resulted in one of the small states threatening to leave the Confederation and Allied itself with a foreign power a delegate from one of the larger States immediately responded with the threat of using military force to keep the dissenting States in line it was now inevitable everything our soldiers had fought and died for was crumbling down around them Washington had commanded many of these Brave Patriots through eight brutal years of war countless numbers of America's countrymen had given their lives for this new nation and now the very convention That was supposed to design a new stronger nation was in reality destroying it to many of those in attendance it seemed only a miracle could save the union now and unknowingly a miracle was about to begin George Washington was a man who was no stranger to Miracles during his Service as the commander-in-chief of the army he had witnessed numerous accounts of unexplainable Providence in his favor Washington believed as he documented in many letters and journals that God had his hands on our cause and these incidents were acts of God's divine intervention now George Washington was in need of a new Miracle one that would change their current course of the convention without such a change it seemed impossible that they would progress any further and that all they had fought for during the war with Great Britain may have actually been in vain another highly respected Statesman the president of Pennsylvania was also looking for a miracle that day the 81 year old Benjamin Franklin who like Washington had also withheld comment throughout the entire convention since that the hostility had brought them to a Breaking Point he knew something must be done to save the convention and he decided it was time to intervene gaining the attention of George Washington he slowly stood to speak as he rose the room fell deathly quiet as the prominence of the elderly Statesman captured the attention of everyone his features were old but his voice was strong and commanding and his words reverberated throughout the chamber carefully leaning on his Cane Benjamin Franklin addressed the members of the convention Mr President Franklin began as he directed his opening statement to George Washington the small progress we have made after four or five weeks of close attendance and continual reasoning with each other and our different sentiments on almost every question is I believe proof of the imperfection of human understanding we indeed seem to feel our own want of political wisdom since we have been running about in search of it in this situation of this assembly groping as it were in the dark to find political truth and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us how has it happened sir that we have not once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to illuminate our understanding in the beginning of the contest with Great Britain when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayers in this room for divine protection our prayers sir were heard and they were graciously answered all of us who were engaged in that struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence in our favor to that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of Consulting and peace on the means of establishing our future National Felicity and have we now forgotten that powerful friend or do we imagine we no longer need his assistance I have lived a long time sir and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth that God governs in the Affairs of men and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid we have been assured sir in the sacred writings that accept the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it I firmly believe this and I also believe that without his concurring Aid we shall succeed in the this political building no better than the Builders of Babel we shall be divided by our partial and local interests our projects will be confounded and we ourselves shall become a reproach in a byword down to Future ages and what is worse mankind May Hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance war and Conquest I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy of the city be requested to officiate in that service Franklin completed his remarks and he returned to his seat for some time the room remained quiet as everyone was moved with emotion Franklin had openly rebuked the entire convention for their failure to corporately ask God for his guidance virtually every one of the delegates were active members of churches and though some had sought private devotions none had proposed praying together as a convention Jonathan Dayton a delegate from New Jersey in reporting the reaction to the Dell of goods to Franklin's remarks stated the doctor sat down and never did I behold the countenance at once so dignified and delighted as was that of Washington at the close of the address nor were members of the convention generally less affected the words of the venerable Franklin fell upon our ears with a weight and Authority Mr Roger Sherman a delegate from Connecticut moved by Franklin's admonition promptly seconded his motion a discussion ensued and some of the delegates wanted to debate the matter those delegates were not opposed to Franklin's suggestion but as Alexander Hamilton expressed this was something they should have done at the beginning of the convention and still waiting until now he argued that if they suddenly brought a member of the clergy into their daily deliberations the public might get the idea that dissensions within the convention had called for such measures Franklin Sherman and others argued that past emissions of such a duty could not justify further omission Mr Hugh Williamson of North Carolina brought to everyone's attention that the true reason that the clergy had not been included is that the convention had no funds to pay a chaplain Mr Edmund Randolph for Virginia offered a proposal he suggested that a sermon be preached at the request of the delegates on July the 4th the anniversary of Independence and that prayers be offered at the beginning of each day of the convention Benjamin Franklin seconded that motion a few days later on July the 4th 1787 in response to Franklin's appeal and Randolph's proposal the majority of the members of the Constitutional Convention led by George Washington assembled at the Reformed calvinistic Church in Philadelphia Reverend William Rogers preached a sermon about trusting the wisdom of God to establish a free and vigorous government Roger's sermon filled the attendees With A New Hope as he delivered these words we fervently recommend to the fatherly notice our federal convention favor them from day to day with thy inspiring presence be their wisdom and their strength enable them to devise such measures as may prove happy instruments and healing all divisions and prove the good of the great whole that the United States of America may form one example of a free and virtuous government may we continue under the influence of Republican virtue to partake of all the blessings of cultivated and Christian Society when the convention reconvened in the following weeks there was a new attitude among the delegates Franklin's call for prayer had broken the deadlock that threatened to end the convention and a new era of cooperation had replaced the spirit of dissension Jonathan Dayton recorded this in his journal that every unfriendly feeling had been expelled and a spirit of conciliation had cultivated the Constitutional Convention went back to work but this time the debates were civil and their differences were easily worked out through negotiations on September the 17th 1787 the final vote was called in the Constitution of the United States of America was formally adopted this document beginning with the words we the people not only shaped a new nation But ultimately changed the course of history for the entire world because of one man's call to prayer and the Miracle of cooperation that resulted the Constitution was not the only product that resulted from Franklin's call to prayer when the first constitutional Congress of the United States convened on April the 9th 1789 one of the first actions of Congress was to formally enact Benjamin Franklin's recommendation made at the Constitutional Convention Congress formally appointed two chaplains one to the house and one to the Senate and each was paid a salary from the national treasury this tradition continues still today as every session of Congress is opened in prayer

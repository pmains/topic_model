hi congressman tracy mann here we just wrapped up our saline county town hall uh we do not have votes in washington dc this week or next and so we've been traveling all over the district we're doing about 40 town halls go to man.house.gov for the full list we'll be out tomorrow we'll be off on good friday and then we'll be back at it next week we've done about 20 so far we were in southwest kansas and in the central part of the district earlier today things that keep coming up people are concerned with the debt and deficit the reckless spending we're seeing people are concerned with the open southern border a lot of concern about inflation and supply chains so come out i look forward to hearing people and some good news yesterday was announced the administration is approving year-round e-15 ethanol for this year so that means this summer we'll be able to purchase e15 ethanol it's been a long time in coven coming we've been up calling on this for a long time and i'm for an all the above approach but there's no reason that we are not especially in these times of super high gas prices um doing e15 and we should be doing this year-round moving forward so thanks a lot as that can be helpful please let me know

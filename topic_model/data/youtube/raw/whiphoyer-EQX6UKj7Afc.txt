thank you so much joining me now to discuss this and much more the number two Democrat in the house congressman Steny Hoyer congressman it's great to have you Thank You Kate good to be with you let's talk about Puerto Rico this aid package that the White House is sending over do you foresee any issues getting this aid package passed I hope not they've sent down 29 billion of which about half is debt forgiveness which will give the female some additional Headroom but the fact of the matter is we're going to need much more than that over the long term but this tranche is a significant figure and I expect more to come hopefully they will not be burdened down with politically controversial items that the majority may want to put in these bills I hope that's the case this is a humanitarian crisis kate of literacy in terms of the figures you gave within two weeks of Haiti's earthquake we had 22,000 military personnel on the ground we need more people on the ground we need more resources allocated and frankly the military is the one institution in our country and indeed in the world who can respond to a deal with the crisis that you have just displayed on your screen and we need to be in the rural areas so many are going to San Juan San Juan is got resources and is getting up to speed but it is the rural areas most of the Puerto Rico lives that are in such crisis without sufficient water without sufficient food without sufficient sanitation exactly that point and and what's being done what's going there you're just at FEMA headquarters I assumed getting an update on things are you satisfied with what you saw heard there no but I'm gonna follow up with them I'm gonna be talking to Governor russello which I talked to some days ago I talked to secretary mattis just two days ago about the necessity to give all resources necessary to get electricity up get water availability make sure they have access for people what are you hearing my own view is the president needs to authorize both FEMA but also the Armed Forces which do have the resources do have the money to respond to the crisis now and certainly we're going to pay forward that twenty nine billion is and we've done billions before that is a start but when Governor Rose say oh when he was president was down there was very complimentary of everything that the president and the White House and administration has done you say you don't believe it Kate I think that governor Rusli yo knows he's dealing with the president Trump and and the Republican administration he wants to make sure that he's on good terms with them but very frankly I'm going to urge the governor to tell us exactly what he needs exactly what the condition is on the ground and frankly be animated about getting that to them we have the ability to do that we need to have the will and then we need to get it done congressman do you think he's not telling the truth no I don't I don't wouldn't ascribe that to Governor Rocio at all I think he may be tempering what he's saying to the president yeah you'd have to ask him on that but I'm gonna be talking to him hopefully later today and I'm going to urge him to as accurately and fully explain what is needed what is being done but more importantly what is not being done to save lives to intervene in areas that otherwise are inaccessible and he has to energize both the puerto rican infrastructure and and resources in terms of human capital on Puerto Rico but it is the Armed Forces of the United States in my opinion that has the capacity to put in the kind of resources necessary to save lives and to stabilize communities look forward to seeing where those conversations go congressman thank you so much we'll have you on keep us updated thank you Thank You Kate appreciate it now after talking about one disaster there there's all

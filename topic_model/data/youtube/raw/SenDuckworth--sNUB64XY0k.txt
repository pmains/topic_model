appreciate it sir Duckworth Thank You mr. chairman a gentleman welcome and this is so good a special welcome to you or your daughter is one of my wonderful staff members and I exploit her labor every on a daily basis so she's quite wonderful Plataea on staff Thank You senator we're very proud and thank thank you to employing her gainfully across Illinois and our country we are already experiencing the harmful effects of climate change growing seasons are changing heat waves of increasing extreme floods are becoming more frequent and severe this is odd that we're talking about today simply put climate change is no longer a threat it's here the climate has changed I believe that we must seek solutions to cutting carbon pollution that strengthen our economy and advance new industries and create quality American jobs the bipartisan use-it act combined with action Congress took last year that extended and reformed the 45 Q tax credit will help to make sure we accomplish these goals senator Whitehouse mentioned this I look forward to working with my colleagues on this committee to advance and further improving this promising legislation mr. Walser Illinois has some of the best saline storage locations in the country last Congress Chairman Barroso and Senator Whitehouse worked with me on the adding language to the u s-- attacked that requires the Department of Energy to author report to make recommendations to project develop to project developers on how best to use Sayle informations for carbon sequestration can you share why this report will be important to the future of permanent carbon sequestration absolutely senator Duckworth for three reasons first given the scale that of what we need to do in terms of eliminating carbon emissions on the planet saline is going to be our biggest target there's really no substitute we need to move forward on answer oil recovery and utilization but if we're really going to make the cuts we need to make that's where we're going to that's where we're going to store the carbon second there are innovations that are occurring for example why being able to produce water particularly in arid areas so it's not just it's not just a storage space it's potentially a place where we can also develop useful products and third its it's the area that it's the resource that's most abundant that's why a DM is doing that project in Illinois and Saline because it's it's there is some you are potential but it's completely dwarfed by the availability of Saline resources we have more saline resources and in North America then we have you are any other targets so if we're not developing this resource and we're not being thoughtful then we're putting ourselves at a significant disadvantage thank you so you know you mentioned ADM they're one of the largest what are the world's largest food processors and this is a one-of-a-kind project in Decatur Illinois it captures carbon dioxide which is created as a byproduct at a corn processing facility and stores it safely almost a mile and a half underground in the Mount Simon sandstone a lot of attention is spent discussing on how CC US can be applied to the power sector I believe use the use of act will help spur industrial capture projects like the one in my backyard but also you mentioned a DM s project can you talk a little bit about how decarbonizing projects like an ADM can teach us lessons about how we can decarbonize the industrial sector absolutely it's a very important project it's a first of a kind and industry is one of those hard-to-reach places in terms of decarbonizing CCS is almost certainly going to be necessary to decarbonize the industrial sector fortunately there are plants like the ADM plant that are ready-made in a sense they have low cost co2 supply they have pure co2 streams and there are many of these types of facilities from ethanol from hydrogen and ammonia production other sources that we can quickly move forward on and we expect for t5q to really move first in those areas so we think it's both absolutely necessary and an area that we expect to see a fair amount of activity on in terms of utilizing incentives like 45 Q in the use it act thank you mrs. sue come I know you said you're a finance guy and not a scientist but I would think that a report that would come out of something like the use it act and that would make recommendations to project developers on how best we use civil information force carbon sequestration would be something useful can you talk a little bit to that you know in Illinois for example wind power has created a hundred thousand jobs in ten years I sort of see that there's potential for on economic front for some great benefits here as well absolutely senator I think when we put iron in the ground we put it in for as I said earlier for 30 or 40 years to the extent that we can get more information and we can use it in terms of making sure that it is critical and can be used and the fact that that it gives us the information that we can go forward with that's one of the most critical things in the utility industry quite frankly so I would think it's absolutely critical that we have information like this and in the use it act so I would encourage very strongly encourage it to be a part of a part of the Act thank you mr. Oldham I just have a minute left did you want to add anything to the discussion so far you know I think one of the things you're absolutely correct that renewable energy and the driver that is a critical part of developing jobs one of the one of the key things to remember is the importance of not just reducing the emissions but also reducing the co2 already in the atmosphere senator Carver has an excellent bathtub analogy that I think he uses I've been using it for years you know continued focus on co2 removal and you're quite correct saline aquifers are a fantastic place to store co2 and Illinois a great place to do so thank you I yield back mr. chairman thank you so much senator Sullivan

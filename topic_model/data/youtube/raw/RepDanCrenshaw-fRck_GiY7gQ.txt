this is why socialism doesn't work in one minute socialism doesn't work because it removes human incentives and we actually need incentives in our lives I mean we engage in economic activity we produce things we work because there's some kind of reward at the end that's basic human nature socialism goes against that basic human nature believes we don't need incentives at all so it actually believes that a few altruistic individuals will do all the work with no rewards at the end and of course that's not true that won't actually happen so how does socialism actually achieve its end goal well it forces people to work takes their wages infringes on their freedoms makes people do what the government wants them to do for the sake of the calm yet it never actually works it always ends up in despair and that's why Ronald Reagan fought so hard against the Soviet Union to end the scourge of socialism that we should too [Music]

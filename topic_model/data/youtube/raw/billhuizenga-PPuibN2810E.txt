and it guess questions a quick question if you don't come to our house to do the integral quarter we're gonna do all right well right now we regularly is a couple of studios in the grand rapids area there's WKTV on clyde park and wyoming and bc TV over to byron center and you know we are ideally what can happen as this project expands as we find other places with studios with ability to do it then find the other thing that could happen is you can choose a venue you know you know it doesn't have to be your house it could be someplace else basically any place as long as it's reasonably quiet has halfway decent light and it will work but those are the options right have one other question how long is this apparently this is an ongoing program so if I were to buy some way find a whole lot of other vets that don't know anything about this program would that be beneficial to the program sure yeah yeah I mean nothing one of the nice things about being set up at the University and having University support for the urn type of the rest of it and have any access to student workers federal work study is finding some federal monies well spent you know but basically that's false lobby yeah there we go but basically we're going running on going and it actually was this project that first got our library refunded into the video age when I told what I wanted to do this there oh I can we are that's going to be too expensive whatever and we just started looking and showing up we could do it so we're in for the long haul I've got a colleague in my department who lives along the lakeshore he's willing to go when this people in gym interviews you can contact congressman's office and given the information on people and you can follow up and find people but yeah we're in a bit long haul another one other thing real quick is can I get some information from you about the program so that I can fry these other people I happen to brought along some handy brochures with we go over there on the day one so our websites on there as well so that's all okay and we are trying to make sure that we develop as a resource as well I always shown up without bail Sherlock kumud's right here handles veterans affairs for firm our office and we are wanting to try to develop this along the lakeshore and try to get some more studios and different places that are equipped to do it and frankly there's a number of community access stations and that kind of thing that that are sort of untapped and they're always looking for program content and those kinds of things so we're hoping to expand that so please make sure we're seeing young lady in the back yes that'd be my mom there the Huizenga family archives are somewhere getting full from my father was a World War one polar bear for those of you from from the area that's it what did I say father I my grandfather sorry yeah grandpa grandpa was a grandpa was a polar bear and then dad was in down World War two so we've got we've got some of those things I don't know it you've set for many years on the Holland trust here that's a very timely question this moon to qualify what I really try to keep the question is what you're asking look what the question is relative to a museum for military purposes correct it just so happens that my former commander Colonel gears who how I'm start home come one of the others donated for fifty thousand dollars to purchase the armory several years ago they spend 150 thousand dollars in addition to approving the building with a stipulation that April percentage of the building be preserved for a military museum so about eight to ten of us are meeting monthly that the third Monday morning Monday dunno every month as Liz on with the Missouri to the museum board of directors try to tie the two together so that we can preserve the military aspect and your time your question could have been a more timely because I brought the fact this Newman that initially the intent was to preserve the history of our unit and I said we should go way beyond that we should include Congressional Medal of Honor winner we should can we should include the Corinne wets the invests every every organization that has veterans and they can become part of the museum so that someone can have a place to go to all the artifacts so keep them that I'm glad you asked the question so you might have a few things on long-term Isaac a family so I think that then we have had a rich history of involvement from this area dating back to the Civil War times right and and you know Lincoln specifically singled out michigan troops at various time so here we go its freedom patriots of michigan 1865 to 2000 this is this is a machine draft copy air but what what Colonel talk about so any other questions yes sir will you make tup one story or is it all become individual stories as a group story question is and I'll pass it off is about is it a group story or individual stories won't let you talk a little bit about a catalog but i want to point out this gentleman we had a great opportunity along with my father and a few others to do a metal presentation ceremony and at that at that time we had somebody else here for them oh hey is it Paul what Brett that's right that's right yes and that's right okay there we go we got the ring right here I we chose Vietnam Korea in World War two right Brianna yep and and that was really something special to be able to go and do that and we want we want to hear from you as well as something that that our office also is engaged in and we we've got one coming up here I think on the when is that Thursday 20th we had a call from a family whose dad and sort of taken a turn for the worst he's 93 I think he was there is still not still here I use with a ninth Air Force out of England flew be 26 is the Marauders and we went to his room and a nursing home and we're able to do the metal presentation there and we kind of did a little impromptu cuz i was asking the fea the family going in it was all kind of coming together very quickly and i said well you know kind of that question you know where'd your dad serve well I think Europe Oh what you know what was he in I don't know i think it was i think it was a planes and you know i think it was in b-24s or something you know just do one word real fuzzy on the details i said is it okay with you if I just start asking them questions and I said yeah he doesn't talk a whole lot about I said well you know here's the thing sometimes a third party coming in can cope something out of out of someone that they're not going to give up to their family and so I made sure we had the video cameras out and we just started talking and it turns out he he came out with a number of things and at one point he said you know I bet you my kids don't even know this part that he had gone to you know at Nebraska teachers institute to become an officer and they're like your went to school in Nebraska you know the kids are shocked at that and all those types of stories and so often you know that is that's a great way I think as you're having sort of that disinterested quote-unquote disinterested very interested but neutral person coming in and being able to ask these questions and sort of cool people to use by thinking talk a little bit about the cattle one ok well the interviews themselves are very individual interviews if you want to focus on that one person follow his story if you are fortunate enough to encounter more than one who is in the same unit or we have who have stories overlap and you interview both of them you do it separately but effectively one informs the other so but basically that one's he interviews are going to be 21 of the time individual things but the way the database is set up it's impossible to go and search for all the people who are in a particular unit or theater or whatever you want to look for any other questions alright if there's no other questions who's ready to go do this all right we got a couple of hands sorry I've got a couple of takers well we really hope that you will and I got one guy who's done a lot of interviewing at me I think I might want to interview him at some point Juventus is here and we've traded I have chance to spend some time in the Philippines I know juke was in the Philippines and he was in Korea and he said ah well it's just a occupying forces and as I you know that that is as important in many ways because that that that needs to inform us about what happened just after the bullets quit flying what were you know what else was going on but we've got we've got some materials over there I feel seated feel free talk to Vail I talked to I exactly where they're here what types of materials you have out there anything what is the next step let's give them that what is the next step that people that are ready to do this what did they need to do sorry yep you just made a good point bill I've got a friend who is right now he's on the edge of dying and there is a veteran's day in the last 20 years that he hadn't apologized to me and I why are you apologizing to me well I spent all the time the world war two him in Washington DC and and I said well so you had a child and and he suggests but I wasn't a combat I feel guilty I said stop feeling guilty it wasn't working together we would never won the war so if there are any of you out here say well yeah I had a cushy job or I had this or I have that tell the story it's all part of the story all right love you loud are willing to the sign up we bow has over there on a copies of the Library of Congress or the bio chief forms as well and there you fill one of those out here including your contact information in it your phone number dress whatever you use then it's impossible for us to get in touch with you and arrange to set up the interview that's the main thing and there are also copies sure up there has all my contact information and stuff on our website so you can also get old me directly and the network too so that sort of step a and in otherwise more particular questions yeah it does all right with that thank you very much we appreciate your interest this is I think a great way that we can honor those that been involved I as hey i know i will never call you know you're here mr. sickle mayor and colonel that's off as as the colonel is pocket glanced over na i saw that on the wall they're all gay some some gave all and this is such a great way to honor those that gave all and honor those that gave some and this is our collective

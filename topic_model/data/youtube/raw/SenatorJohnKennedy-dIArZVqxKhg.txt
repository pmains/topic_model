thank you mr president a um a few weeks ago on august 27th louisiana and southeastern texas were hit by hurricane laura i say louisiana because if you look at some of the press reports they say south west louisiana but the the impact of hurricane loren louisiana was much greater the storm came the senate will be in order the storm came on shore in southwest louisiana in cameron parish it headed north then moved northeast and uh finished in the northeastern part of our state i have seen the damage from the air and on the ground uh there's i've never seen a hurricane do this kind of damage in any state much less louisiana the path of destruction is about 60 miles wide starting in southwest louisiana running north bending to the northeast and it's about 200 miles long we took it full in the face when you see devastation like this and when you go through something like this you start to to understand that we we human beings are a vain lot we think we control nature but nature controls us our our entire uh electrical system went down our water system went down our internet went down our cable tv went down it was a category four storm winds of up to 150 miles an hour this storm was unusual in that the winds were sustained and didn't not dissipate as it got further inland we took it full in the face now it doesn't do any good to complain louisianians are resilient people we uh we live by the old japanese proverb fall down seven times stand up eight and we're standing back up about sixty percent of our electrical power has been restored uh we now have water back in some cases there are still some some boil orders because the water is not clean but we are deficient in one area and that's cable tv and internet with an emphasis on internet mr president i want you to understand mr president i'm not talking here about a mere inconvenience i'm not talking about people missing their their favorite television shows i'm talking about kids education i'm talking about the ability to deliver health care and i'm talking about the ability to to conduct commerce none of those things can be done in today's world without internet the internet particularly in southwest louisiana is provided by a company called sudden link sudden link sudden link is owned it was purchased by a company called altis usa its ceo is a gentleman who i have not had the pleasure of meeting mr dexter goi and i'm here today to plead with sudden link to please get our internet restored sudden link has done such an abysmal job that suddenly needs to change its name to never link suddenly provides internet service to 150 000 louisianians i haven't studied their financials but at let's say 150 dollars a month if you include the cable television part louisianians pay sudden link soon to be named never link if they don't do a better job about 23 million dollars a month now all of our public utilities have been working very hard madam president um entergy's worked hard at t has worked hard center point energy has worked hard to get our utilities restored so we can start recovering sudden link has not worked hard at one point we had 29 000 people on the ground helping us to restore our water system helping us to restore our electric power helping us cut trees helping us to get tarps on roofs we had at most 300 representatives from sudden link 300 representatives to handle restoring internet for 150 000 louisianians suddenly should be ashamed of itself we have restored about 60 percent of our electrical power madam preston we've restored about 16 percent of our internet uh and once again i'm i'm not talking about about someone missing their their favorite television program as you know madam president because you have the same situation in alaska we uh all of our public schools are not open all of our private schools aren't open because of the virus many of our kids are having to learn remotely and they can't do it without the internet they can't uh you're also aware madam president of of how internet is integral to the ability to deliver health care i don't know a single business today that can operate without the internet and many of our businesses including our small businesses because they can't have uh customers coming into their shops doing are doing a lot of their commerce uh over uh over the uh the internet there's just one problem in louisiana because of of suddenly jurassic dragging its feet we don't have internet and we can't recover without it now this is what i i don't mean to be overly critical madam president but but this is this has just gotten out of hand every one of our public utilities has done uh yale yeoman's work it's an extraordinary job except one except one and if mr dexter go is listening tonight and i again i i don't mean to be openly critical i plan to visit with him in the next couple of days i think he's finally agreed to come visit louisiana we have three requests madam president we first of all we need workers on the ground you can't restore the internet service without people working to restore the internet service and let me say it again entergy just to pick one of our utility companies has over 10 000 workers restoring the power sudden link which provides internet for 150 000 of our people has a grand total of 300 people can't be done we're currently not a priority even though 150 000 of my people write a monthly check to suddenlink number one sudden link respectfully put some people on the ground and get our internets restored number two we need a local office from sudden link they don't even have one maybe it's because they don't have internet but people there that many people lost their homes at a minimum they lost their roofs they don't have cable boxes they have to have some body they can go to and say here's my old box give me a new box but suddenly doesn't even have a local office and number three i'm going to ask mr go i to please commit to our state leadership to start giving us a daily update on restoring this service how many homes and businesses have been added each day again i know i'm repeating myself madam president i don't mean to be overly critical and we've been very patient in louisiana but the time has come to to to call it like it is and say it like it is at the rate they're going suddenly needs to change its name to never link in louisiana we cannot recover without internet we can't do it and sudden sudden link has let us down madam preston

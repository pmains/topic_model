senator thank you for joining us well Neil how you doing I'm okay Democrats blame the Republicans Republicans blaming Democrats you have urge that in the interim at least essential personnel be paid right yeah I mean it's only fair that you know Washington DC is dysfunctional enough and it is just true we have essential personnel in these government agencies we require them to work the least we can do is pay them and so I'm going to do the shutdown Fairness Act they would pay about four hundred twenty thousand federal government workers that are deemed essential they call excepted but I'll use the term essential and as long as they're working and trying to keep this nation safe they should be paid it's pretty simple concept I already have six co-sponsors hopefully with this broadcast that we'll have a flood of co-sponsors both Democrat and Republican hopefully leader McConnell bringing to the floor the president will sign it it's the least we can do has have you heard from the president senator whether he supports this I haven't supported the president but I've certainly given heads-up to the White House in terms of what I'm trying to accomplish here maybe this will break the logjam all right let me your colleague Lindsey Graham had suggested it there might be a good opportunity for three weeks to reopen the government and then by that time if nothing has really been made progress on go ahead and and declare emergency powers the president so far reluctant to do that dismiss the idea of a three-week reopening how do you feel about it well the problem is Nancy Pelosi are told the president if you open up the government I'm still not going to give you a dollar one for the border and again I'm highly concerned about using the national emergency power and authority primarily because if he uses it it'll be challenged in court and we won't get the wall built and Neal we do need better barriers walls work they free up CBP agents to be deployed at the ports of entry so we can try and capture some of the heroin come to this country we have to fix these laws this is a growing problem it's primarily a problem now of unaccompanied children from Central America and people come in this country illegally in family units because we incentivize it it's a growing problem just just quick quotation of some numbers in 2012 a little more the 11,000 people came into this country illegally and apprehended as a family unit last year 107 thousand people came as the family units for three months of this year 75,000 people so Democrats who are minimizing this problem saying it's not a pricess it's you it was humanitarian crisis during the Obama ministration 2014 when 120,000 people came in as you acs and family units last year hundred and forty five thousand people came in this is a growing Trump is right we need the better barriers and the easiest way out of this is for Democrats stop being hypocrites you've supported Barry better Barry's in the past you say you want a secure border give the president the minimal amount 5.7 billion out of a budget that's larger than four four thousand one hundred billion it's not even rounding here that is the simplest solution but doesn't sound like Nancy Pelosi is open to that but you know I noticed it's far more common ground that either side let's on senator for example the same Democrats who are opposing this wall or whatever the president wants to call it we're on board allowing President Obama to do 136 miles of just that when he was president of the same number of Republicans who were saying they want a wall now were open to alternatives to a wall back in prior administration so is it your sense that what changed the dynamics here was the president holding the government hostage to getting what he wanted that had he not taken that leap we wouldn't be here now no change didn't Dynamis created Democrats the wrong person won in 2016 they just had never recognized president Trump's as a legitimate president they don't recognize the mandate VVC him early on on legislation that addressed this same thing so do you thing or attaching it to the government its continued function senator and retro so it's easy to play Monday Morning Quarterback trust me with that that might have been the signature wrong turn in this well first of all President Trump is has been very upfront saying he would never support another omnibus that didn't include barrier funding and and Congress presented him with spending bills that didn't include us so I understand his frustration but here's my frustration of Democrats who say they want a smart border all the technology does it allows you to track apprehend process and then disperse and that's we're doing we have catch release we're just dispersing people in the interior if we don't detain people and they don't have an asylum claim judicata valid we order them removed only 7% of those individuals actually get removed well we can't detain them anymore because of different laws and legal precedence so we actually have to fix those laws change those legal precedents if we actually want to solve this problem Democrats have singularly been unwilling to solve this problem do you get a sense senator that this drags on quite a while no so far the polls show that a lot of Americans both are blaming it on Republicans although to your point of that number has gone down a little bit it's still tipping in favor of Republicans are getting the finger not not not so much Democrats think again could and likely will change the longer this drags on but I've heard some raised the possibility it drags on for weeks months what do you think well both sides seem pretty dug in which is one of the reasons I want to pay these individuals that'll take some of the pressure off Republicans plus see the other thing I've talked to the chairman of the subcommittee is on the appropriation bills that are outstanding asking them to take a look and I'd love to hear what a bare-bones budget would look like you know some kind of partial measure here that'll keep pressure on the Democrats because again what's really hot about this debate is I've never heard a Democrat not want to spend money in the federal government they just won't spend 5.7 billion dollars because of this is president Trump's priority but if we open up if we pay these people if we fund these central parts of government they'll take the monkey off Republicans back and put a little pressure on Democrats maybe they'll come to the negotiating table in good faith you have any Democrats interested in this senator beyond the Republicans image well again we we just we just completed the legislation of the language over the weekend we're introducing it we just introduced it today hopefully when they hear about a very common-sense approach a fair approach to paying these individuals we should have every Democrat voting for this this should be this should pass as easily as a measure that we passed last week that said when this government shutdown ends we'll pay everybody why don't we pay them while they're working senator Johnson thank you very much good catching up with you have a good day well

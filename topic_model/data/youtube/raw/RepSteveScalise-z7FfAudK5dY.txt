all right the gentleman on the right-hand side of the screen is the house minority whip and that is steve scalise steve good morning to you welcome back to the show great to see you um i i gotta tell you i was little surprised at mr trump's reluctance to come out straight forward and say yeah i am the leader of the republican party what do you make of that reluctance to say that well stuart uh good morning good to be with you and president trump doesn't need to say that because if you look you know when he gave his speech over the weekend in north carolina when he went to cpac he still garners the most attention of anybody more than even president biden when he speaks and that's because you know he's still somebody who who's got a large following maybe the you know i'd call him the leader of our party right now because he's uh clearly his former president uh still very popular and his policies by the way worked tremendously well to get our economy back on track to secure our border to stand up for our allies around the world and stand up to our enemies we're not seeing any of that right now from president biden i believe you're going to bedminster later this week that's where the president from president trump lives during the summer i believe i believe you're going what's the purpose of that meeting is it to put forward trump's policies in the future and uh make sure that the republican party follows trump's policies is that it well jim banks the chairman of the republican study committee put this together i'm actually on the road fundraising because we're working to get the house back in 2022 so i've been on the road a lot these last few weeks and will continue to be on the road raising money and we're getting tremendous support all around the country because people are are just really disturbed by what joe biden has already done but jim jim banks has done a really good job as the chairman of rsc and wants to put an agenda together like we all do to focus on the conservative principles that work it's not just about opposing what president biden's done because we're very opposed to these radical policies the socialist left movement we're seeing paying people not to work this massive inflation letting our border get completely wide open but in addition to that we want to lay out what those conservative principles are and i know jim's been one of those who are working on it and that's one of the things i'll be talking about with president trump and president trump is very interested in helping us get the house back whether he runs himself or not uh is is a different story but uh you know he really does care about this country still is very concerned about the direction that president biden's taking us in here's what i hear from many many people they like trump's policies they were successful not so keen on trump the persona and how he came across what say you well if you look at what's happening right now uh you know i think for those people that would say that they are very concerned about the economy when if they wanted to add on to their house or buy a new house right now they're going to be paying 35 000 more for that house than they would have a year ago we're not seeing the kind of growth in our economy we should have look at israel under attack and you've got president biden who spent more time trying to help iran get get that nuclear weapon if you look at what president biden has done on russia he just gave a tax break to russia to build their pipeline the nordstrom pipeline between russia and germany and he said no to american jobs with the keystone pipeline and and really insulted our friends canada so i think you're seeing policies that are devastating uh they they like the policies of president trump and they're probably longing for those policies to come back okay congresswoman thank you very much for joining us this morning and we hope you are well and fully recovered i believe you are and god bless you steve's police you're all right thanks stewart

well the question is will the government shut down or not let's welcome in now Georgia Congressman Barry loudermil Congressman great to have you with us John it's good to be with you all right this sounds like quite a mess the Democrats have themselves in it looks like a handout for Joe or for uh Joe manchin a special pipeline going through a state in exchange for finally signing off on all this funding do you think we're actually going to have a government shutdown it seems like there are a lot of Democrats not handy about this special carve out for mansion well they're not they're in disarray and let me tell you on the political front that would be the worst thing that could happen to them for even a 24-hour shutdown it would just again improve to the American people that Democrats cannot run this country and uh so I would anticipate they're going to cut some kind of deal because they're already looking at a Red Wave coming in in November they do not want to do anything to make that worse and so I would anticipate they're going to come up with something if they were smart they would just do a clean CR which is just continuing the funding as it is of course I'm not going to support that I've never supported A continuing resolution because the law says we're supposed to have all the funding done by the end of this month but yet you've known that for the entire year but we wait until the last minute to try to do something then just kick the can down the road to December to where they can arm twist everyone to out of the under the threat of being there in Chris during Christmas so you know it's government not playing by the same rules that we expect everyone else to play by yeah they've been kicking the can down the road for years I mean we none of us none of us will be surprised if at the last minute there's some sort of deal worked out uh and a can get kicked down the road again we know it's not that's probably what's going to happen but they do seem like they're playing with fire right now well they are because a continuing resolution really harms our military more than anything because it just continues the existing funding levels but the military works on the Appropriations process of new projects coming in we have to start working on development of new weapon systems and the procurement of new weapon system which is an authorization process and when you just do a continuing resolution you're just continuing the same level of spending but you're not authorizing any new weapon systems to come in uh you're not authorizing new programs and so it really hurts our military going forward yeah and we have issues with recruitment as well Congressman something we talk about a lot here so we do want to also get uh you to kind of comment on another issue that is affecting a lot of families and parents are concerned about this you have co-sponsored this very important legislation called protect children's innocence act Margie Taylor greensbill would prohibit these gender affirming Care on minors and you know we've heard this week from hospitals talking about what a money maker it is and that these are getting done on kids that are younger and younger tell us about this legislation and what you're seeking to do and who you can protect with it well it's it's there to protect minors who have really not developed to a point that they can make a good logical decision about their long-term care or what's going to affect them for life and and unfortunately we have a lot of undue pressure by some parents who you know wanted a boy and had a girl or vice versa and so they put pressure on them and then you also have peer pressure from schools and friends and if there's a reason that we don't give driver's license to someone until you're 16 years old and and there's other age limitations because we know that it takes a level of maturity to make a decision especially something like this that is life-changing it you're talking about altering your gender that God has given each person and that is a lifelong impact and you don't need something like peer pressure or even pressure from parents forcing someone to make a decision like this and so this simply says you can't perform this love this type of surgery on someone who is a minor I mean that's just common sense to me but then again we live in a world with this woke class of people who who have just you know they've killed Common Sense altogether yet I believe there's also stipulation where if it is done to someone who's a minor they can then later at the age of 18 go back and sue obviously tough for those kids who have been basically mutilated but again it's a an important piece of legislation and we're glad that you were here to kind of Flesh it out for us and it's just such an issue that we didn't think we'd have to be discussing it but this is where we are under this Administration apparently Congressman Barry Loudermilk great to have you in with us today thank you Bianca it's pleasure to be with you

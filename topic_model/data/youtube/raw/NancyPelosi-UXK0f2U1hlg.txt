four minutes thank you madam Speaker madam Speaker there are some days in this Congress I feel like I'm in Alice in Wonderland where logic is turned on its head and all of us have fallen down the rabbit hall today is certainly one of those days here we stand on the 280 second day of this Congress and the House Majority has not yet passed a jobs plan instead we have spent all day long once again attacking women's health with a bill that will never become law a similar bill already passed the house and died in the Senate and the president has issued a veto threat on this bill even if it did somehow become law now madam Speaker with only 20 legislative days left this year the leadership of this body has somehow decided that we should spend the day advancing legislation which would severely compromised women's health madam Speaker despite the claims for mud across the aisle this bill does not simply say that there won't be any public funds for abortion it goes far far beyond in fact the Hyde Amendment which is the law of the land says that there will be no federal funds for abortions except in rare cases of rape incest or the life of the woman period let me say that again there is no federal funding of abortion anywhere in federal law let me say that again the federal law not the federal employees health care plan not Medicaid not the military not the Affordable Health Care Act I will not yield nowhere in the law is there federal funding for abortion period in the Affordable Health Care Act in Section 13 03 it specifically says there will be no federal funding for abortion now this bill contrary to the claims of its proponents goes far beyond current law and here's how it says women who purchase health care insurance in the exchanges cannot use their own money to buy private insurance plans that have a full range of reproductive coverage under current law women can use their own money to buy insurance that covers that full range of reproductive healthcare and madam Speaker that is not changed by the Affordable Health Care Act but under this law what would happen would be women purchasing private insurance plans in the exchanges with their own private money would not be able to purchase a plan that had a full range of reproductive care that would take away the rights of women to exercise their own cotton all rights to have a full range of health care in addition madam speaker this bill also includes such broad refusal language it could override core patient protections contained in the emergency medical treatment and active labor act allowing hospitals to refuse life-saving treatment two women on religious or moral grounds thus causing their death inside the hospital despite their treatable condition now listen when I listen to this debate it's really clear to me that the proponents of this bill they're not their main concern is not federal funding of abortion their main concern is they want abortion to be illegal and so here's my view having debated this now for 15 years in this body here's my view if the majority wants to pass a bill banning abortion pass a bill banning abortion and we'll fight it out in the courts don't make claims that there's some how federal funding for abortion when in fact there is none to confuse the issues and to try to confuse the American public because I'm going to tell you something the public will not be confused they know what this bill does they know they want jobs and they know that's our agenda vote no on this ill-conceived piece of legislation the gentleman from Pennsylvania madam Speaker I yield a balance of

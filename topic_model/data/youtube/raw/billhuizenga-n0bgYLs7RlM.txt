well recognizes the gentleman from Michigan mr. huizinga chairman of our monetary policy and trade subcommittee for two minutes I chair Yellen up over here sorry it feels like you're kind of down closer to the botanic garden then you are here in rayburn new configuration but welcome good to see you again and thank you for honoring my request to meet together last month today's hearing provides us with another opportunity to examine how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy and why the development of these policies are in desperate need of transparency I believe needless to say the feds recent high degree of discretion and its lack of transparency and how it conducts monetary policy suggests that reforms are needed I've continued to encourage the Federal Reserve as you well know from that conversation to adopt a rules-based approached monetary policy and policy and communicate that rule to the public Fed must be accountable to the people's representatives as well as more importantly to the hard-working taxpayers themselves last Congress Professor Alan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University testified that over the first hundred years of the Federal Reserve's history monetary policies operated more effectively if it follows simple and clearly understood rules and I quote from him there are only two periods in Federal Reserve history where they came close to operating under a rule that happened to be the best two periods in fed history in 1923 to 1928 and in 1985 2nite 2003 in the first case they operated under some form of the gold standard in the second under the Taylor rule more or less not slavishly but more or less and those were the two and the only two periods in federal history that have low inflation relatively stable growth small recessions and quick recoveries that's Alan Meltzer well chair Yellen I ask that you work with me and this committee to develop a foundation for a rules-based monetary policy that will properly not slavishly to borrow a phrase constrain the feds discretion without sacrificing the proper independence the Fed has while also allowing the Fed to be more transparent in formulating and communicating monetary policy to not only market participants but also to the American people so Thank You mr. chairman and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back

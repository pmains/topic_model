thank you all so much for taking time out of your schedule and most importantly i love seeing your beautiful maskless faces here at a restaurant that can't be named better with these american flags before us i am absolutely honored by your presence and i tell you what if this is where we're starting i already know where we're going to end as you know we came up a little short last time and we were very disappointed we had so much support from you all that were here and the fact that you're back again is so reinvigorating for me to continue this journey not alone not just with my girls and my family but with you because now i consider you family as well and thank you [Applause] [Music] moving forward if you haven't been noticing what we've seen over the course of the past 100 days we are in trouble if you're not paying attention and while it may have ended that way we have got to let the cake bake because people like me people like my brother brave americans like you in times of duress always step up into the breach to make sure that we have an america for the future for our children and for our children's children that's why you're here actually that's why you're here you want to make sure that you do your part to save our democracy and every generation we have to fight for it because each generation has an opportunity to lose our freedoms we cannot give our freedoms away so easily for people have died for the right for us to have them they've died for the right for us to be here and it's little stuff like i don't know individual liberty our constitution writes little stuff like being called an american regardless of your race religion color or creed and being proud to be an american i find it very interesting i feel like i'm right at home here my wife and family we eat here pretty frequently as i look around i'm here to tell y'all thank i don't see very many black people here thank you all for being here dave michael michael put your hand down you're not black do you know what i do see a bunch of [Applause] americans and in my last run and seeing your faces amongst us today this is the america that i believe in we actually don't care what people look like we actually don't want to divide each other along racial lines we actually just want to be happy and be free and support each other and love our god and so if we want to serve regardless of the way we look and by the way you are here supporting a black guy you know what i do know you don't care we are seeing a constant attempt to divide our country along racial lines we're seeing it with defunding the police we're seeing with critical race theory we're seeing it now with attacking the military now the military is racist that it's truly a meritocracy that i was a part of and my family served in really this is not the america that we died and fought for we are looking at olympic athletes who aren't proud to be american and you're representing us this is your country there are people there are far worse countries by the way out there trust me all of them and their athletes will stand and pride to represent the best aspects of their country we are not perfect we are all flawed by the human condition but guess what we've done a lot of good things we're all standing here together in unity let's celebrate that let's bring that america back i drive around a lot i have a pretty big ford f250 with an apache sticker on the back you can't miss me okay it's pretty funny and i'll drive around 10 and i'll see people honking their horn and waving at me and just two days ago it was an older gentleman he had a vietnam veteran sticker on the back of his truck and we were in rush hour traffic you could tell he was fighting his way to get there i'm surprised he didn't kill somebody he pulls up next to me and frantically asked me to roll my window down and i did and he goes almost in tears to go son please tell me you're running again he said because we need you i cannot think of anything else i would rather be doing other than being a husband and a father to my baby to my baby girls and have the opportunity to represent you all in the halls of congress and beyond if anyone if anyone thinks that this has worked for me or if anybody thinks they need to thank me for doing that hell no thank you thank you for believing in me and seeing something in me that you want me to represent you i'm honored by that i truly am i'm constantly motivated by my classmates who are no longer here my west point class lost 14 brave men brave americans and they aren't here to serve for themselves so if you're a red-blooded living american in this restaurant right now you are fighting and you are voting and you are getting out there you are supporting somebody that carries them with me every day by the fact that you are here right now means that you are honoring them and this is what the fight is all about it's about the sacrifices made by those before us and by the way they were all white men and they didn't die for black people and they didn't die for white people they didn't die for asian people they they died for americans don't ever forget that i will leave you with a quote [Applause] [Laughter] after the election obviously i was i was a bit dejected and i was reminded of what my favorite quote [Music] i can't say that okay i was reminded i was reminded by one of my favorite quotes and my wife was very supportive in this endeavor actually she's the reason why i'm here the next day she looked at me and she said you might be upset but guess what you're doing this again the quote is about woodrow wilson it is it is not the critic that counts know how the man points out how the strong man stumbles nor how the doer of deeds could have done them better but the credit belongs to the man who was actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who actually strives to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst even if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls that neither knew victory or defeat he was clearly a republican and he was clearly right we may fall short we don't always win but you always fight that is the american way that's who people died for and that's why you're here i am truly honored by your presence thank you so much wesley for texas.com is my website if you want to contribute if you want to donate if you want to sign up to to volunteer and let me tell you something we're going to win this time thank you so much

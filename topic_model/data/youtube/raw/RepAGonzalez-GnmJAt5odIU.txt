hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update back home this week out of DC which is always great so first things first I was excited to announce the other day that we won our grant from US Department of Transportation 18 million dollars for US route 30 so route 30 has been a big priority for a long time it was congressman Regulus original idea back in the day and Richard regula his son Commissioner regula has been pushing it for a long time and we and we were thrilled to take a lead alongside of other congressional offices and our senators to help get this done and so we received that news the other day that's 18 million dollars back into the community to improve a very challenging section of route 30 so really excited about that and that brings our total for the office to over 24 million dollars in federal grant money the way I think about this for what it's worth is this money is out there and it's going somewhere like the money has already been appropriated the money will go into somebody's community I want it to be our community and so so we have folks in the office who work all day trying to do just that let's bring as many dollars that have already been appropriated back to Northeast Ohio the 16th district as possible and so really excited about that beyond that was that Walsh University met with some of their students second or third time I've been there this year great Sue's had a great discussion about how to build a more inclusive society and and how to get more out of a college education and all kinds of great issues that we tackled so that was a it was a really positive dialogue also finally we went to the Sam Center veterans resource fair so these are similar to the veterans Resource Tours that we do we bring as many veterans groups together as possible sort of a one-stop shop for our veterans we had one in Massillon this was run by the Sam Center I had one in Massillon just the other day and couldn't couldn't have gone better met with a lot of great veterans connected with a lot of the people who are serving our veterans community and we should be very proud of all that work and finally what I mentioned has something that happened in Ripon at the National Cemetery so word went out that an unclaimed veteran was going to be buried in the National Cemetery and when word got out our community activated in an unbelievable way so there were literally cars backed out onto the street to the point that many people including myself weren't able to actually get there for the actual ceremony because there was so much traffic there were so many people who wanted to make sure that our unclaimed veteran did not get buried alone and so the entire community rallied around that veteran and I think that's a testament to our community and just how much we value our veterans which is something that we should obviously all be very proud of so with that thank you for for allow me to be a representative hope everybody has a great weekend thank you

thanks to all of you for being here distinguished clergy elected officials immediate past mayor for me I have thank you all so much for being here this legislation that we call in short closing the Charleston loophole was first proposed not long after that catastrophic event back in June 17 to 15 it's kind of interesting when we have these kinds of incidents people tend to get a little bit riled up and they'll go off to do something then as a days weeks months years past things kind of wing people settle back in this instance we cannot afford that because we have constantly reminding being reminded daily of some of the incident we seem to be developing a culture that allows us to accept these kinds of incidents and we are growing numb it seems to me to these kinds of incidents but just this week we reminded once again of how important this kind of legislation is because that gentleman in Illinois was not eligible to have a fire off and something got missed in his background check they found it but too late to save those lives and that's what happened in this instance I don't own a gun I don't begrudge and about it else who may um but it seems to me that it is important for us to do what we can to prevent people who should not purchase are gone from purchasing it may be mental illness and may be the propensity to do harm whatever it may be we ought to have sufficient time to try to check out the purchaser that's all we're trying to do with this legislation we're not trying to keep in the battery what's on the gun come on the gun we just want to have time built into the system so that we can check and unfortunately as it's the case so often this legislation is being grossly misrepresented by how friends in the gun owners community I read just yesterday and again this morning something put out by gun owners associations saying they got it from the National Rifle Association that we are eliminating the the waiting period nothing could be further from the truth I wish you read the legislation we are extending the rhythm period from three days to ten and if after ten days we still have not resolved the background check one who wants to purchase can ask for an enhance review and them it's been in the next ten years that the hasp review must take place and the way is all set up the outside period would be 28 days so we are saying that we will eliminate it we just send that we want to extend it to provide sufficient time remember Dylan roof attempted purchase gun on a Saturday and the back was requested the father and Monday and something showed up and they needed to check it out again a further check but by the time the further check the three-day period had it's by from the 13th to the 16th he then went back purchased the gun and by the time the gun was gone so that's all we're doing here and imma Frank all of the Friends of the deceased are the fact all of the people of this community it convinced that I love so dearly a community that I've always considered to be as closely knit as in the community that I've ever been a part of I want to thank them for being here and I want affect my friends and here's my friend you know we we used that term kind of loosely up in we often refer to each other's my good friend than most times they don't mean it I didn't mean that I called him my friends I want to thank you for being there thank you for watching this bill this is Bill is bipartisan Peter King of New York co-sponsor this bill and even when we went to look at whether or not we should modified he said to me if he wanted to remain a bipartisan bill please keep it the way it is so there's nothing about this despotic you can't be more Republican the Peter King I can't you can't be more Democrat as Jim Clavin and the two of us have agreed on this 10 Jeff Cunningham for signing known as he co-sponsored the bill and

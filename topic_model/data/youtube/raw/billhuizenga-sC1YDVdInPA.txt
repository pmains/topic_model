hi everybody this is bill Huizenga where they've just called boats here at the Capitol I'm going to be going in and voting against the president's Iran deal the president's put forward the false notion that this is either this deal or war or somehow that this is going to make America safer I reject both of those notions I think that this is going to put millions of innocent lives in the Middle East and in countries like like Saudi Arabia and Jordan and Israel at risk not including those of us in America and around the globe who are going to be in a more dangerous spot sad irony is is that today September 11 as we remember that attack in New York here we are dealing with a terrorist state again now a potentially nuclear Iran in the near future very disappointed with my colleagues in the Senate both Republicans and Democrats who seem to have caved in to the President and if viewed this as an inevitability I believe that as we see these secret deals become public that we're going to be even more disappointed and this is this is a huge mistake for us to be going down this path unfortunately this is not leadership this is capitulation

you madam Speaker I'm pleased to yield a minute a half to the gentleman from Mississippi a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and current member of the Mississippi National Guard mr. pallazzo the gentleman is recognized Thank You mr. chairman madam Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to this resolution let's be clear with the American people Democrats wrote this bill before being briefed by senior intelligence officials on the strike that eliminated soleimani a well known terrorist at the end of the day we all know that this man was responsible for the death of thousands of individuals including over 600 American servicemembers President Trump was absolutely right to respond and acted within his constitutional authority to protect American citizen he owes no one an apology feelings can be held but dead Americans cannot be resurrected my question for those on the other side of the aisle who are hell-bent on undermining this president over political differences is how many more Americans did you want to die before President Trump acted let's let Frank President Obama authorized over 540 drone strikes killing over 3,700 people and more than 320 civilians not a single one was authorized by Congress as a veteran a member of our United States military I am ashamed at the behavior I am witnessing now our military deserves better and so did the American people during a time where our country should unite behind our commander in chief this resolution turns us against ourselves I support our men and women in uniform and hope my colleagues on the Left will come to their senses to do the same I yield back

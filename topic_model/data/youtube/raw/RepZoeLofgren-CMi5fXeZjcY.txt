I've been struggling from California mr. Lofgren I oppose this amendment and it I don't believe it is simply a technical amendment this amendment would protect Internet service providers who are too cheap to block only a portion of a site and instead who would choose to block a whole site using DNS blocking even when a court order only specifies a portion as infringing to endorse this activity on the part of DNS blocking of entire sites even where there is a more specific order that relates only to the infringing sites would have could have the impact of adversely impacting legitimate speech it sometimes and we've seen this in the past then this deeds are just on one sub domain or even one page and if you block the entire site you will be have the effect quite likely of blocking non-infringing speech this in debt amendment i think is is a further endorsement of the dns blocking scheme which has been criticized as harming cyber security we had a substantial discussion of that yesterday and likely will have additional discussions as well the existing 104a and the managers amendment states that intermediaries are not required to punish a whole site if a quarter a court order only specifies that a portion is infringing and this further amendment to eliminate the only punish the bad person a concept is really not a the right way to go in fact I had I had been looking and may yet provide a proposal that whereas it is permissive not to block an entire site we would be required not to block an entire site this goes in the completely wrong direction the safe harbor states that the DNS walking fully discharges the obligation when you prevent access to subscribers to the limited site and to do as mr. Goodlatte suggests would trump the section it would bless over blocking by ISPs I I don't know whether a court would block it as violative of the First Amendment i have not had the opportunity and hope maybe i will today to review the advice that mr. Sensenbrenner reference yesterday from professor tribe i'd love to do that but i think this is it's it's certainly wrong perhaps unconstitutional and we should vigorously oppose it and with that I would yield to mr. Paulus thank you mrs. Larkin thank you I just I just want to be clear and i'll be taking out my own time on this as well but I don't and I'll engage mr. good lot for this if the gentleman from Virginia has a moment I mean this appears to be I think this was presented as a technical amendment the gentleman degree that this is an amendment that does change the implications of the bill and should be debated on its merits rather than it's a technical quilt well the gentleman and the gentleman may not like the underlying principle in the bill but it's a technical amendment in that it conforms the managers amendment to other language elsewhere in the bill and for that reason you're welcome to debate that principle elsewhere in the bill or offer an amendment but the underlying principle which you've already done but the fact that matter is this makes the amendment conform to other language already in the bill and as a gentleman noted nothing can be done here without a court order so if a court is going to require somebody to over blocked and all of these issues will come up in that in that but reclaiming my time I think the gentleman is incorrect the amendment by having section 102 c2a override section 104 a you would require ISPs receive a court order for foreign infringing site to prevent access by its described as the site the safe harbor is actually being changed this is not just a technical amendment this is something that provides a substantive change that is violative probably of the First Amendment and I'm sure that the gentleman offers it in good faith as a technical amendment it's not merely a technical amendment and I it should be opposed and in fact we should be going in the exact other direction if members are sincere that they are concerned about infringement then and and we want to narrowly tailor our actions towards infringing material the last thing you want to do is the over block so that you're you're shutting down entire sites instead of just infringing material the ones that never would do and it should be opposed

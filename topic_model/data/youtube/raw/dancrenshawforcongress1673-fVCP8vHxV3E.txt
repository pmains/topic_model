- Hey ya'll, I'm here with
my friend Michael Berry. We were just talking about the election and how important it is for
you to get out and vote. Early voting ends on Friday,
the election is November 6th. If you believe in those
principles of individual freedom and limited government,
please get out and vote. - I'm excited! I wanna send Dan Crenshaw to Congress, and I know a lot of you do as well. He's a conservative, he's a veteran, he's a husband, he's a friend, and he's gonna make a
heckuva good congressman, and I'm excited about that, but we need you to get out and vote. You can do it till this
Friday, early voting, and then next Tuesday's Election Day, and then let's celebrate. Let's send Dan Crenshaw to Congress. - Thanks, ya'll!

>> ALI VITALI, THANK YOU. JOINING US NOW, DEMRATIC  SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ OF NEW  JERSEY. HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE  FOIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND  I GUESS I'LL PUT THE QUESTION TO YOU, SIR. DO YOU PLAN TO HOLD UP  RECONCILIATION FOR THE CHANGES  THAT YOU NEED? WHWHAT ARE THEY AND ARE THEY WOH IT AT THIS POINT? >> WELL GOOD MORNING. LOOK, THERE IS SAY LOT OF GOOD  ELEMENTS IN THIS LEGISLATION. CERTAINLY THE PRICE NEGOTIATION  FOR MEDICARE IS GOING TO HELP 62 MILLION SENIORS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, 1.2 MLION IN NEW  JERSEY. IT INCLUDES PROVISIONS ON OUT OF POCKET CAP THAT I AUTHORED AND A SMOOTHING PROVISIONS THAT I ALSO AUTHORED. THAT IS GOOD. THE EXTENSION OF THE ASSISTANCE  UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  THAT I HELPED AUTHOR FOR THREE  YEARS IS GOOD. THE CLIMATE PROVISIONS ARE GOOD. BUT OF COURSE, WE HAVE TO SEE A  COUPLE OF THING NUMBER ONE, WHAT IS THE  PARLIAMENTARIANS FINAL WORD,  WHATOES THISACKAGE LOOK LIKE ATHEHE END. SECONDLY, IF THERE ARE CHANGES  BY ANYONE SE, THEN OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO SEE WHAT THOSE CHANGES  ARE. AND LASTLY, WHEN WE GET TO THE  PROCESS OF THE VOTE-A-RAMA, I  CANNOT SEE IMMIGRATION  AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO  DO WITH THE LEGISLATION ADAPTED  AND IF IT WERE TO STAY IN THE  BILL, THEN THAT WOULD EFFECT MY  JUDGMENT AS WELL. SO THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT  BEFORE WE GET TO A FINAL  CONCLUSION.  >> OKAY. IT SOUS LIKE TRE IS STILL A  LOT MORE TO BE DONE AND WE'LL BE FOLLOWING THAT. I WANT TOSK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER  STORY THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT  NOW. IN A SHOW OF FORCE, CHINA IS  CONDUCTING LIVE FIRE MILITARY  DRILLS AROUND TAIWAN THIS  MORNING IN RETALIATION TO HOUSE  SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI'S VISIT TO  THESLSLAND EARLIER THIS WEEK. SO, SENATOR, THE EXERCISES WHICH ARE THE LARGEST EVER CONDUCTED BY BEIJING AROUND TAIWAN ARE  TAKING PLACE AT SIX DIFFERENT  LOCATIONS. CHINESE STATE TELEVISION REPORTS LONGANGE PRECISION STRIKES ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT IN  TAIWAN'S WATERS AND AIR SPACE. BEIJING SAID THAT THE DRILLS  WILL END AT NN LOCAL TIME ON  SUNDAY. ACCORDING TO TAIWAN'S DEFENSE  MINISTRY, AS MANY AS 11  BALLISTIC MISSILESERE FIRED IN THE WATERS AROUND THE ISLAND. TAIWANESE OFFICIALS CONDEMN THE  DRILLS AND SAID THEY VIOLATE  U.N. RULES. OFFICIALS ALSO SAID THE  EXERCISES AMOUNT TO A BLOCKADE  OF TAIW'S SEA AND AIR SPACE. WHAT IS YOURREACTION TO THIS  LATEST NEWS AND THESE MOVES BY  BEIJING? >> WELL, USING SPEAKER PELOSI'S  TRIP FOR THE SOUND AND FURY, THE TRUCKULENCE OF XI JINPING, IS  JUST AN EXCUSE. 23 FIGHTER JETS CROSSED THE  TAIWAN STRAITS DEMARKATION LINE  AND NOBODY WAS VISITING AT THAT  TIME. THIS IS WHERE CHINA HAS BEEN  HEADED FOR SETETIME. AND SO WHAT WE CANNOT AOW IS  CHINA TO DETERMINE WHO COULD  VISIT CHINA, WHEN THEY COULD BE  VISITED AND UNDER WHAT  CIRCUMSTANCES. THEN TAIWAN WILL BE TOTALLY  ISOLATED AN THE CHINESE WILL  HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR GOAL. AND SO, I THINK AT THE END OF  THE DAY, BY SUNDAY THEY WILL END THEIR EXERCISES. OF COURSE, NO ON WANTS TO SEE  THIS, ESPECIALLY SINCE I AGREE  WITH THE TAIWANESE THAT THEIR  VIOLATING IERNATION L LAW AND  THE TERRITORIAL WATERS OF TAIWAN AND THEY ARE ALSO EECTING  INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE BY THE  SHIPS THAT HAVE TO DEVIATE FROM  THAT AREA THAT WOULD BE CALLING  AT PORT IN TAIWAN. AND SO THEIR EFFECTING MORE THAN TAIWAN AT THE D OF THE DAY. AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO BE  ABLE TO STAND UP TO CHINA. IF WE HAD STOOD UP TO RUSSIA IN  2014, THEN WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE UKRAINE SITUATION WE HAVE TODAY. >> WELL SENATOR MENENDEZ, YOU  LED ME TO THE NEXT QUESTION  ABOUT THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. JUST A TWO PARTER. FIRST, YOUR REACTION TO THE ONE  SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY WHO VOTED  AGAINST THE FINLAND AND SWEDEN  JOINING NATO. AND SECONDLY, HOW MUCH MORE OF  AN APPETITE IS THERE, DO YOU  BELIEVE, IN THE CONGRESS TO KEEP SENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLION  DOLLARS OF WEAPONS TO UKRAINE? >> WELL, LOOK, EVERY SENATOR HAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE AS THEY WISH. I THINK SENATOR HAWLEY IS  TOTALLY OFF AND THAT IS EXAM  FIFIED BY THE FACT THAT THE  OVERWHELMING VOTE, HE WAS THE  ONLY UNITED STATES SENATOR, ON  EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, TO  VOTE NO. SO I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT -- A  RATHER ISOLATED VIEW OF THE  WORLD. I THINK IT WAS A GREAT VOTE. I'M GLAD TO HAVE LED THE EFFORT  AND THE COMMITTEE AND ON THE  FLOOR. GETTING A STRONG BIPARTISAN  VOTE. THE SEND TO THE MESSAGE TO THE  REST OF THE WORLD THAT  COLLECTIVEEFENSE STRENGTHENS  US, IT DOES NOT PROMOTE  CONFLICT, IT PRENTED CONFLICT  AND I THINK THAT WAS A GREAT  MESSAGE AND SWEDEN AND FINLAND  WILL B GREAT ALLS IN NATO. AND YOURSK ABOUT ASSISTANCEO UKRAINE AND THE QUESTION FOR US  AND OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD  IS DO WE WANT TO HELP THE  UKRAINIANS DEFEND THEMSELVES AND DEFEAT RUSSIA OR WILL BE FIND  OURSELVES, AS RUSSIA HAS SHOWN  ITSELF WILLING TO DO, CONTINUING THENCE TOWARDS OTHER COUNTRIES  AND WHEN THEY COME UPON A NATO  COUNTRY UNDER ARTICLE 5 OF NATO  WE'RE OBLIGATED DEFEND THEM AS  THEY INVOKED ARTICLE 5 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AFTER  SEPTEMBER 11th. WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE UKRAINIANS FIGHT FOR THEIR FREEDOM AND  SOVEREIGNTY THAN AMERICAN'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS FIGHTING IN SOME  COUNTRY BECAUSE RUSSIA INVADED A NATO ALLY.  >> SPEAKING EVER RUSSIA, WE'RE  JETTING BREAKING NEWS IN THAT  PROSECUTORS THERE HAVE ASKED THE COURT IN MOSCOW TO SENTENCE  BRITTNEY GRINER TO NINE AND A  HALF YEARS IN PRISON ON CHARGES   CANNABIS POSSESSION. THE REQUEST WAS MADE DURING  CLOSING ARGUMENT THIS IS  MORNING. GRINER'S LAWYERAID A VERDICT  IN THE CASE IS EXPECTED ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW. SO, SENATOR, THERE IS ALL OF  THIS TALK OF A PRISONER SWAP  DEAL THAT COULD BE COMING. DO YOU SEE SOMETHING POSSIBLE TO GET BRITTNEY GRINER HOME OR IS  THE WNBA PLAYER GOING TO SIT IN  MOSCOW FOR NINE YEARS.  >> THIS IS ANNIN INCREDIBLE  FARCE ON BEHALF OF THE RUSSIANS. SHE SHOULD NOT BE A PRISONER. THIS IS RUSSIANS USING AMERICANS AS HOSTAGES. SHE SHOULD NOT BE SPENDING ONE  MORE DAY IN JAIL. AND AS IT RELATES TO ANY SWAP,  WE'LL SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT  CAN HAPPEN. ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES GLOBALLY  IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO  TELL AMERICANS, CERTAIN  COUNTRIES DON'T VISIT BECSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU BECOME A HOSTAGE AND YOU UNDERMINE U.S.  NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES. WHEN WE HAVE TO RELEASE SOMEONE  LIKE IS BEING CONTEMPLATED, IT  IS A MAJOR ARMS DEALER AND HAS A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAT HIS ACTIONS CREATED. IT IS SENDING A MESSAGE THAT  GETTING HOSTAGES OMOM AMERICA  AND WE WILL GIVE YOU SETHING  THAT YOU WANT. SO, I WANT HER TO COME HOME. SHE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ARRESTED. THERE MAY BE, I HOPE THE COURT  REJECTS THE PROSECUTIONS  REQUEST. SHE'S MADE I THINK AN EXCELLENT  CASE AS TO WHY SHE SHOULDN'T  EVEN BE INCARCERATED. IF THERE IS A SWAP, WE WILL  WELCOME HER HOME. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO SEND SAY  MESSE TO OUR FELLOW CITIZENS  THAT THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN  THEORLD YOU JUST CAN'T . BECAUSE ULTIMATELY YOU MAY VY  WELL FIND YOURSELF IN ARISON  IN THAT COUNTRY.  >> I KNOW SENATOR NEGOTIATIONS  ARE ORN GOING. BUT FOR OUR AUDIENCE WATCHING  THIS MORNING, IS THERE A CHANCE, IS THERE A LIKELIHOOD THAT A  DEAL COULDE STRUCK. WE KNOW THE ASKING PRICE FOR THE RUSSIANS GETS HIGHER EVERY TIME  WE START THE CONVERSATION. BUT DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THERE  IS SOME DEAL TO BE HAD TO GET  BRITTNEYRINER HOME.  >> I CERTAINLY HOPE SO. I'M NOT PRIVY TO THOSE  NETIATIONS. AND WHAT IS BEING ASKED. I DO KNOW THAT HISTORICALLY THE  RUSSIANS RAISE THE ANTE EVERY  TIME WE HAVE IT OFFERED TO THEM  AND THEY FEEL THEY COULD GET  MORE AND THAT IS PART OF OUR  CHALLENGE.  >> CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE  FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE,  SENATOR BOB

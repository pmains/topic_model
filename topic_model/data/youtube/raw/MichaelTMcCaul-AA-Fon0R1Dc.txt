yesterday but what is the hundred people well it's not secured yet and I think there's some discussion about immigration reform but we got to get that security piece done i passed unanimously at my committee border security bill working with the Department on getting it secure but obviously you have over 100 people yeah that was a very small house 1200 feet square feet and and just that over 100 people stacked on top of each other very inhumane treatment so we need to know that talking with the ice and the Houston Police Department they're getting to the bottom of it here are the perpetrators here they're getting witnesses to cooperate but that's just another signal in it the borders are open we need to get better security to stuff that kind of Indian the victims also are the people in those houses as well they get abused in and on the trafficking side can be sold to you know the black market but it's sex trafficking it's labor trafficking so it all does go back to that border piece

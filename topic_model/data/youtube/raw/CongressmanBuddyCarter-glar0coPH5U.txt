MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO  RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO  PARTICIPATED IN OPERATION GHOST  BUSTED. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS  PLANNED FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS  TO BUST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING  NETWORK. THIS MULTIDEPARTMENT OPERATION  LED TO THE INDICTMENT OF 76  INDIVIDUALS WHO PLANNED TO MOVE  A LARGE AMOUNT OF ILLEGAL DRUGS  INTO SOUTH GEORGIA. THE CRIMINALS PLANNED TO  DISTRIBUTE METHAMPHETAMINE,  FENTANYL, HEROIN, AND OTHERS. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ALSO  SEIZED 43 FIREARMS AND OVER  53,000 DOLLARS IN CASH. AS WE ALL KNOW, THE FENTANYL  CRISIS IS DEVASTATING  COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS OUR  COUNTRY. NOW MORE THAN EVER, IT'S  IMPORTANT FOR OUR LAW  ENFORCEMENT TO GET THESE  DANGEROUS NARCOTICS OFF OF OUR  STREETS. LUCKILY, BECAUSE OF THE HARD  WORK OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT  OFFICIALS, SOUTH GEORGIANS CAN  SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT. THANK YOU, AGAIN, TO THE WORK OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL  INVOLVED. THANK YOU, M

hi kids solver of elementary I'm Greg Stanton a member of the United States Congress and I was so lucky to have your teacher mrs. tan as my guest at the State of the Union speech president drum gave a speech of the United States Congress and we all get to invite one person as our guest so I wanted to pick the best teacher in all of Arizona the Teacher of the Year to come and visit Washington hear the speech and do some sightseeing she just right before this interview she came in because her and her family were doing some sightseeing around Washington DC but I want to say thank you for accepting the invitation and taking the time to come here and to be a part of history for the speech Thank You congressman I thank you for inviting me to your beautiful second home while you're here we come back any time it's not my office I'm just rented in temporarily well your elected official you can't get too comfortable anyway you know in all honesty thank you for coming it really was an honor and thank you for your commitment to the students of Salt River Elementary and all you do to become Teacher of the Year in all of Arizona and we wanted to make sure that this experience wasn't just for myself and mrs. Stan but that the kids back home had a chance to be a part of it and ask questions about your experience so some of your outstanding students decided to ask a few questions and I wanted to ask you and that obviously they'll be able to watch the video the first question is from Alexander Mitchell delecia full wider and Angel Santana and they want to know about what was like traveling from Arizona all the way here to Washington DC when did you leave Arizona and how long did it take you to get here well kids I left Arizona on Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock and it took me six dollars an airplane to get here it was a pretty relaxing trip it was kind of bumpy on the plane a few spots but we live in DC about 11 o'clock at night when it was let's see it should have been 8 o'clock in summer it's right now the difference in time between Arizona and Washington DC is 2 hours so Washington DC is 2 hours ahead but then half the year were 3 hours ahead because while the rest of the country does some come something called daylight savings time she could teach you about that when she gets back to Arizona Arizona does not do data so we don't ever change our clocks in Arizona but the rest of the country changes their clocks but Washington DC is either 2 or 3 hours ahead of whatever time it is in Phoenix that was a great question by the way my job mm-hmm I have to make that trip every week I fly live in Phoenix I've got two kids myself and my family it lives in Phoenix obviously so I have to fly from Phoenix every week and then I fly home at the end of the idea of the week so some people drive the car to work I take an airplane to work and take it airplay back home at the at the end of the week okay here is another question from a great student chassie Lovato chasidy wants to know about the dr. Martin Luther King statue where was it located hi chasity mrs. stamped here I did get to see the dr. Martin Luther King statue yesterday and from where I am sitting in congressman's office it would be that way which i think is west it's right off the National Mall it's not right on the National Mall but it's a little south about I think would it be so yeah it would be so so hopefully you get a chance to visit Washington and you can see this incredible memorial for dr. Martin Luther King with your own two eyes so addition to seeing that memorial what other memorials you have a chance to see along the mall we saw the Lincoln Memorial we saw the Washington obviously we see that all the time and those are awesome ones we yeah we were very pressed for time we had very little time to really visit one particular place along the National Mall all of the awesome memorials are there including the President Lincoln President Washington the Jefferson Memorial is honoring President Jefferson is nearby and they also have wonderful memorials honoring the veterans of World War two and the people that died serving our country in World War two the Korean War and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial however the one that everybody's raving about and it's awesome to get a chance to see it is the African American History Museum her Oprah Winfrey is on their board and so she donated like 20 million dollars to have that museum built and so it's stunning it's the history of civil rights in America and how far we've come and how far we have yet to go and there's also an incredible Native American History Museum on the mall as well so the list just keeps coming so that's why you can't just visit Washington once you have to keep coming back absolutely absolutely you cannot get through all of this in one day in fact one of my drive my drivers last night said you needed to be here a month in order to see everything at least all right now this one is from Kyla banished Lee she wanted to know it in addition to the ones you just described what other attractions have you seen uh your office I thought I got a tour today and that was really interesting saw a lot of I guess a private view of that it was we were different from a tour group so it was nice to see it from a different set of eyes and then the reason for your visit was to attend the State of the Union the president the United State it's under our Constitution once a year comes for the Congress and gets his version of the State of the Union now everyone has their own political beliefs some people like the president other people don't like to probably won't ask you anything about that because it will keep those persons the political views to ourselves for purposes of this video however beyond what what you whether you liked or didn't like what the president said tell us about the experience of being inside the United States House of Representatives for the speech it was an absolute honor to be inside that room I do understand that everybody has their own personal political views but as a native teacher as an indigenous woman it was truly an honor to see our government in all its glory I was very honored to be in that room I recognize a lot of faces the gentleman who sat next to me was actually an ASU alumni someone was really interested to hear and I sat next to a young girl who was from another Native American tribe and to hear her young views address was really interesting so I'm lucky enough to be a new member of Congress there's over 60 members of the so-called freshman class yes but we did make history this year because for the first time in American history two Native American women yes were elected to the United States Congress and you had a chance to meet one of them last night tell us about that I met Dan Palin who is from New Mexico she was actually for the first time in US history escorted the president to his address last night her in was about ten other members of exactly so that was really exciting to hear and then the other first Native American woman in Congress is Cherise David's of Kansas and they're two of my favorite members were both amazing people and we had the most diverse class in American history the first two Muslim American women were elected in this class as well and the highest percentage of women in the United States history were elected in this class to represent America America all across the country so it's really exciting for me to be a part of this class okay boys and girls if you were had the chance to watch it on TV you would notice that there were a lot of women in white and in fact I wore white last night and it was to honor the women's our right to vote it's been a hundred years since since we gained that right and so the women last night we're wearing white and in honor of that it's amazing that was an honor of the suffrage movement and it's amazing to think that there was only a hundred years ago that when we doing the right that we should not take the right to vote for granted or I'm gonna get off-track here I bet you another question the students have how long did the speech last it lasted about an hour and a half now if you watch the speech of an hour and a half maybe 45 minutes was actually speech II speechifying the other four from 45 minutes a lot of clapping and standing ovations and so that kind of makes the speech go on a lot longer right I think that was probably one of the most exciting things are surprising things about this speech last night is with was how many times people clap and stand up that that happened a lot and it's politics so some people again like the president other people don't but it's really wonderful that you were to come experience it and also to share it with your awesome students you can only be Teacher of the Year if you have the best students in in the state of Arizona so we're very lucky to be able to do the video and try to get the kids at opportunity to hear directly from you and about your experience thank you for doing it thank you thanks for being a great teacher thank you for being a great congressman I hope I can visit Salt River pretty soon my kids [Music]

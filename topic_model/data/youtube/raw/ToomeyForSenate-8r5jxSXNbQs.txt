i want in particular thank the doctors who are joining me here today uh to deliver a message uh to pennsylvania that we're going to fight against this very ill-conceived effort to have the government take over health care and we're going to advocate for the kind of common sense reforms that pennsylvania and america really need with respect to health care let me start by saying that uh this bill that uh working its way through the system that the president is advocating for that the senate has passed it's a disaster at a number of levels it's the product of one party having complete control of the elected government the democratic party being captured by the most liberal wing of that party and trying to jam through an agenda with backroom deals and extremely unusual legislative tactics because frankly this bill has so much widespread opposition from the american and the pennsylvania public today i want to touch on some of the most egregious elements of the bill and then i'm going to suggest some of the things we ought to be doing before i introduce a couple of the physicians who are with us today for them to share their perspective about this bill the first thing i want to stress which is a huge problem with this bill is it does nothing to bring down the cost of health care in an effort to reform health insurance and expand coverage one of the first things we ought to focus on is reducing cost this bill does nothing of the sort in fact when you consider all the new fees and the new taxes that it will impose it's going to raise the cost of health care for pennsylvanians and for americans generally you don't have to take my word for it the center centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has stated themselves that the senate bill would raise not lower the cost of health care to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years the cbo the congressional budget office that's charged with scoring these bills they have said that the senate bill would raise individual health insurance premiums by 10 to 13 percent over where they would be if they did nothing at all the result of that is just that middle class folks in pennsylvania and elsewhere are going to be forced to pay higher prices for their health insurance and some will probably lose coverage as a result second huge problem with this bill it's going to destroy jobs at a time when we can't afford to be destroying any jobs the unemployment rate in pennsylvania is awfully close to 10 percent the underemployment rate is somewhere in the high teens this is unacceptable it's way too high and yet this bill proposes that we impose new taxes on jobs it's quite literally the senate bill imposes a 750 dollar per employee penalty on a company that can't afford to provide health care for their workers not to be outdone the obama administration has proposed increasing that to a two thousand dollar fine per worker for employers who can't afford to provide coverage when you raise taxes on employment you get less employment it's as simple as that this bill if it were to pass and become law would cost jobs in pennsylvania and across america third huge problem with this bill it's going to balloon our debt at a time when we cannot afford a huge increase in what is already an unsustainable level of debt fact is the true cost of the senate bill over the next 10 years will be 2.3 trillion dollars of money that we can't have now they've used a lot of smoke and mirrors and a lot of gimmicks to disguise the true cost of this bill let me touch on a few of them one is the bill pretends that the federal government will cut reimbursements to doctors by 21 next year when we know there is no will in congress and we can't afford to be penalizing doctors with a huge cut in their income no one's going to do that it's not going to happen we shouldn't pretend that that's a savings that's not going to occur they also take 52 billion dollars which is projected to be increased social security taxes and they attribute that to this bill thereby pretending that it will cost less but the fact is the added payroll taxes that this bill might generate would have a corresponding increase in social security's liability if the money is taken away from social security to pay for this new entitlement then it won't be there to pay the promised benefits and social security truth is we haven't figured out how we're going to pay for the entitlements we already have and these people want to create yet a new entitlement a fourth big problem with this bill is it inserts government between doctors and patients it establishes bureaucracies that dictate the terms of coverage and it separates patients from their doctors in deciding very personal issues about health care that's totally inappropriate here's what i think we ought to be doing what we can do what would help improve access and affordability for health care number one we ought to eliminate the discrimination in the tax code that allows employers to deduct the cost of buying health insurance but doesn't allow individuals and families to deduct the cost of the health insurance when they have to buy it on their own that asymmetry makes no sense we ought to provide that tax deduction to workers as well second thing we ought to do is force insurance companies to compete for our business open up competition across state lines so that pennsylvania families have dozens or maybe hundreds of competing insurance companies when they decide on a policy that's right for them a third thing i think has to be part of a comprehensive solution is tort reform we tolerate an extraordinary level of litigation that has both direct and indirect costs that drive up the total cost of health care a fourth thing that we ought to do is allow small businesses and other organizations to bond together and to buy association health plans to be able to pool their members together into bigger organizations just as large employers get to do so that they would have the benefits of lower cost and finally we need to increase transparency in health care so that people understand what they're paying for what things cost these reforms would cost very very little they would lower costs for patients consumers families and workers they would improve access to health care they wouldn't throw anybody off the health care plan that they currently have and enjoy and they ought to be able to enjoy bipartisan support president ought to give up on this bill that the american people don't want and start from scratch with a series of these common sense reforms that would improve access and affordability at this time i'm going to introduce dr joseph galassie he's the immediate past president of the pennsylvania society of anesthesiologist and he's going to share with us some of his thoughts on this legislation doc good afternoon it's a pleasure to be here with pat toomey my former congressman from the 15th district and republican candidate for the u.s senate from pennsylvania regarding tort reform the obama plan does very little to address the issue test projects in a few states are not likely to lead to any substantial change it's difficult to estimate how much defensive medicine cost the system but a 2003 survey of high-risk pennsylvania physician specialists published in the journal of the american medical association revealed that 59 of doctors at that time felt that they ordered more tests than were medically necessary and finally i i do think we need reform however i don't think the current form that we see being pushed in congress is the right one i believe that pat toomey and republicans in congress have the right ideas that are certainly more palatable to the american public i believe we need to take smaller steps undertake incremental change and see how those changes affect us before taking a bigger step this course of action will allow all of us to continue to obtain the high quality care that we now take for granted care that's immediately available when it's needed the most and finally at the same time raining costs thank you very much uh at this time i'd like to introduce dr dick schmidt who is a an orthopedic surgeon uh here in suburban philadelphia and takes a great interest in public policy dr schmidt i am a bone cancer surgeon i've been doing that for the last 25 years and i can tell you that currently i spend many hours on the phone now trying to get approval for crucial tests and surgeries for my patients who have cancer and my patients worry in weight and fear when it comes to cancer we all know that time and care are of the essence but if this bill passes this condition will only worsen and my patients will have to wait longer for the care they desperately need we cannot have our government dictating patient care it will cost my cancer patients their lives and limbs this senate health care bill does not promise good serious change it lacks courage and it lacks solutions to a real difficult problem thank you thank you very much for coming

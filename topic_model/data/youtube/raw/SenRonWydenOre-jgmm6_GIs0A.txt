that's right Thank You mr. chairman mr. M mirantis welcome and thank you for always being so helpful and as you know I chair the finance subcommittee on trade and we were also trying to deal with timber this morning so I apologize for being late I want to get your sense about the next steps particularly as it relates to solar and renewable energy because my sense is we're really at a fork in the road with respect to our policy in this area as you know American companies basically have had to stand up for the rights I mean it had to stand up to dumping and unfair subsidies and file all these cases and as a result I think it's fair to say there's a fair amount of market uncertainty now with respect to renewable energy and particularly solar so it seems to me there could be some real value in the United States looking to put together what I've essentially called in terms my own thinking a kind of global resolution and I'd like to know if you think there would be some value in that and what role you think the United States might play in pursuing something like that senator thank you for your leadership on this issue this is a new and emerging issue and we you know in the administration are committed to creating and maintaining green jobs we are eager to work with you and to stakeholders in terms of determining how to address this issue holistically and look forward to doing so will will pursue that you know with you in greater in a greater detail but I will just tell you I think this is an extraordinarily important moment for the administration and I think that if the United States says a there'd be real value in moving now to try to put together a global resolution of it that alone would perhaps bring a little bit more certainty and predictability to what what's ahead and I think the United States ought to be leading those kinds of discussions so I look forward to following that up with you let's go to the question of TPP and start with digital trade as you know i think that the internet is essentially the shipping lane of the 21st century I think you look back at what hearings were in this room 25 or 30 years ago and obviously you know very different in terms of the opportunities for digital goods and services our problem is is we take steps here in our country to protect our kind of key emerging industries in the tech sector from discrimination and sure they have a set of rules that are going to allow them to prosper and grow and then the threat is that will essentially have a variety of practices sometimes it's out in out censorship but there are a whole host of other kinds of barriers that get imposed in effect not only can unravel gains made we gains we've made in the United States but hamper our ability to get our digital goods and services into other markets will the administration make under TPP the sub this a priority to ensure that there is I think a pro-growth non-discriminatory focus with respect to digital trade as a priority for the TPP senator thank you for your long-standing leadership in this area and for pushing us so hard in it yes absolutely this is a huge priority of ours to pursue pro-growth non-discriminatory market opening disciplines in the TPP as well as in the international services agreement on digital trade and we look forward to working with you to ensure that they are as strong as they can be one last question as you know in our part of the world there is great concern about a number of other economic issues footwear clothing and others and my senses in the past there has not been sufficient focus on the global supply chain as it relates to these kinds of industries can you assure the committee that the administration is part of TPP and it's not just footwear and clothing which I've raised the global supply chain generally will be a bigger part of future trade agreements starting with the TPP yes senator the beauty of the TPP is we have the opportunity to rationalize supply chains with the most competitive region in the world and with the effect of creating and supporting more jobs for us here at home so this is a big priority of ours and again as in other areas we look forward to working closely with you I I think miss mr. chairman my time is about up that's an area I'd like to follow up with with you on because I think and I remembered when you chaired the trade subcommittee that issues like the global supply chain those really weren't they certainly didn't carry the same importance they do today and I'd like to follow that up and work with you on it sounds good Thank You senator

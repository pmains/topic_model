Mr President tomorrow we will have an opportunity to vote for students tomorrow we will have an opportunity to vote for parents tomorrow Mr President we will have the opportunity to vote for common sense in the United States Senate tomorrow we'll have an opportunity to vote for my resolution to stop the Biden Department of Education from destroying educational opportunities for millions of students and their parents during the pandemic we saw the devastating impact of prolonged school closures on America's kids especially kids living in low-income communities Big labor unions orchestrated these shutdowns and blue City politicians fell in lockstep they sided with union bosses over parents over kids and over plain old common sense now we see the tragic consequences the 2022 naep scorecard chose the largest drop in reading scores for nine-year-olds and more than 30 years and the first ever the first ever drop in math scores a seven percent decrease we warned them that this would happen we said stop stop letting labor bosses make decisions parents parents are the ones who know what's best for their kids they need flexibility they deserve choice one of those options should always be high quality public charter schools these Charter Schools continue to out kick their coverage this year Charter Schools only represent 12 percent 12 percent of all public high schools but they make up 22 of the top 100 public high schools in our amazing country that's nearly one out of four amazing Public Schools our Charter School even though only 12 percent of all schools all high schools are charter schools think about this in Colorado 85 percent of charter school students met performance standards compared to only 66 percent of students in District managed schools despite their proven track record of success for students for parents and of course for common sense the Biden Administration continues to attack Charter Schools he campaigned against them and then as soon as he got in office he directed the bureaucrats at the doe the Department of Education to put new restrictions on charter schools desperately desperately looking for funding these restrictions are a slap in the face to parents who are turning to Charter Schools as a better alternative for their children since a pandemic charter schools have gained seven percent seven percent that's 240 000 more students have chosen charter schools because their parents are able to access common sense for their kids education path that means hundreds of thousands of students are better off today than they were before they had this option these are kids growing up in some of America's most devastated communities some of America's poorest communities some of America's most disadvantaged communities and this is a game changer not just for the students while they're enrolled in these schools but this is a game changer for the rest of their lives this is a game changer for them economically this is the fastest path to the American dream but we all hope to achieve one day this is the game changer that we so often talk about we've seen the success of providing parents with more options right here in Washington D.C since the creation of the bipartisan let me say that word one more time because sometimes here in Washington we we don't think anything happens in a bipartisan fashion but the DC opportunity scholarship is a bipartisan bipartisan Coalition of senators Congress members who came together to make sure that DC kids since 2004 have had opportunity for Quality education through Charter Schools yes 11 000 students by the way about 500 not 2 000 11 000 students from low-income families here in DC were able to receive scholarships to attend the school of their choice scholarships that were provided by Republicans and Democrats in the congresses since 2004. Good News by the way good news is that these students attending these remarkable public charter schools graduate 91 of the time 91 of the time compare that to students in the DC area that do not attend a public charter school who are in the public school system they graduate only two out of three times sixty six percent I can't imagine a world where my friends across the aisle who stood with me to protect D.C opportunity scholarships would not stand with us today to protect more education options for kids all across America by voting for The administration's restrictions my friends across the aisle are telling these hard working parents their labor union bosses and bureaucrats know what's best for their kids better than the parents themselves that's plain wrong here's what I know the greatest difference between the haves and the have-nots it's not the color of your skin it's not the neighborhood you live in it's not the income of your parents the biggest difference between the Haves and the have-nots in our country will not be solved by playing politics and putting labor unions in front of your kids the way that we close that Gap the biggest difference between the two sides The Haves and the have-nots my friend from Indiana education quality education changes lives it sets poor kids on the right path I want to do for the kids today what was done for me when I was a kid I want to make sure that everybody understands that education is the closest thing to Magic in America and I do me a good education I yield back Mr President

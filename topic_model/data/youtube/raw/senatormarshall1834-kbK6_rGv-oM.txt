there is new pressure tonight from congress to get answers about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic state department correspondent benjamin hall tells us tonight a new investigation would not rely on the chinese for help this is like a nuclear bomb that went off killed 10 times more people than any nuclear warhead did it's been almost two years since covid up ended our lives leaving 700 000 americans dead but still there is no definitive answer on how where or why it started now a group of bipartisan senators is calling for a full 9 11 style commission to investigate the origins amidst mounting evidence that the virus leaked from a wuhan lab we need to find out where this came from led by republican senators roger marshall and joni ernst and democrats dianne feinstein and kirsten gillibrand this new commission would also examine the u.s response and allow sanctions to be placed on labs like the one in wuhan that won't cooperate sanctions even against china senator marshall also claims that certain u.s intelligence agencies have not cooperated i think that the intelligence agency has been not forthcoming i think that they've not released the documents that could have been released the state department has repeatedly said it backs the current world health organization investigation despite the fact that china has repeatedly blocked those attempts but crucially this new commission would be free from chinese interference china is doing everything possible to prevent that kind of investigation but we can't give china a veto over whether or not we investigate the worst pandemic in a century china meanwhile points the finger the other way saying on friday the u.s turns a blind eye to facts and science and has politicized covert 19 response and then resorted to intelligence community-led origins tracing and brett we reached out to the intelligence community and sources there just pointed us in the direction of president biden's 90-day intelligence review on the subject that never got to the bottom of the covert origins and it was always deemed to be too slim in both time and scope secretary blinken is hosting a ministerial meeting of virtual one on wednesday with foreign ministers from around the world to discuss this subject we don't yet know if the chinese foreign minister has been invited or will attend brett benjamin hall live at the state department our new state department correspondent welcome to washington thank you sir

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in strong support of the coronavirus aid relief and Economic Security Act and our president this pandemic has upended life for everyone I've heard from workers living from paycheck to paycheck who face an uncertain future I've heard from struggling farmers I've heard from small business owners who suddenly can't make payroll or rent I've heard from courageous health care professionals and first responders who desperately need personal protective equipment to continue to care for the sick these are incredibly trying times while the cares Act won't solve every unique challenge help is on the way America has faced periods of profound adversity in the past each time we prevailed together as Americans we will do so again but may we remember that while our nation is locked down our Creator God is wide open to our prayers

from California for any statement he may have Thank You mr. chairman there are events going on the floor yesterday and today it's not the house at a high point of bipartisanship and order as in the we can argue about who's to blame but we come into this room mr. chairman we do see a high point of bipartisanship and order and the credit clearly goes to you and the ranking member the ranking member cannot be here at least at the beginning of this hearing and I have an improvised opening statement nothing prepared walking in so let's see whether any of these comments are helpful first in this issue we face the issue of whether to take down the terrorist message or leave it up and monitor and I want to place a almost always take it down first the theory of Fast and Furious let them take the guns and we'll monitor what happens with the guns did not work then and the idea of let them leave the dangerous site up and let's monitor what happens may not wake work in the future but in addition the terrorists know we're watching and they've decided and they've been pretty good at this that putting their message up publicly is helpful notwithstanding the fact that we are monitoring it we got to take it down that means we need the coordination and cooperation of the industry it was just about a year ago that the chairman Royce the ranking member eliot engel ted poe and I called upon Twitter to update its terms of service and and take the terrorist message off twitter twitter was a reluctant bit at first but in april 2015 Twitter announced changes to their terms of service adding new language to its stance on abusive behavior and adding the the words threatening or promoting terrorism and they have substantially improved I should note that since Twitter changed its policies the terrorists have been forced on to other systems their tactic now involves direct messaging I view that as a step forward we closed off an efficient way to reach many people and now they have to try to use a less efficient system but we now have to stop these direct messages we also have to focus on their encrypted chat apps telegram sure spot thema which seemed to have been created precisely for the market of people who want to evade law enforcement and I wonder why such products exist next issue and one that I've talked in this room an awful lot about is the need to have people who know the language of the people we're trying to influence and I don't just mean stes studied Arabic in college I mean a cultural understanding and an understanding of Islamic theology Islamic jurisprudence and Islamic history again and again the State Department is testified in this room that they don't have anybody who they've hired specifically because that person has the expertise in those areas whereas they have dozens of experts in arcane European diplomatic law as if the austro-hungarian empire is the greatest concern of American foreign policy we I'm not saying that we should be issuing fought was out of the State Department but we ought to have somebody who is red a thousand thought was working in the State Department and someone who knows the difference between what is it except that is a good hadith and what is not be and the reason for this is our target audience is people who think they might want to kill innocent women and children these are people who start from a very bizarre mindset they're thinking of becoming too they don't necessarily see the world the way we do translated in Arabic or translated into another language these are people for whom evil consists that the word evil may not include killing a Yazidi family or torturing people or throwing gay people off of tall buildings they may live in a world where they think the Quran says that's what you're supposed to do we have to have people that can go into that world not just the cyber world but the psychological world and and demonstrate to them that this is a perversion of Islam that has been focused by the terrace for staffing we need to look at a whether it should be uniformed military or civilian or some new status that is in between and finally mr. chairman what happens over there comes over here what happens in raka doesn't stay in raka an important part of turning back the cyber terrorist threat is to deal with Isis on the ground and that will require changing and with the administration's beginning to change the rules of engagement so that we can hit strategic targets it doing our best to avoid civilian casualties but not with the view that a single civilian casualty the possibility of one stops any particular attack the ranking member has a statement prepared for delivery and I request that we make it part of the record without objection you'll back thank you very much mr. this morning were pleased to be joined by a distinguished panel we have

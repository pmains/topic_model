let me bring in Senator cotton here Senator you obviously pick and choose the types of people that you're going to go and lend your support to especially when you're going to fly out to another part of the country and try to help a fellow Republican you've got a lot going on in Washington there's a lot happening in the country your time is valuable as a senator what is it about Joe O'Day in Colorado that got you out of bed to fly to that state and try to help him take back that seat well guy thanks for having me on it's great to be on here with Joe the next senator from Colorado uh you're right but I wouldn't have come out here in a day when the Senate's not in session taking time away from my own family to campaign with Joe if he wasn't going to win more importantly Chuck Schumer wouldn't have spent millions and millions of dollars against Joe day if this wasn't a razor thin race so I encourage all your listeners to go to Joe's website and pitch in especially if they're in Colorado like they're in-laws to make sure they are registered to vote and get out for Joe because he's going to bring very clear-eyed common sense to the United States Senate from Colorado Michael Bennett may talk like a Centrist down here in Colorado but he votes like a Washington liberal 98 of the time with Joe Biden just look at the inflation that you see in Colorado some of the highest gas prices I've seen in my travels around the country why do we have all that inflation it's because Michael Bennett casted signing vote for The Reckless two trillion dollar spending Bill last year or consider Joe uh Biden's student loan bailout we just had news today that is probably going to cost lost at least 400 billion dollars which is only going to create more inflation and is grossly unfair to all those people who worked hard to put themselves through school or save for their kids or didn't go to college in the first place Michael Bennett may say that he doesn't support it he cast the deciding vote in the Senate to make it tax-free on a top of getting all that debt forgiven and then of course Michael Bennett's had a chance to vote time and time again to crack down on illegal immigration to build the walls in Catch and Release to increase sentencing for deadly Fentanyl and every single time he votes with Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer and the Liberals in Washington the people of Colorado are recognizing that Michael Bennett doesn't speak for them and they want a common sense conservative like Joe Day in the United States in it yeah then you look at just the news today at the top of the hour we brought you the down number down again bear Market territory I just saw a Chiron on Cavuto on the news channel gas prices now increasing for the sixth consecutive day on top of everything else and it seems centered like they're kind of in party mode at the White House whether it's with James Taylor or with Elton John they're having a great time over there while Americans writ large are suffering in fact the lower lower down on the income scale you are the less you can absorb all of these you know horrible sort of factors that are all a Confluence of events here that are just hammering Working Families middle class families another issue that sort of I think is undergirding and underlying a lot of these races is that of wokeness and sort of out of control political correctness whatever you want to call it one recent controversy actually has arisen out there in Colorado at the Air Force Academy Senator I know you've weighed in on this where the Air Force Academy is now offering guidance in these diversity trainings not to even use words like Mom and Dad because that's offensive you should use parents or Guardians you shouldn't say you guys you shouldn't talk about boyfriends or girlfriends I just wonder from your Vantage Point as a veteran is this doing anything for the actual Mission and Military Readiness and is this worthy of some national scrutiny or scrutiny in Colorado a few of the Air Force Academy voicing this kind of stuff on their Cadets no guy in fact it's hurting right in this because every minute that our troops spin in those kind of indoctrination sessions or politically correct instructional sessions the minute they can't stand on their core Mission the young men and women at the Air Force Academy go there to learn how to fly Advanced Cutting Edge aircraft and kill bad guys they don't go to learn how to use the right pronouns this is bringing discredit on the Air Force Academy and on the Air Force and on our military and when Joe day and our other nominees across the country help us take back the senate in November I promise you that we'll have thorough going oversight hearings into what has been what's been happening to politicize the Department of Defense including other agencies and departments like the Department of Justice but especially at the Department of Defense which is our military that keeps our country safe from foreign threats it should be producing real Warriors not trying to produce social justice Warriors Joe O'Day you just heard their moment ago Senator cotton talking about Michael Bennett pretending to be a moderate sort of talking that way sometimes firing off press releases here or there trying to put some distance between himself and the national party but when it comes down to Brass tax and voting he's with them every time on everything that matters if you were to beat him if you are going to become the next senator from Colorado what kind of Senator do you want to be because your state is very much a purple State and maybe even a I would say purplish Blue State as a Republican senator if you win what would your approach be in the upper chamber compared to Bennett's or or just you know blazing your own trail what do you have in mind should you win but one difference between myself and and Senator Bennett is I'm not a party guy I'm not going to hold the party line on everything I'm going to cross the aisle I'm going to work with anybody in the Senate that'll help me pass good bills that'll help working Americans here in Colorado and that's going to start with closing this border down one of the very first things I'd like to see happen is we secure this border we take the funding that they're going to put into a an over zealous IRS out of this inflation reduction Act take that funding let's devote that to the Border let's put more border security down there and then let's take the line share that money and let's fund our local police departments uh we were just out in Jefferson County this morning with Sheriff Schroeder talking about fentanyl overdoses he doesn't go a week without at least a couple of them in his community uh it's outrageous we've we've lost our vision for Colorado when we we don't close this border down right now Colorado is number two in Fentanyl yes we've killed 1800 coloradans in the last year during with a drug overdose and that's just unacceptable that's not the expectation that Colorado's want out of their government so we're going to take the right steps to shut this border down and make sure that we secure the Border keep the fentanyl from coming across at record levels and then also get rid of this crime problem we've got here in our communities we need to get more cops on the street and that's one of the very first things that I'll take on on the crime issue what do you think the role is there for the federal government obviously it's a problem in a lot of places especially big cities Democrats are sort of running away from their own rhetoric their own votes from a few years ago the politics used to be different in 2020 everyone was sort of climbing over each other to stand up to the police and talk about redistributing funding away from police and that kind of thing now they're swearing on the Democratic side most of them although you know the squad types are sticking to it oh no no defund the police that was never us no we want to fund the police they've kind of done a 180 for political reasons how are you seeing that issue playing out and resonating in Colorado well it's a resource issue here and I think that's the role of the Federal Government is providing resources to our locals so that they can hire more cops we were down in Denver here last week with uh uh chief of police Payson he's telling the community he's short 250 cops in Denver uh and then again this morning uh the sheriff of Jeffco saying he needs 50 more bodies on the street to make it safe so that's an area where I think the feds can come in with some funding let them hire let them conduct their business but provide those resources at the same time we've got to do more to secure this border they're telling us that they need to choke down the supply chain to get ahead of this fentanyl issue and that means choking down the Border we need to make sure the fentanyl's not coming across at record Paces I mean they're painting these uh these pills different colors now they call them Skittles so that they can provide those more to our kids that's just wrong they're poisoning our kids Joe OJ is a contractor a business guy he's framing himself I think accurately as an outsider he's running for U.S Senate he's a republican nominee his opponent is the incumbent Michael Bennett just like a rubber stamp Chuck Schumer Joe Biden Democrat out there and helping him today on the trail in Denver is Tom Cotton U.S senator from Arkansas and they both joined us here on the show and that's a pretty cool deal gentlemen to both of you thank you very much for joining us we look forward to speaking again thank you guy thanks thanks again for having me on guy I really appreciate it

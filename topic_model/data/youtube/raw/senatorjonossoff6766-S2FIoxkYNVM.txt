mr chairman thank you well thank you uh under secretary isaiah i want to direct my first question to you before i took office i produced investigations of war crimes organized crime and official corruption for international news organizations and press freedom is vital and under threat worldwide with journalists facing chilling restrictions and threats to their lives and safety increasingly around the world reporters without borders ranks china 175th out of 180 countries for world press freedom the ccp's monitoring systems firewalls and media controls have shut down any free reporting at home in november of last year the bbc reported that the chinese province of hanan was building a surveillance system with face scanning technology that can detect journalists and other quote people of concern my question for you under secretary is about the ccp's efforts to repress intimidate and chill press freedom beyond the borders of the prc how do they engage in such transnational repression what tactics do they employ to chill and restrict press freedom and free reporting about the ccp or to influence reporting about the ccp beyond china's borders thank you senator for raising a critically important dimension of our efforts to counter and deter prc transnational repression and certainly uh we agree that our efforts um have to address the um concerted prc effort to um through transnational repression to shape and suppress media reporting that is shedding a light on what's happening um as the co-chairs noted in their opening remarks the you know egregious actions taken against family members of radio free asia journalists is just one emblematic example of the scope and severity of these efforts in response our efforts uh are putting a premium on promoting and protecting uh open and resilient information ecosystems by addressing the needs of at-risk journalists fostering the long-term sustainability of independent media outlets and enhancing the impact of investigative journalism which is critical to to shine a light not only on what is happening inside china but with respect to this growing uh threat of transnational repression which we are discussing today this is also an area for our multilateral engagement with allies and partners we have important platforms such as the media freedom coalition and the freedom online coalition which are building um i would say like-minded solidarity to address and respond to this problem more collectively and recognize that it is truly global global in scope and we can't be complacent in um in admiring the problem without taking uh more concerted action to support free and independent media and investigative journalism thank you under secretary and i ask for your commitment to work with my office and to

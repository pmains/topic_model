member of the House Judiciary Committee and house wins Ways and Means Committee retired Airborne infantry officer and U.S army veteran he's we got to call him the dude he's got more uh than I have on there um Congressman Greg stuby Congressman good morning welcome Today George great to have you so thanks for having me Congressman I love talking to you about stuff like this because you see it there's such a lens of normal people House Republicans establishing this new committee though to investigate the weaponization of federal government we know we know that the FBI did things they shouldn't have done the justice department also many of these things have gone way beyond their scope of Duty what say you yeah I think I think uh leader McCarthy and Jim Jordan for coming up with the creation of this and putting it in the rules so it'll be a separate committee but it'll sit under Judiciary that will specifically look at the weaponization of the doj and the FBI everything from deeming school board you know parents at school board meetings domestic terrorists to the things that we saw happen uh with the surveilling of Trump's campaign everything that you've seen in the weaponization of the doj and the FBI that the American people quite frankly are sick and tired of seeing all the corruption at the highest levels there we have authorized a committee that will have subpoena power investigative powers and once that committee is up and running and put together I think next week into next week that that committee should be seated uh you're going to see subpoenas start flying and investigations start and we'll couple that with what the Judiciary Committee is doing as well you know Congressman we're hearing a lot about weaponization at the same time actual weapons Illinois now becomes the latest state to ban assault weapons um you know it just it doesn't seem to end uh what's your take on that well you know we've had these debates in the Judiciary Committee with Democrats Democrats don't even really know the difference between what a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic handgun is there's no difference in functionality whatsoever but they still want to demonize these type of weapons I can guarantee you crimes going to continue to Skyrocket in places like Chicago it's going to have no impact except on law-abiding Americans who want to use those weapons either for self-defense or some type of shooting at the range whatever it is that is protected under the Second Amendment of our constitution I believe it's 100 unconstitutional and I think is it works it way through the court system you'll see that the U.S Supreme Court will agree with me yeah I tend to agree with you on that sir you've been right on pretty much every gun issue we've had you on but Governor pritzker look he has said I'm going to fire all these sheriffs there's like 74 Illinois sheriff's departments vowed to defy the state's a quote assault weapon ban as you so kindly noted I I mean first off you can't fire an elected Sheriff but what is he like is this just like strong armed communism of course yeah anytime they can bully you when Democrats can't win on the policy they try to bully you into agreeing and doing what they want you to do in States like Florida I don't know how it works in Illinois but in Florida our sheriffs are constitutional sheriffs they are protected by the Constitution unless they violate a crime the governor cannot remove them so hopefully it's the same way there in Illinois and he's just trying to make blatant threats and uh thank God we have sheriffs like that who are willing to stand up for the Constitution because it's completely unconstitutional to ban guns that are in common use those weapons are in common use because the American people use them for self-defense yeah there's like more AR more F or AR-15s and there are F-150s on the road and I would just say Amen to the congressman here as someone that really strongly believes in our Second Amendment Congressman thank you so very much as always great to have you yeah good to see you guys thank you all right

one of those co-sponsors a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee North Carroll to Cody Republican Senator John Hoeven joins me this morning senator what a pleasure to see you good to be with you Jose so will this bill get to the President's desk that's the first question well I believe it will we have 63 or excuse me a 60 sponsors on the bill and about 63 that have indicated support for it at this point and of course we're working to build more support we'll take it through committee today and then take it to the floor and have an open amendment process in an effort to build more bipartisanship is this mr. McConnell said the exact same type bill that was presented just last month he is this is a bill that I had written some time ago my lead co-sponsor on the Democrat side was Mary Landrieu she want to bring it up before the end of the year we agreed to do it didn't got 59 votes at that point now Joe Manchin is the lead Democrat sponsor so all along we'd anticipated bringing it up after the first of the year but Senator Landrieu wanted to give it a try last year so he did but it yes it's the same bill and yesterday you said you're not sure if you could override a veto what are the options your way well that's why we're having this open process or what's called regular order on the floor where we'll go through the committee take the bill to the floor and let Republicans and Democrats alike offer their amendments and if they can get 60 votes those amendments pass in their part of the bill again we hope to build more support for the bill by having that regular order open amendment process senator Hoeven always a pleasure to see you thank you for being with me this morning thanks Susie

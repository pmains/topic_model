thank you so much almost for that great presentation again I think we've had a great day of some great speakers here I think we've it all already Wow we still have panel discussion after senator Cruz thinks his remarks but at this time I would like to introduce him he's right around the corner hardly needs an introduction you know the reason why senator Cruz has been enchanting the religious freedom and his family his family has first-hand experience the impression of dictatorial regimes so his his life and his family's testimony really stand as a testimony of what it means to live in a free world and they know the price of freedom so with that it's my great honor to introduce the senator from Texas Ted Cruz [Applause] well good afternoon and welcome let me start by saying thank you thank you for speaking up for failure thank you for speaking up for littering thank you for speaking up for fundamental human rights across the court when it comes to religious persecution recent studies by domestic and international organizations have found that Christians are the most widely persecuted religious group they suffer at the hands of both state and non-state actors their persecutors range from Islamists to coming from religious extremists to extremes according to a report by open door USA one in nine Christians worldwide experiences high levels of persecution we repeat that step one in nine Christians world one experiences high levels of persecution and Islamic oppression fuels Christian persecution in eight of the top ten countries where Christians experienced persecution certain parts of the world are worse than others and Iran is a place where Christians are in great danger Christians in Iran are routinely arrested because of their faith there are police raids on house churches and religious gathering where different faiths are arrested and put in prison the Christian world watch Monitor reported that in 2016 193 Christians were arrested in Iran because of their religious affiliation in prison imprisoned Christians in Iran are subject to solitary confinement and beatings they are denied medical care and their torture according to the 2018 state Human Rights report religious seminary students in prison in Iran were subject to brutal torture including electrocution and being whipped with electrical wires but in the midst of darkness there is still hope we have today with us Mariano spent four and Marzia he Mirza apologize for the pronunciation to Iranian women who converted to Christianity and spread the gospel they covertly handed out the New Testament to 20,000 raisins in 2009 the Iranian regime arrested in prison tortured and sentence them to death by hanging they spent 259 days in the groove 11 prison in 2010 because of international advocacy and because of God's grace Mara and Marcia were released her crystal in 2013 they relocated to Atlanta Georgia if they are safe and can now freely practice their Christian thank you the Iranian regime continues to threaten and hunt those who they think to pose any economic political or religious threat to the regime a few things are more powerful than highlighting the stories of dissidents of those who were persecuted that's a role I've taken seriously in the Senate the last seven years over and over again I've worked I've gone to the Senate floor to highlight dissidents standing up to tyranny standing up to oppression because simply shining a light and telling their stories causes tyrannous to fear repercussions in 2017 I landed bipartisan resolutions Democratic Senator Pat Leahy calling on Iran to release unjustly detained American citizens and American legal permanent residents that resolution resolution of passed the Senate in 2018 I'll and another bipartisan resolution with Senator Leahy condemning the government of Iran for its violence against demonstrators and its citizens we're in position to lead by using our course by speaking truth to power by courageously challenging tyrants and evil regimes they must continue to stand with personally and justly imprison dissidents have real power by daring to challenge authoritarianism interior they inspire others to speak out of ways whether it's Mario and Marcia and Iran or new shop and Lucia Bella China or Leopoldo Lopez in Venezuela or Asia Bibi in Pakistan these courageous people have inspired others who live under the crushing tyranny to have hope that truth and light will for them as an example of the power of this in the Senate I introduced legislation concerning Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Laureate in China who was wrongfully in prison the legislation I introduced would rename the street in front of the Chinese embassy liusia applause now that legislation took inspiration from a step taken during the Ronald Reagan administration where under President Reagan the United States renamed the street in front of the Soviet embassy sakarov applause after the pain of dissidents at the pause and reflect the power that every time someone wants to write to the embassy they have to write the name of the dissonance every time in today's modern technological world you have to go to the website to say where is the enema see located they have no choice but acknowledge the dissident that legislation initially faced significant opposition and sentence indeed I battled repeatedly on the Senate floor with Democratic senators one senator who opposed it ultimately I placed a hold on every State Department nominee until the legislation was taken up and passed that had a way of focusing attention and I lifted that goal when we received agreement for the legislation that passed the Senate and ends the legislation never ended up passing into law because the house didn't take up and lose my father passed away his widow who she is still in China was still wrongfully imprisoned and among other things had not been able to go and receive the Nobel Prize her late husband had wanted received the cash award the Nobel Prize I can tell you early in the Trump administration when I was having breakfast with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Secretary of State indicated that concern of her Lucia Plaza over that legislation passing was at the very top of China's concerns they had seen that we had gotten unanimous bipartisan support to pass it through the Senate once and the regime was terrified that we would do it again I ultimately told the Secretary of State I said I'll tell you what feel free to use me as the bad guy here if China releases Lucia I'll step back from the legislation and if they don't release her I'll continue to present until we pass it not too many months later try to release Lucia [Applause] speaking the truth has power why is it that tyrants fear because telling stories shining sunlight on their atrocities strengthens others being impressed they feared that exposure so I say everyone here thank you and is present he is with us his racist presence in the dark prisons and the Christians who have been in prison in Iran and across the globe they know that but for the rest of us it's our responsibility not to let them suffer but instead to speak up to speak up with truth because truth is stronger than lies and light is stronger than the darkness and so thank you television [Applause]

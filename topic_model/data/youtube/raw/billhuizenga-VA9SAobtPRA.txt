run from the deep south or you know the southwest or mid-atlantic reviewing we think differently with your within the mid west michigan is going to think a little different than I line and so there's this was paradise that they all come come through it with second one is a political divide all right and that's a little bit about this you know Iraq and Libya thing you know you're an RI Maddie we're going to each other's brings in why because the letters behind our name it doesn't matter now hold the position that I held ten years ago on particular issue we're just going to go a decoder there's a little bit of that but quite honestly it gets portrays far more than what it really is is the third the philosophical divide really what I think is driving so much of it and I guess it sort of play office as political rancor but it's a philosophical divide that it is is involving the proper role with scope of government and what people believe is quantitative easing the proper thing to do which is where a Treasury flying back our own debt all right that's going to be coming up at the end of the month and there's debate about whether it's the new a poor attempt to simulate count the economy federal government should continue to do that there's there's tarp on deck you name it and all those all those programs are part of that that philosophical divide the fourth one is a generational divide and we see it within my caucus there's 87 of those freshmen republicans there's nine freshmen Democrats I've talked to the number of them as well they see it but it's a little more pronounced in our certificate numbers and winded old by our own leadership sometimes it's between the lines is coming okay guys realize you take a few typos and send you home and unless you sit through a couple town hall meetings where you're going to hit me up you're going to come back and then with each OT c really works we'll show you what you get and and there's this number of us and yeah this is a this is a relatively conservative pretty solidly republican district there are guys who lie employed in this class with whom are holding seats that were always have else's the 1880s yes i said 1880s right and these guys are taking some very difficult and they're going back to their district and they're saying i'm ok i don't care what have you go back and explain now yeah after the rhetoric and TV commercials of you know grandma gets shoved over the cliff right some of those things but these guys are coming back and saying same guys universally isn't women that are saying you know I got some dirty make some very difficult decisions I'm okay we doing it I want to do it you know and and when Tim Geithner said to us as he did the other day on Thursday as he said you guys could politically handle the heat for the types of cuts that you need to make there's a number of us that are saying trice right all right i mean and i don't even mind out like that but here's years here but here's why because what your billing in the setup for this is the philosophical difference and grow quickly with President segment which what i canna reinforced on thursday is he believes that he has ventured out phonetically out on the limb he's proposing near description four trillion dollars in cuts over the next 12 years i was a social science major not you know hard science major but do the math on that it's less than 100 billion dollars a year now we're over spending this year 1.5 trillion so 105 150 billions I so we're in it where it got 300 of that that still leaves us with 1.2 but of that four trillion it's actually two trillion dollars of cuts a trillion dollars and tax increases and a trillion dollars and interest savings okay so we're actually talking more about 180 billion dollars a year in Nashville constant and and the President believes that that is as far as you can absolutely go my concern is not been so much on on what's what what that is but the impact for us when I thought when we're talking about the debt we're seeing n0 basically for a floor up for our interest rates virtually zero you know they're better go up we know that they're going to go up or continuing to get billions of dollars into this one that we're going to have to pay out right now fifth largest the largest expenditure is interest on debt there's professions that soon pass defense spending that if we're he'll that sitting at 14 trillion dollars of that and at some of you may have seen house on house floor I got a little more passionate than I typically am and one of the reasons was I was down nervously to some of my colleagues and I got frustrated I got really frustrated and I used on the House floor an example that I talked about I just was talking with high school kid today about this you know you're in high school and you're going to get a summer job you're going to be 220 bucks a week but you're going to spend three hundred seventy bucks we now have school a couple weeks ago where's that all students his hand shot up and mount engaged right because why it's dumb and I said well okay but not fair it is all parents are there times that maybe you need to go in half you're going to buy a car so you get to a gallery buying piece of equipment are you saving up for publisher do what you're doing some of these things so there may be a reason but not picking I'm on your but if your mom and dad or anything like my mom and dad mom charge me interest when I had to borrow something but there's times I think those were good life lessons thanks mom it was appreciate it at the time but thank you and you know but can you do that all summer and and the answer is no you can't and so our problem is we had 1005 and that's what we're doing this year we're taking in 2.2 trillion dollars in drug and that's passes that's Lisa's that's a renounced all right but we are spending the 3.7 trillion and it's not a one-time deal it's not a one night this happened under both administrations I'm not going to get up LOL mix we're going to get your question you know that work or we have been doing this whether both administrations it has taken a dramatic even last couple years because of the philosophy of trying to save those jobs is employers auto industry or tart or whatever else oh absolutely if he had ever going back to work here in Michigan backgrounds in the serving in the state legislature we would have solved a huge number of our physical problem however state-michigan he still continued to spend one line budgets themselves continue to go up it's not like we helped flappy revenues went down revenues are going down dinner spending is going on that is exacerbated the problem and so afterward and we're marching forward on this at what point sling address those issues and there's short-term things medium-term things and long-term things now the long-term things are social security medicare medicaid we just have to be honest now for anybody or 55 in here you know the mush mush line paul ryan plan does nothing to you and it will not change right now the president's are admitted we were at this business meeting that got brought up but he acknowledged that but he said that again you know here's the problem with medicaid we're going to block grant medicate the states or just in a handover you know the money to the states and say okay guys you figure out how you can most efficiently effectively deal with this the president's position is well was going to happen at the state level this eventually they are going to have to start making cuts the children seniors and therefore its varying for us to go after you if you're going to block grant connecticut now I've asked our side to do some research because senator at the time State Senator Barack Obama I'm just curious if he signed on to any bills in your resolution for any letters that requested a waiver for the for the state of Illinois federal government when I came to Medicaid because i know i did and i know that you know the Speaker of the House Andy Dillon Democrat did and I know that Jennifer Randall did I know that whole bunch of other people did so I'm just that in her maybe if he trail lock down where he would acknowledge that the states are looking for flexibility the other thing is social security I'm 42 the Social Security Administration has now admitted that for me and conveniently right a lot of time 25 years from now only four years of drop of the year 24 years from now Social Security will no longer he's paying out 100 100 percent of what I paid there will be 70 a person so that that's problematic to be because it served in a hung at 42 what's happening this is their 22 or odd kids that are fluffy and those kids that are too what what happen we're seeing their life expectancy fill up to

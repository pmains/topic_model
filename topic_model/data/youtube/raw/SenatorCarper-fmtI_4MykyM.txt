as presiding officer knows I come from the state of Delaware and Dell was noted for a number of things one of the things that were noted for is before anybody else any other state ratified the Constitution we did and for one whole week Delaware was the entire United States of America and we opened it up and we let in Maryland and New Jersey and Pennsylvania ultimately Iowa and other states and I think it turned out pretty well most days but we're the first to ratify the Constitution just up the road from from us my family and I live in northern Delaware and just up the road from us in Philadelphia and that's where that Constitution was first debated and folks from throughout the 13 colonies came and argued for against different provisions of how we should set up the structure of our government one of the hardest provisions that they argued on and debated was whether or not there should be a legislative branch at all and if they're there should be sure to just be like unicameral just one entity one body within a legislative ranch and or should there be two should the the number of votes and the power that that states have the in accordance with the size of their other state doesn't how many people they have are we going to balance things out and the sum of those worked out called the Connecticut compromise it said that every state will have a Senate two senators same number and they were part of the United States Senate and the House of Representatives would be comprised of a folks so that the more people who live in a state they have more more representatives now that was a Connecticut compromisers worked out maybe not a perfect compromise in the eyes of some but it enabled him to move afford most people think it's fair and reasonable the another really tough issue that they they wrestle with those days was with respect to one of the other the third branch of going out of the executive we have a legislative rather judicial branch and the question is what are the judge is going to do these federal judge is going to do how are they going to be appointed who's going to pick them and is it the chief executive officer said the president be able to to name by himself or herself the who the judges are going to be federal judges Supreme Court justices should it be up left up to the Senate should it be left up to the house representatives should it be a joint effort by the House and Senate should the there's gonna be some role for the president the chief executive to play I just want you to work out and time and time again they voted on this issue and the Constitutional Convention up in Philadelphia finally finally after a number of votes they were just not successful they couldn't come to a successful conclusion somebody they actually called out for a clergy to come in mr. president and actually a call on divine intervention to help him get over this issue of how to pick judges how to select the federal judges and I don't know if it's divine intervention that led him to this one or not but in the end of the day the the deal was this he said John the President shall nominate not a point not named but shall nominate folks to service a federal judge including the Supreme Court and that the Congress the Senate rather would have the opportunity to provide advice and consent to to the president we've argued a lot over the years what advice and consent should be but it makes very clear the president has a job to do with respect to the naming of judges and I believe we have a job to do was as well about 300 yards from the Golden Fleece tavern where the Constitution was first ratified on december seven 1787 in delaware about 300 yards from there I with my hand on a Bible raised my other hand and took an oath to defend the Constitution as governor of delaware as governor Delaware and you know I never thought mr. president very much about what kind of qualities I'd look for in a judge and my opponent my Republican opponent wonderful guy in a big Arry Scott in 1992 standard bearer for the Republican Party in the governor was raised he and I had 35 joint appearances together debate in all kinds of forms nobody ever asked ever asking all those forms what qualities would you look for in two people you didn't nominate to be a Supreme Court justice for the state of Delaware or a member of the Court of Chancery which is a court that has national international role to play the Superior Court which also here is not just Delaware cases but national cases as well nobody ever asked me what would you consider as it turned out that was a really important part of my job given the other relevance and the importance of those courts and I'm proud to say that LOL judiciary is one of the highest regarded made of the highest regarded of any state judiciary's that we have we have a very unusual sister mr. president where there has to be an equal balance between Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary it's not a spoil system if there's a one more Republican than a Democrat there's a vacancy or you know you got to name a Democrat and that's the way its justice works when I was governor we had a fellow person who had been Chancellor the Court of Chancery which is I Honor Society was going to leave and the three had a vacancy to fill i named a Republican and in that case I actually had the flexibility to name a democrat or republican i named a Republican I I wanted to name the best person that I thought was interested in serving my criteria that I used as a mr. president nominating people who serve on the Judiciary on the bench indelibly wanted I wanted to feel really smart I wanted to nominate folks are sought to nominate people who knew the law I I sought to nominate people in the presiding officer will appreciate this who embraced the Golden Rule they treated other people the way they want to be treated the folks who came before them in a courtroom received fair treatment equal treatment I want to nominate people who worked hard I wanted to nominate always thought to nominate people who had good judgment I sought to it to nominate people who were able to make a decision you know sometimes people can have a lot of those qualities but they just have a hard time making a decision I didn't want to do that I want to have people who could do all those things and my hope is this president will look at Democrats Republicans and independents and find among them on a man or woman who is just meets all that criteria and more and more that's the president's job i was up at the detroit auto show mr. president I know if you've been there you know you have a lot of auto up auto assembly and operations and supply operations in your state but I go to enjoy daughter sure I've been going for a long time Delaware used to until fairly recently built more cars trucks vans per capita than any other state so I cared a lot about who was running GM who was running Chrysler we lost both plants a few years ago when they went into to bankruptcy but I still would like to detroit auto show not every year but most years and has to keep in touch with the industry this last January month ago I was in Detroit is the opening day of the Detroit Auto Show tens of thousands of people converging on on the the Auto Show just a ton of people master humanity going this way that way to see the different reveals are the different vehicles that are being concept cars or new new production vehicles are going to be launched maybe later this year and during the afternoon I'm early afternoon and i'm looking for a restroom i find one and so did hundreds of other people come in and out of this this this one restroom and i notice here is a older gentleman who's a custodian standing with his cart and his mop in his bucket is broom outside of the the mass of humanity and i walked in and i noticed got in spite of all those people the place was remarkably clean and when I came out I said to the other janitor I figured he was a janitor who had responsibility for this for this restroom and I said to him I just want to say sir that this is a really chronic clean restroom and we've given all the kind of people you've got it they're coming in and out of here I I don't know how you do it i just want to say thank you for doing your job really well and he said to me looked at me right in my eye and he said that's my job he said this is my job and he said I I try to do my job well he said everybody has a job everybody has a job and everybody should try to do their job well I thought to myself wow wow what insight what a message and under the Constitution the president has a job and apparently he's moving not with no haste with dispatch you're trying to meet his responsibilities I don't know that we've ever I know we've had any number of times when presidents have nominated Supreme Court justices in an election year presidential election year I know like a dozen or more times that's happened and I think every single time that nominee is then we had hearings for that nominee there's been the opportunity to debate the nominee question a nominee meet with the nominee and the vote debate here on the floor vote on the nomination up load up or down I don't know of any time we've not done that even when when a nominee comes to us during a presidential election year and I know when is crazy election season crazy election season it's still like eight months nine months before the election but I I hope at the end of the day just like that janitor at a Detroit Auto Show intent on doing his job feeling that the rest of us have a job to do and we should be in town doing our job I think we do we have that need we have responsibilities I hope we will live a fulfilling the other thing I want to say is baseball my colleague who's presiding over is now when he was a House member we were House members together we used to play baseball we played in the congressional baseball game I think maybe 10 years or start together may on the Democratic side him on a Republican side a year one or two years I was selected as the almost selected as remotion most valuable Republican player I'm a Democrat so I was a great player but gave him my best but I just an in for event over the weekend in Florida and last week something wonderful happened in Florida and in Arizona and what happened was spring training camps open pitchers and catchers had reported and then the full teams have started to report and when they start to spring training games in a day or two I think maybe tomorrow when the teams take the field they all take the fields with nine players out on the field nine players out in the field when the Justice Roberts was going through the confirmation hearing he said I think before the douchery committee they asked me I said what does the job of the Supreme Court how would you describe it in a simple way he said our job basically is to call balls and strikes that's what he said our job is to call balls and strikes well baseball teams when they take the field they've got nine players nine positions when the Supreme Court is in in in and back row and they're in session they've got nine the job justices at least they did until the jet death of Justice Scalia they just like you can have a baseball team take the field without the shortstop or without the catcher or even now without the second baseman of the center field you can't have them take the field and play well and do their job and do their job the end of the day the Supreme Court as a team they need nine not players but nine justices to be able to do their job as well and let's keep that in mind last thing I would would say is this American people is are frustrated with us and our inability to get things done sometimes I can understand why they would feel that way we have a great opportunity here to get something done and I hope they're PES will nominate a terrific candidate I hope our Republican friends will leak have the courtesy of meeting with that man or woman give him or her a chance to present themselves explain what they're about have a hearing on that person and and then give them but the police dear the honor of a vote I think they deserved that

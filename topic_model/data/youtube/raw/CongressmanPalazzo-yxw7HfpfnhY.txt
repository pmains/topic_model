mr speaker i rise today to remind the american people that today marks president biden's one year in office and 365 days of his disastrous failure at our southern border 40 percent of americans grade joe biden's immigration policy with a big fat f for his failures his open border policy has proven month after month to be not only unsuccessful but downright dangerous for the american people more deadly fentanyl products have been smuggled into our neighborhoods this year than ever before nearly 11 000 pounds were apprehended in the last year alone biden's wide open southern border is poisoning our communities and causing unthinkable harm his bad policy has taken lives it's no surprise that our nation's number of overdoses reached an all-time high in 2021 and my heart breaks for the parents who have lost their children while our president plays politics i have said it before and i will say it again border security is national security and it's time to stop deliberately destroying the safety of innocent americans for the sake of politics thank you i yield back

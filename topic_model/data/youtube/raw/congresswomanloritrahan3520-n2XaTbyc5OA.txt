E TO THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM MASSACHUSETTS, MRS. TRAHAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MRS. TRAHAN: THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. MANY OF US IN THIS CHAMBER HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN. FOR US TODAY'S VOTE COMES DOWN TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS. CAN YOU AS A MOM OR DAD IMAGINE GETTING A CALL THAT YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL WAS LOCKED DOWN BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOT HER CAN YOU IMAGINE STANDING HELPLESSLY BEHIND A POLICE LINE AS GUNSHOTS ARE FIRED NEAR YOUR DAUGHTER'S CLASSROOM? CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO IDENTIFY THE UNRECOGNIZABLE BODY OF YOUR MISSING BABY BOY BY HIS FAVORITE SHOES? AND CAN YOU IMAGINE STANDING IN LINE FOR A D.N.A. TEST PRAYING TO GOD THAT IT DOES NOT COME BACK A MATCH. I ASK THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT 19 FAMILIES IN UVALDE JUST HAD TO DO. THAT'S THEIR REALITY AND IT'S BEEN THE REALITY FOR 14 FAMILIES IN PARKLAND, 20 IN SANDY HOOK, 12 IN COLUMBINE AND THE LIST GOES ON. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT REALITY, THEN DO TODAY WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 25 YEARS AGO. PASS THE LEGISLATION SO NO PARENT IN AMERICA EVER EXPERIENCES THIS HORRIFIC REALITY AGAIN. OUR CHILDREN ARE COUNTING ON U

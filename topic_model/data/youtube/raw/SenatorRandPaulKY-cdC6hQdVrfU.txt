joining me now republican senator rand paul of kentucky senator paul i like the words most of the speech but it's all about the actions what did you get from the 17 executive orders well you know i me this may not surprise you but i didn't find any of the orders that i agreed with and i think many of the orders that he came forward with will lead to unemployment you know paris climate accord carbon taxes all the things he's going to do against our energy industry will cost lots of jobs getting rid of the keystone pipeline but also raising the minimum wage to 15 i think will also the government estimates are close to 4 million people lose their jobs particularly heard among this are minorities and black teenagers particularly with uh high unemployment so i didn't see much there you know that was i think gonna help the country but more than anything if he thinks he's gonna bring the country together by impeaching a former president i don't know what he's what he's smoking because really he's just going to divide the country further and it will be up to him and one thing would be pretty clear if it doesn't go forward it would be because of him he has not mentioned that he says let congress do their job yeah if he wanted to rise above the occasion he'd be calling chuck schumer and publicly saying uh that it's a mistake and will further divide the country that would be a real statesman that would be a real big thing to do i don't suspect he will and so i think these are merely words also if you read uh his speech and listen to it carefully much of it is thinly veiled innuendo calling us white supremacists calling us racist calling us every name in the book calling us people who don't tell the truth and his and going forward we're not going to have manufactured or manipulated truth well that's another way of saying oh all of my opponents manufacture and manipulate the truth and are liars he just said it in a nicer way but that was that was really the gist of what he was telling us but senator doesn't he need you doesn't senator schumer need republicans it's 50 50. i mean they got a slight majority but it's not going to get you 60 to pass anything substantial what are you what are you looking to hear for you to get on board with anything i think most importantly what we have to hear is that uh he's not going to radically transform the country into some sort of socialist dystopia and that may sound like you know hyperbole but many of the things they want to do would radically transform america to a different country to a country different than what has provided great wealth and great humanitarian ease to millions and millions of americans so you know there'll be a couple of key players in this i think senator manchin from west virginia will be key and also what will be key is whether or not they blow up the filibuster if they blow up the filibuster and do everything by simple majority they could very quickly and radically change america and i think destroy a lot of the fabric of what our great wealth and great freedoms are based on the president left a note for as tradition would have it for president biden you like that say it one more time the president left a note in the top drawer for joe biden to read now that trump is out of office and biden is in do you like that do i like that he left the note yeah i don't know what's in the note so it's hard to know what i thought he said it was good i mean that's a good sign that he did something i think so and i think it was good that the president did wish him luck on the on the way out um i personally would have would have come to the inauguration um had i been you know the former president but the thing is is that uh i think what's most important if the country's going to heal is the the democrats have to give up on this rancor and this partisanship and this this this really politically motivated impeachment if they don't 75 million people are going to be very very unhappy if they do this partisan impeachment best way to do that outside convincing joe biden is to convince fellow kentucky senator mitch mcconnell what's the last time you talked to him what do you tell you it's been a week or two since i've had any discussion but i've been saying publicly to the senate leadership at large that if they vote for impeachment if they encouragement impeachment that it will be very very destructive to the party senator rand paul thanks so much

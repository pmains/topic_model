bring in florida congressman michael waltz he serves on the house armed services committee and as a former greenberg commander congressman great to have you with us the white house has said that this trip to saudi arabia is not one that's being made out of desperation over the oil situation what's your take yeah martha isn't it incredible that once again the president has boxed himself in uh with his asinine energy policy that he is having to go over uh to the middle east after insulting the saudis uh throughout his campaign and go over as a supplicant uh basically i mean it's transparent to everyone uh that that he's over there to mother may i beg and plead uh for the saudis to pump more when all he would have to do is take on the progressives here back home and pump more which oh by the way is cleaner uh american oil and gas and if he would just do that uh if he would just take them on politically he would not only be lowering prices for americans and helping himself politically but he would also be starving oil rich dictatorships around the world from iran to venezuela to putin himself of their cash and by the way just very quickly martha putin right now is back at pre-war export levels uh for every european country that has turned away or the united states turned away china uh has stepped in twofold and china has now seen a 50 increase in employ imports of russian gas so it this is just broken across the board and there is one fix that's unleash american energy and he refuses to do it yeah it's a great point india is also taking a lot of russian oil so that's why russia can afford to say well germany we're going to cut you off because they're getting an enormous amount of demand coming from from china and india and and others in the course of this whole thing um you know with regard to this is oliver knox's analysis he wrote about this today he said that pariah meaning mbs has extensive access to the white house new us arms sales and now a presidential visit including a face-to-face with mbs who wasn't even welcome on the phone a year ago this over fierce opposition from saudi human rights activists who see the crown prince as the architect of repression at home and a u.s intelligence report clearly laid out in february of 2021 congressman we assess the saudi arabia's crown prince mohammed bin salman approved an operation in istanbul turkey to capture or kill saudi journalist jamal khashoggi so what do you suggest we do about that well that look the the killing of a journalist is despicable it should be called out it's unacceptable but again the president now put himself in the position uh he did that of of having to then still uh go to the saudis and beg them uh as a leader of opec to pump more what we should do about it we should pump uh ourselves i do have to say though it is a bit ironic from the left who are just uh having a meltdown over this trip uh and and his engagement with mbs over the killing of a journalist they say absolutely nothing when it comes to the president's engagement and i would say even pandering to the chinese that are arresting and murdering journalists human rights activists doctors who call out kovid and a million muslims so i mean it is a little kind of all over the place from their perspective and a bit hypocritical yeah quick question um with regard to nicaragua there are reports that russian troops are training in nicaragua at this point how much of a concern is that to you oh it's a huge concern i mean i feel like we're we're going back to the 70s with the bite administration and we're going back to that as well uh the russians in central america they're already in venezuela this administration as we saw with the disaster that was the organization of american states has completely turned their back on the western hemisphere on our own backyard well you know who's there big time the chinese who control both sides of the panama canal now uh and uh now the russians so i mean it's just once again just a disaster after disaster on the foreign policy front from this administration final thing i hope back to the saudi trip the president can set aside his disdain of president trump his ego uh and and actually talk about the abraham accords he's going to israel after wouldn't it be great if we revived those amazing that amazing dialogue and had some kind of engagement between the united states the saudis and the israelis to start moving peace in the middle east forward again yep that's what i would be a very powerful alliance and that was a huge breakthrough agreement reported on all sides thank you very much congressman always good to see you congressman michael waltz

thank you mr chairman and i apologize um for being a few minutes late before i begin my opening and then going to the to the questions um i just want to acknowledge that today has been a pretty good day in terms of advancing good legislation for for uh native people everywhere particularly our vulnerable women and children with the the ceremony that was at the white house today that you and i were able to be at with our staffs i think it is a recognition of the good work from this committee that this tribal title was a significant part of vawa and i want to give public credit to your team led by jennifer and to our team led by amber and and lucy working on the vawa side it was significant and again worthy of celebration so thank you for that thank you very much vice chair i said something similar not as eloquently earlier but i'll just note that in that room the thing that caused the whole crowd to erupt and goosebumps up and down my spine and neck was when president biden talked about the provisions that we all collectively authored and i mean that in the most collective sense of this this is a real accomplishment for native people across the country and you could feel it in that room so thank you for your leadership as well no good team partnership thank you so this is a good hearing also this is again just more opportunity to focus on on some of the progress that has been made um looking at the state of native economies what we can do to support buying native american i think we we recognize we've seen some good economic growth in the last few decades i'm very proud particularly in alaska of the progress that some of our tribal entrepreneurs and alaska native corporation leaders have made in growing not only alaska's economy but the american economy in alaska nine of the top ten companies are our ancs alaska native corporations they have succeeded economically while still upholding native values which is absolutely key but i think we know that this economic prosperity is not even across uh indian country there's still many barriers and and the opportunity for us to discuss with those barriers and figure out how we move beyond them is is why we're here but the barriers are everything from lack of access to capital uh supporting infrastructure and markets and in order to see continued economic improvements in native communities the role that we have here is to step up work with native businesses to break down the barriers so i think this hearing is particularly timely given that the omnibus was just signed yesterday the bipartisan infrastructure bill was just recently signed by the president we had our energy act of 2020 that is now law all of these are are significant pieces in supporting sustainable tribal economic development and growing native businesses so we're we're looking forward to many of the the um advantages that we're going to be seeing from the infrastructure bill whether it's the broadband the water and wastewater there's just so much there but i think as we are as we are learning the passing the law is the first step is the implementation and making sure that um that american indian alaska native native hawaiian businesses and communities are treated as partners as we move forward is going to be important so i'm glad that we have the administration witnesses with us today i hope that you'll have an opportunity to hear from those who are part of the second panel again for their input um just before i turn to my questions just let me make a little bit of a comment about energy according to the energy information agency rural residents and villages in alaska pay exponentially higher rates for electricity with some rates reaching over a dollar kilowatt kilowatt hour or about 800 percent higher than the national average and i will just share with you there's a great deal of concern right now um in many many many of the uh villages around the state of alaska their their fuel supplies come twice a year they come by barge they come with a spring barge and they come with a fall barge and so the prices are set when when that fuel is purchased at that point in the season so right now the villages haven't been impacted by the increasing price of a fuel it has with the cost of goods and airplane travel but it hasn't translated to what they're paying when they go to get fuel for their their their snow machine um uh uh four-wheeler um and and soon-to-be boats but when that spring barge comes they're locking in fuel at at the prices that we are seeing today which we all know are are just gut wrenching and so the prices that i'm speaking to the rates that people are paying per kilowatt hour you add on that the the now higher price of fuel and even if things should settle down they're still locked in to that fuel until the next barge comes so that's the reality of so many of the communities in in rural alaska um we do have some great news stories though and we're going to be able to hear from that uh hear from from gary hennig on the second panel out of king cove king cove actually has had a good news day today because we got some good news out of the ninth circuit today which is great but gary's going to talk to us about the communities hydroelectric projects that have enabled this primarily alley community to bring their energy costs down to largely get off diesel we're all looking for ways to how do we reduce our emissions how do we deal with climate change well you got to get off diesel power generation first so it's innovations and initiatives like the projects that we're seeing in king cove that recognize the importance of valuing a local community's input in the planning and the administration of their natural resources so i think king cove serves as a great example to our federal witnesses of the important role that local input plays in decisions regarding involving natural resource management and enabling the communities to implement their own energy visions so ms johns let me just stick with you for just a moment here since i'm talking about energy and we've we've mentioned that we were able to amend the energy policy act loan guarantee program as part of the omnibus to eliminate this barrier to its use allow applicants to receive direct funding from the federal financing bank and treasury this should hopefully open up capital lower interest rates for energy projects people are are looking forward to that but where there's a concern is all right you've got this big bureaucracy back here in washington dc you say you've removed these barriers can you tell me how or if your office works with does loan programs to ensure that tribal producers that are interested in developing energy on their lands don't get lost in this kind of back and forth departmental shuffle thank you for your question senator murkowski it's a great question because it's with lpo um our alum programs office at department of energy we work closely on coordinating efforts with tribes and doing outreach our office um has a lot of connections with tribes and um i'm excited about this new language in in the bill that will allow direct loans uh for tribes to apply for and we have identified the barriers we held a listening session last may both lpo and our office around some of the challenges that indian tribes are facing but also ancs and um but we hope to you know this could unlock a lot of potential are you working with a doe loan program yes as well okay good let let me turn to you um miss sims hip and and i appreciate uh appreciate your comments about the food security uh initiatives um a couple questions for you the 2018 farm bill extends 638 contracting authority under isdia to usda through a couple demonstration projects and the alaska native tribal health consortium was selected as one of the participants for this pilot which we think is great the first thing that they did was to replace farm raised catfish we don't grow catfish we don't raise catfish in alaska the catfish was flown to alaska from across the country and and placed as part of these um food uh food baskets if you food packages if you will so the first thing they do is say that's crazy we've got some of the best fish here so what they did is they replaced it with alaskan halibut that's harvested and processed by by sonic tribal enterprise fabulous makes total sense what doesn't make total sense is we're told that anthc is only authorized to supplant items within the food packages so what they've said to us is if they have more authority to include in these food packages things that make sense from within the region um they're they can select more more goods from alaskan goods from tribal vendors so is this accurate that they don't have the flexibility to to really make these food packages not only more more local support the local vendors but also for heaven's sakes if we're worried about emissions why are we flying catfish from somewhere in the south to uh to people who have some of the finest wild uh sources of protein in in the world so can you tell me if we do have some flexibility and if we don't what more we can do to get it well i'm very happy that you brought that program up because it's one of the i believe one of the most important things that this committee was able to influence in the last farm bill the 638 authority that was pushed into the food and nutrition service with regard to the food distribution program that you mentioned has been able to actually put funding towards all of the projects that were that applied for the funding at the tribal level all eight were funded and what we're seeing now is exactly what you pointed out we're seeing the places where we can be informed by exactly the foods that are around the tribes that are actually using that program and how it can inform the changes that we can make internally that would adjust that you have the flexibility i believe that we i believe that we have some flexibility but i believe it to be a very complicated flexibility will you just commit to work with us on this we want to make it work but but it it doesn't make sense if you are if what we're trying to do is is build about um you know tribal empowerment here uh help local economies deal with food security and oh by the way reduce our emissions it seems to me that we just need to be communicating a little bit better and i'd i'd like to think that uh you'd be willing to work with us on that absolutely mr chairman i know we've got limited time i've got more questions but let's let's turn back over to you please thank you vice chair

welcome back last month president Trump shocked the political world and infuriated some Republicans by striking deals with Chuck and Nancy Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California one was on immigration apparently we don't know if that deal is still active and the other was to provide hurricane relief money for Texas and to fund the government for another 90 days is this the beginning of a beautiful friendship or a one-time-only moment in a gridlocked Washington well joining me now is House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi welcome back to Meet the Press good morning my pleasure to be here before it get to the business side of Washington look you will you represent San Francisco the Golden State Warriors Steph Curry at the center of this along with Colin Kaepernick the former San Francisco 49er I know this is more high topic of mind perhaps in your district I imagine I know where you are and when the president's comments on this what would you like him to try to do if you think he would do it I'd like him to do what he said it did he would do when he ran and when he was inaugurated to bring people together he should see this as an opportunity somebody a conquering comprar neck doing what he did says this flag enables me to do this this national anthem enables me to do this this is about freedom of expression instead of resorting to what he is doing now it's unfortunate I think he was ill-advised if advised it all to go down this path sports have always been a great unifier I've always said sports and the arts will bring America together it's where we put our distant differences aside let's not let's not have the President of the United States do anything but bring people together do you think we regardless of whether you think it's the right politics do you do you see the political strategy in this well they you gave a list of the examples of how the president has been shall we say exploitive up certain divisions in our country when it comes to it comes to race I would hope that he would transition from that and understand that he has a different responsibility than feeding red meat to his base he has he has unclean hands comes to this discussion too because of what he he did after a Charlottesville and and the other examples that you gave what do you say to the activists on the left the person who really is angry at President Trump who says don't work with him at all you you you've you're you've you're working with him does this ever give you pause well let me just say this I a speaker and as Minority Leader first and then a speaker worked very closely with President Bush what could be worse than taking us into the war in Iraq on the basis of a false premise isn't that one of the worst thing that's ever happened in our country and yet when we could work with him on the biggest energy bill in the history of our country helping with a refundable tax credits for poor families PEPFAR AIDS drugs to save lives throughout the world there's a long list of things we did working together even though I drastically disagreed with him on the war in Iraq so none of this will none of this gives you pause by working with President Trump one by one it's one issue at a time and we don't know what the next issue might be where we can find common ground I do believe as leaders we have a as an advocate I'd probably be saying the same thing as a leader we have responsibility to try to find common ground stand our ground where we can't but we have important challenges in our country that we have to address and if we can find that path I think we should do that I want to get into the details of the promise that you feel like you extracted from him on daca yes tell me what that promise is what what is this compromise bill going to look like in your view well we haven't seen the whole bill but what the piece of it on immigrant Chuck in Chuck Schumer leaders humor and I yeah everybody's telling each other by first name six days right anyway well respected they call him leader Chuck Schumer I so proud of his leadership in it what we agreed with the President on was that the basic bill would be the DREAM Act this is a bill introduced and has nearly 200 co-sponsors by congresswoman Lucille roybal-allard it is a bill that we will take forward and it it is the bill that we all support what was in to be determined was if and what there would be in terms of border security but the essence of the bill was what the president committed and that's I mean we trust him to owner he committed to a pathway to citizenship for these risk doctoral recipients he committed to that now mind you the paso de citizen is an earned pathway that is way down the road right but some people think there should be no path at all that it permanently cut off you believe the president agreed to to a pathway to citizenship with this DREAM Act that is what is contained in the DREAM Act yes and you think he will keep his word on this that's what he said what makes you trust oh well we'll see well I trust him on it I am concerned about what he might come up with in terms of border security and the rest of that but we have said no wall mm-hmm the DREAM Act no wall and as long as we understand it's the DREAM Act and no war what else do you ask you something the press became of the wall the President on Friday right started describing the wall as the following it's not there's some parts of it that are already there there are sometimes there'll be natural barriers you don't need a full wall and oh by the way it's going to be see-through I could tell you gave me that definition I'd say oh that's a fence does that make you feel better now about where he's going with the wall that he's outlining a fence that actually won't be the entire 2,000 miles no I doesn't but I'm more concerned about what they do in terms of enforcement you know we've said to them when we protect the dreamers we don't use them as a target to go after their parents so we want to say that the prosecutorial discretion that you might use in terms of deportation does not use status as that immigration status as a crime and that if somebody commits a felony or this or that then you couldn't so those are the issues that are more of a concern then his backing off of a wall we're not supporting a wall okay if this Dhaka deal does happen the way you described it within the vicinity definition what's what is the next item you think is realistic that you could work with the President on within the immigration no the next any piece what's the next is it healthcare is it is a tax reform is there some other thing is an infrastructure what is next that you would be willing I would say it is the pressure right from the sir infrastructure has never been a bipartisan issue we've always worked together we work regionally you know in terms of people coming together in regions for different things and it is absolutely necessary will create good-paying jobs every place in the country for everyone and we need infrastructure improvement in that way he's talked about it during the campaign we don't want it to be a tax break for some friends at the exposed as an infrastructure that's something you're going at the table with him on this to at least see I think we have a great deal of common ground there Dhaka before the end of the calendar year Dhaka before Christmas you have to yeah I really so we have we have that path I would like to see it within the next few weeks but certainly before we leave all right House Democratic Leader night supposed to thanks for coming in my pleasure appreciate you when we come back the national anthem has been played at the first NFL game of the day it's in London

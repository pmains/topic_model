Minnesota joins us right now alive from the Russell rotunda what's she doing well first of all Merry Christmas Steve and apparently she's not gonna you know gift wrap that little package and Senator over the Senate right away you know this has been a completely political exercise from the get-go I guess she has some kind of political strategy here it seems kind of stupid to me but so I have no idea what she's what she's doing here withholding the articles that they're highly flawed in any event and well you know you're you're right by the way the senator is from Wisconsin not Minnesota apologies but apparently we had the judge on a little while ago senator and and he said it's not up to her she doesn't get to write the rules for this in it and she's got to send him right over well that I really can't comment on when we get those articles then then our rules start kicking in but delegate those articles I'm not sure there's anything we're gonna do okay yesterday in in front of your committee the Inspector General Michael Horowitz appeared and it became very clear that the FBI's got a lot of explaining to do right it really does when you combine basically the the underscoring of the 17 inaccuracies and omissions you know how serious that was combined with the the stunning rebuke by the presiding judge of the FISA Court you know Steve you know one mistake or omission I mean yeah that's a mistake too maybe it's a coincidence the three you're starting to develop a pattern 17 it's a legitimate question I mean is that a plot and we still have the answers of that but you know also the Inspector General you know we really talked about the fact that you know that one statement that he had no testimonial or documentary evidence that bias affected decisions he admitted there was bias there was political motivation he just doesn't have evidence where he can conclusively say it cause it influenced their decisions but again it's up to the American public to infer what all that bias you know how that could have affected things and we also saw that the little cabal I know that Lisa Paige and Peter struck you know pooed the fact when they use the phrase secret society didn't apply but there's certainly a little cabal between Andrew McCabe Peter strike and Lisa Paige well and we hope that the investigator mr. Durham gets to the bottom of it because there's still a lot of questions we have Senator Ron Johnson from the great state of Wisconsin senator thank you very much and Merry Christmas merry Christmas to you

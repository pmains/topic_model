welcome as the chair point of our committee points out you were required to be independent and accountable you are also required to be tall and short your opening statement pointless mentions great exports but you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by sixty billion dollars in the last year and I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit and when and that's why we elected that's why the country elected Donald Trump president now the chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017 he's right we had Obama's fiscal policies Obama's tax policies Obamacare dodd-frank Janet yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet we had a great year as a matter of fact we've been on a roll since 2011 we were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we'd have a labor shortage and higher wages we were going well and so instead of continuing to be on a roll we've abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy throwing away the budget caps 1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill but I think that we will still do well because our scientists our entrepreneurs and our workers are the best in the world and they'll make up for all the mistakes we're making here in Washington I see behind you sir the green shirts that call for full employment and it's not enough to go with the economists definition of full employment say 4% we need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor and that is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for two percent but two and a half percent inflation that's the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now now when we talk about some workers getting $1,000 bonus yeah few have but a family of fives share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000 what greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country then that some charlatan can say here's the deal I'll give you a thousand dollars it's money in your pocket and we'll just slap a twenty six thousand dollar mortgage on your future now chairman Paulo in your canoe in your confirmation hearings you said that I believe that no bank is any longer too big to fail I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail they would pull the entire economy down we had to bail him out with 700 billion dollars and I'd point out that the wall street prices in to the value of the bank stock but more importantly to the value of their unsecured debt an implicit federal guarantee an assumption that they will be bailed out so I have a number of questions for the record but I will actually ask one for you Ted to respond to we've adopted these profligate fiscal policies huge tax cuts leading to a massive increase in the deficit number that's right behind you then we busted the budget caps as is our monetary policy going to need to be more restrictive this year then it would have been had we not adopted these profligate fiscal and tax policies thank you so of course when we're setting monetary policy were focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment and doing that we consider many many factors all around the global economy etc fiscal policy changes can't have an effect and changes of this size can have an effect and and that can be seen of course in the path of policy it's very hard to say in advance what that would be but the answer of your question is generally we take all those things into account so the more profligate the fiscal and tax policies the higher the interest rates you need to set all other things being equal I would just say our our own job is to focus not on fiscal policy but on monetary policy and that so that's our frame of reference thank you for evading my question time of the gentleman has expired

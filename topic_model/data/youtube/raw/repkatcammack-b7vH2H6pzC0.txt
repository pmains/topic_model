chair calls on the Joe woman from Florida thank you Mr chairman thank you to our Witnesses for being Troopers we are an hour six of the of the committee so thank you for your diligence persistence and endurance um but speaking of endurance our economy needs some endurance and that can only be provided through a reliable domestic production of energy so I'm so excited this is our first hearing our first topic um it goes without saying I think regardless if you're Republican or Democrat we are an energy economy everything begins and ends with energy so I'm excited for all the discussions that we've had today I am the author of The reigns act which seeks to rein in the regulatory environment which costs our economy 2 trillion dollars a year uh you can look no further than the work that is being done at doe or at ferc or others at where this has been an ever-growing present so I'm going to go down the line if you guys can keep them short because I do have a follow-up question to all our Witnesses but I'll start with you Mr McNally give me one regulation that we can take off the books that would help unleash domestic production of energy and bring down costs of energy in America just one take off or reform it would be NEPA nepa's the the Taproot of all the problems if fix NEPA and you fix a whole lot of things I think we've talked about unleashing some of the clean renewable energy that's tied up and we need more transmission for that what regulation specifically uh that um in I think ferc is doing some rulemaking right now um that will look at their um Regional planning and I think that Improvement will bring a lot of new transmission building okay um our country thank you Miss Jackson which by the way you've had remarkable quotes today I've actually written a number of them down so thank you for your testimony today well I'm going to say and I don't know if this have the regulation correct but I would say make reform the permanent reform so that we can have more uh energy production doesn't matter how many leases you have if you can't get the permit is useless certainty certainty in government it's a novel concept I know I'll also go with NEPA I think we need to clear out the litigation that's back that this uh standards that have been built up and only you could clear out all that perfect thank you uh and and it goes right back to you uh Mr dabar we we need to put energy security back at the center of our energy policy both for our International Security but also for our allies my question to you is an element of Ip theft and China you were at the department of energy during the Thousand talents program cracked down concerning Chinese researchers gaining access to intellectual property and other sensitive security information and now you're also involved in a Cutting Edge Quantum technology exploration What specifically can we do should we do to protect our secrets and other sensitive information from the Chinese Communist party and how will this effort benefit our own technological development well with a spin out of Caltech that if there's a certain member here I think may also have went to uh earlier um uh the reality is the the Chinese have a vast amount of uh effort for stealing Technologies from National Labs that I caught when I showed up at doe there was a significant amount of technology that was being appropriated legally because we had no regulation on the interaction uh but also at universities uh and uh so when I was a doe we rolled out four orders to to limit that and I'll give you one example of something that I think should be applied to other other areas in addition to doe is that we banned uh grant money the American taxpayer money going to University researchers who were also at the same time Talent program members for the Chinese Communist party we said the American taxpayer money should not go to those people who are also working for them seems a little too common sense if you ask me well and I'm sorry I cut you off but to that point I mean uh you have the Thousand talents program you have the Confucius institutes on on college campuses I mean is there something specifically a database that we're tracking or is it simply just not on the books or has it been done by executive order on the connection between thousand talents and issues of National Security Programs that we're working on yeah it's basically been a few agencies that have done it and that's it I would recommend that this Congress take a look at the best practices for what's been done um At Doe and some others a DOD because at NSF at nist the Federal Reserve has has Chinese wow

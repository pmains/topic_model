JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT TODAY'S VERDICT AND THE INVESTIGATION IS CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY, THIS DATES BACK TO THE CIVIL WAR ERA, BASICALLY PROSECUTING PEOPLE FOR MAKING MORE, LEVYING WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. IT IS RARELY PROSECUTED, EVEN MUCH MORE RARELY CONVICTED. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT TWO PEOPLE WERE CONVICTED OF IT TODAY? REP. SCHIFF: IT IS A HUGE VICTORY FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND I THINK A VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE ELEMENTS OF THAT CRIME ARE ENORMOUS SLEAZY AREAS. IT INVOLVES THE USE OF FORCE TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE WITH THE LAWFUL FUNCTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOT OFTEN USED AS A CHARGE, AND I THINK IT WILL HAVE BIG IMPACTS NOT ONLY IN VALIDATING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S PROSECUTIONS, BUT ALSO THERE IS ANOTHER TRIAL COMING UP OF A DIFFERENT WHITE NATIONALIST GROUP. THOSE PROUD BOY DEFENDANTS FACING TRIAL NOW SEE THE CONVICTION OF THESE OATH KEEPERS. IT MAY GET SOME OF THEM TO PLEAD GUILTY AND COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. BIG VICTORY FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THIS CASE AND IT MAY LEAD TO OTHER VICTORIES AS WELL. MARC: WHAT SORT OF PENALTY DOES THIS STATUTE CARRY? REP. SCHIFF: THEY COULD FACE YEARS IN PRISON FOR THIS. THIS WILL BE REALLY THE FIRST CONVICTION I THINK OF SOMEONE WHO WENT TO TRIAL UNDER THESE CHARGES, AND THAT TOO WILL HAVE A PRECEDENTAL IMPACT. WITH THE MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS, BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHER STATUTES THAT THEY WERE ALSO CONVICTED OF VIOLATING, THE INTERFERENCE WITH LAWFUL PROCEEDINGS, SOME WERE CONVICTED OF OTHER CHARGES INCLUDING PHYSICAL ASSAULT ON THE FACILITIES. DEPENDING ON WHETHER THERE ARE CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES OR CONCURRENT, THEY COULD BE FACING A LOT OF TIME. MARC: BASED ON YOUR WORK WITH THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE AND WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THROUGH THE SWORN TESTIMONY YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO AND DETAILING, WHAT INDICATIONS ARE THERE THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE HIRE WITHIN THE FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OR PERHAPS THE FORMER PRESIDENT HIMSELF, WHAT SORT OF LEGAL JEOPARDY THEY MAY BE FACING BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED? REP. SCHIFF: THEY COULD FACE VERY SERIOUS JEOPARDY. THERE IS A STATUTE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAKES IT A CRIME TO COMMIT INSURRECTION. AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT TO GIVE AID AND COMFORT TO OTHERS WHO DO. CERTAINLY, I THINK THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF HIGHER UPS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY CRIMINALLY EXPOSED UNDER THAT STATUTE. BUT AS FEDERAL JUDGE DAVID CARTER IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY FOUND, LOOKING AT A NARROW SET OF EVIDENCE, THE FORMER PRESIDENT HIMSELF, THERE IS EVIDENCE HE VIOLATED THE LAW BY CONSPIRING TO INTERFERE WITH THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS. THERE IS A LOT OF EXPOSURE GOING UP TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT. MARC: CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

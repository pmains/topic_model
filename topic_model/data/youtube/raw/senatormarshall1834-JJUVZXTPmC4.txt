in its entirety earlier this week so we're joined now by Republican Congressman Roger Marshall who is also a physician so congressman it is great to have your expertise on that as well good morning good morning Allison how you doing I'm doing well so I know that you met with the president this month about health care so share with us what the plan is well I think first of all the president emphasized that we have to embrace pre-existing conditions that he would not sign any type of healthcare that doesn't take care of pre-existing conditions and not only that he talked about taking care of the 28 million people that still don't have health care coverage so very much the president's in tune to this we talked about the real problem which is the cost of health care and we talked about ways we can start driving that cost of health care down okay so how do you cover people with pre-existing conditions and the 28 million who you say still need insurance what's the plan for monetarily making that work yeah I think first of all I'm looking at the big picture I think America has a very clear choice that both Democrats and Republicans want to repeal Obamacare the question is why do we why do we place in substitution for it the Democrats want Medicare for all which would be the rune of Medicare as we know it but our solution will put patients and families in charge of their health care so anything that we can do to drive those decisions locally to patients and family members will start driving the cost of health care down and allow more people more access to health care well not all Democrats want Medicare for all and not all Democrats want to repeal Obamacare but what I hear most Democrats say is they want to improve upon it why throw out the entire Affordable Care Act before there's a plan where it will leave people not covered it will leave people with pre-existing conditions scrambling for medical for insurance you know I'm sorry but I think that's a false narrative we do have plans we have a year probably this court case will take a year to go through we have several plans right now that would take care of that situation do those have names I mean I'm just curious because do we know those sensors is this the Graham Cassidy plan hey absolutely we have several names to choose from so that so as dr. Cassidy and Senator Graham's plan would be one of them Bruce Westerman introduced a wonderful piece of legislation in the past couple months as well the Republican Study Committee is working on legislation they had some legislation from two years ago we've been working very hard with the president and his staff to improve it so absolutely but if I could just say one thing you say that some Democrats don't want Medicare for all but this election in 2020 is going to be all about just that President Trump will be reelected because he wants to get patients and families choices but every major presidential candidate on the Democrat side wants Medicare for all so I do think America has very much a binary choice over this issue yeah I mean I guess that the reason that it's hard to understand where the Republicans are with this is because you tried before when you when you controlled both houses of Congress and it didn't work so whatever the Republican plan was be a graham Cassidy or anything it didn't work and now you don't control the house and it doesn't sound like Democrats are willing to sign on to things that we just give States block grants to do whatever they wanted with the money and not guarantee it for people with pre-existing conditions you know I think that's the beauty of President Trump's plan is as we go forward he's basically putting a gun at our head and saying look you have to fix this we cannot keep going in the direction we've been going the Democrats are going to have to work with publicans I do think there's that opportunity I've sat down with most every Democrat in the House that has health care experience and talking about solutions so those solutions were actually very very close to solutions but sometimes it just takes an impetus to push this over the ledge and say let's do something together here let's fix this problem but if that doesn't happen in 2020 this presidential election is going to all be about medicare-for-all versus choices for families and patients I just want to move on for one second - the Muller report because you've been tweeting a lot about it of course you haven't seen the Muller report nor have I nor has anyone yet but you seem to feel quite confident that it won't reveal anything what if there is something embarrassing in however many pages when once it alternately comes out well I think that's kind of a crazy narrative as well look every Democrat all the major news station said Miller is the man he's going to give a great report he had the unlimited resources he spent fifty thousand dollars a day I think that if there was anything there he would have showed it was the most expensive nothing burger in American history I mean it was twenty as I understand that it was something like twenty five million dollars but obviously the star report cost more I mean there was there are American history examples of things that cost more but but more importantly you know that there are all sorts of property seizures and fines where they might recoup much of that money so I know that you seem you have on Twitter talked a lot about the expense of this but it's possible that the government's going to get back a lot of that expense yeah we can only hope so but people back home want to know how can we spend fifty thousand dollars a day that's incredible that we could spend that much money and we really know nothing more today than we knew when this whole product when this whole investigation this witch-hunt started so it's just very frustrating that we have frozen America over a false narrative for two years when we could have solved healthcare when we could have built a wall when we could have fixed immigration there's so many great things we could have done but this single issue is taking all the oxygen out of the room in Washington DC you hold on a second you think that because of the Muller report that's why the wall hasn't been built that's why health care hasn't been solved I think it's a great deal of it because this single issue takes up all the home and all the oxygen and see I'd never been to a place that couldn't do two or three things at one time but this issue has kept the Democrats on this witch hunt and we've been sitting here without any cooperation working back with this so absolutely this took all the air out of the room what what about infrastructure week could you have accomplished that I think it would have been very possible I think all along that President Trump has wanted a strong infrastructure plan it's on his to-do list it's on my to-do list and again I worked very hard across the aisle but we can't start talking about a major infrastructure plan in committee until we get this Muller investigation behind us can we please move on I'd love to fix infrastructure as well as soon as we get to see the Muller report I think it will be easier to move on but Congressman Roger Marshall thank you very much for coming on with your perspective and medical expertise thanks so much let's solve healthcare

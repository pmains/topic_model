and he was instrumental in seeing that legislation passed as part of the FDA bill that was act that was voted out on the house side I think 385 25 an amazing accomplishment and as many of you know it only been one drug developed for children with cancer in the past 20 years and that's not acceptable three Mike look calls dedication to service and the needs of children with cancer and the survivors is why the children's cause is proud to recognize congressman would call as a 2012 congressional champion for children right here yeah basically Maureen thank you so much and Susan winter thank you for your dedication to the cause and what you do with children's cause you know night's episode we're not on behalf of myself and on behalf of the kids that I see all the time that you see all the time to combat this disease it's number one killer of children in fact my wife came down when the bill passed overwhelmingly she said who were those five people that voted against it cuz I'm taking names and women don't forget she does all my opponents very well so it's at his a real honor because I got involved in this we started the childhood cancer caucus several terms ago but we're trying to look for a legislative result something tangible I know we Jackie Spears night introduced the survivorship act a bill that I know you've been so involved with with the children's cause i want to thank you for that but as i go through the hospital's yeah my best friend grown-up died from leukemia back when it was completely fatal back then but as i would go through the hospital's md anderson my wife's on the board chairs a childhood cancer committee and that you just is so heart-wrenching and you want to do something about it and that as you mentioned morning we haven't developed a drug since the 1980s which is really shameful and when that came to my attention i began to talk more about this issue how could we let that happen and how could we let these children die in a market failure we talked to the drug companies well it's a market fit but we can't make money off these drugs we are fortunate that the carolyn price walker walker price bill that was passed 30 million dollars towards childhood cancer but boom who types them this creating hope act i think will fundamentally change transform the way drug companies look at this Luka childhood cancer and it's the first childhood cancer drug bill ever passed in history of Congress I asked you to champion this in the Senate I talked to Senator Enzi today who's ranking member on the health subcommittee we had Scott Brown and Senator Casey also champion this bill in the house sign so anything you can do in your efforts on the Senate side we have I think relatively good assurances that this will well it's in the house bills down the Senate bill we do think it will get through the Senate and go to the presents desk for signature and it will change things by the way it works is essentially if a drug company develops a childhood cancer drug they will get a voucher for another drag that they're developing that voucher will put the other drug at the front of the line in the FDA so in a time of you tough budgetary constraints it doesn't cost anything but it greatly incentivizes the pharmaceutical companies to finally start taking a look it's some of these rare pediatric diseases and it applies to all rare pediatric diseases not just cancer movie so I'm very optimistic I think this is this is really great news for the childhood cancer advocacy groups and I want to thank you for what you do every day as volunteers and coming to the hill we and we have our childhood cancer caucus summit every September which is childhood cancer month I encourage all of you to come to that it's quite quite a experience and I think we'll have something really to celebrate this next time around but I encourage you to do it because what you do is again you give these children the don't have lobbyists but don't have the power backing behind a lot of these special interest have you give them a voice and I think the creating health bag will give them a very strong voice with the pharmaceutical companies and the drug companies and I look forward to seeing the spill pass and be signed into law by the president very very excited about that I just want to close by it with it I've never seen a bill that got both the ron paul and nancy pelosi to co-sponsor and the way we did that we weren't stupid we Lobby very hard and I went to individual offices I think Mike would always said that we had about 185 co-sponsors I worked this bill harder than any other villain ever worked in the Congress to get co-sponsors and we took a the 14 year old her name is Brianna and she's a childhood cancer survivor she's a national spokesman one for the cause one of the most mature of 14 year olds I've ever met my life and you know I said you know what I want you to introduce the bill and so we let her introduce the bill now is for and I had to pretend like she was my daughter that's the one way I could get her on floor like alanine about it but and then we we turned her in our secret weapon and my wife is a secret weapon by think Briana we would introduce her to members economy so will you please co-sponsor this childhood cancer bill very very difficult to say no particularly to a survivor and I saw Nancy Pelosi said you know that's a big fish if you can get that one bring me really in shape and sure she said white I don't normally co-sponsor bills and she likes it Briana she looked at me she goes okay good it was a great day my dad always told me he it was a as we celebrate da the invasion now he was a World War two veteran 435 missions on a b-17 over Europe and nearly greatest generation and his example of his generation example taught me that it's important to hand out a better country a better America to the next generation at a time when subsea the nation and decline I remain the optimist that our best years are yet ahead there was a poll taken out that said sixty percent of americans think the American Dream is not achievable but I think we can hand down a better country to the next and we owe it to our children I have five children including triples this is a lot of work but it is very rewarding and it got a bit if one of them came down with cancer one and when I see the kids with the needles and the pain in the hospitals as all of y'all have it it just breaks your heart and so we want to hand down a new to a new generation of Americans a country where children will not have to suffer from this dreaded disease and that is my goal one day maybe in our lifetime we can really eradicate this terrible disease so I want to close with with Briana she her mother told that her about the bill she's in class that day we added to write a little excuse for her to get out of school to lobby the pho on the floor but she sent me a 10 email and she says hello mr. McCall it's Breanna my mom takes to me in school today saying that the crating hope act was finally passed woohoo yay I was so excited I literally screamed in class I couldn't stop smiling and telling everyone about it thank you so much for allowing me to be a small part of this it was really an amazing experience and I will never forget it I guess not many kids can say they help to pass a bill can't wait to see you at the cancer caucus in September much love Briana now we do a lot of stuff up here that doesn't really mean a lot and we spent our wheels passing bills that don't go anywhere every now and then you get an opportunity to really make a difference in the lives of others and I consider this to be one of those moments and for that I thank you for advocate for the kids for calling this issue to members attention and for your strong supporters of this legislation thank you so much

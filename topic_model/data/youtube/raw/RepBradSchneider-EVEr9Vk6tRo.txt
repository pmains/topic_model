Thank You Mr. Chairman and thank you Mr. Secretary for joining us today As others have, I want to touch very
briefly on the coronavirus, picking up on something you said earlier when asked
about the test kits. You said, "they should be available quickly, very
quickly." My question is what specifically does that mean? Are we talking about
today, tomorrow, next week, this month next month? Very specifically when can we
expect to have the desperately-needed test kits into our communities?
MNUCHIN: Let me
just say I don't have any more information on this than what's been
publicly said by the professionals 
SCHNEIDER:In the meetings with the task force are you
talking any timeframe beyond soon? Soon could be this year, next year? 
MNUCHIN: Again I can
assure you this is the utmost importance so everybody recognizes this okay.
The health professionals talked about this yesterday I can't tell you if this
means okay gonna get that and I appreciate that but I reassure you that
everybody is working on this issue I appreciate that my request is when you
have today's taskforce meeting please ask them to share with our communities
when they can expect to have these tests there are too many stories of people
being left without them but right orally MNUCHIN:I will try to encourage them today in
the press conference to give their best guess on time okay. SCHNEIDER: And I think the best
thing we can do for our markets as others have said is make sure there's a
coordinated effort across the agencies across government so that we understand
giving confidence that everyone is working together and very the more
specifics I think the better. Let me switch now to the IRS and and funding
within the IRS specifically the responsibilities the IRS to ensure that
our tax code is fully and fairly enforced doing so requires the
sufficient number of people the training the tools to help them do their job it
requires resources in fact it's stated in the President's budget that for every
dollar we invest in enforcement we get five dollars back from that enforcement
my concern is if the president budget does not provide sufficient funding to
be effective meaning that the law is neither fully nor fairly enforced and
ultimately the government and law-abiding taxpayers are left holding
the bag at the cost of billions of dollars
the IRS funding currently it's below the level from ten
years ago not only that is and if you add inflation it's even more so though
this year's budget does have a slight increase in dollar value it calls for
the elimination of twelve hundred people from the IRA IRS the National Taxpayer
Advocate in the 2020 purple book growth quote largely as a result of these
budget reductions the IRS is neither providing top-quality service nor
enforcing the law with fairness to all and the budget notes that reductions and
enforcement staffing in the last decade quote likely reduce total enforcement
revenue collected by around seventy billion dollars end quote let me repeat
that seventy billion dollars lost the thing is we know that it is a good
investment we know as the President's budget says that for every dollar
invested we get five dollars back I'm concerned that the IRF doesn't have
enough the IRS doesn't have enough revenue agents with the expertise and
tools to conduct the audits of complex returns or audits of large organizations
that may be abusing the tax-exempt status can you share commit to working
with me to ensure that we hold these tax exempt organizations and other
organizations to make sure they're not abusing the system and are fully of
complying with the law yes absolutely and I can't comment on the cut from ten
years ago but I can tell you every year I've since I've been here we've been
asked for more money on enforcement and more importantly more money for
technology on on enforcement yes it's not just its people it's training its
tools that's critical but we are below we were ten years ago that's been a
long-term process and we were still below that and calling for elimination
of 1,200 people at a time where enforcement can bring in the necessary
dollars we need for our our budget to cut the deficit and make sure that the
tax code is fully and fairly enforced I think is important with that I yield
back thank you gentlemen let me recognize the gentleman from Ohio

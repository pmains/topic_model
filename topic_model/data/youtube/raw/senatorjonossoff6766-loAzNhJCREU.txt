thank you mr secretary i'd like to ask you a couple questions uh about infrastructure and transit in metro atlanta first about the marta system and then about the beltline project as you well know and as we've discussed since the mid-1960s marta has been helping folks get around metro atlanta but particularly as the pace of growth of the metro area has risen in the last couple of decades we've chronically under invested in this vital transit system there is great interest in expanding bus rapid transit to connect for example destinations in clayton and dekalb and gwinnett counties also discussed rail extensions will you commit to working with my office the city of atlanta and relevant regional planning authorities in the state of georgia to develop a comprehensive plan to strengthen and expand mardis service uh absolutely as as we've discussed both familiar routes and resources on in marta and new possibilities around bus rapid transit can do a lot to alleviate convention congestion expand opportunity and of course that has climate benefits and and air quality benefits too so we're always eager to find new ways to partner on that and again glad that the president's american jobs plan has the resources we need to allow local authorities not just to hold on to what they've got but to actually plan for the future and expand what's available to those they serve thank you mr secretary and touching on the beltline initiative you know there are over 150 infrastructure projects nationwide that reuse uh existing or abandoned infrastructure and transit infrastructure reimagining and re-utilizing this space to create new mobility and quality of life and the atlanta beltline seven of a 22-mile loop of former freight rail have already been transformed into a multi-use trail with transit capacity affordable housing parks and green space planned there's been more than 7.9 billion dollars in private investment in this initiative i'd like the federal government to get involved in helping to complete this project will you please meet with my office in coming weeks to discuss what we can do to advance completion of the beltline and i am so looking forward to welcoming you to georgia tomorrow and i think we'll have the opportunity to inspect it thank you that's really looking forward to a chance to see it in person welcome a chance to to connect with your office further on uh how to encourage development and and we take a lot of pride in the federal dollars i think in the tiger program that uh went into helping establish the earlier phases of the beltline uh whenever you can reuse and repurpose resources like that as you mentioned it often can unlock private dollars that follow the public investments that have been made and of course we need to focus on making sure it's accessible that the housing that grows up around it is affordable and i know that uh that you've been emphatic about the importance of that and eager to see it for myself thank

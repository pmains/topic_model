chairwoman waters and thanks to our witnesses uh for joining us today uh congress really needs to better understand the great opportunities that your businesses are bringing to this country mr bankman freed i have several questions for you and would appreciate as much as you can quick answers so we can make the most of the time that we have ftx us offers crypto commodity derivatives products such as futures and options contracts to provide these products in the united states it's my understanding that ftx us has obtained at least four licenses from the cftc which you listed in your testimony that's correct do you know are there any additional licenses separate from those four listed in your testimony that are required by the cftc for ftx u.s derivatives to be fully compliant with u.s derivatives regulation i do not believe so i think that's correct and uh where does the price discovery sir for your cftc regulated crypto commodity derivatives contracts primarily come from so uh there's a very large number of market participants that um you know participating those there are hundreds of billions of dollars per day globally a volume um in similar products and uh like other markets you know we don't choose that pricing it's a market-based pricing that comes from you know a variety of liquidity buyers market making firms individual users and other people right and i mean i'll note that for bitcoin futures contracts that trade on the cme which is a cftc regulated exchange 100 of that pricing comes from five u.s crypto spot exchanges uh bitstamp coinbase gemini it bit and kraken we have seen disapproval letters from the sec on multiple bitcoin spot etf applications i don't know if you're aware of that uh the uh chair gensler's justification for not allowing bitcoin spot etfs to trade is his belief that bitcoin spot markets are quote vulnerable to fraud and manipulation now it's my understanding that ftx uses surveillance trade technology akin to the technology national securities exchanges use to protect investors and ensure sound spot markets what does this technology and any other tools ftx uses to protect the spot market from fraud and manipulation look like yeah so you know like other exchanges we do have these uh technologies in addition to the you know know your customer policies that we can identify individuals associated with trades we have surveillance for unusual trading activity we have manual inspections of anything that you know gets flagged either by the automated surveillance or by manual inspection um and we do this with the training activity with the deposits the withdrawals and everything else sounds like you're doing a lot to uh make sure there is no fraud or other manipulation i thank you mr bankman freed uh again for helping us understand the extensive guard rails a cryptocurrency exchange like ftx has in place to ensure sound crypto spot markets for investors the sec has approved several bitcoin futures etfs that get 100 of their pricing from u.s crypto spot markets so i guess i'm left incredibly confused by how the sec's concern over spot market vulnerability applies to bitcoin spot etfs when it doesn't apply to bitcoin futures etfs and by the way this is not a partisan issue i've been working closely with darren soto on our blockchain caucus co-chair on this very issue why because the bottom line is that americans deserve access to a wide diverse range of investment products they deserve to choose what investment vehicle they want to put their hard-earned money into but the sec is not providing americans this choice when it comes to crypto commodity f etfs for reasons again that just don't make a lot of sense especially after highlighting the extensive measures crypto exchanges take to protect their spot markets our strong crypto and web three markets have been have been uh uh in the united states uh have been giving the united states uh up incredible capital market success these markets are also teeing americans up for incredible capital formation opportunities but our regular regulators simply aren't capitalizing on the opportunity here and it's my constituents and all of your constituents who are taking the hit because of this and it must change again i want to thank the witnesses for being here i hope this is the first of many of these discussions we have as congress tries to put together a thoughtful light touch guide guide framework for the industry thank you i yield back thank you very

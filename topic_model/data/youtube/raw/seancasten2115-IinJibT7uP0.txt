hi I'm Shaun Caston representing the sixth District of Illinois and I'm hoping you'll consider making a contribution to us before our end of the quarter deadline I never thought I was going to be in this job I spent 20 years working as a clean energy entrepreneurs building companies and then Donald Trump happened and I knew I had to step up to do something bigger I flipped a seat that was Republican from 1972 to 2018 it was previously represented by people who were more afraid of the gun lobby than they were afraid of the fear that drives our children in schools it was represented by people who thought that a woman's right to choose should be held by a couple of dudes in Washington and it was held by people who thought it was somehow funny or responsible called climate change owes those same forces want to get this seat back I don't wanna give it to him our planet doesn't want to give it back to them and we need to make sure that we hold on to the seat with people who know that we are going to be judged by one thing and that's where our grandchildren are proud of us

um I think it's really important as I travel the district and I hear from Iowans about respect for taxpayers this is what my job is is to respect taxpayers stand up for Rural America and make sure you're safe and secure in your communities and the only way we do that is if we continue to put more money in your pocket and not grow the government which is what we saw happen through the last 18 20 months under speaker Pelosi and President Biden that spending has gotten out of control it's money we don't have that's the number one problem we have here my opponent will vote to raise your taxes she voted against a tax cut this year that was bipartisan in the Senate to not tax your retirement income I think more money should be in your pocket and we should be sending targeted resources to our states

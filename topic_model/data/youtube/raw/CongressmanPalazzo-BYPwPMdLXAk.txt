good morning thank you chairman isa and ranking member cummings and members for allowing me the privilege of introducing someone who i believe will provide your committee with the most credible testimony today i have experienced his leadership firsthand after the devastation of hurricane katrina and more recently the deep water horizon wolfsburg indeed no other governor has been as frequently challenged to rise to the occasion of leading the state during times of crisis whether man-made or natural and each time governor barbour shouldered the burden of leadership in a manner that calmed tempers committed broken hearts and resulted in incredible efficient outcomes to accomplish this he met each event with a balanced regime of compassion and order elaine fears the sense of loss with hope and the prospect of sword recovery i vividly remember the many times the governor and his beautiful wife marsha walked hand in hand with the victims and in the aftermath aftermath of it all assured them that everything was going to be all right more recently he continues to guide our state through historical floods in a severe tornado season he has not only left mississippi through the country's worst natural handmade man-made disaster but he challenged us to go back bigger and better he is a great leader in every sense of the word and of course i'm talking about mississippi's 63rd governor ali martin mr chairman as someone who represents the district devastated by the oil spill i appreciate you directing the committee to assess the recovery efforts of bp and the obama administration i would like to briefly mention that as someone who has worked offshore on drilling platforms i have a particular concern on how the administration came to the decision to institute a moratorium without conducting a study of how it will impact the gulf coast economy we know now that this thoughtless decision will decrease oil production about up to 250 000 barrels per day for the next two years a loss of production of this magnitude will continue to have a negative impact on the gulf coast economy for years to come studies conducted by louisiana state university but potential estimated job loss by the more important and subsequent permitorium in the gulf coast region at around 24 000. the ripple effect of these lost jobs and high energy prices hurts our national economy the majority of the jobs lost in mississippi are from the 4th congressional district of mississippi the district i represent i've worked offshore i know the value of the jobs of the offshore drilling industry you're buying i look forward to further investigation of the economic impact of the administration's decisions and the motivation i applaud the committee for the extensive work on this critical issue i look forward to hearing the testimony by the witnesses and the outcome of this important year and thank you again sharon island and the members for allowing me the honor of introducing governor amy

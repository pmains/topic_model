thank you mr chairman and again hello administrator regan um we really appreciate you spending this time with us and just just uh kind of following up on chairman pallone's line of questioning there there's i wanted to highlight some of the successes of the previous administration when you when you consider that and that the epa deleted all or parts of 27 sites from the superfund national priorities list and it was the largest number of deletions in two decades yes there's no more work to be done but this is this was a priority and we're and we must stay focused on getting results the epa delivered approximately 295 million in brownfield grants directly to communities and non-profits in need i know in spokane we've had a brownfield cleaned cleaned up and it's uh it's now just a it's it's a great contributor to our community the epa closed on 41 wifi loans which led to financing of 16.8 billion for water infrastructure creating more than 38 hundred jobs and saving ratepayers nearly four billion dollars there were management reforms such as thirty three percent improvement in on-time completion of inspections and a reduction in backlogged permits by a hundred and fifty you know the combined air pollution emissions fell more than seven percent even as the economy grew and i just highlight this because there we continue to build on this record of success um and accomplishments i believe that we need to stay focused on results we need to stay focused on making sure that we're spending money in a way that's actually going to get results and it's very important that we keep the processes and programs that produce these results in place the epa received 9.34 billion in roughly the last year for its standard fiscal year appropriations as well as the super the supplemental funding included in the supplemental funding is a hundred million dollars appropriated to the epa under the recent budget reconciliation bill this week senator capito and i sent you a letter requesting an accounting of that hundred million dollars appropriated to epa through reconciliation are you able to tell us today if that 100 million dollars has been spent and if so what have the funds been uh been spent on i will um i will circle with my staff i know that that request came in and i have not been briefed on that yet but we can get you those details okay okay thank you um i also i wanted to switch gears um a little bit on a matter that's important in my home state of washington and and that's cleaning up puget sound and i wanted to raise this issue with you this morning administrator regan you know i think we all agree that generally speaking it's better to limit pollution at the source rather than continuing to try to clean up efforts post pollution and i think that we agree that the the the deployment i hope we'd agree agree that carbon-free uh renewable reliable uh electric generation like hydropower is very important um in puget sound we we continue to have a lot of work that needs to be done um and and a clean sound will benefit our economy we'll also help the critical salmon stocks in the pacific northwest you know one of the main reasons that the puget sound is dirty is because king county and the state of washington is turning a blind eye to the pollution to the the sewer the the sewage discharge that continues to uh happen in puget sound you know there's over 70 sewage treatment plants dumping millions of gallons of raw sewage into puget sound every year and it is threatening the salmon species in puget sound the salmon species that are critical to the orcas for example but it's really it's really um concerning that once again uh these permits are going to be issued instead of actually stopping the dumping of the the the raw sewage you look at the washington state salmon report the puget sound salmon are in crisis having epa remind a state and the city of its legal obligations will save future future cleanup dollars and so i wanted to ask uh you if i can get your commitment to look into making these large cities like seattle stay within their limits of sewage discharge just like the small towns in eastern washington are forced to do yes you have my commitment there and i've already committed to the governor of washington and other representatives that we want to work with the state to make sure that their delegated authority is being done correctly and i agree with you that the puget sound is not only great ecologically but provides economic opportunities as well so we want to partner with you on that well what's happening right now is unacceptable in my uh opinion for the salmon for the orcas and and for our water quality so i look forward to working with you and with that i yield back thank you mr chairman

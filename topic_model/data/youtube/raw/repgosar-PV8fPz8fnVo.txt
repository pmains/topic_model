I'll recognize myself for five minutes first of all I'm surprised my good friend Dan Ashe isn't here today but mr. Cerf I guess you're on the hot seat if staff could bring up slide number one deputy Kurth are you familiar with this letter an issue this is Lake Havasu yes I'm sorry my eyesight's not what did you say you should be I know fine to discuss this with you today slide one is a letter that the service sent me on July 10th 2015 in response to a letter I sent objecting to the arbitrary closure of recreational motorized boating at the North End of Lake Havasu a couple of days before Memorial Day weekend in the letter the service acting regional director acknowledged and I quote the importance of public involvement in decisions regarding visitor use on the refuge end a quote the letter goes on to state on the end of slide 1 this fall refuge management will initiate a review of the overall recreational boating program occurring on the refuge this will include soliciting input from all users on the refuge it is now March of the following year almost April and the fall has long since passed has your agency initiated the review and started receiving public input we've initiated the review but we have not quite started the public input when we look at these use slide 2 please here's the actual letter I sent which included emails and letters from my constituency expressing outrage about disclosure slide 3 please do you know who this is no sir it's a friend of my nine year old Ryder bliss Ryder has special needs he learned to water-ski and frequently skied the area on Lake Havasu that your agency shut down Ryder no longer has a safe place to water-ski on Lake Havasu as you all expect him to ski in the open lake where boats are traveling around seventy miles per hour as opposed to in this back channel where he is safe do you know why your agency shut down this channel we shut it down because we had complaints from non-motorized boaters about you tell your but no let me let me explain to you why you did it's because two old paddle boaters that recently moved to Arizona made up lies and encouraged the agency to take this action let's go to slide four this is an email from the local fishing local Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement agent confirming what I just said in the email he said he is so annoyed with these two P individuals that he thinks he's done with this slide five this slide contains an email from the refuge manager Linda Miller saying she's going to inform one of those paddlers that our immediate request to establish a no-wake zone isn't feasible and we require public comment slide six you know where I'm going this slide contains an email from Linda Miller's boss stating that a closure would likely meet resistance and require NEPA compliance did your agency follow NEPA before making this closure the answer is no I don't want you to have to make any other choice no we did follow and deep in the comprehensive conservation plan that provided for this framework to close then provide provide that further for the for the documentation here I mean sir where you're going on this is no-man's land I mean you have no defense for what's coming the slight let's go to slide seven this slide contains another email from Linda Miller on November 26 2014 stating she will be drafting a proposal and putting it out for a 30 to 60 public day comment period slide 9 this slide contains an email from the said paddle boater on July 9 2015 refuge manager Miller replies to the email and says she is still working on the proposal for public comment slide 11 this Elaine this email contains an email from Linda Miller which states she's closed motorized boating on Havasu as a result of an alarming increase point alarming increase in boating violations she goes on to state that the refuge will be initiating a full compatibility determination that allows public comment for all user groups has that process been initiated yes it's the compatibility determination has been draft at his undergoing legal review and then will be put out for public comment do you know how many boating violations the agency used to justify this closure I don't know yeah to two new violations same people so refuge mill manager Miller told a boulder on May 21st 2015 that the process would soon start soon and it still hasn't even been well you said initiated but no public comment finally saw slide 12 this is the arbitrary notice your agency posted a couple days prior to Memorial Day weekend without public comment that shut down motorized boat boating in the back channel at the North End of Lake Havasu a few days before Memorial Day weekend no public noma notice or comment this is outrageous well your agency withdraw this arbitrary closure and reopen the northern part of Lake Havasu for motor sized motorized boating for Ryder and other skiers they could have enjoyed skiing in this area for multiple decades we will put out our compatibility determination and do that until you actually go through that process sir this isn't total violation of what is standing policy for two people that had a problem and you failed to follow the process no no I know I understand why Danny ash isn't here and he sent you I mean it's pathetic absolutely pathetic I'll expect that answer being withdrawn

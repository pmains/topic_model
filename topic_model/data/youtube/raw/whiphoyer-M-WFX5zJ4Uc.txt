anybody else with republican talking points but they're American ought to be confused consistently the strategy of the Republican Party has been to take America hostage and shut down the government they did it under Gingrich they did it three years ago for 16 days and they are pursuing that policy now this is a shutdown that President Trump welcomed which is why he would allow and McConnell would not nor would Ryan put on the floor issues on which we have consensus speaker Ryan said this we will advance major legislation one issue at a time and then he said we will not duck the tough issues we will take them head-on his failure to do either of those has realized the president's objective of shutting down this government the answer to your question is absolutely none of us here have ever supported policies to shut down the government what we have supported however are positive policies to serve the American people and we have not spent a minute putting on the floor an agreed upon by Paul Ryan over the last four years a parity of increases in domestic spending and military spending both of which we support both of which Speaker Ryan supported in 15 excuse me in 14 15 16 and 17 why doesn't he agree on that now I don't know the answer to that but it has inevitably led to the fact that this incompetent leadership has not sent one appropriation bill to the President of the United States this is not just about a CR what is a CR funding government no business no enterprise no office can function 30 days - 30 days - 30 days - 30 days with extraordinarily inefficiencies and losing money I don't have the Secretary of Navy's quote but apparently it's a four billion dollar cost on these see ours so we ask our Republican colleagues do what speaker Ryan said do what frankly President Trump said I'm gonna when they talk about the illegal immigrants the only reason they're illegal is because Donald Trump made themselves Donald Trump made themselves and What did he say he said Congress fix it and I'll sign it What did he say yesterday - leader Schumer come down in the White House and let's work it out and senator Schumann went down the White House and he thought it was worked out but somebody in the White House maybe it was himself warring with himself but maybe it was some other staffer said no we don't want to make a deal because what you wanted mr. president was a shutdown and show them let's be responsible maybe it was mr.

first of all mr. president I want to thank my friend the senator from Rhode Island two things one for being a constant voice on the need for us to diversify our energy sources and supplies and recognize the enormous challenge around climate change I come from a state not too dissimilar from his in terms of we have a great deal of shoreline we see the effects of the changing climate each and every day where we have parts of the City of Norfolk we're on a high tide parts of the city that never before flooded flooded on a regular basis we have on a sunny day we have a church that has to regularly change its schedule of worship not because the Lord asked for them to change the schedule of worship but because they flood it floods on a regular basis let me also thank him for his comments about the tax legislation I I share his concern as somebody who feels very strongly there's a right way and a wrong way to do tax reform unfortunately the product that I believe we'll be voting on next week not only due to some of the provisions you've talked about but we'll add close to two trillion dollars to our debt it does not even take care of the problems in many ways that was supposed to solve in terms of the ability for companies to bring back profits from overseas and a way to reinvest in this country frankly it exacerbates the problem where companies can further hide their profits abroad I share your doubt whether our colleagues will join us in starting anew but if they would I know I would join with you and others in trying to make sure that we would do a tax reform and a fair balance in a way that was fiscally responsible so I thank you for your comments but mr. president I stand here today though to talk about a different subject and that is to stand in solidarity with over 12,000 of my Virginian constituents were students entrepreneurs members of our military and also these individuals who have the distinction of being dreamers like the nearly 800,000 dreamers across the country these people many of them young folks are worried about facing deportation and for not for anything they've done wrong but because the vast majority of these young people were brought here to this country as children many years ago and today unfortunately due to no accidents of their own they're caught up in some of the worst of our nation's politics up until this past September these young people were living in the United States legally under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program or what's been called daca as part of this program these young people came out of the shadows paid a fee went through an extensive criminal background check and complied with all the other requirements of the daca program unfortunately mr. president dreamers and their families are now in a perilous situation because unfortunately President Trump ended the daca program literally putting hundreds of thousands of these young people in a state of legal limbo and unfortunately while a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to work through this problem we hear the Republican leadership has nothing has done nothing to provide that permanent solution for these hard-working yes young Americans and that's who they are folks who've lived here oftentimes for decades this is not how the greatest country on earth should treat anyone especially these young people who in the most case have only one nation that they've called home and that's our country the United States now I'm not the only one who thinks this mr. president as I mentioned their colleagues on both sides of the aisle who've been coming to the floor for weeks making this point fact is more than three quarters of Americans of all political stripes support a pathway to legal for permanent legal status for dreamers here in this Senate my friends Senator Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin have introduced the bipartisan DREAM Act and have been working actively to work about its passage in the Senate in the house there are enough votes to pass this bipartisan legislation if leadership would only bring it to the floor and that's not just the case here in the Senate just last week my friend congressman Scott Taylor a fellow Virginian and a Republican led a bipartisan group of 30 members in the house asking again the house leadership to find a legislative solution not next year not next month but now unfortunately too many to me at least it seems that some folks on the other side of the aisle would rather treat this as a political issue in a political pawn to be negotiated probably not even this year but at some future date by doing so they leave these young people in a state of limbo and really subject to a great deal of legal uncertainty and for many of these young people as they cycle out of the program close to a thousand a week even if we come up with a legal solution their ability to rejoin the program reclaim their legal status Mabius tingle extinguished through this is not just another political leverage point let me take a moment or two and talk about some of the the folks who are affected folks in my state folks who I call real Virginians I think about one a young student from Northern Virginia who I chose as my guest to the president's State of the Union dress a few her few a few years ago I was so impressed with her work ethic in her passion for improving the lives of others but I asked her after that as an intern in my office where she did great work serving fellow Virginians think about a law student I meet I met recently in Williamsburg who was born in England and brought here when she was just a year old right now it's getting close to the holidays she's probably tucked away in some corner of the library studying for her law school exams but she told me she wanted to get that law degree to help fellow Virginians when she graduates I say we shouldn't stand there away think about again a young man I met from Newport News whose mother brought into the United States when he was just six years old sadly his mother passed away before he graduated from high school but I know that when he walked across the stage of that graduation as valedictorian of his class his mom would have been proud and when hopefully if this program is renewed when he graduates from Virginia Tech next year with a degree in engineering he will put those skills to work these are just a few examples about the smart successful young Virginians who also carry the categorization of being called dreamers truth is in Virginia we have a vibrant and growing immigrant community that contribute to all facets of life in the Commonwealth and while I talk today about dreamers I want to also make mention of another program who's caught up in some of these last-minute negotiations the so called TPS individuals often times individuals from salvador honduras and nicaragua in certain cases folks who've lived in this country for decades whose legal status are also in jeopardy the truth is whether they're a dreamer or someone who's been a beneficiary of the tipi program truth is immigrants in Virginia are all across our community they're doctors caretakers small business owners high tech entrepreneurs quite honestly they're also our next-door neighbors there are motivated talented individuals who want to help to continue contributing to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to our country and we what we and what we tell them every day that we failed to act every day that more and more of these young people fall out of eligibility we tell them in pretty direct ways that actually even though they have served studied and work here that at least some in this chamber don't really want them here they'd rather take their talents urge them to take their talents elsewhere as somebody who's been in business longer than I've been in politics I have to tell you these young people are an enormous asset and urging him to leave the Commonwealth or our country is a bad business decision as I said unfortunately with every day that passes more and more dreamers face the very real and terrifying prospect of being oftentimes sent to a country they barely know or may not know it all for an offense that they were too young to even know they committed mr. president that's just not right it's not right that their lives should hang in balance as they wait and wait and wait for Congress to solve this problem a problem that I know if it was brought to the floor would receive overwhelming bipartisan bipartisan support mr. president these young people can't wait any longer and shouldn't wait any longer it's time to pass the DREAM Act right now Thank You mr. president with that I yield the floor

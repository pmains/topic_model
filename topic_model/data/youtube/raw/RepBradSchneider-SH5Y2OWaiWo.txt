Mr. Speaker,
Today, the heads of our intelligence agencies are testifying in the Senate with a unanimous
and stark warning: Russia’s meddling in 2016 was not an isolated
incident, our midterm elections remain vulnerable, and Putin is targeting 2018. "The United States is under attack” said
Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Russia’s actions demand a serious response,
both to hold our attackers accountable and deter future interference. Remarkably, President Trump and his Administration
have proved unwilling to act. We must do better. I’m proud to join with my friend and colleague
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen to introduce the the DETER Act in the House. This bicameral bipartisan legislation, introduced
in the Senate by Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Marco Rubio, will improve our monitoring of
foreign interference and impose immediate and severe sanctions when such actions are
identified. It is an important step to ensure the integrity
of every American’s vote. Protecting our elections is a national concern,
superseding party and politics. As we approach the next national election
in less than nine months we must work together and we must act now. I urge my colleagues to support the DETER
act to secure our elections this year and beyond.

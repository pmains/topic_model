i i do want to say thank you unfortunately i want to say thank you to ranking member fischbach and fortunately to chairman delgado for having this hearing today to discuss important renewable renewable energy production issues in in rural america and the work that our ag producers are already doing to reduce emissions this administration though is headed down a dangerous path as it continues to pass up opportunities to uphold the renewable fuel standard and support america's ethanol and biodiesel producers i've been proud to help lead initiatives to strengthen and restore the integrity of the rfs alongside my friends and and my biofuels democrat and republican co-chairs my colleagues on this committee ranking member fischbach and mr feenstra have also been key in our efforts to hold this administration accountable and in june i sent a letter along with my republican colleagues to president biden regarding the rumors that the administration was considering a nationwide waiver of the rfs to cut demand for more combined gallons than all those cut during due to the small refinery exemptions issued by the prior administration and we encourage the president to keep his 2020 promises to rural america and actually uphold the law now we continue to wait on the rvo and have yet to receive a response to our letter which is actually concerning i hope that this is not an indication of the administration's unwillingness to stand with america's farmers and further in march i sent a letter with my republican colleagues to the usda encouraging the department to quickly provide assistance using existing funds to biofuels producers for covid related market disruptions secretary vilsack responded to that letter in august stating that an update to the pandemic assistance for producers program at the usda would be provided by labor day however we're still waiting 11 months into this administration and no biofuels producers have seen any relief mr chair i request unanimous consent insured into the record the three letters i referenced without objection thank you madam ranking member do you object i'm thinking about it thank you first question ms score great to see you again and i want to know has any prior administration considered retroactively cutting the rvo in the way this administration is rumored to be considering thank you congressman and thank you for all your leadership as a member of the house biofuels caucus um no what what the rumors that we have heard that this epa is looking to reopen the 2020 blending uh requirements for rvos that's unprecedented and we believe there's no legal authority for the agency to do that as you said we need to get these renewable blending obligations out they need to be at congr at congress's intent to 15 billion gallons of conventional blending so we're still waiting too mr wheeler what do you think congressman it's it's unprecedented for sure and just want to say greatly appreciate all your leadership and your your work um down in illinois and it's good to see you as well uh great to see you i missed score do you believe the biofuels industry is better or worse off under this administration well as we've said from the outset the first real test of the administration's commitment to follow through on on many of mr biden's comments stated on the campaign trail is with renewable volume obligations we have yet to see those we are anxiously awaiting uh that's going to be the really the first test to show that they are committed to low carbon renewable fuels that can be used in our current auto fleet and and this is our test right now ms square this is the test of the administration i mean these are rumors but a lack of response to letters coming from members of congress a lack of response to questions coming from your industry it it only leads us to speculate right um speculation and uncertainty and that's not what our marketplace needs right now so we you know we're already well past our 2021 blending obligations we've got to get 2022 out so that we get back on track uh which is something that the administration had committed it would do at the outset at the beginning of the year they committed they campaigned to be elected on keeping the promise to america's biofuels producers and upholding the rfs and all we get right now is silence and that to me sounds like an almost and hopefully this hearing will help change that but it sounds to me like it's almost a broken campaign promise and i will tell you uh we on on we here we republicans who have sent these letters we will hold this administration accountable so what can this administration and we in congress miss score do right now to provide certainty to your industry what we need is to get those renewable volume blending requirements out they need to be at 15 billion gallons we need to restore year-round sales of e-15 so we get back on track and we can use more biofuels they're good for the rural economy they're good for the american driver thank you i yield back my two seconds

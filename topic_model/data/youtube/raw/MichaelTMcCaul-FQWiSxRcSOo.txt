well isis militants have attention once again after beheading an 82 year old archaeologist now the man who was in charge of overseeing the ancient site at palmyra in syria was beheaded and his body hanged from a column in the town's main square congressman michael mccall one of the leaders focusing on the fight with isis in texas he's here to talk about a few things he's also chairman of the house homeland security committee thanks for coming in hey good morning jose thanks for having me now okay isis they have been causing problems something that we did not think about but say five ten years ago uh in order to get them out bashir al-assad would have to go as well basically but does that mean that u.s boots would have to be on the ground to help well i think it's a complex issue i think assad eventually has to go he's a magnet for the sunni extremists i think that a ground force of indigenous sunni arabs under american leadership with our special forces embedded with them is really the strategy to defeat and destroy them right now it's been all about containment and not destroying and defeating them and i can tell you jose as they do these horrific acts over there and they build their their forces over there so to the threat to the homeland we arrested three isis individuals in the united states last week over the last year over 60 isis that's more than one per week isis follower was arresting in this country alone not to mention what we're doing overseas now isis is not just fighting on the ground they're fighting in cyberspace is there anything that we can do to stop that that's a very difficult one because they are you know out of syria uh they're very savvy on social media and they hit thousands of followers in the united states over two hundred 000 tweets per day pertain to isis trying to activate followers to attack attack military installations police officers so it's a very difficult challenge and then they go into what's called dark space which is a platform that they can go into that even if we have a court order we cannot monitor these communications so jose if you can't see the communications it's kind of hard to stop it can isis be defeated without boots on the ground well when you say boots on the ground whose boots are we talking about i think it has to be under us leadership under a coalition of forces it has to be with our special forces embedded with them but i think the sunni arabs can provide many of these ground forces indigenous forces they call them and that would be from turkey jordan uh egypt and the go and the in the gulf uh those states can't provide a ground force but it has to be with our guys in the middle of it and i don't you know i'm not saying we need a hundred thousand us combat but we're gonna need some of our special forces embedded i'm gonna kind of put you on the spot is there a presidential candidate that would favor what you were talking about that you would support i really have you know i'm looking for someone like uh churchill reagan type that can uh restore american greatness i think the world's a lot more dangerous today than it was before this administration came into office and i'm that's the kind of leader i'm looking for i know um i know jeb bush gave a speech where he talked about some of these platforms that i've mentioned but i'm not seeing a whole lot of coming up from the candidates on national security and foreign policy i think jose that's going to be probably the most important issue this election congressman michael mccall thank you so very much for joining us here on fox 26 morning news this is the best of luck and uh stay safe sir thank you good to see you

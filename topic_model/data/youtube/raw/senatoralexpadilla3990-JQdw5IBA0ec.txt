and begin by reminding the committee that as I said a couple of weeks ago I support the stated objective of this bill quality local and Regional journalism is a vital public good and I'm eager to support the news Community during these difficult Financial Times but I continue to have concerns about the bill want to reiterate them for today's consideration to begin with I believe we need stronger language to ensure that the revenue from this bill goes to the workers that make journalism possible and is invested in the highly quality local journalism that those workers produce well I appreciate that the sponsors have accepted changes that I requested to enhance the reporting obligations of news publishers they're still just reporting requirements after the fact with no built-in consequences or accountability and I don't think public shaming will ensure unscrupulous owners support their workers no amount of public shaming has succeeded with firms like Alden Global capital which as chairman German knows well took over and go to The Newsroom of the renowned Chicago Tribune or Gannett which spent more than a hundred million dollars on stock BuyBacks and executive pay and then turned right around and laid off scores of journalists just last month so as this bill goes to the floor I implore my colleagues including those who may not be members of this committee to take a real close look at the bill and determine for themselves that this bill sufficiently protects workers in this critical industry a second I respectfully disagree with the statements that have been made suggesting that this bill is not about content moderation I don't find myself saying this very often but uh Senator Cruz was right to be concerned about this bill's impact on how information is both shared and consumed online but we depart significantly on how the problems from this bill manifest and while it's great that this committee spent the last two weeks ensuring that Senator Cruz is comfortable with the bill my strong concerns Remain unaddressed the Bill's prohibitions on the ability of platforms to take Viewpoint into consideration and it's overbroad retaliation provision coupled with the compelled arbitration and the ambiguous definition of access invite a world where covered platforms will have to pay for content and subsidize Outlets they fundamentally disagree with if you recall two weeks ago I raised the areas of disinformation the dangers of disinformation with election disinformation being just one example now these Provisions also work in concert to allow bad faith actors to force platforms to amplify the spread of hate speech and disinformation online now finally I worry greatly about the Bill's impact on the open internet and the Public's ability to access and share information what is contemplated is compelling payment for a truly foundational features of the internet and the bill is plagued by vague terms for example the bill defines axis of content as quote acquiring crawling and indexing content but it does not define those key terms does acquire refer to an intentional action taken by a platform or would it include every instance of a video or a piece of content that is uploaded by a user onto a platform in other words is a platform like YouTube for example acquiring content when a user uploads a video to its service if the answer is yes then this bill creates an opportunity for Outlets like project Veritas or Infowars to Simply upload their videos to YouTube and then compel payments from the company from the platform confusion over the interpretation of these highly technical terms can be extremely consequential and in general this will raise the number of policy and Technical questions that demand more Care and More consideration by this body Mr chair I again filed several amendments that seek to address the concerns I've highlighted it's probably unsurprising that I think this bill still needs a lot of work so it's currently drafted as currently drafted I would not be able to support the bill on the floor but I am well aware of the Dynamics around these issues on this committee so I look forward to ensuring that every Center has had an opportunity to closely examine this bill and grapple with the issues that it raises as a process continues and to Senator Kennedy Senator Klobuchar others that have been so extensively involved in the negotiation thus far I stand ready to continue to engage to have my concerns addressed thank you Mr chair thank you Senator Padilla we every

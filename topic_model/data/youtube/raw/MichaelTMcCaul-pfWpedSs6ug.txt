mr mike mccall chairman of the homeland security committee thank you mr chairman and mr secretary let me just uh say sincerely i want to thank you uh for your service and these very uh challenging times that we find ourselves in and i also want to i appreciate your comments about the greatest generation uh my father was a b-17 bombardier in the european theater uh truly was a great and is a great generation um they um were all in and they were all in to win and they won and they defeated fascism i see a new threat and it is islamist extremism and it seems to me the best homeland security policy we can have is to eliminate the threat where it exists rather than coming into the united states before this committee we will be deliberating an authorization for the use of military force we had a meeting with white house officials chairman myself and others and were presented with the president's policy on this i must say the reception was not i have concerns concerns of a timetable telling isis how long were in the fight concerns about tying the hands of our generals concerns about usually an authorization is asked for by the congress to expand uh the president's authority in the military's powers rather than restrict them i cannot support this authorization as presented by the administration the authorization i would like to see i'd like to get your opinion on would be an authorization to degrade and destroy isis wherever they exist can you tell me whether you would support an authorization like that well that's that's in the authorization uh there's no geographic limit purposefully in order to be able to destroy them wherever they exist and the president's uh thinking which which i agree with with respect to the continuation is look there's a huge divide in congress we all know that there was an unhappy experience with a prolonged war in iraq that became a war of choice and which didn't in most people's judgment have to be fought and and people are tired they don't want to go back and do uh another 14-year you know military excursion and there's a divide as to sort of how do you balance this so what the president did i came up and testified on the aumf in december we listened to both sides of the aisle where some people were resisting the idea of something that's open-ended where you're going to be working 14 15 years from now on on the same authorization and the president i think thoughtfully and appropriately said you know what congress ought to be able to unite the american people ought to be able to speak with one voice to say we are going to go out and i if i could just it it sounds like a political document i integrated and and i agree it says wherever it exists but but all the limitations on our military um and i think all the options should options should not be taken off the table i think that's a dangerous precedent this would restrict the president's authority compared to the 2001 uh a umf that he has current authority under uh i'd like to ask you and i appreciate your letter response on the syrian but congressman can i just say very quick very quickly i have the reason for giving the next nobody knows the next president is next president ought to have the right i mean ought to have the right to be able to say i need more i want more or let's continue it the way it is nothing is going to stop you from doing that the policy clearly is committed to degrade and destroy isis we agree on the policy i just don't think you can achieve that goal if you put restrictions on them you were in the vietnam conflict we had a micromanaged war that i think didn't allow our troops to win that war and i don't want to make the same mistake with isis and i think our precipitous withdrawal without a status forces agreement quite frankly created isis to some extent syrian refugee issue um i had a hearing on this i had the fbi testify we have 500 refugees in this country but the plan of the state department as i understand it is to bring thousands more in uh to the country as we're trying to block foreign fighters from coming into the united states from western europe and americans who have traveled uh the idea of bringing in thousands of syrian refugees i think poses a potential risk to americans that was borne out not only by homeland security officials at my hearing but the fbi made it very clear that they don't have the intelligence and the proper databases to properly vet these syrian refugees who would be coming into the united states under your program this federally sanctioned bring in refugees i i think this raises serious risks and concerns and i think that rightly so when the fbi is telling me that and agreeing with that as well can you tell me what your plan is well the plan is to engage in what we would call super vetting i mean an extraordinary level of vetting and if the fbi is not satisfied i'm quite confident that people aren't going to be allowed in so i don't see this as a conflict i mean we have amazing ways of being able to dig down and dig deep we're doing it now by the way with respect to the syrian opposition that is being vetted in order to uh join up to the training and equip program i think we're about you know some well i'm not going to put the numbers out here but there's a disparity between the numbers who have signed up and the number who have absolutely been proved and who have entered the program and i think the same thing will happen well and they'll close with it that was in jordan i saw the refugees and i agree but we've gotten most women you know their mothers and children been doing this for years now i i well we made some mistakes with iraq who the iraqis have been prosecuted for being terrorists but uh the pride the minister of interior and security in jordan told me personally i don't know who these people are i don't know who they are because i don't have intelligence to vet them so i think i think the vetting will reach the security minister of jordan and others and when they weigh in accordingly i don't think you can see those people coming in okay thank you mr

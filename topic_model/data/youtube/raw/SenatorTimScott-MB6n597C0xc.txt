up Senator thanks for joining us it looks like you made it through largely what are you seeing what are you hearing down there in your state well we're thankful that we're on this side of the storm as opposed to where we were just a few hours ago about 200 000 people around the state without power the worst damage in the state so far looks like from Pawleys Island the causeways are still closed a lot of folks without power from Pawleys Island to Myrtle Beach and then up to the PD or the Florence area those are the areas that have the biggest impact so we'll see the governor there tomorrow morning I've been able to talk with some of the Mayors the mayors of the Georgetown to Myrtle Beach as well as the governor to make sure that the coordination that's necessary and the collaboration that will help us get to the speediest return possible is actually happening in real time there's a lot of coming together and in a storm like this this is uh the FEMA assisted administrator uh talking about as this storm moved North take a listen all the hazards that we've seen in Florida can impact those further up the coast I want to remind everyone that this storm is not over yet just because because the skies are clear does not mean it's safe water can be electrified there can be other hazards in there please stay safe and continue to listen to local officials and oftentimes we see a sender that you know folks especially in low-lying areas say this isn't going to hit this time we saw that down in Fort Myers Beach that's part of the problem Brad people they breathe a sigh of relief because they think it's over and the truth is that in the aftermath of a hurricane is sometimes the most dangerous times you listen to the FEMA assistant director talk about down wires those that are still electrified can kill people on the spot one of the most important things that we can do is to stay home stay inside so that we don't put ourselves at risk or the First Responders who are literally running into Harm's Way to save people's lives we can stop that from happening by listening to what the experts say that we should be doing typically that means staying out of Harm's Way and the fastest way and the best way to do that stay in your home Senator I always have a lot of questions about politics I'd like to talk about stuff overseas but today I'm not going to talk about any of that we appreciate your time as you're dealing with South Carolina thank you Brett we continue to pray for our friends and Neighbors in Florida and of course throughout South Carolina as well we'll see you soon thank you

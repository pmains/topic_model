thank you mr chairman um nicole thank you for being so specific in terms of the guidance to the committee i think probably the others on the panel would agree that we can't make roads happen we can't uh make water infrastructure happen unless we have some some sense to the permitting uh process and and so keenly identifying a couple things that we need to focus on um joint mouse but also uh the fast act itself you um and the folks at afn did did a great job in supporting us with the infrastructure grant symposium that we had last month but it was your navigator program and and that cadre of regional um navigators that i think are going to be important they were important then but they're going to be important moving forward as as we're all seeking to access the opportunities that are coming from the infrastructure bill so given that do you have any recommendations for best practices that you might offer to the white house council on native american uh affairs or or the bia to how as to how they might create a larger federal navigator program um you know you you've you've got the navigator programs over at doi you are having them set up an interagency coordinator position to assist tribes so it seems to me we're we're designating lots of individuals and entities to be there to help but how does how does the individual tribe and in a remote area know to even where to go so any guidance on on this thank you thank you very much for the question senator murkowski it is difficult for individual tribes in alaska we have 229 of them they are small they are under capitalized and a lot of instances they are far removed from our bigger cities which i are not really big cities compared to the lower 48 and internet can um connections are stable if they have them at all so um i would encourage the the tribes um in alaska and to the lower 48 if it applies um to them in their regions to really work through their regional um bodies that they have established the the good thing is that there are several national statewide organizations and we are sort of repeating each other's efforts tracking the grants making sure that the native communities know about them and how to apply for them in in terms of what can all of the other federal agencies do to help along the way go out and hire folks like adam and fatma and lucy and amber and put them to work we we don't need more individuals who are doing things the same way that has been done for the past couple of decades we need fresh ideas we need hard workers folks that are willing to think out of the box it's not good enough in indian country and across the islands to hit send on an email that's not how we reach our people that's not how we're doing it through the navigator program we are faxing we are using public radio we are using vhfs in some instances we have tracked down a tribal administrator on a commercial fishing vessel in the middle of bristol bay during the salmon run and said you have to get back to your office you have 24 hours to apply for the mandatory minimum arpa employment um allocation that will come to your tribe so it's it's going those extra miles but if if we just continue to box check which also is an unfortunate um occurrence a lot of times when we do tribal consultations we're not going to get there so i often tell federal agencies if the federal government wants to learn how to consult with native communities and tribes sign up for one of adam geisler's tribal consultations we will wait on the line for eight hours because he stays on the line with us for eight hours he knows about the programs if he doesn't know about them he writes it down and he follows up other agencies oftentimes say thank you your two minutes is up move on to the next um person so those might be a little bit too plain and direct but um i don't think they are too plain and direct at all i think we know whether you're in the islands or whether you're in alaska or you're in south dakota as you say people are communicating in different ways and they're not waiting for that email to come across to to find out what they're supposed to be doing next doesn't translate that way so thank you for for making it real and and again the very very genuine um efforts that the that the navigator program has made and clearly it's it's yielding dividends so i would commend that to the committee thank you mr chairman

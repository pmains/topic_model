well meanwhile we're seeing more reactions to the latest blitz of legislation making its way through congress now to further discuss i want to welcome south carolina representative nancy mace to the program hi congressman for having me today welcome back thank you it's nice to have you of course so um i want to get your reaction to legislation that uh just passed in the house yesterday democrats unanimously approved a bill that would make d.c the 51st state they argued that it would enfranchise the more than 700 000 people that live in the area do you agree with that oh 100 absolutely disagree and we had a very heated debate on the floor yesterday regarding dc statehood because if you oppose it you're racist which could be the furthest thing from the truth what we can't do is oppose the the constitution and the former government that our founding fathers put in place which was a balance of power but what we're seeing with democrats in the far left the radical left when they don't get their way this is they're trying to have more power in congress because they they want to pass this radical socialist agenda and we're pushing back and we're fighting back very hard um i've also seen a group of republicans unveiled a counter offer to buy in sweeping infrastructure plan they cut the price tag on that it's down from the 2 trillion to about a 560 billion they narrowed it down the focus as well to focus strictly on things they consider infrastructure like roads bridges airports now biden has said that he wants a bill that republicans would support do you believe that that's true well we've heard a lot we've seen i've seen more damage done in the first hundred days of the biden administration that i thought possible in four years we've heard a lot of talk about unifying the country and working together in a non-partisan way but to date it just hasn't happened yet and there are republicans this is a place on infrastructure this should not be a republican or democrat issue this should be a place where we can work together but imagine just for a moment that we put an infrastructure built together that actually has to do with roads bridges planes and ports and not the green new deal and that is where we should be working right now on this infrastructure package and what the senate republicans put together yesterday and presented is about a quarter of the price tag of what the biden administration was proposing no tax hikes necessary to pay for that package well and then i want to dig a little deeper into that the second part of biden's infrastructure plan it has items related to economic recovery it's another trillion dollar proposal now he's calling it the american families plan and it would do things like extend the child tax credit through 2025 it would expand paid leave and child care but like you mentioned it would it would raise corporate taxes to pay for it what are your thoughts on that it seems like every week there's a new billion dollar trillion dollar boondoggle coming out of the byte administration the only way we can afford these very expensive packages these uh liberal spending wish list that we're seeing right now the only way we can do it is to raise taxes and they're talking about taxing the rich and having corporations pair their pay their fair share all that might sound good to people and sounds great but it's a horrible idea especially in the middle of a pandemic because hard-working americans are going to end up footing the bill there's no way around it there will always be loopholes for the rich in corporations and so hard-working americans will end up footing the bill and that's untenable and they're talking about seven trillion dollars of new spending just in the first six months of this year i don't know how you sell this to the american people with a straight face all right you mentioned the pandemic so i wanted to finish off with this i've seen reports that coveted vaccination rates are falling in some parts of the country people just aren't going out and getting them as quickly as they were when the initial rollout happened it's prompting some states even to stop ordering more doses does that concern you certainly it does but in talking with health care leaders here in south carolina you have about a third of the population that will will be able to that will get their vaccinations right away in the first 30 days when they have access and the ability to do so you have another third that will wait two or three or four months before they go out and get theirs and then there's anothe the last third are those that have some vaccine hesitancy and this could be for health reasons um this is for a number of reasons and so we've got to give it some time i know that in many states right now like in south carolina everybody has the ability to get vaccinated i had a really horrible case of covid19 i'm a long hauler i just got my first vaccination a week and a half ago and i'm told that that for those that that had a bad case and that were long haulers that they can improve their health can improve after being vaccinated so i'm encouraging folks to talk with their physicians to make that decision it's a personal decision that everyone should have the freedom to make themselves in accordance with and along with their physician and get the best recommendation to protect themselves and their families and our communities and so states like south carolina florida we've done a really good job of balancing health and safety and keeping people keeping our numbers down from coveted 19 and getting back to work and that's really essential to the future and encouraging great economic opportunity in the future yeah like you said getting back to normal i just got my vaccine yesterday my first one it feels like i did a couple push-ups with my left arm but feeling okay so far congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina thank you so much for joining us we appreciate your time thank you

good morning everyone thank you for all of joining us we appreciate your insights will help provide us mayor it's great to be back in hackensack and uh you know hackensack has now become uh the medical uh epicenter of the state of new jersey and that's among the many things that hackensack is doing and so we appreciate your leadership and we appreciate you agreeing with us today i was a mayor so i know it's one of the toughest jobs in america a lot to do everybody's got something to say to you and everybody's got a peace of mind to give you so we appreciate you being here with us today uh i am very happy to have my colleague in the house of representatives congressman gottheimer who is a real champion on these issues and is someone who has proven himself to be able to get things done as someone who served in the house of representatives that has 435 members you need 218 votes to get something done congressman heimer has uh understood that and navigated and been the architect of many successful initiatives so we're always trying to hack with us in a common cause and to president garrett thank you for hosting us again when the congressman and i were thinking about where would we host this roundtable we wanted it to be in a health care center because this is a healthcare issue and it should be people in that regards we could have done many different forms at different locations but we really said we need to have new jersey answers for that fact americans think of mental health exactly that as a health care issue and so we appreciate you hosting us with the incredible work that is going on here on this and so many other critical issues to our state today we'll hear from students and parents and counselors and experts in the field how mental health issues are impacting our youth we are in a moment that i cannot stress this enough is critical when it comes to the mental health challenges facing our young people in fact if you pick up any newspaper or more likely if you open your social media feed you will see story after story about this public health crisis and its devastating toll whether it's a rise in eating disorders anxiety depression or in the worst and most tragic cases the loss of young people from suicide we know that this growing crisis started long before the pandemic however there's no doubt that every single one of these issues has been exacerbated by the isolation the lack of time of peers the closing of schools and their associated activities just to name a few now it can be difficult to talk about mental health i come from a generation that didn't talk about it enough i am encouraged by the openness and bravery of this generation in removing the stigma surrounding mental health and bringing it into a light that was forced into the darkness it's an issue that first requires individuals to find inner courage and then requires them to find the language to talk about what's going on inside which is easier said than done part of why it's so important that we come together today is because hearing stories from others can encourage the next person to share bringing down the walls that divide us it starts to make it okay to say hey i'm having a hard time and i don't feel like myself i need help as i said before when i was growing up and even when my children were growing up we didn't do a good enough job of that this sea change of openness is a very powerful tool in addressing mental health according to the national institute for mental health nearly one in five u.s adults live with the mental levels the national alliance on mental health nominee when we have a representative here has concluded that one out of every six kids between the ages of 6 and 17 experience a mental health disorder each year and right here in new jersey we have 72 000 children aged 12 to 17 who suffer from depression it's so widespread in our schools and in our communities that late last year the united states surgeon general called youth mental health a quote-unquote crisis a crisis that from 2019 to 2021 led children's hospitals across the nation to report a 45 rise in cases of self-injury and suicide among children ages 5 to 17. a crisis that just a few months ago was front and center at a round table i hosted with congressman pasquale and carney to discuss pandemic learning loss at that time we were talking about learning loss and how do we overcome and make sure that we make our students hope speaker after speaker shared with us that students weren't just having problems with their academics because of the pandemic parents teachers and counselors all say they saw a rise in anxiety and depression in their kids so taken together when we zoom out and see how numbers backed up by personal stories we see just how many people are impacted with mental health concerns mental health is just like our physical health and equally important it must be treated as such and when we look at it this way we can really make change last year congresswoman bonnie watson coleman and i introduced the pursuing equity in mental health act the bill would address the growing issue of suicide and mental health facing young people particularly disadvantaged communities with unequal access to mental health treatment both before and after the pandemic so we're thrilled to hear what you're doing in a prayer family i'm proud to say that just a few weeks ago the senate finance committee where i sit has a discussion draft to address mental health and it included my bipartisan school behavioral health incentive act this bill would support states in developing initiatives inside schools that address the behavioral health needs of students when we open up our discussion i'm looking forward to hearing from students like gabriela javier elijah and liam who can tell us about what's going on in their classrooms and what solutions and resources have helped them along the way elijah liam i want to thank you all for being here today for sharing your stories and for being beacons of life to your peers who may be going through similar things and but no they're not alone last thing i want to say before turning it over to congressman alheimer is that mental health is not a monolith people are not a model and often one-size-fits-all solutions are simply band-aid proposals that don't get at the heart of the issue it's why i've been so frustrated that after a horrific killings of gun violence we've seen in the last few weeks that there are those who point to mental health and call it a day of course mental health is part of that equation particularly in the death uh suicide in which a gun is involved that universe of gun violence is definitely something that's the basis of mental health but i also want to make it crystal clear mental health challenges exist all around the world yet it is only the united states where we see the massive value of mass shootings taking innocent lives year after year while we certainly know that mental health issues can sometimes be part of that equation in mass shootings the root cause in my mind is the unfettered access to weapons especially killing machines like the ar-15 high-capacity magazines which are about high-capacity killing you don't need 50-100 rounds to go hunting at the end of the day so let us not complete the issue of addressing implementing common-sense gun laws repressing concern of the youth and their mental health crisis these are two distinct issues from my perspective so again thank us and thank you all for joining us at this critical conversation and with that as i said before i'll return to my colleagues if you need a champion to be with you on the other side of the capital to get things done thank you

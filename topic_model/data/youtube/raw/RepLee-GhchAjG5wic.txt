let's bring in congresswoman barbara Lee Democrat of California and a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee congressman good to see you again I was a good to run into you yesterday evening at the studio what is your take on the president's tax cuts I'm going to call it first of all it was non-starter for me the president tax cuts really quite frankly are irrelevant at this point because he hasn't released his tax return and unless he does that how will we know how he stands to gain from this from what we've seen from that one-page sheet it will line the pockets of his friends millionaires and billionaires and who's going to pay for that the most vulnerable working men and women the middle class so in no way do I even want to think about this tax plan until we see his income tax return all right let's talk about the other big thing going on somewhere around you probably not involving you is a health care negotiation that is going to try and get the freedom caucus to sign off on a health care bill this is a health care bill that the last time they floated at about a 17 percent approval rating and now they're taking out some of the good parts of it that we're left what's your sense of what happens next well purses the health care care bill that they wrote has been really a bill that would make everyone sicker again the country sicker again and it would really destroy the health games that we have made under the Affordable Care Act this just doubled bounds on how bad it is this makes a bad bill work and for the life of me I can't see how they could be this cruel here they would deny emergency care to pregnant women people in West Virginia's stand to lose they would deny mental health services they would deny all of the essential benefits that people need to stay healthy and to say well and to stay alive so it's a shame and disgrace it's immoral and it's hard to believe anyone could vote for such a mean-spirited bill we have not resolved whether or not there's going to be a shutdown most of the betting money is that there won't be but there's still some chance and a short time ago the president tweeted quote what's more important rebuilding our military or bailing out insurance companies ask the Democrats how to respond to that he is saying that calling for those continued Obama care subsidies to the insurance companies is bailing out insurance companies and that's what Democrats are supporting why you know what I hope the president doesn't know what he's talking about because people deserve health care 24 million Americans sansa lose their health care moves forward and plus they run the they have the House the Senate in the White House and so any talk of a shutdown you know really goes directly back to him what disarray they are in and how they're conducting business which is in total chaos and total disarray and hopefully they'll come to see the light very soon because the American public deserves more and what do you think's going to happen what's your what's your guessing on what's going to happen is weekend are we are we going to get a continuing resolution to keep Congress in business or we're going to have a shutdown it's really hard to know again they run the show you know you hear one thing one hour something the next hour once again you know they could not bring forward a health care bill that's going to destroy health care for 24 million people and if that's part of the deal you know I don't think they can move forward on this but again we'll have to wait and see you know it's one hour sis another hour it's that you know but again they have the house the Senate in the White House and so let's see what they do but I don't think many of us will support their overall plan congresswoman barbara Lee of California good to talk to you thank you for being with me

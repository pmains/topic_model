here to help us make some sense of what is not making any sense at all is uh Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy Senator so great to have you here on set so I'm so confused the bite Administration criticized um incessantly title 42. now they're using it but only for Venezuelans then they have a 24 000 that they're allowing in Legally but we know that's not going to be enough I'm concerned maybe there's going to be a black market for that can you help us make some sense of this it makes no good luck yeah the bite Administration effectively wants open borders effectively they want that and now it's a totally out of control even they have to do something and so they're going back to policies that the last Administration did which were the last policies that worked he campaigned against them he's got to be a little quiet about this turns out those are the ones that work and by the way if you think Venezuela is an issue you just wait and see what's about to happen in Haiti Haiti where there's gangs making uh taking we're going to stop shipping rice to Haiti because the gangs have taken over which means there'll be Mass starvation and which means Haitians will be coming across far more than Venezuela but why did they pick them as well um I'm not quite why they did it unless it's some sort of deal or trying strong arm the Venezuelan government to give us more oil you know like instead of producing our own Oil we're going to ask the Venezuelans to produce theirs I don't quite get it I'd rather jobs in Louisiana than jobs in Venezuela but that's this Administration you mentioned Haitians and we just now learned this week that mayorkas knew that the whipping story wasn't true when he went in front of the media and and disparaged these agents accountability for him coming at any point I actually think it starts at the top he's just a man taking orders and they said you're going to go out there and you're going to say this and you may have said it in true and they said we don't care you're going to say it I just say if you want accountability vote Republican in the midterms well on that topic we're looking at the midterms I think everybody believes the house will flip to the Republican control and now we're looking at the Senate and and a lot of experts are saying one or two senators here or there it could go either way if we end up in a situation where the houses in it or are republican-controlled obviously Biden's still in the white house we go back to this water issue okay they're probably not going to let you fund the wall what can you do to secure the border so so unfortunately Congress has get fortunately Congress has given the executive everything they need to secure the Border as well as it can be secured the executive doesn't want to use it it's like pushing what like pushing wet toilet paper you're trying to get it to to give you a little bit of push back you can't so the administration will not build a wall they won't enforce the law they won't you they're trying to repeal title 42. uh the best we can do no I won't say the best we will do our best to get them to enforce the laws that are there but I will say if they want to rope-a-dope if they want to pretend they can't do it they got a lot of tools at their hand to be incompetent another topic Joe Biden's on the west coast claiming that if Republicans take charge they're going to make inflation worse please translate and explain his attempt to flip what's going on sometimes you just gotta laugh I mean it's like what Joe I mean like they passed a 1.9 trillion American they called it Recovery Act it's actually our program whatever is actually the American recession uh what they did with left of center economists predicting that it would drive up inflation and it did Republicans are going to put a stop on unnecessary spending we're going to do our best to open up North American energy production can you do that um you can do that by saying okay agency until you start issuing permits we're going to put the squeeze on you power the purse the power of the purse let's hope that the that the Republicans actually use that power I mean that's all you have that's all you got Rachel it is a always a tension between an executive that doesn't want to do something and a Congress was just trying to get them and so you use whatever tool you can because what's at stake here is the family budget how do we get that family budget in better shape we know we're talking about inflation and a lot of your colleagues and would say that much of inflation or much of our economic woes come from our energy policy and uh President Biden made some news this week early Saudi Arabia did saying that the body Administration requested that oil production be cut after the midterms obviously a political move there but what does that say for looking out for Americans it says that it's cynical or you know if you're at home and you're paying that much more for your utilities and that much more for your gasoline and that much more for your your heating oil you're thinking what in the heck is happening 28 more 27 more 10 percent more five percent more your four major forms of energy we read them off this morning this Administration does not care about that Family struggling around the kitchen table to pay their bills and they're going to tell you otherwise but in practice that's true you know Joey Fairley says of course we know this is about the election that's how you know oftentimes we would react to this reality that Saudi Arabia said no to Biden's attempt to effectively meddle in the elections the other side spent four years trying to impeach Donald Trump using a phone call to say he meddled in elect none of which was true so why did they why I'm not going to ask the question why did they get away with it because we know why they get away great question Pete it's a great question because they he also threatened we're going to not give you weapons sell you weapons isn't that what happened in the Ukraine they accused Trump of of using the sale of weapons to Ukraine as a you know as a cudgel same thing yeah as a bargaining chip why why we cannot have a country with not same the same rules for both parties so Rachel I am from a state in which hundreds of thousands of people have a Better Living because we have North American energy production our my state our country our families are stronger when we develop our own resources now the president is begging other countries to increase their resources they're going to do what's in their best interest I just asked Mr President do what's in the interest of the American Family let's develop our own resources our own Supply to drive down the cost of all these fuels but drive up the wages of our fellow Americans Mr President please do that then you'll be doing your job would you guys impeach the president the way they impeach Donald Trump for the same thing so of course impeachment starts in the house and so they'll decide if there's going to be an impeachment chart should they should Republicans do that uh Rachel let's look at the charges you don't want to make impeachment a a political they do I know they do ideally there's a lot of things that I think Republicans this is more about our country and about the future that we're saying than about you know kind of a tit for attack yeah and so I so if there is something that should be impeachable he should be impeached if there's something well it's payback time I'm a little uncomfortable with that is it impeachable what he did I don't know that I mean withholding oil to the American people and telling the the Saudis to do that I don't know that before the election we know that I I I don't know if that I don't know if that breaks the Constitution and that is you know what the impeachable crime is what's amazing is that they've they've made so many charges against Trump that that were trumped up or created that it causes us to say well if that's your standard then why can't this be the same that's the frustrating part is that there are two standards and that's going to be a challenge for the incoming Congress to navigate if you get the gavel both prevent presenting an alternative but also there's a lot of people clamoring for accountability when there just hasn't been any problems and Peter I always point out to my my friends if you impeach the president who will take his place you know maybe he's more maybe smarter about this than we thought that's right that's why he's a senator yeah got it uh by the way you're a big LSU Tigers fan I am go Tigers how are we feeling uh you know we're a little bit of a rebuilding year uh we need to spread around a little bit more nil money like Georgia sell it hard because this guy's in Tennessee talking about being a fan of that ugly orange team at least he married into LSU I'd rather him being the good hands his wife is a saint the girl with an ex Tigers then does I have a she has a Justin Jefferson 18 LSU Jersey does she really in her closet the fact that you married her tells me that you're a social climber I like it guilty as charged yes for sure well Senator thanks for coming to visit us here hey thanks for having me I enjoyed it awesome thanks for having me yes sir

  COMPANIES TO PRESERVE THE PHONE  RECORDS OF MULTIPLE PEOPLE  INCLUDING SOME MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS. LET'S GET TO IT WITH DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. THANK YOU SO MUCH. APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. GOOD EVENING. A LOT TO GET TO ON AFGHANISTAN. I WANT TO START WITH THE SELECT  COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING JANUARY  6th. YOU'RE ON THAT COMMITTEE. BENNY THOMPSON, THE COMMITTEE'S  CHAIR CONFIRMING TO CNN HE WANTS TELL LACOMBE COMPANIES TO  PRESERVE PHONE RECORDS TO  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND KEVIN  McCARTHY, JIM JORDAN SPOKE WITH  TRUMP ON JANUARY 6th. WHOSE RECORDS DO YOU WANT TO  SEE? >> WELL, I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT  AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE TO THE  CHAIRMAN TO MAKE THOSE  DISCLOSURES PUBLIC OR IN A  FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT. I CAN TELL YOU THIS, WE INTEND  TO BE THOROUGH. WE WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT  TOOK PLACE BEFORE JANUARY 6th  THAT LED TO THAT TRAGIC DAY AND  THE VIOLENCE OF THAT DAY. ANYONE INVOLVED AND ANYONE WHO  HAD KNOWLEDGE WHO WOULD BE  ASSEMBLING ON THAT MALL OR THE  VIOLENCE TO COME, ANYONE THAT  FUNDED IT, WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE  WAS DOING, PEOPLE IN THE  ADMINISTRATION, WHAT THEY WERE  AWARE OF AND WHEN, WHY WE  WEREN'T REINFORCED IN THE  CAPITOL, WHY IT TOOK SO MANY  HOURS TO SEND THE NATIONAL  GUARD. SO WE WANT ANSWERS TO ALL THESE  QUESTIONS AND WE'RE NOT AFRAID  TO ASK THEM OF ANYONE INCLUDING  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, FORMER  MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION,  CURRENT PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING  WITHIN ADMINISTRATION, ANYONE  WHO HAS RELEVANT INFORMATION.  >> YEAH. LISTEN, YOUR ANSWER MAY BE  SIMILAR BUT I HAVE TO ASK IT  ANYWAYS, LETTERS ARE GOING OUT,  GOING TO BE SENT TO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES. ARE YOU ABLE TO SAY WHICH ONES  AND HOW EXPANIVE YOU SEE THIS  INVESTIGATION COMING? >> I CAN'T. I CAN SAY THIS FOLLOWS A VERY  TRADITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE PATH  WHERE YOU WANT TO GET THE  DOCUMENTS FIRST BEFORE YOU BRING IN WITNESSES SO YOU KNOW THE  RIGHT QUESTIONS TO ASK AND WE  ARE WORKING IN A VERY BIPARTISAN INDEED NON-PARTISAN WAY AND  BROUGHT ON VERY CAPABLE INVEST   -- INVESTIGATIVE STAFF. WE'RE GETTING WELL SITUATED TO  GET THIS IMPORTANT WORK DONE AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT  INVESTIGATIONS CONGRESS HAS EVER UNDER TAKEN.  >> APPRECIATE YOU TALKING ABOUT  THAT. LET'S TURN TO AFGHANISTAN, SHALL WE? WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT  YOU HEARD IN THE INTEL BRIEFING  WITH IMAGES COMING OUT OF KABUL, VOLATILE SITUATION ON THE  GROUND. THE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND AFGHAN ALLIES WHO ARE THERE AND STILL  NEED TO BE EVACUATED, GIVE ME  YOUR REAL ASSESSMENT OF THIS  SITUATION, CONGRESSMAN? >> YOU PRETTY DIRE. THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS THAT NEED TO BE  EVACUATED. AMERICANS FIRST AND FOREMOST AND U.S. RESIDENTS BUT PEOPLE THAT  HAVE A MORAL AND ETHICAL  OBLIGATION TO. THOSE WHO FOUGHT BESIDE US AND  INTELLIGENCE TO SAVE AMERICAN  LIVES AND AS WELL AS CIVIL  SOCIETY FIGURES THAT WE WERE  WORKING WITH TO TRY TO ESTABLISH A GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD PROTECT  CITIZENS INCLUDING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS AND SO THAT'S A  BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I'M  ENCOURAGED THAT WE HAVE REALLY  RAMPED EFFORTS UP IN THE LAST 24 TO 48 HOURS WITH 11,000 PEOPLE  EVACUATED IN A SINGLE DAY. THAT'S PRETTY -- THAT'S PRETTY  EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER BUT THERE  ARE SO MANY MORE YET TO EVACUATE THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF HARD  WORK AHEAD OF US UNDER DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES.  >> LISTEN, YOU'RE THERE. YOU KNOW. YOU GOT THE INTEL BRIEFINGS. YOU KNOW MORE THAN WE DO AND  CERTAINLY SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T  REVEAL. LET'S PUT UP THOSE IMAGES AT THE KABUL AIRPORT. YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE  THREAT AT THAT AIRPORT. WE'VE SEEN PLENTY OF VIDEOS  SHOWING CROWDS OF PEOPLE  DESPERATE TO GET IN. DO YOU THINK THE U.S. NEEDS TO  DO MORE TO BEEF UP SECURITY OR  DO YOU THINK THAT RIGHT NOW  THEY'RE DOING WHAT'S NEEDED TO  BE DONE? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT? >> WELL, I GUESS I WOULD SAY  THERE CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH  SECURITY AT THAT AIRPORT. IT'S SUCH A CHAOTIC SITUATION  AND WHEN YOU MASS THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE CAN GET HURT JUST BEING  IN A CROWD THAT SIZE BUT MAKES A VERY ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR OUR  ENEMIES, FOR ISIS FOR EXAMPLE  LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO  ATTACK, SET OFF A SUICIDE BOMB  IN THAT CROWD OR TAKE OUT ONE OF THOSE AIRCRAFT WITH A MAN PAD. THAT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY  CATASTROPHIC AND THEY WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT CATASTROPHE. IT'S A DIFFICULT DANGEROUS  SITUATION. WE HAVE THE BEST TRAINED  MILITARY IN THE WORLD BUT THIS  IS A FIRST CLASS, FIRST ORDER  SAFETY LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE AND  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE ALL  THE SKILLS WE HAVE.  >> YEAH, AS YOU SAY THE WORDS  GOD FORBID LET'S HOPE THAT  DOESN'T HAPPEN WHAT YOU SAID BUT YES, A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. SO YOU ALSO SAY -- YOU SAY WE  SHOULD HAVE A MILITARY PRESENCE  IN AFGHANISTAN AS LONG AS IT  TAKES TO GET TO U.S. CITIZENS  AND ALLIES AND AFGHAN ALLIES BUT THE TALIBAN SAY ANY DELAY TO  THIS AUGUST 31st DEADLINE, THEY  SAY IT A RED LINE. ARE YOU WORRIED AN EXTENSION  COULD PUT EVEN MORE LIVES IN  JEOPARDY HERE? >> WELL, I'M CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EFFORT BY THE TALIBAN  TO GO AFTER PEOPLE AFTER THE END OF THE MONTH. BUT I'M -- LOOK, I'M VERY  MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THERE  ARE STILL MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE NEED TO GET OUT AND GETTING PEOPLE TO THAT AIRPORT  IS VERY DIFFICULT AND THE END OF THE MONTH WILL BE ON US BEFORE  WE KNOW IT AND I THINK THAT WE  NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR MILITARY  PRESENCE LONG ENOUGH TO GET  EVERYONE OUT, CERTAINLY OUR OWN  PEOPLE OUT BUT ALSO THOSE WE  HAVE THAT MORAL OBLIGATION TO  HELP EVACUATE. SO LOOK, I SUPPORT THE  WITHDRAWAL OF OUR U.S. FORCES  OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE THE  RIGHT DECISION. WE COULD BE THERE ANOTHER FIVE,  TEN, 15 YEARS AND STILL BE IN  THE SAME SITUATION IN TERMS OF  THE TALIBAN TAKEOVER. BUT WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE UNTIL WE  GET ALL OF OUR PEOPLE OUT AND  THOSE THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HELP GET TO SAFETY.  >> YEAH. CNN IS REPORTING THAT THE U.S.  IS SCRAMBLING TO FILL AN  INTELLIGENCE VACUUM IN THE  AFTERMATH OF AFGHANISTAN'S  COLLAPSE. ARE YOU WORRIED THAT ALL OF THIS INSTABILITY COULD EMBOLDEN  EXTREMIST GROUPS AGAIN TO CARRY  OUT AN ATTACK YOU MENTIONED AT  THE AIRPORT BUT CARRY OUT ON  ATTACK AT HOME OR ABROAD,  CONGRESSMAN? >> WELL, LOOK, WHEN YOU DRAW  DOWN YOUR MILITARY FOOTPRINT  SOMEWHERE, YOU LOSE EYES ON SOME OF THE DANGERS THAT EXIST, BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DANGER IN THE COUNTRY IS GREATER OUTSIDE OF AFGHANISTAN IN TERMS  OF TERRORIST ATTACK THAT MAY BE  ORGANIZED AGAINST THE HOMELAND  SO THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE  WORLD WHERE AL QAEDA HAS A  BIGGER PRESENCE AND ISIS HAS A  BIGGER PRESENCE BUT OVER TIME,  THAT COULD CHANGE IN  AFGHANISTAN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO  KEEP A CLOSE WATCH TO MAKE SURE  AL QAEDA DOESN'T RECONSTITUTE  ITSELF THERE AND TAKE ACTION  AGAINST ISIS K AND MAKE SURE  THAT IT DOESN'T POSE A GROWING  THREAT TO US. THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE TROOPS  STILL ON THE GROUND BUT OF  COURSE, WHEN WE DID HAVE THE  TROOPS ON THE GROUND, THEY WERE  TARGETS AND WE WERE RISKING  AMERICAN LIVES IN THAT FASHION,  TOO. SO NOT A BRIGHT LINE HERE BUT I  THINK THE DRAW DOWN IS THE RIGHT DECISION, AND WE'RE JUST GOING  TO HAVE TO REALLY STRENGTHEN OUR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING  CAPABILITY FROM OTHER PLACES.  >> LOOK, WE APPRECIATE HAVING  OUR LEADERS ON TO SPEAK TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE ESPECIALLY  SOMEONE LIKE YOU AND THE  COMMITTE

I want to say thank you to all of our teachers today you know I can went back for my kindergarten year all the way through my senior year in high school and I remember every teacher and I had a couple of favorites mr. Berkey who taught me a lot about life skills and mrs. combs my first grade teacher who passed away when I was like brand-new Brigadier General in the Air Force and I was still called her little squirt not to her so I have quick memories of teachers but all of us do and we thank you because you've taught us how to read and write in math you know and sciences and you name it whatever something should teach and you make a big difference in all of our children's lives and this pastor has been very challenging now with the cove enviros we've had to innovate do a lot of distant learning and you've responded so on behalf of this community we say thank you to all of our teachers for your commitment to our kids

sorry my friend good morning great to be with you so now over in a house they've begun all these investigations in Byron York in the Washington Examiner and on Fox News says the House Democrats have sent a message the impeachment is on let me get your thoughts on that senator well I think that's probably right I think on the Democratic side this last election they've unleashed the angriest demons in their party and I think right now the extreme base of the Democratic Party is fueled by rage they hate present Trump and I think the next two years of a democratic house is going to be all investigations all subpoenas and all impeachment I fully expect this time next year to be right in the throes of impeachment because I think that's where the Democrats are and we're saying every day they're getting more and more extreme not looking to actually pass legislation and act policies to benefit the American people instead they're just they're just expressing their visceral rage and hatred of President Trump you know senator I wrote an article yesterday which talks about the socialism issue the socialism angle and how many social is out now avowed socialists on the Democrat side have announced that they're going to be running for president I fully believe I'm and I've felt this way now I've been doing this job for 45 years and I have felt this way all those those many years that we have been on this slow Trek that way towards socialism and they're gonna try as best they can to drag us across that line in 2020 what are your thoughts about that you know I think that's exactly right although I don't think it's slow anymore right I think that the Democratic Party that the election of Donald Trump caused the Democrats the congressional Democrats to lose their minds and and so you look at the 2020 presidential race we're gonna see more than 20 Democrats running it's going to be a crazy crowded field and they're already falling all over each other trying to gallop further and further to the left so they're embracing socialism they're calling for 70 tax rates they're embracing late term abortion right up until the moment of birth and even shockingly after birth right falling for abortion them on immigration you know it used to be that Democrats would at least claim they wanted to secure the borders not anymore now they are openly in support of open borders in fact they're saying they want to tear down the border walls we have and and this is where the energy the passion the anger and the Democratic Party is and and when it comes to socialism look my the most telling moment of the State of the Union address just a few weeks ago was when the president said America will never be a socialist country and half of the Democrats sat with their arms crossed glaring at him and refused to applaud for that they really eat each of them self-identified on that man made very very clear what they support and and what you and I understand what we have to do a better job particularly with young people explaining if socialism has been a disaster it is responsible for the poverty and misery of suffering of billions of people across the globe and if you care about poverty if you want people to be able to rise the economic ladder to be able to achieve the American dream the greatest Avenue for conquering poverty for achieving prosperity that the world has ever seen is the American free enterprise system and and and for me my number one test the next two years is explaining that and helping win people's hearts and mind because freedom works and socialism doesn't and it produces misery and suffering and poverty tell me about your education bill and what you're working on there well sure last week I introduced legislation did it working hand-in-hand with the administration with the Department of Education and it is a federal tax credit for school choice and and it provides five billion dollars a year fifty billion dollars over ten years so that if individuals or corporations give contributions to a scholarship granting organization that money is a dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit now it respects federalism it's not the federal government running this each of the states has a choice number one whether to opt in so the state doesn't want to participate they don't have to number two the states are on it not the feds the states run it so each state can set up their scholarship granting organizations however they like they can set up whatever system they have it's simply a federal tax credit to make those dollars available and and it there are two tracks there's number one the K through 12 track which would be five billion dollars a year of additional resources flowing through for K through 12 school choice number two there's a vocational and apprenticeship to trap track for adults for adults that want to learn a trade that want to get a job that also is five billion a year the impact of those would be enormous for the state of Texas in terms of helping number one helping kids get a quality education I think school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century every kid deserves access to an excellent education regardless of your race regardless of your ethnicity regardless of your wealth regardless of your zip code and and nothing can have a greater impact on Texas future than improving the educational choices and options and prospects for our kids and then on the workforce side helping adults get the skills they need to provide for their families and so both of those I'm excited about because they have a tremendous positive impact on the state of Texas everybody support those bills make sure you get in touch with the people in Congress right now and tell them to move this forward senator Ted Cruz bill on education make sure you get this done and let's let's show the support that he richly deserves and I'm gonna have a lane contact your people and we'll set up that Alamo lounge of that senator thank you as always for your time I appreciate you very good thank you thank you for everything you do trade I'll see you soon

welcome back to TMZ live the Congress has revealed the I'm sorry the impeachment hearings now have unfolded and we now know exactly what they're going after the president for its articles of impeachment they're basically saying corruption and obstruction is power and obstructed Congress in the investigation into what happened with the Ukraine so I've actually had some time to really think about this since I had a few days off and I've got a couple of things that have been in my head about how this plays out and not just in the short term so we wanted to see the impeachment plays out however yeah politically how it plays out in all sorts of ways so we wanted to get somebody from the Judiciary Committee on the show today and we're lucky enough to have a representative Karen bass from California hearing and she joins us right now congresswoman welcome to TMZ live thank you thank you so this was a bold day for the Democrats for sure not only not only machine these articles of impeachment but also really announcing a big policy change that that that could be an important step in trade I want to get into this impeachment thing and I want to ask you a couple of questions a lot of Democrats are saying that they have to do this and even if Trump gets reelected as a result of this it would be worth it because that's your duty my question yeah I don't you know no one I think it is up to us whether he gets reelected but but let's just talk about impeachment for a minute the reason why I feel it's so urgent different than the Muller report the mother report was very significant ten examples of him obstructing justice but the Ukraine situation is an example of him in the middle of committing a crime so he's robbed the bank and he's driving down the street with the money and the money is the election in 2020 so he was directly trying to cheat on the next election and as a matter of fact he still might be tried to cheat I know that Rudy Judea Leone is over in the Ukraine I don't know what he's doing except for I guess he's still going after the conspiracy but that was the urgency we had to do something to put the brakes to the best of our ability with the only tool we have is to send a message to him that he is not above the law and he cannot and should not intervene in the next election so you've got a situation where it's very clear I mean I think what you're saying is the currency that Donald Trump used was not money it was power and I get it but if after all you've done the American people reelect Donald Trump what would that say to you about the American people well you know I I guess I am ultimately an optimist and I believe that the 2020 election assuming we can stop him from trying to cheat is in our hands and so I think it's our responsibility to turn people out and I feel very positive about that if we didn't impeach him that also creates a tremendous amount of rage amongst people like in our city for example of Los Angeles people were angry that he wasn't impeached then their way of getting amount of officers to actually be and be encouraged to get to the polls and vote but now if you I guess the flip side of that is impeaching him and then he doesn't get he's not gonna be thrown out of office we know that the Senate isn't going to do that so he gets impeached but he still stays in power and that energizes him with his base to say they can't get rid of me they tried but they can't get rid of me you are right that is a scenario however if he is not thrown out of office and I do think there is a possibility in the Senate and I'll explain that in a minute then people like me are gonna use that energy to say this is why we have to take back the Senate and we have vulnerable senators and you know we only need a few seats but there is one scenario it's far-fetched but it is possible and that is a secret ballot if they had a secret ballot over there in the Senate which they have the power to do if they had a secret I think he'd be gone in a minute because the sad thing about my Republican colleagues says they know how bad this president is they know he violated the law they just defend him because if they don't defend him then he attacks them and they're afraid of losing their seat he's not gonna get convicted he will get impeached so I want to hos this to you congresswoman I've been thinking about this for the last couple of days I did some research there's no such thing really as double jeopardy in an impeachment trial because it's political so it's an act okay so I want to give you a scenario because you are a very influential member of Congress so here's my scenario suppose Donald Trump gets he's going to get impeached he's not going to get convicted suppose he gets reelected but you're right and you win back the Senate in a big way if you did that would you be inclined to take a second bite of the Apple and reintroduce the exact same impeachment articles and then send it through again a second time if you have a Democratic Senate on your side you know yes but I don't think it would be exactly the same and here's why because even though we're impeaching him you know now there's still a number of court cases there's a ton of information that could come forward for example we could get his bank records and found and find out that he's owned a hundred percent by the Russians so you are absolutely right in your scenario but the only thing I would say slightly different is is that it might not be the same articles of impeachment because the odds are we'd have a ton more information and then the odds of that sadly enough is is that you know he probably has other examples of criminal behavior in Congress you know really isn't this is a sad situation the third time in over 240 years in our history that we feel a president is so bad that we actually have to impeach him now my Republican colleagues say we're doing that just because we hate him if it was just a matter of hating him we could all wait 11 months that's not the issue here well it's a momentous week for sure and we really really appreciate you giving us the time oh I appreciate you having me on anytime [Music]

secretary kendall i apologize in advance if you've touched on this because i think i i heard you engaging with um mr banks as i was coming in the room about divestment i have more questions about the divestment uh as you're aware in last year's ndaa the senate blocked the divestment of 42 a-10 aircraft that's my understanding and that's what i want to get your thoughts on the event the inability to divest of those a-10s would potentially prohibit the bed down of f-35 squadrons at tyndall i don't know if those decisions were linked or not but with a couple questions regarding the a-10s did the inability to divest those a-10s last year have implications on the air force's air force's fifth generator or fifth generation fighter capability it has and we're still trying to figure out how to react to that the uh the maintainers who were doing the a-10s that we had planned to retire um we're going to be retraining and go to f-35s and now because they still have to do a10 we're not able to do that there are several hundred people that are affected by this so we're trying to find another solution to to that problem okay what does the status currently of the of the bed down on the f35 squadrons at tyndall i i think it's on hold until we can resolve this problem security yeah we're gonna have to delay a little bit because it's about uh having a number of credits about 950 maintainers that was in the plan from last year to to make that transition so we are as a secretary squad looking at some some other options on how we you know harvest the 950 maintainers that would actually get this back on track and as was mentioned earlier that's not an instant uh flip of the switch will those be uh a10 trained personnels that will be switching over to the new platform or it's a combination and it's a matter of uh you know as our airmen pcs and move uh we will have experience levels and we'll be able to move uh uh some of those airmen some will come from where they work in a tent they may come from other airplanes uh but it's uh being able to move those airmen around uh but having the flexibility is the key part to be able to have them available to transition from their craft together thanks uh secretary kendall continuing on this divestment theme uh this year's proposed budget calls for the divestment of 33 f-22s which as i think my math is right about a sixth of the total f 22 fleet uh we all know how important fifth gen fighters are to our our great power competition that we're we're trying to re-equip for coming out of 20 years in in the gulf but um can you expand on the potential implications of this this divestment of 5th gen aircraft which we don't have enough of already that's essentially an efficiency move for us we're we're taking out the black 20 the oldest f-22s they're less combat capable and and would not probably be employed against the high-end threat it would cost prohibitively to upgrade them about 50 million dollars per aircraft and they're used for training now and what we can do is we can substitute fully combat capable aircraft and use them for training with the ability to deploy those aircraft if we needed to so it's going to be an efficiency saving that will out not significantly impact our combat capability okay uh and yep but we're still re-winging vietnam era aircraft that clearly aren't going to play a role in in a war against some of these potential adversaries um okay so that answered that question are there any other legacy aircraft investments that could allow us to continue funding and flying these and you're saying it's cost prohibitive it it's really not if you had the money you'd invest it somewhere else besides these aircraft so there's nothing you can do software-wise or anything that airframes themselves are just too far gone to to make it worthwhile even in a training capacity cause i know supporting the budget that we requested um quite frankly though if i had more more money to spend on in the department of the air force uh it might not go to airplanes at all that might go to things like munitions electronic warfare and information security well you know one of the it's been an age-old problem of trying to to to fight like a train train like you fight it's hard as a fifth generation fighter to to go out and train we don't want to use these front line assets to train against one another and expend them in that sense what role do you see or do you see a greater role for using virtual and augmented reality on training ranges to try to avoid putting hours on these airframes that are so critical well we want to train our f22 pilots on the same aircraft they actually would use in combat so this will improve their training in that regard but we do try to do a mix of simulators uh as well as live training uh to to get the optimal mix from a cost of vitamins point of view okay all right thank you mr chairman i yield back

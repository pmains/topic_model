hello everyone annie kuster here to talk about an update on my campaign for congress i'm really excited yesterday we had a super successful canvas kickoff here in nashua and over in milford and we were also in temple and greenville and today i've just come from a forum on the issues and then we're headed to our campus kickoff in salem i want to thank every single one of our volunteers for all the work you're doing on this campaign and i want to give you a brief update about how things are going last week we got great news we're pulling ahead in all of the public polls the lead is somewhere between one point and six points so we know that every single voter that you speak with will count in this race i'm excited to report that we're up to almost 1 000 volunteers and that's the people power that's going to make all the difference in this campaign now you've probably heard that we've been hit by some pretty hard negative attacks from outside interests and even from the vast campaign but we've known all along that it's the people power of our campaign that's going to make all the difference every campaign takes time talent and resources and i want to be sure that we can respond with all three i'm super proud of the fundraising that we've done in this campaign and particularly because it's a people-powered campaign not just knocking on doors and making phone calls but every dollar that comes in as well you know we have donors that give us three dollars or five dollars or seven dollars and there's a reason we want them on board i want to be sure that i'm not just going to congress i'm changing the way people go to congress and you can be a part of that so we can all make a difference in this race it couldn't be more important our country needs our help and thanks so much i've gotta get out there to knock on doors with you good luck we're gonna win this one and you are going to make the difference

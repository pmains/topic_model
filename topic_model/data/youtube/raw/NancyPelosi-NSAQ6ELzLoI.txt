i thank him for his leadership in presenting a common sense piece of legislation to ensure that the interest on student loans is not doubled in july and to pay for that by cutting the subsidies to big oil instead of as the republicans do making it and continuing their all-out assault on women's health so much of the time that we spend on this floor seems completely irrelevant to america's working families as they're struggling to make ends meet imagine them around their kitchen tables as we talk about this that and the other thing seems disconnected from their emergency and urgent needs what we're talking about today directly relates to what keeps people up at night their economic security the education of their children the health of their families the list goes on some of those some of those are addressed in this legislation i think we all agree that the greatest thing a country can do and that a family can do is to invest in the of education narration the education of our children imagine if we're sitting around that kitchen table as a family as we are and we say as a family in order for you to go to college we're not going to be able to immunize your little brother or sister we're not going to be able to have preventive care in terms of screening for breast cancer cervical cancer the list goes on and on for your mom or any other preventive care uh for uh for men and women in our family who just would be wrong who is we who are with a nation if that's a statement of our values i have to choose between the education of your children the health of your family it's just not right especially when you have a situation where we had this fight over and over again but let me put it in context in 2007 the democratic majority in the house working in a bipartisan fashion with our republican colleagues passed a bill that ratcheted down the interest rates to 3.4 percent we were very proud of that legislation passing with 77 members of the republican party voting with the democratic majority the bill was signed by then president george w bush and we were we all celebrated that legislation that is expiring in july and if no action is taking those interest rates at 3.4 will go back to the level of 6.8 percent we have been making that argument over and over again that in our budgeting we must provide for the education of our children in a way that enables them to acquire a higher education should they desire and be qualified to do so if that's in their interest in their family's priorities republicans have grown impatient they said with hearing about student loans don't look at us until the president went to the public and clearly spelled out the public policy debate that was going on here that in the republican budget the ryan republican tea party budget there was it enabled the doubling of the interest rates in our house budget the house democratic budget we provide it for keeping it 3.4 percent a big difference if you're sitting at that kitchen table and you have a college-aged child it's about the children and the debt they incur it's about the families and the parents and the debt that their families incur because the president took the issue to the american people he made the issue too hot to handle so the republicans this week are doing about face for what they did last week which was to vote overwhelmingly for their budget which will now enable the budge the interest rates on student loans the stafford loans to double and about face but what do they do they say okay we'll we won't allow it to double but we're going to take the money from women's health should be no surprise to anyone because they have an ongoing assault on women's health and this is in their budget and this is just a continuation of that but i think it's important to note the following that they know not only in their bill call for taking the amount of money that would cover the cost of of keeping the interest rate at 3.4 percent they say while we're at it let's eliminate the entire fund let's eliminate the entire fund for prevention for the uh for the immunization for the screening and the rest for the cdc to do its public health work let's eliminate it so that should tell you something about where their priorities are if they're saying we stare once again handmaidens of the oil industry protecting subsidies for big oil and instead we want mom and the children to pay the price with their health it's just not right it's just not right the president made it clear to the public the difference in our approach on the student loan issue now he has made it clear that he will veto this bill if it contains this pay for unfortunately rather than finding common ground in a way to pay for this critical policy the statement of administration policy says of this bill includes an attempt to repeal the prevention and public health fund created to help prevent disease detect it early and manage conditions before they become severe women in particular will benefit from this prevention fund which would provide for hundreds of thousands of screenings for breast and cervical cancer this is already happening this would have to stop under this bill so let's back up for this for a moment and say we all want the most educated population in our country so people can reach their self-fulfillment whatever they decide that is so that we can be competitive in world markets so that we can have an informed electorate in the spirit of the gi bill which educated the american our soldiers when they came home created a middle class in our country which is the backbone of our democracy and in a global economy even more necessary for us to be able to have the skills and train workforce to compete let's also recognize that nothing brings more money to the treasury than the education of the american people whether it's early childhood k-12 higher education post-grad lifetime learning nuts more money to the treasury so it'd be a false economy to deter people from seeking more education and it's a adding insult to injury to say now that we finally had to fold on the issue and agree with the democrats that we should keep the interest rates at 3.4 instead of doubling to 6.8 we're going to put women and children first as those who will pay for that it's just not right i congratulate the president for his message to the american people for the message of his administration a statement of administration policy that a veto would be recommended urge my colleagues to vote no and yield back the balance of my time generally yields back her time generally from illinois mr speaker at this time i would yield three minutes

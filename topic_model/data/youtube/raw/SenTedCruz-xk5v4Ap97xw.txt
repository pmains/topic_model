[Music] thanks senator so much for doing this interview it's good to see some Texans in Washington DC so I want to get straight into it as it relates to free speech the President of the United States has signed an executive order what is Congress role in this fight when it comes to the higher ed reauthorization where do you stand on that well as you know we're seeing a growing problem in colleges and universities of free speech being suppressed and and what we've got really is sixties radicals who have taken over the administration and the faculty of universities and you know the left is in a different place but than it was in previous decades it used to be the left defended free speech you know one of the famous Supreme Court cases that went all the way up to the court involved a campus protester who wanted to wear a jacket that said eff the draft although it didn't abbreviate what they were saying in the court court upheld that students right to say that well the left has changed its views now that now the left unfortunately is afraid of debating on the merits of a whole host of issues and and so they've shifted instead to the view that that any views they disagree with need to be silenced that they need to be muzzled that they label unacceptable views that are contrary to the Orthodox views on the far left I think that really destroys the the whole purpose of a university education which is to learn to learn how to think to learn how to debate to learn how to reason so what does Congress is gonna do the crackdown on that well I I think we ought to include within the higher education authorization a restriction on federal funds that if you are going to be silencing the free speech rights of your students that you're not gonna be getting federal funds it's it's it's simple and straightforward Congress has used that tool before to say that we're not going to fund discrimination we're not going to fund conduct that it that that is violating constitutional rights and I think that's a lever that we should be using today interesting poll 41% this is a new poll of college students believe that hate speech should not be protected by the Constitution does that surprise you you know it doesn't because unfortunately students the they're not being taught to think I mean what what is defined as hate speech by the way is anything the Left disagrees agrees with you yeah you know look the the first amendment wasn't designed for popular speech you actually don't need the First Amendment if what you're saying is popular the First Amendment was designed to protect unpopular speech to protect minority views to protect views that are not in in common agreement and and particularly the whole point about a college experience is learning to confront views you've never seen before you don't want what when I went to college and and law school I took a number of classes from Marxists now listen my family comes from Cuba my family was imprisoned was tortured my aunt might the asagna was tortured by Fidel Castro's goons I don't view communism as a theoretical matter it's it's it's a very personal matter to me because my family suffered under communism but you know what I was perfectly happy to take classes from Marxist not because they convinced me to become a Marxist but because I wanted to understand how they thought I want to understand what they believed I wanted to engage in the intellectual dialectic that's what a good education is about and and so if you have a view you disagree with look we have all these young socialists that are embracing socialism well if you want to be a young socialist how about you actually engage with defenders of free enterprise how about you actually engage in the facts that socialism has produced poverty and misery and suffering for billions across the globe and the greatest enemy poverty has ever seen in the history of mankind is the American free enterprise system that dialectic engaging on the substance is incredibly important you know you know right now we see the battles on campus over sexual orientation and gender identity you know I guess facebook now has I think at latest count fifty seven different genders I kind of sad I don't know what fifty seven different record with it maybe it is but that statement there some of these knuckleheads would say oh that's hate speech what you you if you suggest they're not fifty-seven genders your society people yeah it by the way it is of course all those folks who talk about the virtue of science unless it concerns x and y chromosomes that that is verboten science you know at the end of the day everyone just needs to count to ten relax Minh actually debate issues with a smile you know not everything has to be life or death not everything has to be if you disagree with me you're evil and must be destroyed you know I member when I was in college I was in the debating society and I chaired the Conservative Party in the debating society the Speaker of the Liberal Party was a very good friend of mine and we used to have debates all the time big public debates on campus we would blast each other and disagree vigorously on on important issues and then at the end of the debate he and I would go out and get a beer and you know I you know he'd called me a fascist I'd call him a communist and we don't heard another beer but like relax and and part of learning is learning how to discuss and disagree with people who may have different views and and to understand them that universities are undermining their core missions when they seek to censor and blacklist speech they disagree with you think they're doing that to the Christian faith as well a yell law school you sent out a letter yesterday and you said they are discriminating against traditional Christian views yes why do you say that and what do you plan on doing to combat breath so yell a couple of months ago announced a new financial aid policy Yale has stipends that it gives law students during the summer when they go work at Public Interest firms and it also has loan forgiveness plans for people after they graduate when they go work at Public Interest firms and that policy historically is applied wherever that wherever the Yale student decides to go well Yale announced a new policy that it would apply for anywhere the student chooses to go unless that student chooses to go to a Christian organization that believes in traditional marriage or traditional sex with a nonprofit organization even though it's nonprofit those views Yale has decided are unacceptable and if you look at the history of where this policy came from it really appears that it was targeted at one group a group called the Alliance defending freedom which is a national public interest law firm that defends religious liberty cases all over the country and you may remember the Colorado Baker's case of a baker in Colorado who's a strong Christian and and who did not want to bake a cake and celebrate a same-sex wedding and and he was he was persecuted for that and that case went all the way to the US Supreme Court and the Supreme Court said he has a First Amendment right to live according to his faith and he can't be forced to celebrate a same-sex wedding which which he believes is contrary to his faith now that decision the Alliance defending freedom ATF they were his lawyers yeah and so they won that victory at the Supreme Court one of those ATF lawyers was on campus at Yale was talking about the case and the LGBT group on campus it's called outlaws at Yale my kind of a clever play on word they got angry and and they protested that that this lawyer was coming to campus and and they demanded the administration change its policy and so this change in financial aid policy appears to be a direct response to this complaint and and what it seems to be the case is that this policy was drafted to single out 80 F ATF has every summer what they call Blackstone fellows which are law students that come work work for the summer with them and it appears it's those Blackstone fellows that Yale wants to punish any Yale student who has the audacity to decide to go be a Blackstone fellow and work at ATF and and so you asked what can we do about it well I chair the Constitution subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee and so the Constitution subcommittee has launched an investigation into Yale's religious discrimination against people of faith you say you want all the documents involving this that's right so this week we submitted a formal formal request for production of all the documents and so Yale's defense when I initially open the investigation they said no no no this had nothing to do with this organization this is a general policy well let's let's see the correspondence let's see the documents let's see the discussions because what we know publicly it sure seems that all of that is a pretext to cut off any Yale students being able to choose to go work at ATF and among other things federal civil rights law prohibits discrimination based on religious faith and Yale gets very substantial amounts of federal funds and if they're going to take the federal funds they need to comply with the federal civil rights if you find out that they violated these students what it appears to be their civil rights what do you do to take those funds away what process does because this is a bureaucracy right how do you get both Democrats and Republicans to agree on that to strip those funds away though senator well we want to first lay out the facts that's the first step of an investigation what happens after that one thing the investigation could result and it could result in legislation now it could result in legislation making the protections even clearer and more explicit to be honest that legislation is not likely to pass this Congress mm-hmm as long as Nancy Pelosi is leading a Democratic House I'm not going to hold my breath there with the press executive order though well it could potentially happen through executive action it could also potentially one of the results of this investigation that's certainly possible is that the Constitution subcommittee could make a referral to the Department of Justice for either criminal prosecution or for a civil action depending on what the facts are and what we discover but that that is an outcome that is entirely possible asking the Department of Justice to go and investigate and move forward in this case

On behalf of Gayle, myself
and the entire Manchin family, we wish all West
Virginians and Americans a Merry Christmas and a
Happy Holidays. During this season of giving and
reflection, Gayle and I are reminded of the
importance of family, the source of life's greatest
joys and deepest bonds. Growing up in Farmington,
my parents taught me that if you can count your
blessings you can share your blessings. This
lesson has stuck with me throughout my life and it
is a message I have proudly passed along to my
children and grandchildren. We are
blessed to have loving families and friends, a
beautiful state to call home, and the knowledge
that we are truly a statewide community with
an unbreakable bond. In West Virginia, we look out
for one another during good times and bad. Not
only is this good for the soul, but it makes West
Virginia the best place to work, live and raise a
family. Gayle and I encourage all West
Virginians to join us this holiday season in praying
for the safety of our fellow West Virginians,
frontline workers, servicemembers and
Veterans, as well as thanking them for their
service to our nation. Let us also pray for peace,
joy, and a greater understanding of one
another that can bring our nation closer together. As
this year comes to a close, let us all reflect
on our many blessings and look forward to a healthy
and happy new year. May God continue to bless the
great state of West Virginia and the United
States of America.

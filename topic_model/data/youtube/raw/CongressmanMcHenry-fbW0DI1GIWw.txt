  WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN  FROM NORTH CAROLINA SEEK   RECOGNITION? >> TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE  MINUTE AND TO REVISE AND EXTEND  MY REMARKS.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION, JISE 1. >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. HERE IN WASHINGTON WE HAVE --  WE ARE IN THE MAJOR DEBATE.  MR. MCHENRY: THE PLAN UNVEILED   IS A TAX PLAN FOR MIDDLE   INCOME, MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES  IN AMERICA.  IF YOU'RE MAKING $59,000,  FAMILY OF FOUR, THAT IS THE  FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE, THE  MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN  AMERICA, YOU'LL RECEIVE A  $1,200 TAX CUT AS A RESULT OF  THE PLAN THAT WE UNVEILED  TODAY. THAT'S REAL MONEY FOR  MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES IN NORTH   CAROLINA.  IT'S REAL MONEY, MAYBE NOT IN  WASHINGTON, D.C., BUT IT'S REAL  MONEY IN WESTERN NORTH   CAROLINA.  WE NEED TAX CUTS.  WE NEED TAX SIMPLIFICATION.  WE NEED ECONOMIC GROWTH, MORE  AMERICAN JOBS, MORE COMPETITIVE  ENVIRONMENT IN AMERICA SO WE   CAN KEEP JOBS HERE IN THE  UNITED STATES AND NOT OFF-SHORE  THOSE JOBS.  WE NEED MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES  TO WIN.  OUR PLAN DOES THAT AND I URGE  MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT OUR   EFFORTS.

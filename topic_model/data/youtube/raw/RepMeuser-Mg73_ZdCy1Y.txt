uh a report's coming out that the u.s is in talks with energy producing countries and companies around the world to try to create a plan to divert supplies of energy oil and natural gas to europe if necessary should russia invade ukraine but is this the right strategy pennsylvania congressman dan muser took to twitter to point this out saying dependence on foreign fuel is devastating the american economy american energy is affordable energy hashtag biden by the numbers joining us now to the skies pennsylvania congressman and member of the house foreign affairs committee congressman dan muser congressman what's your thought on what's going on right now well you know just uh two short years ago we were energy independent as a as a nation uh since joe biden came into office all of that has changed uh we've we've done everything possible to rattle our domestic energy industry pushing prohibiting the expansion on federal lands canceling the keystone pipeline of course and our banking systems are being regularly threatened frankly investments in and fossil fuel companies uh meanwhile of course the uh the famous approval of the nordstrom ii uh so so somehow our other pipelines are okay from russia to germany but not so from canada to the united states of america uh all of this just builds up to create no investment certainly not capital investment taking place in the energy industry and um a shortage of supplies yeah take a look at this these energy increases since 2021 gas up 49.6 and utility gas service up 24.1 percent um and i'd asked this question earlier if in fact uh russia does invade ukraine specifically the crimea the crimea uh region don boss that area specifically what impact will that have for us here in the united states well it'll it'll be very impactful really for the whole world again particularly since we rely upon the middle east and in fact russia believe it or not we get imports from russia into new england because we have don't have a pipeline that goes across new york state from the marcellus shale in pennsylvania the second largest reserve in the world to new england so we're doing a lot of things kind of backwards and we we need to straighten that out now um if the uh one thing that the bite administration just earlier today did announce they stated and hopefully they stand up to it that the nordstream 2 will be cancelled if an invasion takes place so it does seem as if the byte administration up very late in the game here uh but is starting to respond in the superpower of substantive manner um with so put the sanctions back in place that biden lifted which allowed nordstrom 2 to continue uh when he took office that's right that's right reversing the earlier decision should again letting putin make the first move first if they were to invade so i believe that that should be done now uh many of these other uh consequences including sanctions should as well be and force russia to pull back then we can talk about uh future matters russia's making a lot of money right now in oil it's their main product and the price of oil has gone up to 88 a barrel it was down in the 60s before christmas now we're at 88 a barrel gas supply also a major concern in the event that mr putin decides to weaponize it here's what secretary blinken had to say about it we're in discussions with governments and major producers around the world about surging their capacity we're engaged in detailed conversations with our allies and partners about coordinating our response including how best to deploy their existing energy stockpiles all this effort is aimed at mitigating price shocks and ensuring that people in the united states europe and around the world have the energy they need no matter what russia decides to do congressman your comments well you know the bbb initiative removes repeals the intangible drilling cost deduction that's a huge deduction for drilling that has existed i think for about 150 years um i i think uh secretary blinken and certainly president biden will be focusing on on reinvigorating our domestic energy resources as opposed to pleading around the world in preparation you know they're they're making this imminent and inevitable with the moves being taken along with these pleas going out to the other end energy producing countries where of course we're we're actually the best at this point uh we're we're um abandoning we're the only country in the world that has abandoned our embassy in in the ukraine so you know this administration is really mismanaging this very serious uh situation on many fronts yeah and some of these liquefied natural gas companies in turn also now stand to make a lot of money as well as a result of of what's happened with russia and you know nordstrom 2. it's it's just interesting to look at and see who will will benefit from all of this agreed again though we if we're learning anything here energy is national security uh we need to be a pro domestic energy producing not continue to uh literally be on the uh uh on the attack of our own domestic energy companies energy um independent uh congressman dan muser thank you very much for joining us thanks heather thanks bob

california democratic congressman select committee member and house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff chairmanship i appreciate you joining us i want to get to today's testimony but the former president late tonight just released a 12-page response to your committee's committee accusing you among other things of hiding evidence cherry picking what testimony to release he claims that quote manga witnesses had quote their very lives turned upside down do you want to even respond just to be clear witnesses knew they were being recorded and knew their testimony might become public is that accurate yes and look i only had a chance to skim the former president's latest lengthy diatribe but what was most notable to me was it's more of the same big lie uh he repeats a lot of the the claims uh that were debunked long ago and you played a nice montage of all the people talking about how um you know how much bs that was well the bs goes on uh and it goes on a great length this is the the thing that uh we really want to get across and that is that big lie about our election that began before the election with the president laying the foundation and saying you couldn't trust the election if he lost it and that votes counted after election day were going to be suspect even though he knew that because of all the absentees votes would have to be counted after election day that big lie that ultimately led to a violent attack on our capital he continues to push out to this day and there are people running on that big lie running to be the person who'd be in charge of next elections in in states it became clear today that the then president was told over and over and over by the people close to him his attorney general his campaign manager his own family that he lost the election how key is that to your committee's investigation i think it's very important for the public to know uh that is that the president was told by his own people at the highest levels that there's no merit to this uh there's no way that uh these allegations could be true uh and uh you know the president you were saying is claiming that these are cherry-picked uh statements um i don't know how you could cherry pick when your own attorney general says you're full of bs essentially um but uh it is important to show the country that uh this wasn't a president who was merely mistaken or just merely misled this was willful on his part he knew he lost he was told that he lost he was told that these claims that people are making were crazy uh it didn't matter to him and uh and even when the capital was attacked he certainly watched it uh he thought that uh you know the vice president may have had it coming um and uh and so this is who he is and and to those of us that watched him carefully over the last five years it's not at all a surprise but it is quite quite a dangerous thing the select committee's chairman benny thompson told reporters tonight the committee will not be making any criminal referral to the department of justice regarding the former president or anyone else in his orbit do you agree with that decision even the committee uncovers evidence of criminal wrongdoing you know i haven't uh seen the pres the determined statements uh we haven't had a discussion about that so i don't know that the committee has reached a position on whether we make a referral or what the referrals might be um i thought we were deferring that decision until we concluded our investigation at least that's my understanding on top of raising a quarter billion dollars for an election integrity fund that didn't actually exist your colleague congresswoman zoe lofgren told rj tapper that kimberly gilfoyle was paid 60 thousand dollars for her very brief speech at the ellipse on january 6. does the former president control how all that money raised is spent uh you know i don't know who has their hands on that money and how it's allocated uh the principal point that we want to get across during the hearing today was that the lie the big lie was not only destructive to the country it was also used to build the president's own supporters uh to to get money from them uh under the claim that it was going to be used to defend their position on the election and it wasn't for that purpose there was no such fun uh and instead that fund can be used as a kind of slush fund in terms of who controls it what oversight uh it's anybody's guess and at this point i'm not sure i could tell you you said on abc over the weekend that you think there's credible evidence of criminal activity on the part of the former president that sounds like you would want that referred to the justice department even if if benny thompson says that they don't have plans to do that well i think that any credible evidence that the president united states the former president was engaged in criminal activity or anybody else for that matter needs to be investigated and it's not just me that thinks that there is credible evidence federal judge david carter of course has said that multiple times on the basis of his view of a far more limited set of evidence than what than what the committee possesses so my point is that you know a president doesn't get a pass and particularly if the department of justice takes the position as it did while he was president that you can't indict a sitting president to then take the position as a practical or prudential matter that it would be too controversial or perceived as political to investigate criminal activity potentially criminal activity of a former president confers a kind of immunity on the president which is a dangerous idea but we've obviously heard statements like this in the recent past about president trump that he did something criminal we've seen the former president investigated before you were obviously involved in some of those cases and criminally so far nothing has been proven in the court of law well certainly true that uh he hasn't been charged with a crime uh now there are multiple investigations going on so that might change my point is though that if there is credible evidence of criminal activity and here i believe there is it needs to be investigated ultimately it's up to the department of justice whether they believe they have proof beyond a reasonable doubt uh such that they feel comfortable moving forward with indictment but i don't think you can just not investigate uh i think it has to be looked at uh it has to be looked into just as it would for any other uh us citizen or non-citizen for that matter nobody gets a pass nobody should get a pass if the rule of law applies equally to everyone congressman schiff i appreciate your time thank you

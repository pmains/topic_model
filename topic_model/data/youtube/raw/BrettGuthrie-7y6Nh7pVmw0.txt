I recognize the ranking member for five minutes Thank You church to get for bringing this important hearing together and we are working together to try to get to the bottom of what's happening in the insulin prices and hopefully use that as a case study for looking at others it's not just rebates are not only in the insulin space but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 30 million individuals are nine point four percent of the population in the United States have diabetes a 2018 American Diabetes Association report found that diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the United States according to this analysis the economic cost of a diagnosed diabetes the United States and 2017 was 327 billion dollars the CDC estimates in 2016 about six point seven million Americans aged 18 and older use insulin the only an insulin prescribed in diabetics today is different than insulin discovered over a hundred years ago changes to this life-saving drug over the years meant that according to the American Diabetes Association almost everything has changed over the past 50 years for Americans with diabetes including how long I diabetic can expect to live however the list price of insulin has increased substantially over the past decade putting this life-saving drug out of reach for too many Americans according to a 2016 study the average list price of insulin nearly tripled between 2002 and 2013 many argue that while this prices have been increasing net prices have not grown as rapidly having stayed relatively the same or even gone down for example one popular insulin product at its list price increased from three hundred ninety one dollars in 2014 to five hundred and ninety four dollars in 2018 a 51 point nine percent increase during the same time however the products net price decreased by eight point one percent going from one hundred forty seven dollars two hundred thirty five dollars while no one is supposed to pay the list price for insulin some patients end up paying the list price or close to it especially if they are uninsured or underinsured an uninsured patient that purchased insulin at the pharmacy is likely to pay the list price for the medicine unless they have access to a patient assistant program further even if a patient has insurance increasing list prices oftentimes directly harms patients by increasing their out-of-pocket costs if they have a high deductible health plan as many Americans do today they're likely to go pay the list price or close to it until they reach their deductible while patient assisted programs can be helpful resource to patients we have heard from patients and patient advocacy groups that it can be difficult to qualify for a patient assistance program patient assistant programs are viewed as a helpful resource but only as a band-aid and short-term solution until we can find a permanent solution that improves access to and affordability of medicines such as insulin in addition we have heard the formulary exclusions are helpful to drive down cost to the plans we've also heard that they are having an impact on patients in the diabetic community we have heard stories that some patients have had their insurers change the insulin products covered by their plan year to year or even in some cases in the middle of the year causing them to have to switch to a different insulin product or pay a higher price for the insulin that has been working best for them doctors and patients have shared that it can take days or weeks for someone to adjust to a new insulin if they adjust at all the prescription drug supply chain is complex and it lacks transparency there is a there is limited public information regarding changes in net prices due to a lack of transparency surrounding rebates and other price concessions this makes it difficult to fully understand what prescription drug prices like insulin have continued to rise for patients especially uninsured and underinsured patients this lack of transparency makes it hard to determine who benefits from increases in list prices but we know who loses the patient prescription drug prices affects every American and that's what today's discussion using insulin as a case study is important step to better understand the rising cost of prescription drugs in our country and how we can work to make life-saving prescription drugs more affordable for all patients again I thank all of our witnesses for being here today and sharing your testimony and I look forward to this important discussion and

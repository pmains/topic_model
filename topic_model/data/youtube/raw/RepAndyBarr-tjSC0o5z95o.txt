right now full disclosure folks long ago in far away there was a set of repeated grandfathers that were called henry clay keane and if you go to henry clay high school in lexington kentucky you have an interior knowledge of the whigs their success and their failure in the 19th century andy barr joins us now he is a member of the gop which is what you are in kentucky and joins us from the 6th congressional district and from the capital of this nation andy you more qualified than mitch mcconnell to talk about this trap of your gop going the way of the whigs what do the republicans do to not repeat henry clay's history well that's a great question and obviously there is some soul searching anytime you lose a presidential election a party should do that uh we're doing that um and i think we've come to a good place uh as as of last night with our meeting to make sure people understand the republican party is a big tent diverse party we have a small number of colleagues who voted to impeach the president a large number of members who voted against impeaching the president but we recognize that we need to attract a lot of people to the republican party because we're the party of free enterprise and limited government and as you see from this president it's a very different story we have a president preaching bipartisanship is your party too frugal are the republicans to austere for 2022 no we've no not at all in fact some would argue we're not fiscally responsible enough given the four trillion dollars that we borrowed last year in response to the pandemic but the truth of the matter is we have over a trillion dollars in unspent stimulus funds uh left and we're rushing to borrow another two trillion dollars that's why you're not seeing a lot of bipartisanship uh unfortunately the president is not working with republicans they're using a budget procedure to ram through this two trillion dollars in come on you guys use the same procedure stop it what we did you did the same procedure last time around we we certainly did and there's nothing inherently wrong with using the procedure but if you want to be bipartisan about it you don't use that procedure frankly and uh this president has said that he wants to be bipartisan but when he had the opportunity to do it he's obviously turned away from that congressman we've got to get through a lot of topics not just stimulus but also on regulation i understand you're on the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations as well given the events in the last couple of weeks in financial markets leading the administration is secretary yellen do you think she needs to recuse herself from this well i don't know if she needs to recuse herself but what i want to see from uh secretary ellen is a little bit of uh caution and deliberation and not a lot of overreaction to this the broader markets are are are doing just fine obviously there was volatility with respect to reddit fueled trades on game stock and other amc and other uh equities but that's actually as a result of the advent of zero cost trading and the democratization of access to the capital markets that's not a bad thing and i think what you're seeing is the markets actually functioning fairly well with market discipline setting in both uh with the hedge funds we're learning a lot about uh zero cost trading and the influx of day trading and what that means for their short positions it means that short squeezes are very possible and i think there's market discipline that will set in with these hedge funds and professional wall street uh professionals on the other hand i think a lot of the day traders and the small investors are learning about capitalism learning that fundamentals matter learning that earnings and valuation matter and that on the downside of this rally as as investors get in too late in the rally and as they get too far away from valuation there is a big risk associated with that too so the market is actually working of course it's appropriate for the sec and congress to look at whether or not any laws have been violated from a market manipulation standpoint but to me at this point doesn't look like any illegal activity and certainly doesn't look like any systemic risk congressman there is a larger debate though about anonymity on social media and the ability of unknown actors to act manipulatively to act without oversight from regulators potentially from within or from without uh from outside of the country how much is the direction of questioning going to go toward that issue i think there will be some questions about social media there's questions about social media all the way around both in terms of financial marketplaces but also in the marketplace of ideas and that's always appropriate for us to look at social media the role of social media but i think the more information generally the better people need to understand the sources of that information but at the end of the day i believe that democratization of access to capital the advent of low-cost no-cost trading platforms and more information right it's a good thing it's it's not illegal to share stock tips or ideas about the equity markets congressman bar very quickly here not enough time i don't care about that what i care about are we going to endure with another running of the kentucky derby may 1st yes we will in fact i've talked to churchill downs they're never going to do what they did last year and shut down the derby on the first saturday may uh and that's a good thing as co-chairman of the congressional horse caucus we want the derby to be back on the first saturday in may we hope it will be with spectators no go we'll see if we'll get this as a foreigner i'm not sure if that caucus even exists or not right he does not exist it's not a thing [Laughter] no look you know uh there there's a lot of betting that goes on in kentucky there and there's some uh you know there's some there's some specula of trading that we've seen but you know what i love i love that um you know a lot of the millennials uh are participating in the stock market now and some of uh some people have said that millennials are more open to socialism it looks like from this gamestop story that many millennials are more interested in capitalism that is a good thing i just want to find out who's running the book down on capitol hill for the republicans great to catch up andy let's continue this dialogue andy bar there republican from kentucky congressman thank you

and South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy mace all right um Nancy mace I'm going to start with you uh I'd say these things we've got to fight back and people say well how do you fight back what do you do you showed us this week you put out a video um sticking it to Nancy Pelosi um tell us your position on fighting back against this madness well I walked into the office in my DC office on Thursday morning to learn that Nancy Pelosi had told and interacted the Capitol Hill Police to arrest people who are visiting the capitol and our staff to be arrested if they were not wearing a mask and I totally lost it I absolutely lost it it is authoritarian and it's wrong and if and if you want to prove that vaccines have efficacy the last thing you need to do is message that vaccines don't work by telling Americans that they might be arrested and that they'll have to wear a mask outside to protect the unvaccinated I had a really terrible bout of covid-19 I had long covet and I've been you know pushing and encouraging people to consult with their medical their doctors and their Physicians to get vaccinated to help put a stop to this thing but I'm old enough to remember when President Trump when he was president and it was a left calling him authoritarian well this is the very definition of authoritarian and I was interested in one of your colleagues Dan Crenshaw said you know very directly said look just ignore them just just ignore all this stuff and I just I mean we hear this term Civil Disobedience a lot in this debate and I know our audience feels incredibly strongly about this whether they live in a and I think it's important here because you know obviously many it depends where you live you know in South Carolina in your state you know they've got there's there's a ban I think on schools imposing these Moss mandates so you know different places have different rules but generally speaking I think there there's a proud and Noble tradition of refusing to obey unjust laws and I think that also applies to unjust rules made by an elected bureaucrats don't you think oh absolutely and this is really about stoking fear and a fiasco rather than facts the CDC data that they've been using last week is total bump and in fact it was a study from another country not using vaccines that we used here I had four words for Nancy Pelosi last week it was come and get me um and I and I do believe that and you saw Republicans because masks are mandated on the house side of the chamber but not on the Senate side in their chamber and you saw that Civil Disobedience peacefully trying to prove the hypocrisy and the stoking of fear this is not based on science and it's wrong and we need leadership in this country our nation is divided and this is not the way to encourage people to get vaccinated and anyone that's watching watching tonight can go to Nate silver in 538 and look at the statistics it is people in low-income areas that are not getting vaccinated we didn't need to ensure that we're going into those areas that we uh have access to vaccines and we're encouraging and communicating and educating those areas so that we can put a stop to the Delta variant in any other variants that come forward now now and in the future exactly now Dr McCary you know I don't expect you to weigh in on the politics of all this uh you're here for your medical expertise but one thing I noticed and I wanted to talk to you about as soon as I read it your brilliant piece in the Wall Street Journal a number of really important points there one of them that really stood out to me was your your criticism of the cdc's own data collection Nancy mace mentioned the poor data there but this goes right back to the beginning of the pandemic you know we we were here over a year ago saying publish the the details of who exactly is really getting into trouble with this disease so that we can really help people prepare but you know the comorbidities all of that you wrote that they still aren't doing that properly you know it's inexplicable with 21 000 employees how the CDC has not investigated the reported 335 deaths they can't even tell us how many deaths that have been in kids under 12. it's probably about 100 to 200 and they can't tell us if they had a pre-existing medical condition or were healthy and Dr wilnitski has been asked several times were any of those kids how healthy and she says she doesn't know how do you not know when we're imposing tremendous restrictions on 50 million kids and even this week announcing with such certainty was with such an absolute nature and fervor that every child K through 12 needs to be masked even if they're vaccinated even if they're in a low outbreak community in America despite the fact not a single study has ever shown that masks work in kids we're extrapolating from adults but we if no healthy kid is dying and the risk is very slow by the way there's more kids with RSV in the hospital right now than with covet infection that's an infection that causes the common cold where's the data it's remarkable 42 billion dollars is spent by the NIH last year and not a single study on masks and kids I mean why do you think that is I mean why is the the CDC used to be held up I mean you hear it over and over again the world's number Premiere public health agency it seems to be operating as a shambles through this pandemic I feel as if they've already decided that every human being needs to be vaccinated regardless of any other Factor regardless if they're extremely low risk regardless if there's complications from the second dose of the vaccines in teenagers regardless if they have natural immunity it has been a top-down decision early on that that is what the directive is going to be and they are sticking to it and even she suggested in the interview with Brett Baird that kids will need to get vaccinated under 12. we haven't even seen the Ditty yet the trial is not even read out yet how do you make that conclusion already as your Baseline assumption yeah it's really shocking actually Jason uh what's your reaction to all this well I think Dr McCary it makes a very valid point I want people to digest it and that is they're making the political decision before the data is in the way to properly do this is to show the public the data let the medical professionals across the country uh examine that data and then the CDC can come in a couple days later and say based on this data you can all see why we're making this decision but it's quite the opposite and the problem particularly with Dr fauci is he's so invested in protecting now his self and what he said and he said multiple different things about the same topics that now you need to dismiss them he needs to be fired he needs to go nobody trusts Dr fauci and and he has a political Personal Agenda to protect his reputation and I think if President Biden wanted to try to do the right thing he would fire this guy and get rid of him and put somebody else in that America could believe in but right now you you really can't and to Nancy mace's point to the to the congresswoman remember Nancy Pelosi was making this directive I don't believe there's a direct rule that gives her this but at the same time she's saying she's going to arrest people like Nancy mace who already has some immunity to it evidently having gone through it before and her staff it was Nancy Pelosi who posed for a photo and took off her mask for a photo opportunity how come she wasn't arrested she doesn't get to live under different rules than everybody else but that's the way the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi role and Dr McCary what are they doing with this the Panic they're creating over the Delta Varian as as you know that we've got good news here we saw it in the UK the decoupling of case rates from from hospitalizations and deaths it's not the same pattern we saw before so why are they stoking this Panic people are people are conflating two entirely different things happening right now one is breakthrough infections where you test positive after you have immunity those are often asymptomatic and sometimes they're mild they're never severe or deadly cases the other thing that's happening is the virus is ripping through in a more contagious form through that 10 to 20 percent of the adult community in America who has not yet been vaccinated and they don't have natural immunity that's where we should be spending our effort encouraging that last segment of the population where there's a real risk to their own health not arresting people who are vaccinated and forcing young kids to wear masks we need to focus on that 10 to 20 by the way the biggest barrier to vaccine hesitancy in the United States right now is the U.S federal government the FDA has not issued full approval despite an impeccable safety profile and last Quick word announcements I just want you to get the broader picture it's not just on the pandemic it's right across the board it's this mixture of incompetence and top-down authoritarianism that's so toxic it's shocking but it's it's very scary as well to see this happening literally I have a front row seat to seeing this out there to authoritarism happening in our country and I learned a few days ago that if you were a tourist and you're going to Mexico and trying to re-enter the United States and go home you must you're required to test negative for coven 19. and look what's happening at the border we're allowing people thousands of people to come over across the border every day no masks no vaccinations no testing um this isn't putting our citizens in our country first at the moment or our kids and let's look at where the hot spots are let's go in and fix this but no one's shutting down the border and I saw Lance Gooden the other day Tweet now when is the CDC going to recommend shutting down the border to stop these hot spots and stop the Delta variant it's so idiotic

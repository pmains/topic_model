great welcome everyone good morning thanks for joining I'm congressman Ted Joyce I represent Florida's 22nd congressional district and I am joined here so far by and lady we're we're thankful also to have the strong support of Frances Rudy Rudy Carson Fitzpatrick two of our Republican colleagues unfortunately due to scheduling conflicts are unable to make it this morning Bob a statement that I'll read from congressman pruney we're here this we talk about the of the Trump administration's National Climate Assessment ward of the same types of disasters that have already cost the United States more than 400 billion dollars just since 2015 and then there's the report that came out just yesterday from the UN Environment Program showing that greenhouse gas emissions get a record high in 2017 and and that we're going to be in the spirit trouble limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius and of course they're those follow the to those to follow the major UN study from October that laid out the urgent changes to get our world on is not sustainable it's not survivable we return when it comes to our our problems and I'm ready stand ready to work with consider other parts of the climate change challenge like encouraging research and development energy options more energy efficiency and so many other issues that we can tackle this is a complex and difficult challenge but we cannot be the generation that allows a runaway train we've got to put the brakes on climate change with the introduction of this bill we're taking the step a significant step to show our colleagues and the country that there is a bipartisan solution to climate change that faces the risks to our health our environment and our economy head-on and the price to end our reliance is necessary but it's necessary not only for Florida and America but for the world for us to take this bold step despite partisan stuff so I want to thank in particular our colleagues representative Bruni as well as representative fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania to Republicans on the bill who are helping us in this effort reducing our carbon dependency is key to winning the fight against climate change that's what this is all about this was clear for more than ten years ago after hosting Florida's first national climate change summit as governor of Florida we worked to limit carbon emissions during that period recent primer reports as Ted referred to the Trump administration snow report lends urgency to this issue at this point in time continued inaction would be catastrophic event for our environment our economy and our people's health we are taking a historic step with the introduction of this bipartisan legislation Congress must act the urgency of this crisis demands and I want to turn it back over to my my dear friend and my wonderful colleague before before train over to Daniel ray Richter the vice president of government affairs for the sloppy Emily did share a statement that Congress or ANSYS Rooney and asked us to read for him this is from Congress ready to let the free market price to let the free market price out coal we should consider a value price as a requirement a revenue-neutral carbon fee is an efficient market driven incentive to move toward natural gas in a way from Paul and to support emerging alternative sources of energy grateful to congressman Rudy and with that I'd like to turn this over to the endo Richter AB there are so many groups who have been so involved in getting to this point but the citizens climate Lobby with the emphasis on the citizens who in chapters all across the country went out to talk to their elected officials speak out about the importance of moving forward to address climate change this group of citizen activists really has helped to move the needle I'm grateful to all of them and I will turn it over to Dave introducing the energy this policy comes as a result of these members really listening to their constituents responding to their concerns citizens climate Lobby has over 100,000 supporters in twice a year hundreds of them traveled to here to washington d.c to speak with their members of congress face to face many of those volunteers live in these some answers districts there in Florida Pennsylvania Maryland and all across the country they come in to their representatives offices as neighbors as local business owners as parents as Grandparents they've expressed their concern about sea level rise flooding their streets about poor air quality making their kids asthma worse about all the evidence they see right there the climate is changing yet again the climate change is real scientists agree that humans are causing it and that we have to act earlier this fall the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out its latest report saying this that report specifically focus on a price on carbon pollution as a way forward today these five members are eating that call and introducing the broad effective climate legislation we need the energy innovation and carbon and dividend act shows that these legislators agree the climate change is bigger and more important than party politics climate change can and should be a bridge not a wedge between two parties this challenge is so big that we must work together to solve it these Republican and Democratic members of Congress have shown us the best of what our democracy can be working together on issues that base all Americans were grateful for their leadership and for their commitment to addressing climate change [Applause] [Music] is encouraging the important step represent George Chris Bruni Delaney Fitzpatrick deserve considerable praise not only for introducing this important policy but also for their willingness to work across the aisle offering the first bipartisan carbon pricing bill in Congress nearly [Applause] and it's thousands hundreds of thousands volunteers who were a driving force behind this effort a carbon be paired with regulatory certification would send a powerful price signal while providing much-needed policy certainty for businesses this will unlock the wave of American innovation and investment position US manufacturers and businesses as the world's leaders of the next generation of energy technologies and deliver a stronger returning all of the revenue from the free the feed directly to the American households is not only the most equitable approach but also the most popular recent polling indicates voter supports a carbon dividend framework by a margin of two point five to one with strong support among Democratic Republican and independent voters and perhaps unsurprisingly voters overwhelmingly the other uses of targeting members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are quickly realizing that the carbon dividends approach is not only just good policy but it's also positive this legislation proves that a carbon dividend framework can detract from lawmakers the council commends the congressman for their strong leadership in taking major steps forward in addressing the climate challenge well there are some important differences between the council's Baker Schultz plan and the EIC D Act we agree that carbon dividends the carbon dividends plan is the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the required scale and speed and is the best solution for the environment and the economy Americans want both parties to work together to solve big issues like climate change and in that vein once again we thank representative George Crist Rudy palainian Fitzpatrick for their cooperation and leadership and for setting the stage for a bipartisan solution on climate laney just before I open up for questions I would just make this observation in South Florida where I come from and just true on the west coast of Florida in so many other places climate change is not a political issue it is understood by business leaders and local government officials back home where climate the impacts of climate change are being felt right now it is understood that we need to work together to come up with a bipartisan solution to address this most urgent threat that we face our hope is with the introduction of this legislation that Congress can show that it understands that as well and with that I'm happy to open up questions yeah Nick stop joking with peeny news so this obviously has relatively little chance of passing in this Congress so what's the strategy in truth now and what sort of the the outlook well we thought it was important to introduce this now to partisan Congress with the Democratic House Republican Senate that there is a bipartisan way forward on this issue it's the only way that we can get anything done people understand that I think from from all of the members of the citizens climate Lobby all the activists who have come to see us they want action so there was no reason to wait until the Congress we wanted to show right now that and act in a positive way to seriously address climate change in that bipartisan way for the first time in quite a while I couldn't have said it any better than Ted already did but he's right we're gonna have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate it doesn't get much more bipartisan than that and so I think the prospects are very good just looking at the co-sponsors of this legislation itself it's Republican and Democratic members too and so I think that we have a great opportunity and it is smart I think we go ahead and set the groundwork now instead of waiting until the next Congress there's no need to wait to do what's right well there are always challenges there are political challenges in bringing Republicans and Democrats together so this piece of legislation the fact that 100% will go back to American families is an important piece of this the understanding that we can both impose a carbon fee to help to help change the behavior of polluters while at the same time addressing the regulatory framework to provide some certainty for them and the estimates that show the significant impact that this is going to have in reducing carbon output well set the stage for a national debate I don't know about the voters of Washington State I don't know how that was discussed or what or frankly how they addressed it and I'm not so concerned about that with this piece of legislation we have the opportunity to start a very broad very important and most importantly bipartisan conversation about a way forward to address climate change everyone and this bill is starting out with Republican support of course the United States Congress is very different than Washington State but already we're starting off with something that ultimately the the actors who worked very hard and in Washington State were not able to achieve alright great yes have you had any sort of conversations with the incoming chairman of the relevant committees obviously tackling the issue of climate change is urgent not just for the bill but it's certainly urgent before Congress and for the new leadership the House committees which tends to be - and they're looking at all of the various ways to tackle it we wanted to get this out here now as as congressman Chris said so that we could show that there is bipartisan support for an effort like this and then people and then make sure that this is part of what will be a really important conversation about the agenda that will take place over the coming weeks heading into January all right yes [Music] one administration administrator regulations only back in the process we fall well short of the necessary emission reductions needed to address the challenge and on the other side of the equation we don't give businesses the certainty that maybe to make necessary long-term investments to ultimately develop technologies that will lower emissions and drive us too economy and that's why businesses are rallying behind this market-based approach it provides them the necessary search they need to compete long term adults think that introducing a bill like this now it's really important as we start to look ahead to the next because this shows the kind of bipartisanship that can go into a really important piece of legislation there we hope to be able to attract members based not just on the meetings that we had in the last Congress and the discussions that took place but really a bunch  on coming together to help advance bills that and I think an impact so that that's the analysis that we're doing great thank you very much everyone [Applause]

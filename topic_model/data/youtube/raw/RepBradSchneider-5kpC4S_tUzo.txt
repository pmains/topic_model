. MADAM SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY IN  RECOGNITION OF MENTAL HEALTH  AWARENESS MONTH. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN DECLARED IN  HIS PROCLAMATION THIS MONTH,  EACH MAY WE RAISE AWARENESS  ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL  HEALTH AND ITS IMPACT ON THE  WELL-BEING OF ALL AMERICANS,  INCLUDING CHILDREN, ADULTS,  FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR NATION. WE ALSO GIVE THANKS TO THE  DEDICATED MENTAL HEALTH  PROVIDERS WHOSE SERVICE AND  SUPPORT IMPROVES THE LIVES OF SO MANY AMERICANS. WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY FOR THOSE EXPERI EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH  CONDITIONS, PROVIDING THEM WITH  THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AND  DESERVE. MADAM SPEAKER, EVERY DAY  AMERICANS BEAR TREMENDOUS MENTAL HEALTH BURDEN EXACERBATED BY  COVID-19. .  THE PECTD HAS INCREASED CHAL LNGS FOR ALL OF US. FRONTLINE WORKERS, SENIORS FORCED INTO ISOLATION, PARENTS JUGGLING WORK AND TEACHING OUR KIDS FROM HOME, ANSWER ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NAVIGATING LIFE'S DECISION OFTEN WITHOUT THE BASIC SUPPORT SYSTEMS THEY DESERVE AND NEED. WE FEEL THE IMPACT OF OUR DAILY INTERACTION WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, AND EVEN STRANGERS. AND WE SEE THE IMPACT IN THE NUMBERS. INCREASED DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE, RISING INCIDENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND FAR TOO OFTEN STORIES OF PEOPLE, OLD AND YOUNG, LOSING ALL HOPE AND DYING BY SUICIDE. I HAVE HEARD FROM THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CHICAGO ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, THEY USED TO GET 50 CALLS PER WEEK FOR NEW APPOINTMENTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THEY ARE NOW GETTING 50 CALLS A DAY. THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TREAT ADD PREDECKED -- PREPANDEMIC TWO TO THREE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS EACH MONTH. THAT NUMBER HAS JUMP TOPPED TWO OR THREE ATTEMPTS EACH DAY. COUNTLESS TEACHERS HAVE COME TO ME TELLING ME ABOUT THE STRUGGLES THEIR STUDENTS ARE FACING AND THE DIFFICULTIES THEY ENSURE SIMPLY MANAGING THEIR CLASSROOMS. A STUDY FOUND THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF COLLEGE STUDENTS DECLINED BETWEEN 2013 AND 2021 WITH 135% INCREASE IN DEPRESSION AND 110% INCREASE IN ANXIETY. ACCORDING TO THE C.D.C., DURING THE PANDEMIC 18 TO 24-YEAR-OLDS BECAME 25% MORE LIKELY TO REPORT THE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED SUICIDE. IN MY DISTRICT, DILLON, A STAR QUARTERBACK DUE TO GRADUATE WITH HONORS IN MERE MONTHS, WAS LOST TO SUICIDE IN JANUARY OF 2021. DEVASTATING HIS FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COMMUNITY. MORE RECENTLY MY COMMUNITY LOST A SHINING LIGHT TO SUICIDE THIS SPRING. SHE WAS A WONDERFUL YOUNG WOMAN I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING HER ENTIRE LIFE. HER PARENTS, HER SISTERS ARE HEARTBROKEN. BUT ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO HELPING OTHERS GET THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. STEVE SPECIFICALLY ASKED THAT CONGRESS TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. ANOTHER OF MY CONSTITUENTS LOST THEIR SON, WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICER, GEOFF SMITH, DUE TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INJURIES INCURRED ON JANUARY 6. OFFICER SMITH'S FATHER SHARED WITH ME THE STIGMA AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS TRAGIC LOSS. ORLEY'S AND JEFF'S STORIES ARE SPECIFIC TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT THE TRAJ DIFFICULT YOUNG LIVES CUT SHORT AND THE INCIDENTS OF PEOPLE OF ALL AGES NOT ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED, REFLECT OUR NATIONAL FAILURE TO MEENT THIS MENTAL HEALTH MOMENT. AS A NATION WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS, EDUCATION, AND BETTER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE NEED MORE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND RESIDENTS AVAILABLE TO BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN TO ADDRESS AND ACCESS THE GAP THAT SO MANY FAMILIES CONFRONT. GETTING AMERICA HEALTHY REQUIRES THAT WE GET THOSE FACING THESE CHALLENGES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. IF WE AS A NATION ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR GREATEST POTENTIAL, WE MUST HELP THE SICKEST AMONG US GET HEALTHY SO THEY CAN REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

there senator Cortez Masto thank you and thank you so much for having this hearing today and for all of you being here and all of the good work you're doing because we know this abuse occurs and we need to make sure we're out there fighting for and protecting not just seniors but miners as well anybody who comes into this protected class that we should be looking at so I'm sure that you all have read or are aware of the New Yorker article about some of the abuses occurring in Nevada prior to 2013 but since that time the state has drastically overhauled its laws to make sure that these abuses are ended something that was not reported in The New Yorker article unfortunately so I wanted to talk about this because the overhaul of our guardianship laws began when I initially introduced as AG legislation as Attorney General in the state of Nevada you get to introduce legislation and so before I would termed out I had a bill package ready to go and pre filed it and the legislation really was specific about requiring private professional Guardians to be licensed and bonded created oversight of them by the Commissioner of financial institutions a separate outside of the courts oversight body as well as laying out a strict fiduciary duty standard that they must follow that bill unfortunately the the Attorney General who came in after me decided he did not want to introduce that bill knowing that I reached out to my colleagues in the legislature the Speaker of the House at the time and one another assemblyman and asked them to introduce my bill and they did so in 20 our legislative session in 2015 when I was no longer AG it still went for it and Assemblyman Mike sprinkle introduced it as a B for 2325 but during that time that bill was passed but along with that we realized more needed to be done in Nevada to address this issue because as you've heard from the horrific stories so much was happening so in June 8th of 2015 our Supreme Court commissioned a study to study the and it was the Commission to study the administration of guardianship sin Nevada courts and it was created in September of 2016 it issued his final report right here and there are 14 recommendations for new court rules and 16 recommendations for legislative changes to the NRS those legislative changes were adopted those court rules were adopted and so much what we have done was an overhaul a complete overhaul everything you're talking about today was what the Commission studied and we implemented so I applaud you for what you are doing I welcome you to take a look at the reports on what we have done either as a model or tell us additional things that we should be doing so let me let me also talk about the questions here that I have and let me at maybe start with dr. Cohn we talked a little bit about this but how important is that oversight of guardianship stew making sure that we can prevent some of these abuses from occurring and by doing that we are not just relying on the court oversight but an independent body which I've heard today that seems to be key here correct absolutely the court has a tremendously important role in monitoring guardianship there needs to be an annual report a guardian should have to do a person-centered plan so that the court can figure out whether what the guardian is doing is consistent with the goodthe guardian said they were going to do and the courts need to be open to communications from individuals that suggest abuse even if those communications don't come on a petition format right or the right piece of paper you need ways that informal grievances can be brought to the court but in order to have those informal grievances you need people to have notice that they have a right to make that informal grievance so it's incredibly important that at the time of the initial order the individual subject to guardianship and any family or friends who can reasonably serve is that extra eyes and ears of the court not only know that there's been a guardian appointed but know what powers that guardian has been given and know how they can alert the court to potential abuse to a change in the person's need to other problems that may be occurring and if we can provide that notice then we can have these additional monitoring abilities without expense to the court and can prevent the guardianship in part from further isolating the individual subject to guardianship and from further estranging the family thank you and let me I know my time is running out but I want to highlight something else and ask you because one of the things that Nevada did as part of its guardianship reform legislation in 2017 that I don't think has been replicated anywhere else is that it actually went further than a right to counsel for protected persons to create the requirement of counsel this means that as soon as a petition for appointment of a guardian is filed the court is automatically required to appoint them a legal aid attorney specializing in guardianship law unless they already have that attorney and this is paid for by a fee on recording documents with the court what is your opinion on Nevada's requirement of counsel do you think that Nevada's requirement is the best practice for all people who are the respondent in a guardianship proceeding should have an attorney there to represent their wishes and that's critical it's not just their interest that's what a guardian ad litem does right their best interests but each individual who's going through that process deserves and I think is entitled to an attorney who can voice their preferences whether that be a preference about whether there should be a guardianship whether that be a preference about what powers should be included in that guardianship or whether that's a preference about who serves I want my daughter Mary and I don't want my daughter Betsy great thank you I know my time is up thank you very much

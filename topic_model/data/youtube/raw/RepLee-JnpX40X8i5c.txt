chairman first let me just thank the Rules Committee chairman mr. sessions and our ranking member slaughter and all the members of the committee for making this amendment in order my amendment is very straightforward it would have days of enactment of this act repealed the 2001 authorization to use military force which Congress passed into law September 14 2001 and when we repeal this 2001 authorization to use military force time Congress would finally be forced to debate and vote on a specific AUMF to address the ISIL threat I voted against the 2001 authorization because I believed it opened the door for any president to wage endless war without a congressional debate or a vote and I believe quite frankly that history has borne that out in fact I have a new report from the Congressional Research Service and I would like to ask mr. chairman unanimous consent to insert it into the record general Coburn sequester's covered by generally Thank You mr. chairman because I want to encourage all my colleagues to read this report and it shows that this authorization has in fact become that blank check for war in the more than fourteen years since its passage it has been used 37 times in 14 countries to wage war with little or no congressional oversight it's been used 18 times by President Bush and 19 times by President Obama and this report only looks at unclassified incidents how many other times has it been used without the knowledge of Congress or the American people not only has this authorization been used to justify military action thousands of miles away it's also been used much closer to home to allow warrantless surveillance and wiretap indefinite detention practices at Gitmo and targeted killing by drones including of American citizens and it's also been cited as the authority for the nearly two year long war against ISIL award that Congress has never debated voted on or specifically authorized mr. chairman our brave service to be deployed around the world there in combat zones whether they're combat troops are not there in combat zones they're risking their lives don't we at least owe them and our representation in terms of our job to debate and vote on the cost and consequences of the war I think we owe them that if we all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled then why is Congress missing in action every day more bombs fall we've already lost three brave servicemen we've already spent more than nine point six billion dollars and we spend an additional six hundred and fifteen thousand dollars per hour I know that while we may not share a common position on what the shape of any new AUMF to address ISIL might look like I know that many of us do agree that the overly broad in almost 15 years old a umf represents a major and very concerning deterioration of congressional oversight what that means the lack of the involvement and input and voice of the American people let's repeal this blank check and finally 90 days later debate and vote on an AUMF to address the ISIL threat mr. chairman I'd like to reserve the balance of my time so

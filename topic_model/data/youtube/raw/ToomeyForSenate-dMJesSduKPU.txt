nbc10 nbc10 a tissue sunday january 31st 2010 you see the next US senator from Pennsylvania Republican former congressman Pat Toomey leads and head-to-head matchups with all inspector and joe sestak what's his take on President Obama now what would he do about the economy and health care Pat Toomey now on NBC 10 at issue good morning I'm Steve Highsmith Pat Toomey served three terms in Congress representing the 15th district mostly the Lehigh Valley he went on to head the club for growth and now is formally seeking the Republican nomination for US Senate and the opportunity to face either Democrat Joe Sestak or Arlen Specter in November it would be now is Pat una con I've seen it thanks for having me but let's get right to how your campaign is doing the franklin Marshall Daily News poll came out this past week and said it's basically yours to lose well I wouldn't go that far gosh you helped by 14 points are the closest candidate well that's that appears to be the case I suppose and certainly I'd be lying if I didn't say that it's encouraging but I don't put too much stock in polls nine months before an election we've got a long way to go I'm going to run like I'm 20 points behind I think that's what I ought to do well the same poll does say that about half the people surveyed say they don't know enough about you to make a decision about you do you have a concern about that given that as much money as you've been able to raise so far or inspector still has a lot more well our inspector does have a lot more but Arlen Specter is I think quite likely to spend a lot of that money trying to get through a primary and I don't know that it will manage to get through that primary I think joe sestak has a very good chance of winning that but our fundraising is going extremely well I think it will continue to go well and I think we'll have more than enough money to get our message out keep in mind that the fundraising is going extremely well but we haven't been spending it on getting a message out to voters so I'm not surprised that a lot of folks are not familiar with me yet they'll get a chance we plan to spend a lot in April in May or you're going to save everything really haven't decided yet we'll we'll wait and see what do you make of the Scott Brown victory in Massachusetts you know I think it's indicative of what we're seeing really in national and it's reflective of the same kind of message I'm hearing across Pennsylvania every single day which is people saying Washington doesn't get it these guys are out of control they're not listening to us and they're pursuing an agenda that the American people never signed up for when you think about cereal bailouts of failing companies nationalizing whole industries spending on a breathtaking scale deficits like we've never seen before and then they want to take over health care by the way they still want to do cap and trade and card check in a lot of people are saying wait a minute shouldn't you just be focused on growing the economy creating jobs and keeping us safe well I think that should be the focus and and because it hasn't been to date I think people are reacting to that would it be a mistake for Republicans to think that the Scott Brown victory signals that what the American people are endorsing is the Republican Party that would be a mistake I don't think that the people are saying we want to demonstrate that an endorsement of the Republican Party per se I think they're looking for ideas and principles that's much more important than a party label and the ideas are going to be those are going to generate economic growth and sustain security and reform health care in sensible ways so I think we do need to be a party of ideas but most importantly individual candidates need to articulate principle what you said here a little bit earlier and that was people didn't vote for this in 2006 they said no to Republicans and robbers in 2008 they pretty strongly said they want President Obama and if I were paying attention to what Barack Obama was saying as a candidate what you're getting this past year is pretty much the kind of government he said he was going to get I would have to disagree with part of that I agree that voters rejected Republicans who are in control of Congress and I think part of the reason that they did that was too many Republicans in Congress had abandoned the principles that had gotten them there I criticized many of my Republican colleagues when I was in the house prior to that I thought we were spending too much money I thought the earmark explosion was obscene we had Republican members of Congress going to jail for corruption so you know that that's appalling and I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that the voters decided take you know this is no way to be majority party as for the election of President Obama you know I really don't think people were expecting that they were buying into an extremely ambitious program to really remake our economy which are with a much bigger role for government much higher spending nationalizing whole industries they were voting for a guy who was a very charismatic figure very intelligent very eloquent charismatic and he promised change and in a time when a lot of people were really tired with the previous administration I think people didn't really know what change they wanted I think they didn't know what change they were going to have coming down the pike I don't think they anticipated that Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid we're going to write the kind of health care bills they did I don't think anybody in their wildest dreams imagined that we'd have the combination of trillion dollars of spending of money we don't have all kinds of mandates taxes and then those really unconscionable deals that were struck to buy votes of the senator from Louisiana and the senator from New break from Nebraska no I don't think people had any expectation that they'd see a product or a process that was that out of line the president was correct though was anybody said he inherited a lot of this mess I mean except he will say there's a trillion dollars in deficit that he's at it but that there was you know 12 13 trillion before that well or maybe 10 to 12 before that and and he's right on that isn't it the recession started before he took off the president inherited a very very difficult situation very difficult set of circumstances but I have to say I think many of his policies are making things worse let me stop you right there I understand that and you can feel free to follow up but my context is we just got a report for example this week that said that ghost domestic product went up five point seven percent in the fourth quarter at first time will the highest rate since 2003 right you take a snapshot of that the first reaction might be well that's a good thing the economy's showing signs of robbery rebounding maybe some things are turning around well it certainly it's a good thing to have have growth the number was in the right direction and it was a pretty good magnitude but it's still pretty modest compared to what you would normally expect after the decline we've had we're coming off the worst economic contraction in in many decades normally any after any recession you get a pretty strong bounce back we're not seeing that now this is this is the most hopeful sign but it's only one indicator and frankly so many of the others are looking pretty grim that I don't think we should be too too confident that we're out of the woods yet if the stimulus a Recovery Act had had been on your watch you would have voted against it oh absolutely why not because ill-conceived and so there you don't buy it all the argument that the financial system was so broken sir log jam so there was no money flowing that money had to be injected into the system the Fed had to do what it had to do it and everybody else we got a couple of things going on at the same time here you know the stimulus was a big spending program a big big effort to describe government and spend money as though we're going to spend our way out of the recession I think that was very ill conceived remember all that money has to come from the productive private sector whether it's borrowed away are taxed away and so I'm not surprised that that was not a constructive boost for the economy now during the financial crisis that was melting down a little over a year ago I think the federal government did some things that were prudent I think it made sense for the Fed for instance to open the discount window to the broker dealers to provide liquidity to essentially solvent firms but those that might be running into a liquidity problem I thought it made sense to increase the FDIC guarantee for instance to prevent a run on banks I think it made sense for the Fed to accept the lower quality collateral when it provided the liquidity so some of these measures I think did make sense under the circumstances but the forced bailouts the forced investments of taxpayer money into banks of big banks whether they want it or not I think many of those were ill conceived 20s cool ben bernanke and others coming over to Baltimore with Senate candidate Pat Toomey with NBC tennety she comes right back six

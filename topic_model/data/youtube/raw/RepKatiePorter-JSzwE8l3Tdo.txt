hi everyone i'm representative katie porter from california's 45th congressional district and i'm joined today with my colleague cindy axedy who represents iowa's third congressional district cindy sits on the agriculture committee and she's introduced an incredibly important bill it is called the i'm going to get this exactly right for you the cattle price discovery and transparency act i'm really proud to co-sponsor the bill and i wanted to talk with cindy today and ask her to explain to everyone why this bill is so important and what it does well hey katie i'm glad to be here with you and uh nothing like a couple of iowa girls sitting around talking about cattle and the price of beef right people might not know that but i'm actually was i grew up in iowa my family still lives in cindy's district i was actually little known fun fact on the beef the statewide beef promotion team oh and i have a t-shirt to prove it but now my interests in this are more about what it means for consumers so tell us what the cattle price discovery and transparency act would do yeah so it does what i know you want to see in oversight happen making sure that consumers uh aren't being gouged uh at the grocery store or at the pump and so what the cattle market transparency bill does is literally level the playing field unfortunately in this country like too many other industries what we've seen is consolidation of markets and so we've seen a big consolidation of our beef industry and so we have four big players uh that literally control the market and so they control how much cattle is purchased and the price that's paid for it well what this has unfortunately done has shoved small producers out to the tune of 17 000 cattle producers every year that's from iowa to california going out of business going out of business going out of business because these large meat packing uh facilities are purchasing from a concentrated market of individuals not in a transparent way and so this bill will literally create a requirement for those big four to purchase from the cash market which are these cattle producers part of the products that they're purchasing so we can start seeing what they're paying we can start leveling the playing field and when that happens you know exactly what happens to the people's pocketbooks it means that they get a fair price because they're not being gouged by a system that they can't see yeah and i think you know when do we hear things like consolidation and there are larger companies we tend to think well okay these are bigger companies consolidation is not a good thing for consumers and it's not a good thing for you in terms of prices in terms of competition i'm a capitalist but we have to know what that means capitalism is premised on consumers having choices and choosing the product that's best for them having competition on price and unquality um and you know listening to you when you say there are 17 000 producers who are going out of business you know i heard john tester senator tester from montana who's got this kind of bill in the senate talking about this and one of the things he said was he went to be a cattle farmer and graduated from college in like 1974 1975. that's the year i was born i'm one generation after him and continuing to farm cattle wasn't really an option for my family in the wake of the of the farm crisis and with what's happened so this is really really important to continue to give small businesses family farmers farmers who are using sustainable practices the opportunity to compete and to bring their products to market where consumers can choose them if they want to and i just think we see these monopolies in so many different industries we're tackling it here with cattle but there is a bread monopoly in this country there is a pasta monopoly in this country there's a serial monopoly in this country and it's not serving consumers bottom lines that's right it's it's not it's about time we make some of these changes it's been far too long because what happens when we get into a situation uh that we're in right now with supply chain disruptions coming out of you know a major worldwide health care discr disruption we're going to see supply chain issues and when we get to a point where most of our products are coming through some major suppliers and the consumers are having to be beholden to purchasing from them we get left behind as consumers because we have limited products we have 17 000 more cattle producers continually leaving every single year i can guarantee you we'll get down to just four of those those four main packers that are going to be selling the products that's going to leave out so much of the meat and products that people would like to see not only that you know it takes away some of the opportunity for types of diverse farming sustainable farming uh new types of farming that i think so many of those who manage our land would like to do uh but they're stuck really in a marketplace that they kind of have to be in so that they can put food on their table yeah so we got to open this up and just you know to kind of map it out economically we often talk about monopolies and we think about having a small number of companies who control the selling of something and we have that with beef we have four companies right they control like 85 percent of the the beef processing market but what this bill really does is tackle the other kind of monopoly which is vertical right which is that these processors are are only buying from up from large producers and so it's there's there's work to be done here to to create more farming more people who are producing the cattle and then ultimately we'd like to see more processors too and when you talk about this being an issue about the supply chain it's also a national security issue one of the reasons that our country has always supported agriculture we've tried to support our farmers historically generation after generation is the experience of our grandparents in world war ii when there were shortages of things so when you only have one or two or a handful of companies it's not good for supply chain it's not good for resiliency it's not good for being able to weather natural disasters whether it's drought hurricanes um tornadoes whatever might be coming our way so i think the big winner here in this bill is going to be consumers and small business and they are really joining together to get the victory here and who's opposed is just those four companies who are frankly using the fact that they've squeezed out competitors to be able to charge prices and keep supply low yeah well and we need to keep in mind too that when we impact our farmers and our ranchers we impact rural america to a massive degree and i always think it's important to point out to all the folks out there and katie porter land who are listening to this that we are so intricately connected in this country uh every ball bearing for every ford explorer that's built in detroit is made right in iowa's third district so we're helping to put money in the pockets of of people in detroit um rural america is a key component no matter if it's upstate new york or if it's you know down in new mexico or if it's right in the heartland in iowa where i should have we have a lot of rural stuff in california not in the foreign congressional district but california is very rural and very agricultural that's right vegetables it's fruits it's nuts that's right but we want those to be diversified markets we have our own market concentration in those industries that we should talk about sometime but it really is about supporting the people who do this work yeah and about the towns and communities and having these jobs in every community matters i grew up in the farm crisis cindy and you remember my parents were farmed um they farmed cows pigs soybeans and corn and the consolidation in those four markets today would have already squeezed them out that's exactly right and so i really have very very strong memories as a kid of feeling like growing up in rural iowa i didn't know if there'd be a job i didn't know if i'd be able to carry on the tradition that my family had had farming and and that was a terrible feeling yeah um yeah so i think this is about making sure that we have opportunity to thrive to succeed to start a business to run a company um to sell products to the marketplace in every part and pocket of this country because every american deserves opportunity that's absolutely right and you know making sure that we're supporting our small towns is only does positive things for this country taking farming away from rural america continues to hurt us it has hurt us it is it has squeezed us at every point in turn uh we're certainly seeing that right now with the war with russia and ukraine where our food production is being impacted as well there it's just so important that we pay attention to our our food supply you know interestingly um during kobet you know the people in our packing plants were essential workers that's how important this is to our country and so getting the pricing right making sure that americans aren't strapped and aren't gouged and making sure that we don't continue to conglomerate more so that we drive more people out of the market is really important to get done now yeah and we see this effect i mean i think about me standing in the grocery store in california and you know looking at the price of hamburger and thinking yikes we're not going to have that tonight right um and then what you can you want to tell yourself what's higher but the farmer's getting more but that's not true right so if we go back a decade or ago or more the producer the farmer got 60 cents for every dollar of that beef and today they get 40 cents that's right and so our farmers are getting less even as we as consumers are paying more and that is just there to line the pockets of these handful of conglomerates and their shareholders and their ceos and their executives and the rest of us are losing out so there's a big aspect of this bill that's about standing up to corporate power leveling the playing field for small producers and in doing that it has a huge benefit for consumers yeah that's absolutely right so you're making 40 cents on a dollar uh if you're a producer that's that's just unacceptable and secondly um we the cash market for these these producers used to be fifty percent of the market now that markets down to twenty percent so the market itself if you took 100 down to 20 percent then you take each dollar within it and you're only making it give you a smaller share right 40 cents so they're being gouged every which way every which way and one thing about this bill i want to make sure to mention is that it's bipartisan in the senate um your state senator senator grassley um and senator tester from montana are pulling for this at night i think we all want to see that bipartisanship we want to see people coming together to do what's right for consumers do what's right for small business so this is an important marker of that as well oh my gosh yeah listen this has it all wrapped up we're going to lower the prices in the stores we're going to make sure that we help um american farmers we're going to help rural america across us across the country we're going to bring you better beef for goodness sake i can tell you that much because the best beef comes right out of my backyard in iowa and we're just going to make sure that we're sending a message i think to big industries that you can't hold american families uh you know uh hostage to the pricing that you've decided you want to set you've got to be true and honest and give us give our american families what they need and what they can afford you should have competition there you go that's part of capitalism i mean i feel sometimes like some of these corporations they want the upside of capitalism which is the ability to pay their ceos whatever they want and to pay their shareholders what they want but they don't want the other side of capitalism which is competition and transparent markets and consumer choice and all the things that are supposed to ultimately generate that one of the other things i wanted to mention is we talked about this helping the producers one of the things the administration's done that i'm excited about is create along with secretary vilsack the department of agriculture is to create a program a grant program to help fund startup regional local processors for both poultry and meat and i think that's also going to be really important people are going to be able to buy the meat and have it processed closer to where they live and that's also going to help create i think innovations around meat safety and food safety and processing techniques humane treatment options so again competition is going to give consumers choice at a better price yeah and i think that's why this bill is such an exciting innovation so i know the title when i first heard about this bill i said the cattle market price discovery and transparency act what is this and when i started to read about it i realized how important it is to really break it down for people so that people in in across the united states understand how important this spell is listen uh sometimes i think that it's hard to really see everything that goes on out here but this really is just about putting a better product at a better price in americans pockets awesome yeah love it love it

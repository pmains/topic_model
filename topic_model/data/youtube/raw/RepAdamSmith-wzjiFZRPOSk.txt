and we spoke with congressman Adam Smith about how a trump presidency could affect people in Washington he told us he's concerned trans proposals of increased military spending and cutting taxes for wealthy corporations could leave the working class struggling if you're bowing or Amazon I mean he's spending a lot more money on the military yeah I mean that's that's a good thing in the short term but how long can the economy survive if we don't have enough people to participate in it Democratic congressman Smith also questioned how much Trump actually knows about being in office because he has never held any elected position before

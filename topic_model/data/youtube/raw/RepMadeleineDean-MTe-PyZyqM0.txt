joining me now is congresswoman madeline dean of pennsylvania who served as a house manager on the second impeachment trial of donald trump her new book under our roof a son's battle for recovery a mother's battle for her son comes out tomorrow and congresswoman dean thanks for being here i want to i want to get to this point about a a 9 11 commission there's been a lot of talk that that's something that would be needed but i my my fear about a 911 commission is who would appoint the people on it ron johnson your fellow senator um who's had some strange musings in the past today on a radio interview said he didn't think it was an armed attack he said this didn't seem like an armed insurrection to me i mean arm when you think arm don't you think that means that means people had guns i don't see any guns i would like to know you know did anybody recover any ammunition did anybody recover any firearms if he had anything to do with that commission it wouldn't be a commission it would be a circus do you trust a 911 commission that any republicans lindsey graham ron johnson any of them have anything to do with well joy thank you for having me tonight and it's strange you and i are celebrating president's day uh following the sad uh acquittal of the president or amassing an insurrection and attacked by americans against americans so what i keep thinking in your beautiful opening there is have they know decency we know that expression but for god's sake have they no decency uh to support this president in some foe i don't know what you call it lack of spine lack of conscience i don't understand it so i want a commission i want it to be impartial certainly the people you just talked about have fully disqualified themselves from sitting on any such commission do you think that people like lindsey graham who also tried to overturn the election who's now under investigation in georgia should be barred even though he's a member of the gang of eight from picking anyone from the commission and should that commission investigate people like your colleagues josh hawley and um ted cruz i i don't know how this commission will be set up but certainly i don't think somebody like lindsey graham who has spoken out of both sides of his mouth uh disgracefully so should be anywhere near this commission lindsey graham sat there i was there i made eye contact with the senator as we made our case i'm very proud to have been a part of that impeachment team and we gave the american people and the senators in the room who were witness and victim in that very crime scene the facts that we could that we knew at the moment that were overwhelming and damning and clear and certain so folks like lindsey graham mitch mcconnell should not sit on the commission you know i was struck because i was there for the vote i waited and stood in the back of the chamber as each senator stands and announces his or her verdict literally stance lindsey graham barely stood to say not guilty mitch mcconnell stood to say not guilty and then what did mitch mcconnell do within minutes he stood again in that very same spot and he said there is no question that the president is practically and morally responsible for the insurrection for the attack on the capitol on a co-equal branch he said it was a disgraceful disgraceful dereliction of duty you know what that what rang in my mind when he said a disgraceful dereliction of duty i thought senator mcconnell yes you're talking about the president but aren't you also talking about yourself well then if if if we're to keep someone like mitch mcconnell from having anything to do with appointing members because i foresee people like mitch mcconnell people like lindsey graham trying to put like a jim jordan or a devin nunes on such a commission to blow it up that their only purpose would be to blow up the commission to obfuscate and make the commission come up with a non-answer and to protect both the former president and their fellow colleagues who are also insurrectionists this is a sort of jim crow style caucus at this point do you think that such a commission should be controlled by the justice department should be put together outside with no no no congressional particularly congressional republican input i think it should be a fully independent commission perhaps with retired judges those who would want to serve in order to collect the data the evidence review it against the law and when that happens i hope they also collect the stories and catalogue the stories of the heroes you talked about the custodians think about that after the destruction and desecration of the capital where lives were lost they came in with a sense of pride and purpose and duty and did their job cleaning up the bloodstained floors the shattered glass the splinters of wood and frames and mirrors i wish the senators had risen to the same level that the custodians had to do their duty to do their jobs with pride so i hope we catalogue the heroes as well as those who aided and abetted the president in an insurrection and my final question to you congresswoman should such a commission have subpoena power and should the former vice president be subpoenaed since he was one of the potential victims of this lynch mob we've seen all the difficulties around subpoenas you know that i'm on the judiciary committee we're still working on the subpoena of don mcgann imagine that all these months later i hope that certainly that the committee would have all the power necessary to collect the facts and the data and the evidence to depose witnesses to hear from them but i guess i also really hope and maybe it's naive of me or optimistic of me that folks will want to come in will want to offer testimony for the insurrection the attack on our capital please god that it never happened again we never would have thought it would happen but i hope they will come forward i hope whatever commission is set up is independent and has the full power that they can collect all of the evidence congresswoman madeline dean congratulations on your book thank you very much for spending our president's evening with us thank you and joining me now is tim miller writer at large cheers writer at large at the bulwark and charles blow columnist for the new york times and

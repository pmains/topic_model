under the previous order morning business is closed under the previous order the Senate will proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the following nomination which the clerk will report nomination the judiciary Britt Kegel grant of Georgia to the United States Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit present senator for Morgan president the Senate is approaching the end of the debate on a significant piece of spending legislation that includes funding for the Internal Revenue Service that is why I've come to the floor this morning to discuss one of my amendments to this legislation which is based on a bill that I have authored entitled the presidential tax transparency Act it is long past time for the president's tax returns to be released to the American people this president has in effect thrown in the trash can a bipartisan 40 year pro transparency tradition by refusing to release his tax returns in the course of the 2016 election this was a tradition accepted by all liberals conservatives across the political spectrum that dates back to the post Watergate era the president ended it for reasons as flimsy as you can get a made-up story about the president's claim that you can't release your returns in the course of an audit but now it's not just a matter of the president destroying a for decades good government campaign tradition week after week month after month there are more questions that swirl about with respect to financial ties that might skew the president's decision-making about new foreign deals the Trump organization continues to strike violating the promises the president made the American people about foreign cash coming in to his properties here in the United States about the astronomical amount of cash taxpayers spend to fund the president's many visits to Trump branded properties essentially forcing the American people to finance Trump Resort ad campaigns the episode that left more jobs on the floor than perhaps any other came a few weeks ago that's when the president traveled through Europe for what should have been routine meetings with our long-standing allies instead the president attacked our closest allies and put on a performance standing next to Vladimir Putin that few will soon forget with a hostile dictator at his side the president said the u.s. was quote foolish and he threw our intelligence officials under the bus and refused once again to accept the conclusion that Russia interfere with our 2016 election the clean up he tried to do a few days later in my view was laughable at best following that meeting in Helsinki people across the nation were left to wonder does Ladda mere Putin have something on the president does the president simply prefer dictators and strongmen to democratically elected leaders or does poo have information or financial influence that he's exploiting there was also the mystery of why this administration which Steve seems to stumble from decision to decision sprang into action to save ZTE a company that is a Chinese serial sanctions violator and a tech company that experts will tell you is a threat to our national security and mr. president and an open hearing the Intelligence Committee we have few in response to my question mr. even Nena the new point person for the whole questions counterintelligence in Counter Terrorist ill as an espionage threat for all the president's tough talk about enforcing sanctions on countries that pose a threat to Americans letting ZTE ZTE off the hook after it violated sanctions against Iran in North Korea is just baffling certainly shows signs of weakness and the timing raised eyebrows is the ZTE deal came right after the Trump family secured valuable trade marks and a trump project in Indonesia got a five hundred million dollar loan from a Chinese state-owned companies these looming questions are yet another reason why the American people should not be asked to wait any longer to have a chance to see what every other president has offered in the last four decades that is his tax returns the American people deserve to see those returns and see if some of the sort of almost impossible to explain presidential judgments over the last few weeks are due to what may be in those returns so let's be clear the financial ties between the president the Trump Organization and Russia could be hidden deep within the Trump web of business entities releasing the tax returns at least is a start with respect to accountability and transparency in the long held tradition presidents have fallen unfortunately for the interests of the American people debate on the legislation before us now has been cut off that means that my amendment which would call for the disclosure of these tax returns and transparency and accountability just as we've seen decade after decade will not get a vote but I intend to keep calling this legislation up for a full debate I simply believe this issue is too important to ignore there's a reason why we've had this tradition for four decades this is mr. president this is the lowest ethical bar for a present it's not a high one it's the lowest ethical bar and it's not being fallen members on both sides ought to be interested in protecting good government Pro transparency traditions that stretch back decades mr. president what a lot of people wondered is why is legislation necessary here and I held off for months in 2016 even talking about requiring this by legislation I just hoped I just hope that then candidate Trump would do voluntarily what everybody else has done for four decades but when it was clear he wouldn't I said I don't know of any other path to get the transparency and accountability the American people deserve other than through legislation like this nobody in the Congress ought to be in favor of keeping the American people in the dark about what is motivating the president's decision and certainly all of us all of us ought to be concerned about protecting against corruption helping Russia undermine NATO and letting sanctions violators repeat sanctions violators off the hook puts American interests in danger the public has a right to know the truth of what's behind those decisions and certainly a part of being able to make those judgments is having the chance as we've seen for four decades the opportunity to see the president's tax returns

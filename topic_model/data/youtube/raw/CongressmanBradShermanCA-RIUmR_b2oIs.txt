not without objection i'm going to leave i'm going to yield a couple of minutes to mr. Sherman to you had some remarks on the House floor last night that I think in the interest of the committee might be well served if if I just yield you a few minutes right now mr. Sherman to reiterate your observations about the Senate in the house Thank You mr. chairman I'll give you a one-minute report on our consideration last night of s 24 26 some in this committee will have noticed that that bill that Senate bill we considered last night was identical to house 1853 written by mr. salmon and passed by this committee and so I'll report to you on that coincidence by quoting the remarks I made on the floor last night the House passed HR 1853 overwhelmingly last year we sent the bill to the Senate instead of acting on the House bill the Senate xeroxed our bill put their own name on it and send it back here the decision to send the bill back to us with their own name on it is a trend that we are seeing in the Foreign Affairs area a trend that I do not condemn because it allows us here on the House floor to consider well drafted House bills not once but twice and to vote on them twice and to emphasize to the administration how serious we are about them being enforced I appreciate the Senate copying our work since imitation is the most sincere form of flattery anyway that's the report from last night now want to address the witnesses um first as I want to associate myself with the Chairman's remarks on the row hingga and note again the importance of fort fighting the Zika virus and other other infectious diseases and this is part of our national security since these diseases which we call tropical are coming our way whether that's for a host of reasons as to southern Pakistan which I mentioned in the opening statement I want to commend you from one it's tues from let me see the construction of 26 schools that you've started both girls schools and primary schools training 113 supervisors and I wonder if you could comment madam administrator on your work in Sindh and Balochistan uh yes sir and thank you for your comment again on on Zika I think it's extremely important that we all recognize that this is a new and modern threat that's going to continue to challenge us in Sindh province and and thank you for your recognition of the work we have as I think you know a comprehensive development assistance portfolio that includes on includes repairing power stations developing a workforce program targeting disadvantaged youth increasing enrollment in schools and improving infrastructure and technical capacity to deliver quality health services you've pointed to some of the results we've seen I'd also like to point out the health infrastructure improvement program which trains over 1,300 healthcare workers and provides care importantly for a hundred and forty thousand women annually thank you I've been advocating for direct day to nagorno-karabakh since 1997 it's an important investment we make in peace in that region and a support of a negotiated and democratic solution recently aid direct to nagorno-karabakh as dropped to 1.5 million dollars per year principally directed at D mining can you explain why we're not doing more given the fact that this area is beleaguered and in need of help uh thank you for that and as you know we are operating an environment that forces some tough choices I think the good news is that we've seen and in the FY 17 request include increases across the board throughout that region in addition to demining we have also supported humanitarian assistance should there be a recurrent need for that we are always as in any part of the world willing to take another look at that I look forward to talking to you and showing you that the that need has already occurred absolutely I'd love do that and obviously a lot of countries are seeing refugees from Syria and we are helping turkey that is well publicized many of the Christian refugees are making their way to Armenia especially being ethnic Armenians are we providing aid to the government of Armenia to take care of those refugees we are providing some assistance to help with refugees who have migrated to parts of Europe as well as trying to concentrate our assistance both for people inside Syria and those in the surrounding regions in addition the State Department through PRM is providing assistance to those people you wouldn't happen to know how much has gone to Armenia I can get that specific a story I'd be happy to provide it in writing or in person thank you I want to get again commend you on your work and yield back the rest of my time

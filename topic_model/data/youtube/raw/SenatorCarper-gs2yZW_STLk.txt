Thanks thanks mr. Chairman I am let me just set aside my prepared remarks I would ask consent that they be submitted for the record make a couple comments if I if I can a lot of attention paid to refugees coming from Syria to the United States in the last year they've been about two thousand refugees it's not an easy process to go through as my colleagues know it's a process that can take as much as two years and it starts with vetting by the United Nations one of their high command's and if folks make the ax-cut to get to the step next step then they go through a bunch of screens personal interviews in person and interviews data to the extent that we have data files to to check we we do all those the DHS does some of them we work with other countries with whom I where were allied out of the two thousand that come in terror as a refugees in the last year or two about two percent were of military-aged males two percent and other folks that have come to our country so far I'm told out of those two thoughts not one person has been arrested now one person's been arrested the it takes two years it's a process that if I were a bad guy trying to get in that's the last place i try to glassware i try to get in if i were trying to a bad guy trying to get on my try a visa waiver program visa waiver program and i might try just coming over on it as a student or is it tourists and good news i understand out of the four french nationals who were killed in in impera see the three are all four of them where folks who would never would have been allowed to get on a plane because we had him Adam suitcase in terms of who they were where they would never get on a plane to come to the two to the US the one of the things that challenges for us is i think is to understand without a hearing already this year on visa waivers i recall and we need to go back and dust off the books see what we learned in terms of how we're strengthening that program has been done what started off as a travel facilitation program has now become an information sharing program with 38 other nations in order for them to participate in this program with us they have to agree to to provide our access to every kind of data file intelligence file that we ask for and if they don't then they're not included as one of the visa waiver countries one of the latest of one of the other developments says and not too long ago was that if you if you want to be a Visa Waiver country at least 38 countries you have to make sure that if somebody's passport is stolen or lost it is reported to Interpol and that way when somebody shows up using trying to use that a passport to come to the US or some other place they can be stopped in their tracks preamble to our Constitution says in order to form a more perfect union my guess is that as much as we're trying to make the visa waiver program better it still isn't perfect and our goal should be perfection and we're going to work on it every day and I think there's some things we can do legislatively hopefully in this committee and to work with some of our colleagues and other Committees of jurisdiction the the last thing that i would i'd say we have a we face a moral dilemma here the Pope was in town two months ago spoke to Wallace invoke the Golden Rule treat other people way we want to be treated invoke Matthew 25 the least of these when I was a stranger in your land did you take me in and everybody stood up and applauded in our joint session you may recall that when he said those words and now we're not so sure we believe those words and the question is we have a moral imperative to the least of these to treat other people way we want to be treated we have an equally strong moral imperative and I think a duty by by virtue of our oath of office to make sure that we don't meet that moral imperative to the least of these by putting at risk the citizens of this country and that the question for us is can we do about can we do both I think we can and I think morally and just by common sense we need to do both and our challenge is to figure out how to do that and the thread the needle build on the good work that's been done and can you go for it last l says this or department home and secured work in communities where there's a heavy a large Muslim population in this country just to try to make sure that we inoculate were inoculating help those communities inoculate against the success and as Chairman's mention is the success of efforts to use social media to radicalize our own people and they there's a request by the administration to increase the funding for that program it seems to be working and I think as we consider the appropriations bills in the near future I hope we'll keep in mind what works and do more of that including in this regard lastly there's a guy fella named Adam zoo and I things Adam zubin who is epicenter height okay I have a name like I Adam szubin who was involved heavily involved in a leadership role when we're trying to cut off Iran's access to international financial markets when we're trying to cut out for North Korea and their access to international financial markets and I understand he has he's been nominated to at a very senior position within Treasury to do that work to leave that effort including cutting off Isis financially and there's obviously work that still needs to be done and can you senator Heitkamp is that committee is that nomination still pending in the Banking Committee it's still pending we held as hearing so the hearings been completed pending voting in the Banking Committee this committees done great work and making sure that the senior level leadership and Department of Homeland Security all those vacant positions year and a half of the week they've been filled and we've done very good work in that regard and this is another nominations agree very helpful in terms of the root cause cutting off Isis money it's all well and good to request you on the battlefield but in terms of making sure that their money is gone this is a good way to do it and we got a good guy holding you know I was willing to serve we need to get them done thank you

joining us congressman adam schiff of california a member of the house select committee on january 6 and the chairman of the intelligence committee uh congressman it's been it's been a huge week of public revelations i'm not sure how much of this is new information to you or the committee but if we could start with jenny thomas and if you could just characterize how interested you are in speaking to her and if there are plans to do so well there are several setting things to me about the what was publicly known had been revealed about jenny thomas uh here she is weighing in with the state legislators in arizona seeking to get them to essentially send a bogus slave electors that didn't represent who won the popular election in arizona uh and you know the the judge in california judge carter in the case involving eastman uh this lawyer describes what the former president was involved in as a criminal conspiracy uh that was a conspiracy to interfere with the joint session to defraud people and here you have the wife of a supreme court justice engaged in a parallel effort to get arizona to improperly cast aside the votes of millions uh and and also to add to it her husband on the supreme court uh writing a dissent in a case arguing against providing records to congress that might have revealed some of these same emails that conflict of interest just screams at you so it's a tangled web here but it is it is a pernicious tangled web at that congressman had you seen the emails that jenny thomas sent that the post reports on today have they been swept up in any of the prongs of your probe you know i can't comment on whether the select committee has them or had them already we have a mountain of materials and i can also tell you i haven't seen all of the materials that we've been able to accumulate uh but uh you know we continued to learn more and more uh in this uh eastman case for example and this was the subject of a foia request so i can comment on it um there are records showing that ether was basically giving a blueprint to a pennsylvania lawmaker about how to fudge the results how to defraud the people of pennsylvania i mean the the explicit nature of that corrupt activity is so blatant uh and now it's revealed that he's in direct conversation with donald trump's strategy strategizing with donald trump so that criminal conspiracy that judge carter mentioned uh now uh courtesy of mr eastman goes straight back to the president well so you've said two things that i i want to press you on one what has been described as likely felonies committed by donald trump and john eastman seems to track with all of the reporting about where your your where the select committee's work is now focused and um there's been some reporting that congresswoman liz cheney and her public and private work is certainly focused on making sure that the ex president's role in all this is is revealed in part in the public hearings i wonder if you can comment on how much of this final phase uh and i don't know if you would feel or describe it as final but the final phase before the public hearings is focused on donald trump's role in that conspiracy well you know in my point of view i won't speak for liz but in my point of view he's the author and the architect of this plan to overturn the election of this uh this coup attempt uh you know masquerading as a legal strategy after all he's the the chief promulgator of the big lie uh and that big lie is used around the country to try to get states to send boguslates of electors fake certificates of electors he's involved in this he's calling state legislators he's calling local elections officials uh he is strategizing uh with uh eastman and others uh so you know he's the instigator of the author of the architect of uh you know this effort to overturn our election culminating uh in this violence on january 6th so you can't ignore the principal player here uh and you know there are a lot of other players too our goal is to expose the role of all who are involved uh the fragility of our democracy but the reason it was so fragile the main main reason it remains so fragile is because of the active participation of the head of today's republican party donald trump i mean your response seems to render mood the debate from about three four weeks ago about whether or not the committee would refer donald trump it sounds like whether you make the referral or not your committee is in possession of ample evidence to allege that he's the chief architect of a coup well look the the the judge out in california on the limited basis of the material he's reviewing just involving eastman has reached that conclusion uh you know we have access to uh well i you know i certainly concur with judge carter's observation i think he was involved in an effort to overturn the election i think that uh there is uh evidence as the judge pointed out of the president's involvement in multiple potentially criminal acts uh the judge there doesn't even get into what donald trump did in georgia trying to get the secretary of state to find exactly the number of votes he would need to defeat his opponent and even threatening or intimating prosecution if he didn't those are potentially criminal acts that ought to be investigated by the justice department congressman you talked about the states and and i just want to press on on the significance of jenny thomas the wife of the supreme court justice as you said her husband um perhaps this is false in the category of wild epic hundred year coincidences he is the one supreme court justice who dissented on how much information your bipartisan committee should have access to do you want to understand jenny thomas's role in the fake electors plot as it is now also under scrutiny and investigation by doj yes i mean i won't understand the role of anyone in overturning our election and it will be up to the committee as a committee you know how we go forward in terms of jenny thomas uh we have other sources of information about her role in the role of others that don't necessarily have to come from her but but yes where you have prominent people involved in essentially a an effort to overturn our election to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power you know a big part of the reason why people are listening to jenny thomas in the state legislatures or elsewhere is because of uh you know not just her own work but of course who her husband is uh it's unless it's a hundred year coincidence as you point out um and uh and of course the justice's own role in trying to deprive the committee of information is just scandal um and it certainly tracks with something the chief justice has talked about and that's the perception of the integrity of the court i want to ask you about the headlines that were made almost 24 hours ago this letter for a voluntary interview with a republican congressman that we haven't talked too much about and i don't know that much about i just want to read an excerpt from the letter you write to mr louder loudermilk quote based on our review of evidence in the select committee's possession we believe you have information regarding a tour you led through parts of the capitol complex on january 5th 2021. republicans on the committee on house administration of which you were a member claimed to have reviewed security footage from the days preceding january 6 and determined quote there were no tours no large groups no one with maga hats on however the select committee's review of evidence directly contradicts that denial we understand that to mean that you have evidence that that that says the opposite of quote there were no tours no large groups and no one with maga hats on on january 5th do you have evidence of reconnaissance tours on january 5th you know we have evidence that contradicts what mr loudermilk and other republicans on that committee said which is that there were no tours that day before uh january 6th uh and we would like him to come in and testify and share what he knows um and explain uh why he would be a signator to that letter uh or whether for some reason our evidence is wrong but uh but we do have evidence that contradicts that claim uh that merits his coming in and sharing with us what he knows in response he called for um the capitol police to release the footage that he relied upon for that denial is it a fair assumption to say that you're in possession of evidence that goes beyond the footage he's referring to to exonerate him you know i'm confident that if he comes in and testifies we will give him an opportunity to explain any evidence that seems to contradict the claims that he has made so we look forward to what we hope will his be his cooperation with our committee we have had other investigations in the past which i've conducted where democrats and republicans have come in and cooperated voluntarily but uh he clearly in our view has evidence relevant to our investigation that relevant to that very issue of whether tours were conducted on january 5th or prior to the events of the 6th it's just a stunning question to leave open and harry lipman former doj officials said on this program that if depending on how this witness and this piece of evidence that contradicts his claim turns out if this is someone who provided tours to someone who carried out acts of violence on the u.s capitol on the sixth he made the parallel to someone sharing cockpit footage with um attackers on september 11th i mean is are your questions that serious in nature about his role you know i don't want to uh overstate or understate uh what we're trying to find out for mr loudermilk um and so uh but we do have evidence that that contradicts what he has represented uh we would like to talk with him we think he has information you can share with us and at this point i'm not liberty to say how significant or not significant it may be but but clearly all of our committee members are concerned that the statements coming from from him and other committee members don't hold up to the evidence and we want to know why what can you tell us about not necessarily today but what the process might look like in the future with with justice department criminal division prosecutors wanting access to your transcripts and your your work product you know this is not an uncommon phenomenon uh there were cases in the russia investigation the ukraine investigation where justice department wanted information that we had obtained and of course information we wanted that they'd have obtained and it's the product of a negotiation we want to support the justice department in their work i don't think anyone has been louder than i have been calling for the justice department to pursue all leads of any criminal activity related to overturn the election um but you know we received a very blanket request for information uh the congress doesn't simply say hey justice department come on in and we'll open our files uh you know they need to be specific about what they're looking for that we can help them with um and we're i think more than willing to do that uh eager to help in any way we can but we do have an institutional interest in not simply setting precedent where the justice department can come rummage through a committee's investigatory files there's also information we want from the justice department and we also don't want the justice department to in any way discourage witnesses from talking to us that may be talking to them at the same time so we we want to discuss all these issues want to be helpful and i'm confident we'll work it out what do you think when a republican primary knight comes and goes and the energy and the support from republican voters is around and does not disqualify people who were champions of the stop the steel movement which is you know your investigation makes clear it is part of this broader conspiracy to overturn the results of a free and fair election uh you know it's terrifying i mean here we are we're more than a year after this violent attack on the capitol and our democracy is weaker and more vulnerable than ever yeah and a big part of the reason is you have people who were lying about the last election who continue to lie about the last election and they're running for secretary of state they're running to the be the people counting the ballots next time they've already proved their their fundamental uh incapacity to do those jobs and and yet they're on the ballot and they could win and if they should win and there's a contested result next time no one will have confidence in what they say um because they've already proven themselves uh untrustworthy and this is how democracies uh wither um is by using instruments of democracy to tear itself down so it's terrifying uh and and we all need to wake up to this threat the threat on our elections infrastructure the threat on those who conduct the elections the the local technocratic elections officials some being driven out of town with death threats this is the paramount danger to our democracy right now along with voter disenfranchisement laws aimed at people of color and the common link there is those disenfranchisement laws are funneled and fueled by lies about voter integrity they've pushed in states where they had no fraud i i just want to ask you a final question about you when you hear mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy on tape and these these two great reporters from the new york times have lots and lots of tapes sounding a lot like you and me right describing trump as the son of a who uh he helps democrats take care of that's mitch mcconnell's quote on one of those tapes and kevin mccarthy making abundantly clear that after january 6 donald trump had to go and and detailing on a conference call with his members that he wouldn't resign but either impeachment or the 25th amendment which is only concerned with was that it was too slow when you see the private thoughts of republicans put back in the tube or covered over or consumed by the public conduct of enabling him and strengthening him and as you said strengthening republicans around the country who adhere to this big lie what do you think the prospects are for success or what is your benchmark of success for the public phase of the 1-6 select committee hearings uh you know our benchmark for success i think is to tell the story of what happened uh in the run-up to the sixth and on the sixth in a compelling way to give good information to those uh in the in the public the tens of millions of americans who still have an open mind who generally want to understand what happened uh and and how close we came to losing our democracy um but you're absolutely right you know listening to those tapes of mcconnell mccarthy uh in in private expressing what we all felt about the unfitness of the former president and to see now how they have completely caved in to the immorality of the former president um it just takes your breath away what is is scandalous about kevin mccarthy for example lying to the new york times about those conversations in the wake of january 6th isn't that he's lying today to the new york times that's not the scandal anyone who knows mccarthy isn't particularly surprised by that the scandal is that if he didn't lie if he doesn't lie if he doesn't continue lying he can't serve in republican leadership right that's the terrible scandal the terrible tragedy um and uh you know robert carroll the story once said in an interview that power doesn't corrupt as much as it reveals it doesn't always reveal us for our best but it says a lot about who we are well power is said a lot about who kevin mccarthy is and who mitch mcconnell is and if we don't uh elect people of character um then none of it works no matter how brilliant the constitution is no matter how we reform the electoral count act um if people don't give meaning to their oath of office none of it works at the end of the day it sounds like the other half of your answer is that the stakes are very very high for the public phase very high very high um thank you for spending some time to talk to us about these these stunning developments today we're really grateful for your time thank you

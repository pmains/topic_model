hey everybody Senator Tim Kaine here it's that time of year again Congress is beginning its annual Appropriations process when we decide how we're going to spend the federal budgetary dollars for fiscal year 2024. and for the third year in a row the Senate is accepting requests for a congressionally directed spending CDs formerly known as earmarks as we go through this process I want to hear from you about the needs in your community and how I can support those needs some of you may remember that Congress had earmarks for many years and then eliminated them in 2011 two years before I arrived in the Senate and the reason they eliminated them is that the Aramark process that happened long ago was not one that was very transparent instead senators and house members would stick earmarks in the Appropriations bills at the very last minute and often there would be a vote on a massive budget bill that would contain items that people really hadn't paid attention to but after earmarks are banned Congress quickly discovered that eliminating them just transferred spending decisions away from the elected members of the article one branch into the executive branch and look there's nothing against the executive branch making spending decisions but when the people making the budgets and the budget is a congressional responsibility when we're making the budget we should have some ability to direct funding because actually we're the ones that live all around the country and are the most in touch with citizens so I was very excited when the Democratic majority in 2021 worked together with Republicans to return the power to Congress to direct Congressional expenditures in some portion of the federal budget most of the federal budget is still dollars that we allocate to federal agencies and they make the in-depth spending decisions but a portion of the budget now involves the elected representatives in the House and Senate working with the communities to make sure that you have a say in how funding is done and of course we put new safeguards in place to cut out some of the abuses that had led to airmarks being banned in the past for instance every Senate Office and house office that requests earmarks have to publicly disclose the earmark requests on our website the requests have to go through an intense vetting process we can't airdrop a new project nobody's ever seen before into a must-pass bill at the very end of the session for example and so these reforms are reasonable and it means that anyone in Virginia can go on to my website a journalist a mayor an everyday Citizen and look and see okay what kind of earmarks are Senator Kane requesting are they good organizations are they spread all around the state are they for legitimate purposes are the amounts that are asked for reasonable so we started the airmark process two years ago and in the past two years I've only seen this become more and more powerful wherever I go in the Commonwealth or when I meet Virginians in DC someone is always talking to me about a community need and often about what a difference it is made to them to apply for and receive a community directed expenditure so that they can apply that to community needs we've received from the Appropriations committees successful consideration of our our requests in a whole variety of fields infrastructure Workforce Development violence prevention Broadband build out we've gotten significant down payments on some projects we've been working on for years like the new Container Terminal on craney Island at the Port of Virginia projects in rural areas that have tended to be overlooked maybe because the populations are small when we didn't have earmarks are now receiving some significant funding for example the coal Fields Expressway in Southwest Virginia or the Eastern Shore rail trail that serves the Eastern Shore saving Tangier island in the Chesapeake Bay this is something we've learned that rural priorities tend to do pretty well as we advocate for Aramark requests there are too many to name but you can see on my website the projects that we've received funding for in the last two years so here's a few things that I want you to know if you are considering making a funding request to my office and usually the requests are made by state or local governments non-profit organizations or educational institutions for-profit companies are not allowed to make your mark requests so first you've got to be either a state or local government non-profit organization or educational institution second the scope of an earmark request tends to be a mill a maximum a million or a couple of million dollars or sometimes in the few hundred thousand dollar range for a small non-profit they're not in the you know 100 million or billion dollar range um three if you have a project where a Federal grant will put shovels in the ground that's going to be more competitive than something where you might get the first million of a massive project but you won't be able to use it unless you find the other 99 million for example four we found that the appropriators really like projects that have some Regional significance so you can get an earmark for a project that serves one Community but we tend to find a higher batting average if you have a project that's going to serve maybe a couple cities and counties that's just Grist for the mill from the first two years fifth start early there's some paperwork involved you'll see it when you click on the links under this video and that's to make the sure the projects are all you know vetted serious a good use of taxpayer dollars and a higher likelihood of making those on the Appropriations Committee say this is a priority that we want to fund um six you don't have to do this on your own my Senate staff is available to consult with you and answer questions and even work with you on what would be a competitive project and then finally what are your chances of getting funded well I'd love for a hundred percent of all funds to go to Virginia projects but senators from every other other state wants them too and we need to prioritize an important Criterion I use is this when Virginia organizations apply I I try I Look to try to make sure that we cover all regions of the Commonwealth and all sizes of communities so not just Northern Virginia but also the Northern Neck not just Fairfax County but what about Highland County not just Richmond but Emporia in the education space Not Just UVA or Virginia Tech but what about Marymount or Virginia Union or our wonderful community colleges if your Grant's office is just two or three people or even if it's just you we still want to know what kinds of projects would be helpful in your community we're not able to fund everything and the earmarked part of the federal budget is just a small part of the overall budget but we'll be able to fund some very good projects throughout Virginia and I'm really looking forward as we're starting on the third year of community directed expenditures to see the great project ideas that you forward into my office so please read the information below on this webpage carefully don't hesitate to reach out to my staff with questions and thanks for focusing on this and I look forward to seeing you around Virginia and learning about the important work that you're doing in your communities

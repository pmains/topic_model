the biggest problem is not the substance of what the President did last night although it is going to cause difficulties the problem is the process he can't do what he did you cannot make law last night that was not an executive order this was new law and you can't do that in this country on a unilateral basis we saw with health care where we had no Republican buy-in now we have no legislative buy-in you cannot change the big problems you cannot address the big issues on the unilateral basis the American public simply will not accept it and that's what's bothersome to me I'm interested in immigration reform just like mr. Pascarella I'm not interested the president doing it by himself congressman if we go back to the President Reagan and President Bush so I think I made the point earlier that they had attached additional things due to legislation but and again it almost was pretty similar you know some of the executive orders that that those two president Republican I not not guilty I don't think they were what what did the president do last night what an executive order properly done and their proper a lot of folks will give this president a hard time for the number of executive orders that's not the key the key is is an executive order properly done and a proper deck univ order prioritizes your efforts like prosecutorial discretion it focuses the the efforts of the executive branch that is legitimate use of the executive authority last night what the president do he made law he said look right now the law is that you cannot be here and we have to deport you now the law will be if you do a b c and d then you can stay and you can work that is not an executive order it's flat-out law and it's what he's not supposed to do what do you think congressman mickey's even my something good morning look good Mike wasn't all with you get the god Bless America she's not only that does not know history on I think he does know history's I select the memory right now Ronald Reagan President Reagan not only had an executive order he did it after legislation you guys and gals have not sent us any legislation over 500 days after the Senate and a bipartisan vote 68 senator is voted for comprehensive health comprehensive care and reforming in the immigration system this is a a compassionate issue this is an issue dealing with work even even the chambers of commerce support that we need to do something the system is broken and the president simply said for 550 days send us a bill send me a bill will take a look at it let's sit down and get a bill as the Senate did this was not done in the House of Representatives the President did last night what many other presidents have done in the past and he's even saying now before this is even implemented it's time to get us a bill I think if we sat down Nick we could come up with a comprehensive bill and we would have to compromise that's part of the American prying one talk about process that's part of the process and we should have that this is a homeland security issue the government has a right to know who's in this country and every day we waste we move away from realizing that fact that the government has that right under the Constitution of the United States you've tied the president's hands you did a great job in doing it and now the time has come for to put up or go home well you had you had super majorities for two years congressman so the president's hands were as untied as any president's been in the last four bilder consistency tried to build a consensus with that you could have done it you could have harassed effect it did it in the Senate didn't I hate to be ex enemy he wasn't the only one responsible for that what I'm worried about congressman Mulvaney is that I mean we saw your party had a great night and you're in a position that Democrats wish they were in and I just worry that you take this issue and it almost like plays into President Obama's hands to some extent I think because you can't I saw durban yesterday and you know yay says these aren't criminals these are children these aren't gangs these are families and I just don't know how the US you know it's going to be easy to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in 2016 again republicans seem to know how to do that every time and this might be the issue that suddenly the president looks good again how can you how can you look good again with what's happening with Obamacare and gruber and all this stuff and you're going to make him look good again isn't that exactly what this is about I think it is politics what is this is not policy doesn't mean it's not going to work though because they've done it before and it's worked this admitted I think folks at some point see through the politics they do what why did we do this last night but it wasn't this an emergency two weeks ago three weeks ago wasn't an emergency as you mentioned 2007 had the president not read the scripture two weeks ago sure last night was the latin grammys i make the last picture you please that's good we'll talk about politics you've had several years to do something to put it put your own idea just like you do with the a we're building but really I unitive come up with a no you want you and I to talk make all the time here's the weakness and what bills talking about he knows this is that I'm actually one of the Republicans who was interested in doing immigration reform imagine talking to have been talking to Democrats about a guideline a way to get to immigration reform as early as january of last year then what happened the president opened up the southwestern border bill in the springtime and all those discussions drove down couldn't talk to luis Gutierrez anymore it just simply couldn't happen after President did that Joe what if there is something tell me we've had a ruse for five years border security that's baloney I want to inform the Republicans that there's more than one border in the United States of America and they're not just Mexicans hordes coming over the Rio Grande we're talking about many borders that the United States side we're talking about Polish immigrants will talk about Italian immigrants we're talking about immigrants from from Africa we're talking about immigrants from Asia this is what we're talking about not just Mexicans in fact there are last two years we've had a slackening of those who are coming from Mexico trying to come through 9 30 minutes of it comprehensible mill veiny one of the people who would be willing to talk about this yes and now that he says was I'm assuming it's past tense what do you do at this point well well I don't think what the President did night is temporary what the president said that last night anyway what do you do to work with people like congressman Malaysian lame duck let's have a bill that we can set put on the President's desk even put it on the front desk in the new Congress in January that's fine what the President did last night was in sindhi area was designed to make those talks break down a lot of us more about it before the alleged did for four or five years is in syndrome dealing with fears I mean are the people who carry the American flag with those kids coming across the border are they any more American than you or myself I don't think so and the flag myself broke both sides are incendiary and and you know over the past five years both sides are at fault for a lot of I think on what part of jersey are you from a lot of Jersey huh nor things on this with my district you're my scare me I like the way you you know I you got that Jersey like it but I thought I got a little southern accent southern thing hospitality going here this guy you know I'm he's on the setlist but so I'm kind of deferring to him a little bit congressman I'm not I'm not chris Christie there's another guy another guy that's the jersey that I'm now they did get pretty darn close you're not some shrinking violet don't don't pretend double okay or I should discuss this in Iowa holder we should discuss in a civil way but you know we don't have time to discuss Obamacare in a civil way duty congressman I will be proud of the way that was Gary carried on much better than was like I wasn't incendiary that wasn't one side taking exactly what it want to know we remember every seven percent of the rule to this point on the widows of the stupidity of the American people Joe you always talk about don't worry about the whole I don't worry about haha a lot of goods coming out of it well happy thanksgiving if I don't see you too everybody good not much thank you for the game

with all the political rhetoric the finger-pointing and the many versions of Trump care hyper partisan politicians often forget what this date debate is all about it's about people it's about reliving relieving a person's pain and suffering about giving a person a chance to live a healthy and happy life it's about Max maybe you'll remember him Max was the mini Darth Vader from a Superbowl commercial in 2011 who captured our hearts max was born with tetralogy of hello a rare and deadly congenital heart defect throughout his 12 years Max has had more than 10 heart surgeries under the loving care at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles he lives every day with a pacemaker in an artificial pulmonary valve open-heart surgeries are complex and very serious surgeries they are tough on patients with often a long recovery and grueling for the family you see max stopped by my office a few days ago to talk about his experience and he told me quote I'm going to have my condition all my life I'm going to have surgery as a constant commotion on my life I just want to be covered I don't want to have to worry about insurance and how I'm going to pay these bills I just want to focus on keeping myself healthy and not having to sacrifice everything for a surgery unquote you see max wants to play baseball he loves Harry Potter and he dreams of being an actor earlier this year max was in the hospital for treatments for an entire month his mom Jennifer described how they were feeling bummed one day after such a long and arduous hospital stay so they decided to take a walk and on their walk they met a boy Max's age named will will is still in the hospital today he's been there nine months waiting desperately for a heart transplant max told me how will has been every holiday and even his birthday in the hospital this year max wanted to do something for will so they had these bracelets made he named them will power the ad Max's favorite verse on them mash and will connected they developed a bar a bond bound by compassion their hope for a normal life gave them strength and friendship and Max promised will he would bring the bracelets to Congress when they came Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and max and will that's my favorite verse - max is fighting to protect other kids like him and will people with a pre-existing illness from losing coverage and having to pay more from facing a lifetime cap on coverage he came to tell the stories of so many other children he knows from his many Hospital Village visits his message is simple quote children's health care needs a bipartisan solution unquote Max and will and all the friends they have made in the hospital aren't rooting for Democrats or Republicans they're fighting for their life and rooting for each other they are children children who want to get healthy who want to stay healthy and care for one another we can all learn from Max and Will's selfless courage to help others stop the hyper partisan fight to score political points and start fostering a bond through compassion let's find a way to protect health care for max and will in the midst of this health care fight we should take a moment to pause and remember that goal let's be like Max and think of others as we come together to find a bipartisan solution to address what isn't working and remember Max's message Children's Healthcare all health care must and should be a bipartisan issue thanks and I yield back

mr. speaker as droughts continue to work in across Kansas now impacting all 105 counties we are again at the point of seeing wildfires whip across the state of Kansas while so far none of them have come close to the size of last year's Starbuck fire there's reason to be concerned today I want to recognize the resiliency of Kansans who have been coming together to help neighbors and strangers alike as well as soldiers from the Kansas National Guard these Gardens work in cooperation with local firefighters and emergency personnel to combat fires and say people property and animals I stand today to commend their hard work and thank them for their service these fires are a stark reminder of the devastation created by wildfires last year and provide a reminder of the importance and standing together in the face of difficulty

hi i'm congressman joe morelli and i want to call attention to the critical work of protecting women's reproductive health rights 49 years ago today the united states supreme court handed down the landmark roe versus wade decision ensuring every woman in the united states has the right to choose i believe this right is fundamental across this country it has come under attack in states like texas mississippi and beyond we are seeing continued efforts to roll back the essential rights protected under roe versus wade we have come too far in the fight for women's equality to retreat to an era where women lack the basic right to autonomy over their own bodies with the fate of roe versus wade in jeopardy it's more important than ever at the federal level to safeguard a woman's right to choose last year i co-sponsored and helped pass the women's health protection act and i'll continue fighting to codify roe versus wade into law and uphold every woman's right to make her own health care decisions no matter what this anniversary serves as a call to action for all of us and a reminder that we cannot and will not go backwards you can always count on me to fight for the essential rights for all women thank you

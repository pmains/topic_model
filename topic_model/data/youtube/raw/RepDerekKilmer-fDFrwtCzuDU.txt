Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to support HR 50 120 the Department of Energy Laboratory modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2014 in the report rising above the Gathering Storm Paul Otellini the former CEO of Intel challenged Congress and challenged the nation to step up to the Innovation Challenge to grow our economy without a change in US government policy he wrote the next big thing will not be invented here jobs will not be created here and wealth will not accrue here I'd like to thank mr. Hultgren and my colleagues on both sides Dale for working together to produce a bipartisan bill targeted at stepping up to that challenge our National Labs are currently doing innovative research that can hit roadblocks on the path to commercialization on the path to helping small business run with those innovations so this bill provides important tools to spur and accelerate the transfer of new technologies developed outer national laboratories and help transfer those to the private sector it significantly broadens the range of companies that can participate a new pilot program with our federal labs and allows for more flexible partnerships more flexible partnership agreement terms between the public and private sectors the bill also allows labs to use their technology transfer funds for activities that identify and demonstrate potential commercial opportunities for their research and technologies these partnerships between our National Labs and the business community will help eliminate gaps in funding but facilitating a path for innovative ideas from basic research to have commercial application let me tell you why this matters to me the region I represent is home to the Pacific Northwest National Lab facility and I've seen firsthand the innovative research being done there I've also worked closely with our premier research universities to find ways to enable exciting new partnership opportunities so going beyond just the labs this bill removes burdens that currently prevent many universities and other nonprofit research institutions from working with the Department of Energy this bill streamlines management and coordination of do E's full spectrum of energy activities from basic research through commercial application by establishing a single undersecretary for science and energy and the bill authorizes doee to partner with the National Science Foundation so that it's researchers can participate in NF NSF's groundbreaking innovation Corps program which matches grant recipients with entrepreneurs to help get their ideas out of the lab and into the marketplace lastly the bill includes important reporting and accountability measures so that we'll be able to evaluate the effectiveness of each of these new tools and determine any additional steps that we should be taking down the road do E's national laboratories have been the birthplace of some of our most revolutionary technologies when this research is harnessed by entrepreneurs and business leaders startups with only one or two employees can grow into companies that can create hundreds of quality jobs we want to make sure that our national labs our universities and all federally funded institutions and initiatives remain an important foundation of our knowledge based economy that's why I was proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation to give scientists and researchers in both the public and private sector the tools and the freedom that they need to unlock a new wave of great discoveries like to close by noting that this is the kind of bipartisan cooperative work Congress needs to do if we're going to bolster our global competitiveness countries around the world are working to recruit and develop the next generation of innovators if we're going to have any chance of keeping up we absolutely have to make research and development a top priority I am hopeful that we can renew the bipartisan spirit and commitment to making sure tomorrow's cutting-edge technology has developed here not someplace else thank you again and I reserve the balance of my time

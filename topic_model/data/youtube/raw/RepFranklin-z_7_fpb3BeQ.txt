thank you madam chair I also am a strong supporter of this bill um as a career Naval aviator and a general aviation pilot I can tell you these aircraft controllers have saved my life on a number of occasions and this is a problem that we have nationwide and virtually every industry we talk to there's a shortage of personnel some of that is Coveted some of it's Baby Boomers in the retirement phase but this is a problem that air traffic controllers have been dealing with for years because of the mandatory retirement age at 56. personally I'd like to see that addressed because a lot of these people still have a lot of useful years that they could still apply their trade and we need them and it's a problem it's only getting worse and this bill is frequently those who would uh oppose it would say well these are small airports and we really don't need this measure to be put into place but I can tell you from personal testimony my own hometown of Lakeland Florida Lakeland Linder International Airport is considered one of these small airports it does use these contract controllers we also at our Airfield have Amazon air it's a huge air Hub we have five flight schools four government agencies including the NOAA hurricane Hunters Dragon International which is the largest private military Air Force in the world we have a sun and fun fly-in which is the second largest air show in the United States and we're considered a small airport so uh you know at any given time we've got 767's hauling cargo it's students who've never flown before military aircraft and then over 260 private aircraft that fly out of that field we need qualified controllers we need to keep these people working and the last thing we need in our country is anything that would disincentivize someone who's willing to work these folks should not be punished for wanting to continue to work and I fully support the ACT I yield back the gentleman yields back Mr session is now recognized Madam chairman thank you

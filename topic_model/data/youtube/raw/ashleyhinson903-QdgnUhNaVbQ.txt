joining me now is io congresswoman and house budget committee and house appropriations committee member ashley henson uh just what do you make so far congresswoman about what you're hearing about another spending plan as joe concha was mentioning earlier 1.9 trillion uh in well spending masking is coveted that was already passed we've got 2.3 trillion in infrastructure spending although it's not infrastructure that's been proposed and now this right yeah the spending spigot is clearly on digging and we have to respect the hard-working taxpayers of this country and what we've seen in biden's first 100 days in office is exactly the opposite we've seen like you said so-called spending packages that really include a lot of liberal wish list priorities and not that targeted relief when only nine percent of that coveted relief bill actually went to public health measures to get us out of this pandemic when we're hearing about this infrastructure package that is not really about infrastructure only six percent to roads and bridges two percent to locks and dams you've got more money going to electric vehicle subsidies than to those actual infrastructure projects so i think we need to to redirect the way things are going in this country we need to fix the crisis at the border that's a direct result of president biden and vice president harris's policies and we need to get back to respecting the american taxpayer which is what i'm hopeful that we'll be able to do moving forward well let me turn to the crisis at the border since you did bring that up a group of republican lawmakers pressing the biden administration to reveal how much money the government is spending on the ongoing border crisis in their letter to the omb director congressman jason smith and john catgo expressing concern about reports that funds from departments like health and human services and homeland security are being redirected to address the crisis congresswoman henson what do you know about this your reaction to that well i had a chance to visit the border myself and meet with the border sector chief of customs and border patrol and they told us uh that they are having to use their resources to address this problem and and that's coming out of their existing budget they're not getting additional resources to do that so you know that means that they're having to pull priorities from other areas in order to cover what's happening there they're pulling their agents off of the border where we know we need them to defend us against cartels and keep our country safe and instead they're having to literally change diapers and take care of these these migrant children who are crossing the border so we need to re-prioritize what's happening we need to peel back the curtains of the american taxpayers know that this is a real crisis at the border it's a humanitarian crisis the cartels are the ones winning they're making 11 million dollars a week just on uh in one sector of the border smuggling people uh so it's it's a major crisis in every state's a border state we need to make sure we're we're securing our border and uh respecting the taxpayers in the process lee carter so i'm fascinated by the border situation this is no doubt joe biden's weak points where he he pulls the weakest he's only got 50 support there um and only and even two-thirds of democrats 66 percent democrats say the border situation is a crisis that needs to be dealt with immediately 87 of republicans 73 of independents and so this is a real real challenge it's really important to the american people to get this right it's clear that the biden administration isn't doing a good job what is the answer how would we come together and solve this because it's a problem i think it's fairly simple we have to make sure we're being secure at the border we need to restart the construction at the border wall which immediately stopped when president biden took office we need to end catch and release title 42 enables our customs and border patrol agents to return these people who are crossing the border illegally more quickly to mexico we need to go back to those policies they were clearly working and right now again we have policies in place that are emboldening the cartels they're shooting at our customs and border patrol agents they're sending their dangerous drugs fentanyl up into states like mine in iowa it makes our communities less safe and those sheriffs are screaming out for help they need the resources and they need to be able to keep their communities safe but they can't do that right now because of the crisis at the border congresswoman but these were policies that were removed by the bite administration without congress being involved so how do you re reinstate these policies like you said the remain in mexico policy for example like are you powerless in essence i think our our greatest power right now lies in telling the story of what's happening at the border and i'm encouraging everyone who's going to watch the speech tonight to go to gradebiden.com and let us know what you think because i have a feeling he's not going to address the situation at the border which is why it's our duty to get out there and say here's what's really happening these migrant children are being detained in facilities that are they're safe but they're you know they've got coven coming across the border and who knows what's happening once they leave those facilities uh trafficking is a huge problem in this country and our communities are our people living in the communities deserve to be safe so so that's my biggest priority is to make sure that we can we can spotlight what's happening there and focus on the real solutions that are going to be able to fix this this crisis at the border brought on by president biden's policies congresswoman ashley henson thank you so much for being here this morning stay tuned

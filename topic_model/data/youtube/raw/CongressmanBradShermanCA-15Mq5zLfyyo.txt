 SHERMAN: TODAY IS A GREAT  DAY BECAUSE AFTERDECK AIDS OF  STRUG -- AFTER DECADES OF  STRUGGLE, THIS HOUSE WILL  RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. JUST IN TIME TO BE VIEWED BY THE LAST SURVIVORS OF THE FIRST  GENOCIDE OF THE 20th CENTURY. TWO WEEKS AGO I CAME TO THIS  FLOOR ANDRY SAID, NOW IS THE  TIME, FINALLY, TO RECOGNIZE THE  ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER THE  TIME TO KOWTOW TO TURKEY. SINCE THEN, MANY OF US  APPROACHED THE SPEAKER AND URGED HER TO PUT THIS BILL ON THE  FLOOR. BUT THIS GREAT DAY BELONGS TO  NANCY PELOSI, OUR SPEAKER WHO  MADE THE DECISION TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR WHERE WE WILL PASS  THIS RESOLUTION, HOUSE  RESOLUTION 296, WHICH I AND SO  MANY OTHERS INTRODUCED TO THIS  HOUSE IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. AND, OF COURSE, I  CO-SPONSORED -- BEEN AN ORIGINS  CO-SPONSOR OF EVERY ARMENIAN  GENOCIDE RESOLUTION SINCE 1997. WE ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, BUT WE  WERE TOLD AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT  WE WOULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE WE  HAVE THIS GREAT ALLIANCE WITH  TURKEY. EARLIER THIS MONTH, TURKISH  FORCES SHELLED TO THE LEFT AND  TO THE RIGHT OF AN AMERICAN  BASE. IT SEEMED CLEAR TO MANY THAT  THEY WERE READY TO KILL  AMERICANS. AMERICA WITHDREW, AND THIS WAS  NOT SOME WELL-PLANNED, CAREFUL,  DELIBERATE WITHDRAWAL. WE LEFT BECAUSE OF THE TURKISH  SHELLING AND THE TURKISH  THREATS. GREAT ALLIANCE? IT'S BEEN A GREAT ALLIANCE FOR  TURKEY. WE DEFENDED THEM FROM COMMUNISM. WE DEFENDED THEM FROM THE SOVIET UNION. WE PROVIDED THEM $23 BILLION IN  AID, AND WE ARE THE REASON WHY  THERE'S NOT AN INDEPENDENT  KURDISTAN IN NORTHERN IRAQ. THE SHELL TO THE LEFT, THE SHELL TO THE RIGHT OF AN AMERICAN  MILITARY OUTPOST. FROM 1915 TO 1923, THE OTTOMAN  EMPIRE MASSACRED 1.5 MILLION  ARMENIANS, THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE 20th CENTURY. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS  OCCURRED, EVEN THE  ADMINISTRATION TESTIFIED BEFORE  OUR COMMITTEE LAST WEEK. THE MASSACRE OF 1.35 MILLION --  1.5 MILLION ARMENIANS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST CRIMES OF THE 20th  CENTURY AND THIS IS NOT IN  DISPUTE. THERE'S NO DISPUTE THAT THAT  MASSACRE -- THAT MASS DEATH  CONSTITUTED A GENOCIDE BECAUSE  RAFAEL LIMKIN WHO INVENTED THE  WORD GENOCIDE SAID THE ARMENIAN  GENOCIDE WAS THE FIRST EXAMPLE,  PERHAPS, OF WHAT HE WAS TALKING  ABOUT. IT IS TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE BECAUSE GENOCIDE DENIAL IS THE LAST ACT OF THE GENOCIDE. FIRST YOU OBLITERATE A PEOPLE. THEN, YOU SEEK TO OBLITERATE  THEIR MEMORY. FINALLY, YOU SEEK TO OBLITERATE  THE MEMORY OF THE OBLITERATION. BUT GENOCIDE DENIAL IS ALSO THE  FIRST STEP IN THE NEXT GENOCIDE. WHEN HITLER ASSURED HE COULD GET AWAY WITH THE HOLOCAUST, HE  SAID, WHO SPEAKS TO THE  ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS,  AND IT'S TIME TO RECOGNIZE THIS  GENOCIDE TO REMOVE A STAIN ON  AMERICA'S HONOR BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW, WE HAVE HIDDENED AND  REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE  TRUTH. WE HAVE BEEN SILENT ALL IN AN  EFFORT TO APPEASE TURKEY. WE -- TURKEY COMMITTED A  GENOCIDE IN WORLD WAR I AND  DENIES IT TO THIS DAY. GERMANY COMMITTED A GENOCIDE  DURING WORLD WAR II AND HAS  ACKNOWLEDGED IT FROM THE 1940'S. GERMANY HAS MOVED ON TO BE A  PROSPEROUS AND STRONG DEMOCRACY. TURKEY CONTINUES TO DENY THE  GENOCIDE. THEN PASSES LAW PREVENTING THE  DISCUSSION OF THE GENOCIDE. AND THAT LEADS TO KRENS  SURESHIP -- CENSURESHIP,  AUTHORITARIANISM, LEADS TO  CORRUPTION IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS GREAT PROBLEMS. WHERE WOULD GERMANY BE IF IT  DENIED THE HOLOCAUST TILL THIS  DAY? WHERE WOULD WE BE IF WE DENIED  THE GENOCIDE OF SO MANY NATIVE  AMERICAN TRIBES? TURKEY WILL BE A GREAT ALLY OF  THE UNITED STATES. ONLY WHEN IT RECOGNIZES THE  FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE 20th  CENTURY, ONLY WHEN IT ALLOWS  FREE DISCUSSION OF ITS OWN  HISTORY BY ITS OWN PEOPLE. SO TODAY IS THE RIGHT DAY TO  RECOGNIZE THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF  THE 20th CENTURY. WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER. WE SHOULD DO IT EVERY YEAR ON  THE ANNIVERSARY IN APRIL, BUT IT STARTS HERE AND NOW. AND FINALLY, AMERICA CAN STAND  UP, ALONG WITH SO MANY OTHER  COUNTRIES

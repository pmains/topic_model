Thank You mr. speaker let me first thank the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands who has demonstrated great leadership in leading of these CBC special order hours it is not an easy task but has done remarkable work in terms of finding topics that are important to our communities in our nation so I'd like to thank her and you know as she stated mr. speaker this month we marked six months of the trump presidency and six months of congressional Republican inaction Republicans made a promise after promise to the American people the president called himself the ultimate deal maker I wonder are we witnessing the first manchurian president instead of a instead of the promise of jobs infrastructure and a new and improved health care plan we get chaos and seemingly never-ending controversies where is the Republican agenda where are their accomplishments where are all those wins let's take a look at the numbers President Trump has a job approval rating of 36 percent the lowest of any president ever at this point any president ever at this point in their presidency Republicans can point to zero legislative accomplishments he has no plan to lower health costs care health care costs no jobs bills no infrastructure bills no tax reform no clean budget they simply are the facts instead of doing what's right for the American people it appears that the Republicans are more occupied with taking away health care from millions of our constituents to give tax cuts to the wealthy or defending the administration's most recent controversy this week will vote on a dishonest security spending package that will force American taxpayers to pay for the president's border wall who's going to pay for it it looks like the American people now but during his campaign and the rhetoric that we heard up until this point Mexico was going to pay for the wall now here we are with our Republican colleagues supporting an effort that says that now the American people will pay for the wall well we'll get the money from Mexico later yeah all right as a member of the Homeland Security Committee I am alarmed by the President Trump and the congressional Republicans determination to further break down our alliances and ignorant of matters related to security of this nation instead of funding the border walls we should focus on building strong transportation and infrastructure systems that will create good-paying jobs and lay a foundation for a strong economy instead instead we are weakening America let's build America with a strong infrastructure built and adequate training and apprenticeship programs that will benefit our constituents let's make it in America is something that I heard last week which sounds magnificent if we would do it but if you're going to be the leader of this country and make such pronouncements you have to live by what you're talking you talking about make it in America wants to strive to make sure that we do everything in America when we hear of two buildings that he erected in Chicago use Chinese steel or steel from outside the United States if you look at his ties his shirts his suits the soap in his hotels nothing is made in America what who are we trying to kid with this nothing maybe his daughters will know her shoes aren't made in America her dresses are not made in America who are we kidding who are we fooling the American people have to open their eyes and see the Sham that is going on it is an atrocity of how this president says one thing and does absolutely the opposite make it in America he stood up there in front of the American people and said that with the suit and a shirt and the ties that he had on absolutely absolutely unconscionable where are the jobs I'm going to be the best I'm going to be the best job creator you've ever seen when when you're going to win so much you're going to get tired of winning when the American people deserve better the American people deserve better than a congress that cares more about pushing an agenda that puts wealth care in front of health care the American people deserve better than a Congress that will pass legislation that will harm our environment contaminate our air and pollute our waterways the American people deserve better than a congress that continues to ignore important issues that disproportionately affect African American communities such as criminal justice reform gun violence prevention and voting rights while this administration and congressional Republicans turned their backs on the American workers we will continue to demand real action to create jobs raise wages and create a brighter future for American families and with that Mr Speaker I yield back to the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands

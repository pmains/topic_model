senator from Louisiana I ask unanimous consent that Zachary Schultz an intern in my office be granted floor privileges until September 29th 2022. without objection Madam president I am constantly struck that when people say there's no consensus in Washington D.C there is often consensus it is just a question of a different means by which to achieve the goals of the consensus if I were to say that we would want to have increased National Security lower Global greenhouse gas emissions a booming economy and energy security everybody would agree the difference is how we achieve those means and so what what this process is is to give the American people the opportunity to judge what is the best set of policies that will allow us to achieve that which we are speaking of clearly there is a Nexus a connection you've put them all together between energy Security National Security the economy of our country and the economy of a family and whether or not a country is lowering or increasing or their contribution to Global greenhouse gas emissions and and this talk will be about that Nexus energy Security National Security Global greenhouse gas emissions how do we decrease them and the economy of our country and the economy of a family now I'm from Louisiana I think that's pretty well known senior senator from Louisiana and we are privileged to host many of the facilities of the Strategic petroleum Reserve that kind of that connection between energy security and National Security Now now the Strategic petroleum reserve for those who do not know is where we have salt domes full of oil um millions of barrels so that if ever there's another embargo like there was in 1973 where Middle Eastern countries were attempting to punish the United States we would have enough in our strategic petroleum Reserve so that we could draw from and we could preserve our national security and our Economic Security again that Nexus between energy National Security and the economy of a country and the economy of a family now President Biden has decided to drain the Strategic petroleum Reserve to lower the price of gasoline I'm all for lowering the price of gasoline but if you think about it drawing oil from a strategic petroleum Reserve is basically the same as pumping it out of the ground if it's in West Texas or off the coast of Louisiana one is just oil that's been produced and put in a salt Dome and the other is being produced naturally so rather than increasing production on federal lands the president made the decision to just draw from our strategic petroleum Reserve unfortunately we are now at the lowest level of reserves since 1984. to the degree and it's a great degree that our national security depends upon being energy independent we have lowered our Reserve to the lowest since 1984. which is to say that we are less secure in terms of energy therefore less secure in terms of our economy and less secure in terms of our national security now the president needs a plan to refill that from domestically produced oil period end of story and the swing production of that is going to be production on federal lands such as that off the coast of Louisiana now where does that leave us unfortunately President Biden's energy plan is such that the Biden Administration has set the record for the fewest oil leases on federal lands in the first 19 months of his office both Presidents Obama and Trump approved over 10 times the number of leases as the Biden Administration has over the same period so while Russia is attempting to Blackmail the rest of the World by their energy production where we have drained our strategic petroleum Reserve down to its lowest level since 1984 where Europe is paying record prices for oil and natural gas which may bring on a recession depression there which of course hurts our economy this Administration has had the fewest leases on record and Obama and Trump had 10 times as much in the same period this is hurting our energy security which means it hurts our national security which means that it is going to hurt the economy of our country and the economy of a family my gosh just ask if they're paying for the utility bill what they're paying to fill up their tank ask what they're paying at the grocery store which is very dependent upon the supply of natural gas and oil in order to keep those prices lower they would say that they are hurting this anti-energy policy has hurt across the board now by the way I think the rationale for not issuing those leases is that in some way if the United States does not develop our own oil and gas resources magically Global greenhouse gas emissions are going to decrease that is the Superstition of those who favor that policy except unfortunately you know logic you can't ignore facts a National Laboratory has said that if you're speaking about oil that which has the lowest life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions is the oil produced off the coast of Louisiana Which is far lower than the oil that we import from other countries if you are really concerned about lowering Global greenhouse gas emissions it is the environmental standards that we use in our country to produce our natural resources and by the way creating our American jobs that has the lowest life cycle carbon emissions so that completes our Nexus we spoke about energy security related to National Security which in turn creates better jobs and a better economy for us all and actually has the effect of lowering Global greenhouse gas emissions that is our Nexus unfortunately this administration's policy is hurting the American family as they pay more through inflation hurting our national security as our strategic petroleum Reserve is at its lowest level therefore our energy security and also contributing to increased Global greenhouse gas emissions as we have to import from countries import from countries without our environmental standards and because we're unable to increase our production and supply say Europe they're burning coal instead of our oil or gas and with that increasing Global greenhouse gas emissions now there are some bright spots on a bipartisan basis the the Congress just passed the Kigali Amendment uh which recognizes that which which is a form of hydrocarbons uh of uh which will used in refrigerants and the use of this will lower Global greenhouse gas emissions the United States Congress just passed that and so other countries which persist in using older technology which increases Global greenhouse gas emissions will be at a competitive disadvantage because Congress passed that so in the midst of this kind of bad news boy it's just not working out the way it should we actually have an example of how we can make it work better um I am an advocate for a carbon border adjustment not a carbon tax I think carbon tax is a wrong way to go but let me explain if we have a carbon border adjustment where the U.S chemical industry using our environmental standards using natural gases of feedstock everything we've done invested into lower the lower our greenhouse gas emissions we are competing with with countries in Asia specifically China which don't use those measures which pollute far more than we but because they don't use their environmental standards may have a lower cost of manufacturing we are competing against cheaper Goods but they're precisely cheaper because they're producing more Global greenhouse gas emissions the Kigali Amendment tells us what to do if we had a carbon border adjustment where we say this is the carbon intensity of our good that's produced and of a country in Asia say specifically China has a carbon emission profile which may be five to ten times higher if they want to import their good they would have to pay a fee based upon how their carbon intensity is greater than ours that's great one it's going to help us with our economy our workers who are losing their jobs to those in China because they don't enforce their environmental standards and we enforce ours and therefore our cost of production is higher those jobs begin to return it will be cheaper to produce here after all if China is forced to pay for the pollution that they're putting into the atmosphere creates more jobs that's good for Americans good for our economy strengthens us relative to the Chinese who are using their profits to to build a bigger Army it is good for greenhouse gas emissions now China is actually incentivized to lower emissions as opposed to now where they are where they have no incentive to do anything but to increase their emissions so it began to decrease Global greenhouse gas emissions it's good for our national security the stronger our economy is the relative weakness of the Chinese economy means that we're better able to invest relative to the Chinese which means that we're better able to spread Western values as opposed to the Chinese values which involve bribery which involve Corruption of government which involve coercion just look at what has happened in Hong Kong if someone thinks that the Chinese the Chinese Communist party is a better system of government we're able to export our values and push back upon theirs so if we're trying to have a policy as I said at the outset which combines the best instincts of the right and the left where we all want to have energy Security National Security we want to have a better stronger economy for working Americans and we want the lower Global greenhouse gas emissions the Kigali Amendment which passed on a bipartisan basis gives us an example of how to do that let's make a strength of our environmental regulations and let's make others pay for their ignoring those same regulations and in so doing we begin to attract jobs back here for Americans to strengthen our economy lowering Global greenhouse gas emissions strengthening our energy security our economy and therefore our national security Mr President thank you I yield the floor

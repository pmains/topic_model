hello and congratulations on the incredible work you do at JS Street I'm Andrew yang and I'm running for president as a Democrat in 2020 America and Israel have had a long storied historic friendship that has spanned decades and generations and it should continue to be that way for generations to come Israel is one of the only democracies in its part of the world and America needs to stand up for democracies everywhere I believe that the best resolution for the israeli-palestinian conflict is a two-state solution one that will enable both Israelis and Palestinians to have their own sovereign land and self-determination moving forward that is where my administration would seek to drive the current conflict and we would do everything in our power to engage stakeholders to make that possible under my administration aid to Israel and Gaza would continue and also aid to Palestinians and a US aid would be restored this to me is the best path forward for everyone concerned and I hope that we can make this happen under my administration starting in 2021 you

LIZ CHENEY SAID THE FORMER  PRESIDENT TRIED TO CALL A  PROSPECTIVE WITNESS AND THAT  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN  NOTIFIED OF THAT ATTEMPT.  ON NIGHTS LIKE THESE, THERE IS  CERTAINLY A LOT TO COVER.  TWO HOURS AHEAD.  FIRST UP, DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF.  SPOKE TO HIM JUST MOMENTS  BEFORE WE TALKED.  WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST TAKE AWAY  FROM TODAY'S HEARING?  >> MY BIGGEST TAKE AWAY IS ON  DECEMBER 18th, THE PRESIDENT  MEETS WITH THESE OUTSIDE -- I  DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL THEM.  ADVISORS, ALLIES.  AND THEY WANT TO SEIZE VOTING  MACHINES.  THEY WANT SOME KIND OF SPECIAL  COUNSEL.  THAT PROPOSAL IS ESSENTIALLY  REJECTED BY THE PRESIDENT'S OWN  PEOPLE. HOURS LATER IN THE  EARLY MORNING HOURS OF THE  FOLLOWING DAY, TRUMP SUMMONS  THE MOB AND SENDS OUT THE TWEET  SAYING IT'S GOING TO BE WILD.  AFTER THESE OTHER EFFORTS TO  OVERTURN THE ELECTION FAILED,  HIS LAST DITCH EFFORT WAS GOING  TO BE TO SUMMON THE MOB.  >> WHAT YOU THINK WAS THE MOST  VALUABLE PART OF PAT  CIPOLLONE'S TESTIMONY, AT LEAST  FROM THE CLIPS PLAYED TODAY?  DOES HE CONNECT DOTS THAT NO  ONE ELSE HAD BEEN ABLE TO?  >> I THINK THAT HE CERTAINLY  UNDERSCORES AND CORROBORATES  MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY WE HAD  ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE  PRESIDENT'S OWN LAWYERS KNEW HE  LOST THE ELECTION AND TOLD HIM  HE LOST THE ELECTION.  UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CLAIMS OF  FRAUD WERE BOGUS. THERE WAS NO  EVIDENCE FOR THEM.  UNDERSTOOD THE ELECTION WAS  OVER WHEN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE  TOOK THEIR VOTE IN MID  DECEMBER.  AND BASICALLY TRIED TO WARD OFF  A LOT OF WHAT FOLLOWED.  I THINK HE CONFIRMS A LOT OF  THAT.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT COMES  DIRECTLY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE  COUNSEL.  THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO  REPRESENTED THE OFFICE OF THE  PRESIDENCY.  IT JUST CORROBORATES HOW THE  PRESIDENT WAS TOLD OVER AND  OVER AGAIN BY THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT, HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE  LAWYERS, THAT THESE CLAIMS OF  FRAUD WERE COMPLETELY BOGUS.  HE GOES DIRECTLY TO THE  PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE AND  INTENT.  HE KNEW THE CLAIMS HE WAS  MAKING TO THE PUBLIC WERE  FALSE.  HE CONTINUED TO MAKE THEM.  HE KNEW THE CROWD WAS ANGRY ON  JANUARY 5th, AS HE WAS  LISTENING FROM THE OVAL OFFICE.  AND HE KNEW ON JANUARY 6th THAT  THEY WERE ALSO ARMED, ANGRY,  AND AN ARMED MOB. HE URGED THEM  TO MARCH ON THE CAPITAL.  THAT IS VERY POWERFUL EVIDENCE.  >> I KNOW YOU WILL NOT GET INTO  SPECIFICS.  CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE WHAT  PEOPLE CAN EXPECT TO HEAR FROM  HIM AT THE NEXT HEARING?  >> I CANNOT CHARACTERIZE HIS  TESTIMONY, BUT I CAN TELL YOU  THAT IT WILL BE FOCUSED ON WHAT  THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING AND  IMPORTANTLY, WHAT HE WAS NOT  DOING.  THE SUPREME DERELICTION OF DUTY  WHILE THE CAPITOL WAS BEING  ATTACKED.  AS YOU HEARD TODAY, WHEN THE  PRESIDENT WAS FINALLY PREVAILED  UPON TO SAY SOMETHING, IT DID  HAVE THE EFFECT OF GETTING SOME  OF THOSE PEOPLE TO TURN AROUND  AND LEAVE THE CAPITOL, BUT THE  FACT THAT HE COULD NOT OR WOULD  NOT RATHER DELIVER THAT MESSAGE  EARLIER, THAT HE WAS WATCHING  THIS ATTACK UNFOLD.  WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING TO STOP  IT EVEN WHILE HIS OWN VICE  PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO STOP  IT, I THINK WE WILL GO INTO  THAT IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL.  >> THE FOCUS ON THE PROUD BOYS  AND OATH KEEPERS FOCUSING ON  THE DECEMBER 19th TWEET THAT  JANUARY 6 WILL BE WILD, WHY DO  YOU THINK THEY SAW THAT AS A  CALL TO ARMS, AND YOU SEE THEM  AND THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO THE  FORMER PRESIDENT HAS AN ONGOING  THREAT?  >> YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY LOOK  FOR MESSAGES, PARTICULARLY FROM  THE PRESIDENT.  WHEN EARLIER, MUCH EARLIER, HE  SAID THAT DURING THE DEBATES,  STAND BACK AND STAND BY, IT WAS  MEANING SOMETHING.  HELP THEM RECRUIT PEOPLE.  THESE GROUPS WANTED TO FORM  KIND OF AN ARMED MILITIA AROUND  THE PRESIDENT.  HIS OWN PERSONAL ARMED MILITIA.  YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING  THAT COMES OUT OF GERMANY IN  THE '30s.  NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD EXPECT  TO SEE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.  SO, IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT  DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTOOD BETTER  THAN ANYONE ELSE, IT'S THE  PSYCHOLOGY OF CROWDS AND MOBS.  YOU KNOW, HE DERIVES SUCH  ENERGY FROM THE CROWD AND HIS  RALLIES.  HE IS ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT  THE SIZE OF HIS CROWDS.  HE KNEW HOW TO DIRECT THE MOB  AT THE CAPITOL.  AND HE DID.  AND OF COURSE, PEOPLE AROUND  THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD, ALSO,  THE PARTICIPATION OF THESE  DANGEROUS PEOPLE AS HE  ULTIMATELY DEAD.  >> WAS CHENEY AND AT THE  HEARING TODAY AS THE PRESIDENT  CALLED A WITNESS THAT THE  PUBLIC HAD NOT YET HEARD.  THAT THE WITNESS DID NOT ANSWER  THE PHONE AND ALERTED THEIR  ATTORNEY AND FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS.  IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE LEGAL  EXPOSURE THERE?  >> IT IS POSSIBLE.  I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN  COMBINATION WITH OTHER THINGS.  BUT THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO  INFLUENCE THE WITNESS'  POTENTIAL TESTIMONY OR  TESTIMONY.  I THINK IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS  WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING  TO DO.  WHETHER THIS IS ACTIONABLE BY  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL  PROBABLY DEPEND ON A LOT OF  OTHER ACTIONS OF THE FORMER  PRESIDENT.  AS IT AFFECTS THESE WITNESSES.  BUT, YOU KNOW, WE THOUGHT IT  WAS IMPORTANT TO GET THAT  INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC.  TO PUT PEOPLE ON NOTIC

based on today's hearing it's clear that passing policy solutions to address the fentanyl crisis is top of mind for Democrats and Republicans alike and I hope this will be one of many hearings the subcommittee holds to build on the bipartisan addiction prevention and treatment policies like the mate act that we passed at the end of last Congress the Biden administration's proposal to permanently schedule FRS within schedule 1 includes an important off-ramp to reschedule an FRS found to have medicinal value as well as research Provisions which have been adopted by my Republican colleagues in their halt fentanyl bill it's important because fentanyl itself has an approved medical use and it's possible there are unknown pharmacological effects and therapeutic potential for the entire class of substances is studied and regulated properly for example studying FRS may be key to discovering the next generation of naloxone commonly known as Narcan which will help to save lives our recent Trends in overdose deaths show the emergence of fentanyl adulterated with a powerful animal sedative called zyzaline which has been talked a lot about today more commonly known as tranq dope according to the Lowell's son the paper in my district First Responders have already seen the steadily drug make its way into Lowell the Gateway City where I grew up and I represent in fact the Lowell police department has sent out alerts to Residents to inform them of the dangers of this drug the city worries that Narcan does not counteract xylazine like it does with fentanyl and the FDA issued a similar alert back in November so Dr gandotra can you please shed light on how naloxone was discovered and how Research into FRS may lead into similar opioid antagonists uh thank you congresswoman woman for the question certainly uh we know naloxone is an important tool for reversing opioid overdose it was discovered in the 1960s by a researcher who was trying to alleviate symptoms of constipation from chronic opioid use and it's derived from oxymorphone I will also state that it is this property as an opioid antagonist that makes it incredibly useful as a mono product for uh for reversing overdoses but also as a combination product with buprenorphine for suboxone for opioid treatment and has a quite a different risk profile and diversion profile making that a wonderful evidence-based practice for treating opioid use disorder

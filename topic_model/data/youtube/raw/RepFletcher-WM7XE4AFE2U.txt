thank you Mr Speaker and thank you Mr pallone I rise in opposition to H.R 21. my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that as a representative for the energy capital of the world in Houston I support domestic energy production we produce oil and gas better we have better environmental standards better worker safety standards and better emission reduction efforts and opportunities we know it's important to produce energy domestically for our economy and for our national security we also know that domestic production of oil and gas is a complicated system from Upstream exploration and production to Downstream refining and transportation along the way and that is why I oppose this bill it doesn't reflect the reality of how oil and gas production works or solve the problem I think it seeks to solve oil and gas production is a long and expensive process leases are executed many years before production begins if it begins at all when we are talking about the Strategic petroleum Reserve we are talking about crude oil that has been produced and stored for emergency use so if what we're trying to do is make sure that the spr is full and available we should pass legislation to require the government to replenish it after sales are made to buy when the price is low if what we're trying to do is increase domestic production we should be working on permitting reform and addressing issues in the capital markets that are making Investments more difficult if operators can't make the Investments build the infrastructure and move the product what good is a lease sale today we've heard a lot of complaints about President Biden's strategic use of the Strategic petroleum Reserve which has successfully lowered the prices at the pump for Americans and weakened Russia's ability to fund its unprovoked unconscionable war against Ukraine and it has been a vital tool as we just heard for responding to national natural disasters energy Supply shocks and mitigating hostile foreign actors in other times we should support all of these efforts the response to this effort certainly should not be to make it harder to do what we have just successfully done but that is what this bill does placing new burdensome requirements to offer vast sums of public lands for leasing at any time mandatory sales are dictated by Congress or exchanges are implemented by the department of energy it's not the solution that my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to think that it is and I would be glad to work with anyone here to address the real barriers to domestic energy production and support Smart Energy policy thank you Mr Speaker I yield back

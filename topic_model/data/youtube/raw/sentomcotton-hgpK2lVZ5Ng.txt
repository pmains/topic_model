let's bring the senator Tom Cotton who spent yesterday with the Herschel Walker in Georgia welcome back senator hey Brian it's good to be back on the show with you well how did it go yesterday oh it was a great campaign rally uh in Western Georgia Republican stronghold rehearsal Walker is going to have a huge turnout because the people of Georgia know that a vote for Raphael Warnock is a vote for Joe Biden Rafael Warnock votes with Joe Biden 96 of the time he's voted for trillions of dollars of spending which has caused record high inflation he's voted to throttle American oil and gas production production which is why we have such high gas prices he's voted to go soft on criminals which is why we have a crime wave all across our country so on issue after issue Raphael Warnock who campaigned with puppies a couple years ago has turned out to be a lap dog for Joe Biden Herschel Walker will be a bulldog for the people of Georgia uh What uh how does he handling the controversy and the allegations about abortions he may or may not have paid for you know Brian uh Herschel has been very upfront with the people of Georgia for a long time but he is an imperfect flawed person as we all are um Herschel found God many years ago he's been redeemed and saved by grace um and you know people in his life that he's hurt as well like his ex-wife have now uh accepted his apologies he's done right by them they fully support him in this race so I think Herschel uh is a great Redemption story for the people of Georgia and in particular if you read his autobiography the struggles he had with mental health which caused some of the problems earlier in his life allows him to see exactly what families are struggling with when they face someone with a mental health challenge or perhaps with an eviction challenge which again will allow him to be a strong voice for the people of Georgia on the abortion question more broadly uh Brian you know in all my campaigns across the country obviously the Democrats are trying to dial it up to 11 on abortion um speculating about what Republican majorities might do as a hypothetical but we don't have to speculate about them Brian we know exactly what they would do because they all voted for a bill earlier this year that would mandate every single state allow partial birth abortion up to the moment of birth and would force you to pay for it with your tax dollars the Democrats are the true radicals when it comes to abortion uh I want to hear what Lindsey Graham said because it's a two or three points either way Hershey workers up or down and then you had this controversy in Warnock stayed quiet why because there's a domestic abuse allegation against him his lack of Child Support allegation against him there's all types of controversy this is you know Senator Lindsey Graham like you Senator cotton said a lot of success campaigning in the South cut 18. here's herschel's problem he's being outspent three to one he needs to run ads talking about Warnock voting against border security and increasing the IRS by 87 000 votes he needs to run ads telling the people in Georgia that Warnock has shut down domestic oil and gas production in the United States making us more dependent on foreign oil and gas and he also needs to tell the story about the double standard here this October surprise against Herschel you think that's an accident they waited this long to drop it right before the election so here's what you can do to help Herschel Walker and to help your own family if you live in Georgia vote for Herschel tell your friends to vote Herschel if you don't have a friend go make one if you don't live in Georgia you can tell people you know in Georgia vote for Herschel so you just get get down get dirty is there that type of uh hustle in the commercial camp oh yeah yeah from what I saw yesterday uh Brian what I've seen from personalized Team all year long um he's working at it like it's uh final final game of football season and the playoff birth is on the line uh Lindsay is right um if you live in Georgia don't just vote for her show but as I said yesterday the most important advertisement is not what you see on TV it's you talking to your family and your friends and your co-workers anyone who trusts your judgment and your opinion and saying I'm professional here's why and I hope you will be too and Lindsay laid out the case uh why that Raphael warnock's been a rubber stamp for Joe Biden he's voted against securing our border he's voted to hire 87 000 new IRS agents as opposed to the border patrol agents we need at the border he's voted against cracking down on fentanyl Smugglers he's voted for trillions of dollars of new spending that has caused this record high inflation if you want to change if you want to break on the Biden's uh Democrats agenda then vote rehearsal Walker if you're not in Georgia then maybe he's thinking about sending a few dollars so he can communicate to those voters who will make difference so you talk about communicating I've never seen anything quite like it John fetterman does barely does 15-minute appearances does almost no interviews will only agree to one debate and needs closed captioning because he can't understand what people say but he can understand what they by reading I feel bad for him but is HE capable of being Senator listen to what was on MSNBC last night this dasha Burns was able to do an interview with him and this is what she observed cut six we had a monitor set up so that he could read my questions because he still has lingering auditory processing issues as a result of the stroke just in some of the small talk prior to the interview before the closed captioning was up and running it did seem that he had a hard time understanding our our conversations I mean that's unbelievable in the Senate your experienced Senator do you need to understand when people talk and do you need to be able to talk well Brian first off let me say um I uh wish Mr fetterman very well and a full recovery I wouldn't wish what's happened to him on anyone and I'm sorry that it happened to him um and I do hope he makes a full recovery but but I want to make two points um about John fetterman first is that irrespective of where his condition is now and where it's going it's plain now that he misrepresented to the people of Pennsylvania over the summer the severity of this condition it is very hard to work in the Senate if you cannot have a discreet private conversation you know on the senate floor or in someone's office he may be able to use closed captioning at hearings uh and other public events but a lot of work happens behind the scenes and John fetterman misrepresented the severity of his condition of the Pennsylvania voters I wonder what else he may be misrepresenting to them and second his uh his recovery and the pace of it is the least of my concerns about John fetterman for pennsylvanians I'm much more concerned about his radical record especially his record on crime he has a history as a member of the clemency board in Pennsylvania of voting to let serious violent felons out of prison early and just think about this Brian he was asked once what would he do if he could have a magic one what's one thing and it wasn't to reduce inflation it wasn't to close the border it wasn't to end the fentanyl epidemic that's killing somebody in Pennsylvania is it wasn't even to find a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers so they can start winning some games it was to end long sentences for murderers that's where his priorities are that's not the priority of the Pennsylvania voters that's why they're going to elect them at all as in November but yeah I mean nothing against anyone with a stroke but if I had a stroke I couldn't do my job I'm not saying I wouldn't get benefits and fox wouldn't have uh like compassion but I just couldn't do it you know Tom you'd be Senator you'd be fill it in for me uh and until I recovered there's no no one who can fill in for you kill me yeah you well an Ivy League education with an infantry background with uh a session in Congress and two terms as a senator I think you're qualified uh I want to talk to you about Ukraine uh it seems to me that Vladimir Putin's Circle Inner Circle is closing and his uh barrage of rockets while devastating and cruel to me shows a little bit of desperation because he cannot win on the battlefield you fought in close contact you learned to find the Infantry the ukrainians are destroying the Russians in face-to-face contact the Russians are not committed to this fight here is uh Vladimir zielinski on uh on what he is uh seeing so far cut 22. as of this morning there were 28 missiles of which 20 were shot down more than 15 drones almost all of them are Iranian combat drones most were shot down on October 10 dimitro shrumsky showed excellent skills and the reaction shot and shot down two terrorist cruise missiles with the help of Stinger Man pads one person saved dozens of lives thank you for that they want a missile defense system we said we're going to get him there and said Germany is supposed to help and we're going to it looks like according to the Wall Street Journal green light a uh something that goes beyond what the high Mars will do in the field of battle what do you know well Brian the missile attacks on civilian Targets this week have been another barbaric action by Vladimir Putin I can tell you that the action though that matters from a strategic standpoint is what you cite at the beginning it's the front line infantry and artillery troops in eastern and southern Ukraine who are retaking vital territory these barbaric missile attacks as gruesome as they are and as despite the loss of life they've caused are not going to have a strategic impact on the war if anything they will simply further deepen Ukrainian resolve if that's possible against Vladimir Putin and against this Invasion if this is the new phase of War though then no question the West needs to provide more air defense systems to Ukraine so they can prevent protect civilian population centers these are not escalatory as the Bible Administration often worries about they're not offensive weapons they're simply designed to protect civilian population centers just like we help our allies around the world in South Korea and Japan and the Middle East protect against missile strikes as well and frankly European governments need to do more to provide those kind of systems as well the way to end this war is to back Ukraine to the hilt so they can get Russian troops off of Ukrainian soil there's a lot of Republicans who don't want to do this anymore uh say you know we need to we have so many needs here with 32 trillion in debt we're giving money out we're not following through and making sure and giving out arms and making sure that it's getting where it's supposed to we hope it is but there's no follow-through with it what do you say to people that are saying that I'm not sure we should be in this conflict well the reason this conflict started is Vladimir Putin invaded Ukrainian because he's always wanted to reclaim Ukraine for the greater Russian Empire uh it's not anything the United States did we're not fighting this war we are simply enabling the ukrainians to fight a war for their own soil as Churchill wrote it is the primary right of any people to fight and to die and especially to kill to defend their own land uh and the best way to bring peace to Ukraine and re-establish peace and deterrence in Europe is to allow Ukraine to defend its own territory when you see the news about how much money is being spent in Ukraine remember that's not simply spending money or giving Ukraine money to spin it is mostly the in-kind value of the Rockets and the artillery and the other weapon systems that we're providing them most of which is made here in the United States much of which is being bought here with those tax dollars to help provide good high-paying American manufacturing jobs in our defense industry like the workers in South Arkansas who have been working overtime for 10 months to ensure that Ukraine has the Munitions they need and to backfill their Munitions we need is the back filling going on does concerns of Oliver North and others that it's not being done that when we're emptying our coffers we're not refilling them do you know for sure it's being refilled so it's uh it's not going fast enough Brian that's why I propose legislation uh to substantially increase spending on America's Munitions um what we need is is certainty in the order uh uh allotments and the Appropriations for these companies that make systems like the javelin or like the hymar system or like the shells that go in those artillery systems these are not I mean they're Advanced weapons don't get me wrong but they're not a stealth fighter they're not an aircraft carrier they don't take years to make they can be made with a strong enough commitment of resolve both the money that we spend for ourselves and our foreign Partners who want to invest in them that these companies can open up a new production line or they can run a third shift on the production line we do need to substantially increase our rate of production of these kinds of weapons and we can if we show the resolve and commitment to do so all right stay on top of food center I know you will Senator Tom Cotton helping out Hershey Walker as there's a Sprint now 27 days till midterm election day Senator thank you thank you Ryan

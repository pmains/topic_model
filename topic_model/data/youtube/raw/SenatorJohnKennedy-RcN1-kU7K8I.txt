thank you madam chair i want to thank our our witnesses today for being here i want to thank you for for giving so much to our country um i want to thank my team my ranking team for their hard work especially many of you know him but i especially want to thank bubba from my office better known as kennedy's brain when it comes to really technical details it's a real pleasure for me to real joy for me to serve with senator feinstein she is and i'm not just saying that we've had spent a lot of time together on judiciary committee she is uh she is an institutional compass for the senate when you get lost you pull out your compass and she has served that role for many many years and i have and will continue to serve that role for many many years and i've learned an awful lot from just watching her and listening to her um before i give my opening statement i do want to recognize my good friend senator kester who uh if you haven't read it he rocked a first a front page article in the wall street journal this week i mean he rocked it okay if you will go read it you're going to want to follow him on facebook see he can't say anything yet so i can he'll get his turn let me just say a word about about louisiana um we we're a state that uh that has a lot of water we deal with storm surge from the gulf of mexico during hurricanes and tropical storms so and that's ordinary for us even in ordinary times we deal with a lot of water lately we have had to deal with isolated rainstorms people who don't live near a tributary or a body of water have flooded and i i don't i don't i don't profess to know why this is happening and in the grand scheme of things and in the long arc of history maybe this isn't unusual but uh i do know this if you get 8 10 12 14 inches of rain in a short period of time you're going to flood i don't care whether you're in the desert or on top of mount up of pikes peak the mississippi river of course runs through our state we're blessed it goes from the top of our state to the bottom of our state it has the third largest drainage basin in the entire world not the united states entire world it's exceeded in size only by the watersheds of the amazon and congo rivers now that's something that's a blessing but it can also cause issues um our basin drains 41 of the 48 contiguous states of of these united states so this isn't just a louisiana gem and issue it is a national issue our basin our mississippi river basin covers more than 1.25 000 square miles it includes all our parks of 31 states and two canadian provinces provinces it roughly resembles a funnel just like this which has its spout at the gulf of mexico i'm not telling you gentlemen i know anything you don't know but i just think it's important to emphasize this water from as far away as new york and as far west as montana contributes contribute to the flows into the mississippi river so the work of the u.s corps of engineers to say it's vital to america and louisiana is is a gross understatement um we need your help with flood control we need your help with storm protection projects just as we need help from our government with respect to the fire fires in in california and and the lack of water in some respects in their state um because we're talking about we're not just talking about projects and i know you know this we're talking about human life we're talking about humanity and we're talking about about property that people work very hard for now i just wanted to include these pictures everybody loves pictures this is a project uh that was authorized after hurricane katrina you know it well struck new orleans thank you american taxpayer and thank you corps of engineers for helping louisiana when we're on our niece this started in august of 2005. uh these pr the planning for these projects katrina of course killed about 600 people in my state and uh um destroyed the lives of many many more uh this project provides storm protection for the new orleans region not just new orleans but for the entire region we just you together we just built levees around the entire area not just the city we used levees and sea walls we we you together we constructed the largest surge barrier of its kind and this this project also as you know includes the world's largest not the united states its largest world's largest pump station it's known as the hurricane and storm damage risk reduction system and i just wanted to mention it maybe we'll talk about it later thank you again for your service

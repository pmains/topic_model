Thank You mr. president consumer protection has been a priority for me throughout my career as I know it has been for the presiding officer both he and I served together as attorneys general and now as a senator he and I have worked to give consumers a voice against companies that harm them through deceptive and dangerous or abusive practices this month mr. president we recognize consumers in two ways national consumer protection we recognize the week of March 4 through 10 is led by government and nonprofit groups and its focus is to encourage consumers to take full advantage of their consumer rights and make better-informed decisions for themselves in the marketplace every day ought to be consumer rights day because as President Kennedy once said we are all consumers and we are consumers every day of every year organizations here in America such as consumers union and other consumer groups around the world celebrate world consumer rights day as members of consumers International the nonprofit organization representing 220 consumer groups in 115 countries today also marks the 50th anniversary of a very special day in American history for American consumers on March 15 1962 President Kennedy sent a message to Congress calling for a national commitment to protecting consumer interest 50 years ago today President Kennedy spoke about the consumer right to safety to be informed to choose and to be heard these rights are the foundation of what we now know as the consumer Bill of Rights the consumer Bill of Rights has grown to include eight specific guarantees the right to satisfaction of basic needs the right to safety the right to be informed the right to choose the right to be heard the right to redress the right to consumer education and the right to a healthy environment today I'd like to propose another right a 9th right the right to privacy there is a growing need to defend individual rights to privacy in a multitude of areas this country was founded it's basic bedrock is on a desire for personal privacy on the right to be left alone it's the reason that people came to this country avoiding unwanted and unwarranted intrusion on their personal space on their rights and liberties they came here out of a desire for religious freedom economic liberty and the security of their person and property against intrusion I've heard numerous complaints from Connecticut residents who are concerned about their privacy they're concerned about federal and state intrusion into women's health care decisions they're concerned about government efforts to combat terrorism through tracking of individuals by a GPS or cell phone tower location those potential invasions of privacy are by the government by official forces but people today are also understandably and rightly concerned about corporate intrusion into their privacy they're concerned about government about companies crawling the web to collect consumers personal information and selling it to market ears they're concerned about mobile device apps that can access and acquire the device owners photos and address book without his or her knowledge or consent I am concerned about this issue and I'm encouraged by the bipartisan support for attention to it I was heartened by the president's recent call for a consumer privacy Bill of Rights a great beginning a very positive step forward and I believe that our approach to privacy must be comprehensive and robust as a threshold matter companies that collect or share information about consumers should be required to get consumers affirmative opt-in consent for collecting or sharing that data not an opt-out and opt-in specific informed consent and that should apply online as well as offline if a company wants to collect aggregate share sell share by selling or any other means it should get consumers permission otherwise it shouldn't be permitted and we also need to pay attention to the collection of information from consumers use of mobile devices as we've seen recently some mobile apps for operating systems are capable of tracking not just consumers web browsing but also their text messages what they photograph whom they contact mobile devices need a system-wide do-not-track option to allow consumers to control the distribution of their information finally consumers right to privacy also must encompass the right to prevent unauthorized distribution of that information and to that end we need to establish requirements for companies that possess consumers personal information to ensure they have security features in place to prevent data breaches those protections must be accompanied by remedies by fines and penalties that make those rights and protections real so that consumers as well have a private right of action Congress is working on this these issues there have been numerous hearings and legislation proposed closed we should be proud in this body of having continued the fight for consumer protection it should be full throated and full hearted

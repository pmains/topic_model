mr. Woodall thank you for yielding to me today Mr Speaker I find myself in rural debate today because my very reasonable amendment was not made an order the amendment was germane to the bill written with proper offsets and in accordance with house rules the denial of my amendment was purely political I wanted to debate my amendment on its merits because passage of my amendment would mean jobs for families in Minnesota's eighth congressional district in northern Minnesota there are vast reserves of copper nickel and other precious metals offering the opportunity for northern Minnesota to power our economy while providing high Wade's Union jobs and diminishing our reliance on foreign resources the twin metals project has a long and difficult regulatory review ahead because our approval processes are the strongest in the world twin metals is following the process we require they cross every T in dot every I and they will employ our friends and neighbors in good mining jobs of the future unfortunately politicians in Washington and the twin cities metro area opposed this project they know that we have the strongest environmental reviews in the world and they know twin metals will have the opportunity to succeed so they decided to change the rules they included language in the spending bill creating a quote study that does nothing more than merely delay this project it's changing the rules when they know a project has a great chance to be successful instead of including including it in the base bill they snuck it into a committee report language and instead of making my amendment in order they decided to reject it all because they want to interfere with the promising project in Minnesota district 8 twin metals were offered a mind plan of operation in the coming months I'm plan they will lay out how they will extract our minerals and store tailings in an environmentally sound way they will illustrate how they plan to meet or exceed all existing standards a gentleman from Minnesota is recognized mr. speaker this is unacceptable I want to debate it on the merits of my amendment by discussing how this will follow the rules and benefit jobs in my district instead I'm here to discuss the failed process and how the anti mining groups changed the rules to benefit their anti mining ideology Mr Speaker I opposed the rule and urge my colleagues to do so as well I yield my time thank

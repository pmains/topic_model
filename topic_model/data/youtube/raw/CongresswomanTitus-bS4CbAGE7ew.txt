hello I'm dina Titus your representative from Nevada's first district please join me in celebrating Black History Month by honoring the african-american community and events throughout las vegas this februari this month is a time for us to reflect remember and respect those who sacrifice so much to ensure equal rights for future generations I want to thank longtime community leaders like Anna and the late Bob Bailey Ruby Duncan of course Senator Joe Neal and many others who are the real civil rights heroes of Southern Nevada I also want to say what a privilege it is to work alongside George's representative John Lewis a statesman who has left an indelible mark on this country's history today it's almost unthinkable that some Americans still are not afforded the full value of freedom citizenship and suffrage sadly though opposition still exists there are forces that want to seal off access to the political process we've seen rulings in the Supreme Court that have rolled back votto protections and laws passed by state legislatures it would add barriers to voting like ID requirements and shortening early voting periods that's why my house Democratic colleagues and I are committed to fighting this effort and instead increasing access to civic participation for example I recently signed on to a resolution that recognizes the hundred and forty sixth anniversary and the fifteenth amendments ratification which secured the right to vote for african-americans I've also co-sponsored legislation that would reinstate voter protections from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and overturned the Citizens United decision that allows money to buy elections so please consider me an advocate and a friend when it comes to protecting our civil rights and liberties growing our middle class expanding access to high-quality education and promoting policies that empower all people I'm pleased to recognize the Black History Month and hope you'll join me in celebrating the many contributions the african-american immunity has made in district 1 and throughout our country thank you so much

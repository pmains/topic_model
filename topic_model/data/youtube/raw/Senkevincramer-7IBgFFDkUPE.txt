dakota on my mind senator kramer thank you thank you chairman carper again and i thank you witnesses i i want to add one point to the to the den berry example that john haryu talked about in response to senator capital's question especially since my friend from wyoming is sitting right next to me um that that that example actually generates now net negative carbon oil in north dakota as a result of injecting into you know to old wells uh a very important point i think that that we've we haven't brought up yet uh there's so many things that i get to but mr harley i want to ask you senator whitehouse talked about a value proposition which we know he's talking about some sort of a profit opportunity in all of this but with regard to the tax credit system there are different values not every credit's created equally not every carbon reducing technology is created equally have you ever done an analysis on the benefit of say a 45 q um credit versus a credit for say electric vehicles for example in terms of a dollar per ton or a ton per dollar comparison senator kramer yes uh thank you for the question um um i actually i was recently asked to uh uh give a comparative assessment of a of a conceptualized ten thousand dollar a ton ev credit in terms of what that would equate to on a ton of carbon basis um what i what i uh my valuation gave me a price of somewhere between 200 and 300 per ton of co2 avoided over the life of that vehicle um the average vehicle if you can consider that they're going to run somewhere in the neighborhood about 120 000 miles that they uh will have a fuel efficiency of about 23 miles per gallon they will emit a total of a gasoline-fired vehicle will emit about 50 tons of co2 over its entire lifetime uh electric vehicles are not zero so considering that they take their power from the grid if you use just normalized grid uh signatures and the fact that there's a life cycle associated with production of battery and so on they'll actually emit somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15 tons of co2 over the life of that vehicle again on a normal life so your net savings would be about 35 tons and at 10 000 you're approaching 300 a ton there so versus a 45 q which is 50 a ton for geologic storage 35 for co2 stored in conjunction with so even if we went up to 80 it would still be a bargain i think it would be a relative bargain yeah um you know i want to also follow up with something senator capitol asked you about and that is of course um the the primacy that north dakota has now wyoming has that others are trying to get can you can since you work across the country and with the federal government can you give us a little bit of a comparison as to why is it why is this primacy important to a state what's the benefit versus say states that don't have it versus say the federal government's response to all of this sure well i i think the proof's in in the permits um the best of my knowledge i believe the federal government has issued one class six permit the state of north dakota has issued three with several pending um and uh we've only had that uh primacy since uh 2017. so so why is that do you think i mean why is the state doing better than the federal government well i think in in the case of states they're much more familiar with their local geology and the opportunities that the state affords and regardless of of the permitting authority uh you know the the federal oversight is really on the wells themselves so the class six program really does not deal with poor space access and some of the other ancillary things that are necessary for the construction and operation of a ccos site so our state actually passed comprehensive geologic storage rules prior to the existence of the class 6 program and and ultimately needed to go secure that primacy even though we previously had fully comprehensive rules including poor space ownership unitization provisions uh etc how long does the permitting process take so uh in the state of north dakota the average uh thus far for each of those permits has been seven months uh the uh my uh recollection of the of the one federal permit was on the order of five or six years in its state of illinois can you in the remaining seconds can you explain um how e or actually function functionally works the amount of carbon stored compared to the downstream emissions from oil produced because that is part of the you know the you know program that's most controversial abs absolutely uh so so denbury has done a fairly uh extensive analysis of their own operations um and they estimate that roughly a quarter of their operations especially those that are industrially sourced or anthropogenic co2 that each of those is is in that carbon negative uh oil production operation so our own research at the bell creek field in southeastern montana uh further verifies that long-term uh secure geologic storage uh our average uh stored volumes over the course of a project suggests that it's going to be on the order of approximately one half ton of co2 stored for each barrel of oil produced thank you thank you mr chairman

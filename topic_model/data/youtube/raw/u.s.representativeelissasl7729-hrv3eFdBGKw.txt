have you ever visited the doctor's office been prescribed medication and gone to pick it up at the pharmacy only then to find out just how expensive it is i cannot think of one other thing that we buy in our lives where you don't get to know the price before you hit the checkout counter every day patients are leaving their pharmacy without the medication they need because they can't afford it and they had no idea what the price would be until they tried to pick it up well a bill of mine that was recently signed into law is about to help change that it's called the real time benefits act here's how it works medicare insurers will soon be required to provide drug price information to a common system called a real-time benefits tool doctors will be able to access the system right in the doctor's office and together with the patient right next to them they can show the exact out-of-pocket cost of a prescription they can tell you whether there are alternatives to that drug and which pharmacy has the best deal patients can make informed decisions right then and there all before leaving the doctor's office and by increasing price transparency this bill also encourages competition to help bring down drug prices across the board i've heard from so many people across our district about their experiences going all the way to the pharmacy only to find out that they can't afford the medication they need no advance warning no time to compare prices between different brands they either have to pay right then and there or they leave their medication behind now that this bill is law more folks will be able to make informed decisions and pay for their prescriptions without breaking the bank and it means we're one step closer to making sure no one ever has to walk away from the medicine they [Music] need

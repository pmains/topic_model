hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update excuse my voice and a little under the weather but as far as this week goes unfortunately I have a bad update to start with and that's we heard this week at the end of the week from speaker Pelosi that she is no longer planning on putting us MCA up for a vote by the end of the year she had been saying for months really back into the summer that it was on a path TS we were gonna get it done I was part of a coalition of 48 members 24 Republicans 24 Democrats that endorsed the deal encouraged her to get it on and due to a lot of factors I think frankly just being distracted with other things she has decided or said that she doesn't think it's possible this year we're gonna keep pushing jobs are at stake I've set up four hundred and seventy five thousand jobs wages rise manufacturing and agriculture unemployment goes down GDP goes up I sincerely believe this would be the best thing we could do for the Northeast Ohio economy and the entire region and so we need to get a vote on it there's there's simply no excuse I don't care how busy you are we have to vote on this so that's number one and we'll keep pushing that obviously secondly I was excited to lead a letter to encourage more development of pediatric cancer drug a chemotherapy drug it right now it's in short supply I'll butcher the name if I try to pronounce it but it's it's in short supply at the moment we need more production it's sent sent a letter out encouraging that obviously a big issue for parents in the country and it all across the world so I'm hoping hoping that and then in addition really just got some great time back in the district I've spent a lot of time in Medina County visiting with different businesses a lot of small business focus which was really the key had a good it good meeting with small business group at root candle but then again at a different location of Medina and just got to catch up with everybody good news is despite the chaos in Washington the district's doing great people are happy people are excited for the holidays the economy is doing pretty well not as well as last year but it's doing pretty well I think people are anxious to get some of these trade deals done but by and large I would say everybody's pretty happy and excited for the holidays and so that was nice to see yeah always great to catch up with folks so as always thank you for allowing me to be a representative and I hope everybody has a great Thanksgiving thank you

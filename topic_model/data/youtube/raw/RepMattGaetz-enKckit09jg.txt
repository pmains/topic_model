[Music] the White House did a rejected a call by the House Dems for documents related to conversations between President Trump and Russian President Putin president Trump's White House Counsel is serving the president's diplomatic communications are confidential the request beyond congressman Congress's so-called legitimate realm of inquiry joining us tonight is Congressman Matt Gaetz member the house judiciary and Armed Services committees congressman great to have you with us what do you make of this request by the house is this going to be the the standard from now on they're just going to throw out wide Nets and started annoying every agency of the federal government House Democrats are searching for everything because they've found nothing loo we're now more than two years into this presidency and there's yet to be any evidence of collusion or conspiracy or illegal activity of any kind by the President as it relates to Russia and so in anticipation of those findings in the Mullah report which we expect any day now potentially even tomorrow Democrats are having to launch 81 new prongs of investigations to try to find something to discredit president Trump now I think when we voted for President Trump none of us ever would have expected that we were putting at issue every business dealing that he had ever done dating back to the 80s or 90s and I think that this is a real has a real chilling effect on the presidency because when you run for president and get elected you don't open up every facet of every decision you've ever made in your life leading up to that point we want our presidents focused on the things Donald Trump's working on reinvigorating the economy ending wars renegotiating trade deals and creating the economic momentum that you covered with Larry Kudlow in the last segment yeah and and to think that of the 81 entities and individuals 61 individuals that documents had been sought from as in the course of this quarter court investigation eight agencies did respond meeting the deadline but that means that the rest told the told the House committee to go to hell I was encouraged by that too tell you the truth and there's no obligation for those individuals to produce anything in the absence of a subpoena but loo the POC receipt here is absolutely deafening you heard Democrats say over and over again we have to wait for the Muller report it's all about the Mahler report we have to protect the Muller investigation and now those very same Democrats are saying we'll forget about the Muller report we now have to go look into these 81 new things and plow all this new ground that has nothing to do with the original claims that they made and I think the American people are going to be pretty ticked off the Democrats lied and said there was cold hard evidence there was demonstrable proof of collusion with Russia we have seen none of that and it proves these are not people we can trust people we can't trust I want to turn very quickly to illegal immigration the border security crisis the national emergency what is going to in full unfold here what are the solutions or we're told the detention centers are being overrun we've got a Department of Homeland Security that cannot figure out what to do despite the fact that they have more than twice as many agents as well 11 years ago when there are even more illegal immigrants being apprehended and coming across the border DHS looks like an agency a department that is totally out of control here but loo there is no department that can deal with our border in the absence of a physical barrier and the other tools we need to stop illegal immigration and right now we've got a Democratic Party that's ready with their new you know with their new patron saint and beta O'Rourke to tear down the physical barriers that we have and so I think that with the president we're trying to disincentivize the illegal immigration by making investments on the border the president's budget which he just rolled out articulates border security and a physical barrier as a priority but Democrats won't even take a vote on the President's budget because they have no immigration policy you got half the Democratic Party that wants to go we didn't listen abolish ice and the other part of the Democratic Party that ran and in districts that Trump won and they're promising to work with Republicans but they're so busy with these crazy investigations that they won't sit down at the table and work reasonable solutions to secure the border the reasonable solution it seems to me is to build the wall the president's national emergency declaration verify and chain migration crack down on sanctuary cities it's not like we don't know how to do this it's not like illegal operations from history that no one can solve no political it has a monocot there's the border yes the wall well the president has just released actually to some of us the information on the different projects and military construction where monies are going to be reappropriation for the wall and i think that that shows progress toward that end but it must be incredibly frustrating to have all of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans working against building a wall and having the type of border security structure that we need if we want to preserve our country congressman always good to have you here thanks so much good to talk to you Lou

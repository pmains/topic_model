Thank You Chair and thank you Madam
Speaker. You know, Madam Speaker, as we continue
and consider this historic impeachment vote, let's be clear that the president's
actions seriously jeopardized not only America's national security, but the security
of our closest allies. His actions threaten the goals of the U.S.- led NATO
alliance. You see, Ukraine is a nation working hard to make its democracy
stronger. And make no mistake, Ukraine is on the frontlines of Russian aggression. Thankfully, U.S. military aid helps Ukraine defend itself against Russia and
integrate itself into the European community. When our European allies are
stronger America is stronger. We are better equipped to promote democracy and
put a stop to tyranny. But to President Trump, strengthening this valuable
national security objective, Madam Speaker, was not as important as smearing
a political rival. Madam Speaker, we know that he held nearly 400 million dollars of aid to Ukraine until President Zelensky agreed to help him dig up dirt
on his potential 2020 opponent. This aid was approved by Congress with strong bipartisan support. President Trump's actions hurt American diplomacy and undermine the integrity of our nation's promises to our allies. We will not allow our leaders to trade away our national security. We cannot allow Russia's continued threats to Democracy go unanswered. And we must not allow our own president of these United States to get away with breaking his own oath of office. Madam Speaker, that is why we take this solemn but necessary vote to impeach. Thank you. And I yield back the balance of my time.

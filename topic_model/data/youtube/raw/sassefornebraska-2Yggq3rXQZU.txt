I had 11 missed calls in a row from Melissa's phone and when I tried to call her back there was no answer he was working for President Bush and that Holl day I had this weird headache and I never really get headaches you remember walking down the street we just seen their first one land my head is ringing so hard so I say to them I know this is so strange but I just need to sit down also we thought that was just normal that she wanted to take a nap personally she just lay down beside the street there was a woman who was riding her bike to work in the so she saw me sit down with two little girls and thought that looks weird she pulled off and came over and said do you all need help and at that point I was in the middle of an aneurysm they figured out what happened and they said we don't know what's gonna happen when she wakes out you could have a wife that will never take care of your children again we wait there's just a whole range we didn't know if she was gonna make it at that point my mom and my sister came out to live with us I'd put my two little girls to bed they were three and five we'd get anomalisa in my bed I'd be in the middle and her mom's run a girl on both sides and my dad would come back for like half the night and then he'd go back to the hospital as soon as the nurses had let me in after visiting hours I'd take to the halls and try to find a vacant room somewhere and steal a hospital bed and marry it up - Melissa's bed snuggle over up against her and every night I would do these two two moments ago into bed and my girls think I was gonna sleep with them then sneak out of the house and go and steal a bed to sleep with Melissa in the hospital he really set up a great system that's the part where we can kind of keep things going five or six months after the event we had a battery of tests done and they said she's had nearly three years of recovery in these six months and a lot of the things that we've been telling you weren't gonna come back we think you're gonna get a lot of these mental abilities back we had changed jobs about six weeks before the hospital dug through her purse and found an insurance card but it was an insurance card that was from the job that we had left six weeks ago and who'd had known that we were gonna be fighting two different insurance companies for the next five months about a hundred and sixty thousand dollar bill that should have been covered this obvious that our health care system is just it was a complete mess in that you had no portability across jobs and Obama cares done nothing to make any of that better now instead of a big company on in your health insurance policy the president says a big government bureaucrat can own your health insurance policy families should own their health insurance policy these aren't political issues to us this is personal people are suffering or are going through these things and yet God can use this for good she is fine except that she can't drive because all the vision where I left I was shut off there's like a line that she can't see it's been seven years now we made it through that time I still have a little bit of fatigue I think from that time but overall we're back you

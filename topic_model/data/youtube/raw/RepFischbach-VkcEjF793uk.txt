madam speaker house resolution 601 provides for the consideration of two controversial partisan bills and deems the 3.5 trillion dollar reconciliation resolution adopted that strip away local control and add trillions to the national debt the building adopted under this rule is s con resolution 14 the 3.5 trillion dollar tax and spending bids that passed the senate earlier this month mana speaker prices are at a 13-year high and inflation is rising president biden has already spent 1.9 trillion and is now looking to spend an additional 3.5 trillion all while his administration pays americans not to work and stifles our robust economy not only does this budget call for the highest sustained federal spending level in american history but it also amounts to a whopping 68 trillion dollars over the next decade it raises taxes on the american people ships jobs overseas and taxes american employers at one of the highest rates in the world it eliminates right to work protection and does nothing to address the historic flow of illegal immigration at the southern border democrats know their proposals are unpopular they can't even get their own conference to agree instead they're resorting to smoke and mirrors to push it through and hoping the american people aren't paying attention where is the transparency if democrats truly want to serve and help the american people they need far more transparency and input from everyone not just a few this is no way to build a budget madam speaker then there is hr4 which would make changes to the voting rights act and strip state and local governments of their ability to manage their own elections the constitution places the responsibility for elections at the state level and we have a long history of letting each state run their own elections but h.r 4 grants the federal government unprecedented control over state and local elections it empowers the attorney general to bully states and forces those states to seek federal approval before making changes to their own voting laws hr 4 also provides incentives for advocacy groups to file as many objections as possible to manufacture litigation in the hope of triggering coverage under the voters rights act we need safeguards that make it easy to vote and hard to cheat hr4 is not the solution and finally madam speaker the final bill in this resolution is the senate amendment to h.r 3684 which provides for 1.2 trillion in new infrastructure spending i hate to say it madam speaker but my democratic colleagues are using the bipartisan infrastructure framework to force their members to also push through trillions more in their outlandish spending resolution our constituents of ty are tired of washington playing games with their livelihoods to be sure investing in our nation's infrastructure is critical however only a fraction of this 1 trillion plus bill goes is for roads bridges and other projects the american people would consider traditional infrastructure with tens of billions for electric vehicle plug-ins amtrak and light rail if you live in a deep blue city this bill is for you but if you're one of the millions of americans in a more rural area this bill leaves you behind madam speaker our country's infrastructure should not be tied to the democrats partisan spending spree especially during a pandemic but here we are until democrats stop playing games and work with their colleagues on a truly bipartisan compromise i urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying bills thank you madam speaker and i reserve the balance of my time

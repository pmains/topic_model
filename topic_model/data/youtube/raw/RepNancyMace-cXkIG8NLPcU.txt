right and you know i i crafted this bill in a way that brought together uh pro pieces of different bills that had been filed previously or discussed whether those were republican or democrat i tried to make this palatable for both sides of the aisle and having expungement and release of federal non-violent cannabis users it was a big component of that republicans and democrats alike have for years now tried to create second chances for these kinds of individuals and this bill does that it will affect about 2 600 inmates given the expungement and release and then it allows states to do what they are doing today and want to do with regards to release and expungements this is a great bill that gets the federal government out of the way of what states are already doing today and uh does that levies a three percent excise tax and uh creates a framework for regulation at the federal level much like alcohol and so the the goal is to get democrats and republicans to work together on a bill that's viable and this one is the art of the possible and passable

John Lewis and we're going to change the trajectory of our country we're going to change your trajectory of our nation we're going to save that next life it may not be easy but when morality called you after that morality and we have the moral high ground and when I was talking to my media back home and talking to some of the reporters and they said aren't you going to be tired isn't it going to be uncomfortable staying up all night what I said was that isn't discomfort what is discomfort is listening to the agony of that mother who is never going to see their son or daughter dad is discomfort listening to that son or daughter that is never going to see their father or mother again that is discomfort and that is what this is all about and I can't go back and save those forty nine sons and daughters that we lost nor lando or the thousands of others we just don't have that power but what we do have the power is to save that next life to turn this around to prevent the next vanity let's do this mr. speaker democracy calls us to action let's do what we were elected to do and save that next life let's have a vote let's have a conversation let's have a debate thank you you

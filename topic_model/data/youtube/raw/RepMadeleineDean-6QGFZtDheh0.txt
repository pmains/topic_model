it's americans livelihoods that hang in the balance as a pair of pandemic unemployment programs expire today impacting about 14 million people joining me now pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean a democratic member of the judiciary and financial services committees welcome back to the broadcast hope you had a good holiday i'm asking about this relief bill and how imperative you think it is that it gets signed today and even if it does what kind of lapse and benefits can americans expect well merry christmas happy kwanzaa alex thanks for having me on uh it's beyond urgent that the president signed this bill and send relief to american people can you imagine this holiday season as the president is off golfing or tweeting uh he cares little for the suffering and pain of other people he cares not at all that today unemployment benefits and the enhanced federal benefit will run out we have millions of people unemployed struggling through no fault of their own because of a pandemic and a virus that is out of control and yet the president has been disengaged uh uncaring it's sad but this president is going out the way he came in soulless and substance free and there are many who will agree with you but there are those who've heard that the president says he wants the relief checks to be raised to two thousand dollars that's up from 600 in this bill house republicans are the ones that nix that they block the democratic efforts to go along with the president speaker pelosi now setting up a vote for the standalone bill on monday i mean do americans need two thousand dollars not six hundred dollars and will they get it well i thank uh the president it's rare that i do this but thank the president for pointing out the great need that americans have back in the summer matt cartwright and i congressman cartwright and i introduced payments for the people guess what the level was two thousand dollars and it would be a recurring payment quarterly connected to need connected to the unemployment levels it's very strange that the president who is allegedly the author of the art of the deal was disengaged paid no attention to the negotiations and then once the negotiations are complete and we have a bipartisan bill that we have passed that he now stands in the way throwing it up in the air the idea of two thousand dollars do people need that absolutely it is desperately needed relief an economist told us long ago that people needed relief throughout this pandemic you remember we passed the heroes act back in may the president and the republicans did not engage and the president didn't even engage until after his own administration had come up with a deal yeah the timing is actually quite extraordinary given the months it took to get to where we were just this week only to have a last-minute you know thorn thrown into the plans there the president uh calling for the higher stimulus checks but he's also telling congress hey stop the billions of dollars in pork he says it delivers too much money to foreign countries not enough to americans is the president right i mean is the relief bill not doing enough for americans you know what this was not the bill that we wanted we wanted more relief to the american people and we wanted it sooner and we wanted it recurring uh but look what happened christmas eve the president's own party republicans blocked with great indecency the two thousand dollar bill so we'll be putting that on the floor again uh on monday so we'll hold everybody to account uh what the president is doing is has nothing to do with the substance of the bill he's just creating chaos that's the way he operates there is a new usa today suffolk university poll i want to look through uh according to that 50 percent of americans predict history will judge donald trump as a failed president what's your reaction to that and and his effort now to boost money now to americans is it too little too late well i think history will reflect sadly that this president has been an utter failure when he was elected president we all wanted him to be successful and i was reflecting alex on his inaugural address as we prepare for a new president's inaugural address you remember the jarring dark words that he used he used the words that this american carnage stops now stops here i think sadly he was projecting what his presidency would be a very dark set of carnage that sadly he will go out and he will forever own corruption indifference uh think about it he's executed people as he pardons others he will go out sadly a most failed president and that is not what anybody wanted and there have been government shutdowns on his watch in fact one is looming as the covert relief bill is tied to the larger spending package how likely is a government shutdown this next week do you think congress will avoid it oh i pray and i believe we will avoid it you know when i was sworn in two years ago we were in the midst of the longest shutdown in american history that cost americans billions of dollars we now are in the midst of a pandemic where people are worried about their lives their livelihoods uh the social justice reckoning that we need to face and so i pray and believe we will avoid a government shutdown to impose more harm on america at a time when they are suffering such great harm would be extraordinarily unjust and i want to say again i call upon the republicans work with us work with this administration as it goes out the door to send relief to the american people and prevent any further harm you mentioned federal executions as well as the president's pardons this week those pardons included roger stone paul manafort in fact multiple other people caught up in the mueller russia probe as well as some allies from congress what do these pardons say to you they say that this president never understood his job he never understood the leadership the role of the president a pardon has to do with mercy a pardon has to do with someone paying his or her due to society this is these are sets of pardons that have nothing to do with mercy they have to do with favoring friends can you imagine at a time when he allowed the executions federal executions to go forward he pardoned the blackwater uh defendants uh mr kushner uh it's it's extraordinary but it it's shocking but it is not surprising this is the very man the huckster who was elected president uh he is going out shamefully with these pardons he's going out shamefully not caring about the suffering of american people not caring about people who are hungry and in food lines as he goes and golfs or if it's a little too cold for him he tweets pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean sobering assessment right there i'll look forward to seeing you though in 2021 thank you

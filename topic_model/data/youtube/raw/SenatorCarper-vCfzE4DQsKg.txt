thanks very much i'm the last vietnam veteran serving in the united states senate i remember full well our withdrawal from vietnam i remember watching on television as american helicopters rose from the ground in saigon and attached to them all over those helicopters were if you hadn't made people trying to get out of that country i remember watching those uh helicopters rise into the the sky and people fall off of those helicopters to their death and as i watched the uh withdrawal and the effort to try to get 125 000 people out of afghanistan a month or so ago i was reminded of what happened uh in vietnam i think in 1974. the uh i think from the time that uh donald trump and i'm not a real political guy as my my colleagues know i think from the from the moment he sat down with the taliban and we had a negotiation cut our two presidents to 2500 people i think the guy was well cast i think that pitch was pretty well telegraphed and i said to myself this may not end well and it didn't i think the question for us now is what do we do now what do we do now we're out of afghanistan we're trying to make sure that about 125 000 other people who are afghans who helped us that they have a chance to get out of there and to be resettled here and i think our challenge is the way how do we handle the resettlement how do we handle it and that is mr uh mr secretary that is a big part of your job help by delaware and jack markell our former governor to to make it go well and i think one of the questions for me today is what do we need to be doing not just in this committee not just in the senate but what do we need to be doing as a body uh at large to help make sure that the folks that are coming here have a new chance in their lives have a chance to get settled a lot of them want to work we have a lot of employers that are looking for workers and maybe at the end of the day that something something good hopefully can counter somehow very tragic i stood on the tarmac with the president or military leadership my congressional delegation about a month ago as we received the the sacred remains of twelve of our of our heroes navy air force that rather navy marines army and uh it was a sad sad and hard hard day what do we do now going forward there's a lot to do we need to work together to make sure that we learn from always what's happened in the past we'll learn what's happened in the last 20 some years and go forward with that having been said i i want to ask my first question if i could to mr ray director ray in 2020 the fbi arrested 180 individuals on domestic terrorism-related matters of these arrests 75 were identified as white supremist extremists for years now we've been hearing about the rising threat of racially motivated attacks specifically attacks carried out by white supremacists you may have heard me say before that in order to address a problem we must understand and address the root causes of that problem director ray and secretary marcus why have we seen such a rise in racially and ethically ethnically motivated extremism and violence in this country in recent years and what is the root cause and how are we tackling it mr secretary senator carper let me if i may take a moment to answer a point you made or respond to a point you made there's important legislation uh that is that is pending that would uh bestow uh upon individuals evacuated from afghanistan uh the same benefits uh that refugees receive and that would assist um in their resettlement here in the united states and their integration into our communities and we're extraordinarily proud and inspired by the unity that we see across of the country we have seen regrettably um over the last several years uh senator arise in the manifestation of hate we've seen the propagation of false narratives we've seen an increase in anti-government sentiments and we are very watchful of and vigilant in response to any signs of connectivity between those ideologies and acts of violence that is where our focus is all right thank you um director wright please same question root cause what is it what are we doing about it uh so i think our focus is of course on the violence not on on the ideology itself um i would say that we one of the things that we've done about now two years ago is create a domestic terrorism hate crimes fusion cell which was designed to bring together both our domestic terrorism experts as well as our hate crimes experts and try to be try to get ahead of the uh of the threat and be more proactive in going against the threat and we're very proud for example of the work of that fusion cell in preventing a an attempted attack on a synagogue outside of las vegas for example i will say that a big part of the threat that you're asking about is the social media dimension you know some of these same people before might have been stewing away in you know the basement or the attic one part of the country and not communicating with the other but today uh terrorism moves at the speed of social media and you have the ability of of lone actors disgruntled in one part of the country to spin up similar like-minded individuals in other parts of the country and urge them into action or inspire them into action i think that is a huge part of the threat that you're asking about all right thank you another question if i if i could uh with respect to afghanistan and counter terrorism this would be for all all three witnesses and i'd like to uh to start uh if i could uh with uh uh uh director robbie say please question as we grapple with the fall of the government of afghanistan our focus remains on how to get americans and our at-risk allies to safety however as we know and as i believe you've mentioned in your testimony ma'am terrorism uh organizations thrive when they can explain instability and we govern institutions that said it's important that we look ahead to our ever-changing landscape in that region following the taliban takeover of afghanistan to that end i'd like to ask each of you to take a moment to address the following how has our threat landscape changed since the u.s withdrawal from alaska afghanistan just three weeks ago and how are your agencies working to address the shifting threat landscape that will undoubtedly continue to evolve follow up i have a follow-up but let me just let's that's that's the one i'd like for you to tackle please if you would i'd ask each of you to try to be relatively brief there will be a second round of questions thank you thank you madam chair thank you very much um the threat from afghanistan i think is is the top of our priority in terms of understanding what that dynamic landscape is likely to produce in terms of an external threat we do think that principally the operating groups isis k and al-qaeda present a significant threat in the region they are going to have to contend with the new [Music] de facto government in afghanistan the taliban principally isis k and this will be an absolute top priority as we develop our intelligence capabilities are over the horizon capabilities to make sure that we're monitoring any changes in the threat landscape and able to arm policy makers to address that thank you thank you very much manager i'm just going to ask that there are other two witnesses respond for the record to that same question thanks very much and it's good to see you all thank you very much for being here for your service and for your leadership with the men and women with whom you serve thank you

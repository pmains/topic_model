u.s representative nancy mates was in mount pleasant tonight talking about infrastructure reform alongside the group americans for prosperity this as a bill backed by the biden administration is getting a lot of discussion in washington a lot of people talking about it news 2's kate presta joins us now live the charleston harbor fish house that's where the congresswoman spoke tonight and kate you got a chance to speak to representative mason why she says this is such an important issue that's right representative mace telling me that with only five percent of this plan going towards repairing old bridges and roads she says she simply wants more for south carolina any infrastructure plan that i support i wanted to be bipartisan i think it's really important but also that it actually has something to do with infrastructure representative nancy mace addressing the low country after voting against the biden administration's four trillion dollar infrastructure plan that she says included very little improvements to transportation infrastructure some have tried to redefine infrastructure as human infrastructure like school lunches and art sculptures and those kinds of things and that's not what most people think of when they think of roads and bridges they want their potholes built they want their roads white and they want their airports upgraded and you know all those things are important as it stands the current proposal could also impact south carolina in removing it from being a right to work state that plan heading to the senate where representative mace believes more will be done the bill that passed out of the house all that wasteful spending it's not going anywhere the real bipartisan work right now is being done in the senate while may says there's hope in the senate she worries if a bipartisan agreement cannot be met the package will be passed on party lines through reconciliation my fear is that nancy pelosi will do the same thing if she does an infrastructure package to budget reconciliation or any additional spending she won't give us a say and i'm really confused by this because i live in a swing district i represent republicans and democrats alike the u.s senate is evenly divided 50-50 and the house has a very slim majority this is not the time to go and be at odds over everything in such a far direction really is the time to work together and my message to democrats and republicans i'm literally willing to work with anyone who's willing to work with me those who led the event tonight americans for prosperity say they'll be sending a postcard from the low country to president biden's death showing their opposition for now live in mount pleasant i'm kate prestak count on two

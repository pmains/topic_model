proof in the polls that the Republicans are ahead congressman brad Sherman joins us now and he's a Democrat from the San Fernando Valley Sherman from Sherman Oaks as he likes to say right so what do you how do you react to that did that tweet Trump is trying to tear down our institutions because he knows that the ultimate report will indicate that he's guilty of obstruction of justice and perhaps collusion so he's preemptively trying to say the FBI is a communist organization the Muller who's been I believe a lifelong Republican is somehow conspiring with Democrats even though there's almost no leaks out of his investigation he's trying to tear down the institutions and he's having some success yeah meanwhile at the same time he's trying to negotiate a deal with North Korea there's this possibility of this summits gonna be on off on off with kim jeong-hoon do you think that there should be a summit do you think the u.s. is is ready for that and what do you want to see accomplished well what I'd like to see accomplished is a reasonable goal this idea that we're gonna have one meeting and then there's going to be a completely denuclearized North Korea's absurd but if we can freeze inspect make sure that they're not developing any more fissile material block any further developments of their missile program then were a lot safer than we would be otherwise but I think Trump may have set himself up for failure by talking about the Libya model yeah well he didn't specifically talk about that was john bolton a security adviser and vice president Mike Pence and then president Trump tried to walk that back are you comfortable with President Trump in a room one-on-one with Kim Jong Un's you negotiate with the president you have not the president you wish you had I think that it's they're not doing the preparation that you would ordinarily do this is not a normal foreign policy establishment and the the greatest fear is that he storms out of the room and then turns to military action I don't think he'll do that because that would be so destructive okay now let's talk a little bit about some of the politics there's a big going on within the Democratic Party about what to do about the impeachment question you've introduced articles of impeachment on the house but not all of your Democratic colleagues think that's a good idea I recently spoke with congressman Adam Schiff on our new political show called the issue is this is what he had to say well Democrats like brad Sherman Maxine Waters and others who are pushing impeachment hard you're saying stop it I'm saying that for us to be advocating for impeachment before we even know what the full body of evidence is and I I've seen more of it than most of my colleagues let's wait what's your response to that I think we have the evidence that there's been a violation of our obstruction of justice statute we've had that for a long time I saw all of James commis testimony it is clear it is convincing he was threatened in an effort to get him to pull off the Comey investigation he was fired in order to prevent or deter the rush investigation for going forward but it's not just the legal analysis which led to me filing articles of impeachment last year it's also the political situation you can't remove a president without a two-thirds vote it has to be bipartisan the evidence on Richard Nixon was there at a much earlier stage but it took a while before Congress would go forward and I think it would take a report by Muller that surprises us that goes beyond what we know in order to convince Republicans because shifts argument is that the politics of this is not helpful that essentially you're playing into president Trump's hands politically and he will rally his base because they're afraid of impeachment I filed articles of impeachment about a year ago and I didn't do it for political reasons you know I couldn't predict what political effect it would have and the fact is the country is going to be talking about impeachment because we have a president who's obstructed justice but that isn't our main message our main message is here's how I'm going to improve the economy here's how we have a better system for raising wages and providing health care and of course we have a primary election on Tuesday you're on the ballot and a lot of competitive races in Orange County oh yes and we have this top two system that could prevent Democrats from even having a candidate on the ballot and a couple close races in Orange County that's why we've united behind Gil Cisneros we were you night in behind a Harvey Ruda because those are the candidates they can at least get first or second and have a chance to be on the ballot in November although a lot of the other Democrats running would dispute that but it's interesting to see what's going to happen there thank you so much coming in so much going on and we appreciate your perspective thank you for sharing your views there on Good Day LA thank you

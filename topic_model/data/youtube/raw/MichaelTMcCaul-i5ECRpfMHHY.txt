very much we are nine days away from the start of the winter olympics in sochi and security concerns remain high in fact the national hockey league has threatened to keep players home if there are any security breaches central texas congressman and homeland security chairman michael mccall just returned from sochi today i asked him about his concerns when it comes to security so how does the threat at this olympics compare to other olympics you've seen in my lifetime this is probably the in terms of security threats the greatest that i've seen and i also remember uh i guess i'm old enough to remember the 72 munich olympics where the israeli team was taken hostage but those olympics we didn't have threats prior to the olympics that we're seeing at these olympics i think that's what distinguishes uh this olympics from any of the others is a threat to information that we have coming in and quite frankly just the bold declarations that they are going to increase bombings and that in the words of the leader of the caucuses that bin laden if you will we will consume the olympics uh i certainly hope that doesn't happen if we don't send our olympic teams then the terrorists have won and i think that's what they want us to do so i would not want to give them a victory by not showing up to these games and

the next tier we have to come to give to that we have to get the opinion of this committee Thank You jimin's time has expired - mr. Pascrell just a reminder after your questioning we'll go to two to one so we can balance out the rest of the hearing I'm sorry after you were listening I knew to two to one so we can balance this out mr. Pascrell you recognized Thank You mr. chairman Thank You mr. ambassador I think it's clear after a Montreal and Mexico City and thank you for your indulgences up there that we're getting we're approaching I think a common a culminating part of the negotiations that's my judgment we have a lot of tough issues to address some of and I quickly went through the document that we're supposed to be talking about today part of it is not that some of your nafta proposals have really challenged the status quo of US trade policy and I think have been creative in trying to make the agreement work for the many and not just a few all the boats have to rise and I have that confidence still that you are working to ensure the labor chapter of NAFTA is fully enforceable building on the strength of the may tenth agreement as a floor and not a ceiling and I want you to erupt me if I say something that is not in place please feel free to do that enforceable labor stand is alone will not entirely solve the key driver of outsourcing under NAFTA we all know that for 25 years Mexico has engaged in a purposeful strategy of labor and wage suppression in order to attract invent at the expense of the US and the expense of Canadian workers and in ways that have expanded poverty for Mexican families instead the record is clear on us the numbers are clear building a middle-class market for the US exports you identified in the trade agenda report you identified you said this since NAFTA went into effect the gap in Mexican wages and labor productivity with the united states has widened the OECD the organization that we know about for many years reports that the average annual wage of Mexico fell from sixteen thousand eight dollars in 1994 to fifteen thousand three hundred eleven dollars and 2016 unquote I met with the workers in Mexico City just a few weeks ago because reading about it and looking at statistics is very different than hearing anecdotal stories about actual situations that are tangible and no Democrat and no Republican can deny these they are in the auto parts factory many of them and we're making less than a dollar an hour no options to bargain for better treatment both the labor rules in NAFTA and in Mexico mexico's own labor law and practice must be upgraded to make real changes for workers both in Mexico and my districts do you agree that Mexico has failed to live up to its obligations with respect to NAFTA's labor side agreement yes or no yes so please explain how USTR is working to solve the problem of low wages and called protection unions which you've identified yourself not I you in Mexico and I agree with you wholeheartedly how are we working to get this done explain I would say first of all that they're wild wages have been stagnant and that was not our expectation at all when we entered into this agreement if you look at the way it was sold it was clearly sold as wages go up in Mexico they became customers for us we get to sell a lot more stuff and that has not happened I would say from the point of view the Mexicans created a lot of jobs though low income jobs in our opinion but a lot of jobs and a lot of those have been in the auto industry and I would suggest many of those at the expense of US jobs I and that's important isn't it mr. ambassador to understand the relationship between how low wages I'm putting it as simple as possible in Mexico do affect jobs and can I at least finish what I'm saying I'm sorry mr. Pascrell all time has expired but maybe another member can yield to you and if I don't want anyone to yield I'm asking you a question can I finish my coy I'm sorry mr. peso you know what it's done thank you you're well Jen Coons miss Jenkins you're recognized

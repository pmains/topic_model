break yeah and we should point out too I mean there's a lot of technology that goes into producing this show and for those who don't know I mean we're not really operating at our normal capacity here there's a ton of people behind the scenes who are either working from home or working in locations they wouldn't work to bring you this program and all the programs are seen on bloomberg television it's an incredible effort of not only technology but just uh I guess human cooperation collaborate collaboration that's the word yes collaboration impatiens we should thank all them and yeah we're just you know we're just here to talk well we just happen to be the people in front that you see but yes there's a lot of work being done behind the scenes and it'll continue next week as well all right advocacy group common cause has filed complaints with the DOJ and the SEC asking the agencies to probe the stock sales of four senators there is some question as to whether the Senators had access to inside information due to government briefings on the corner virus so we're gonna head over now to our chief Washington correspondent Kevin so really for more Kevin thank you I'm Kevin Cirelli chief Washington correspondent for Bloomberg TV and radio and I'm joined now by Senator Kelly Leffler who is a Republican from Georgia Georgia senator thank you for joining me thank you Kevin I appreciate being on well first let me ask you first when is this economic relief bill going to be passed that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said is going to provide some relief for many Americans who are facing down the prospects potentially of losing their jobs well Kevin that's an important question we've committed to staying through the weekend to get this passed as quickly as possible I'm certainly not leaving until we get it done I've spent roughly the last 10 days on the phone non-stop with hospitals nursing homes Georgians families understanding what their needs are and have work to really make sure that that bill reflects what everyday Americans need in their lives right away senator do you think that hospitals right now as of Friday early evening have are prepared for the coming likely crisis that many of them are going to face do they have enough equipment or the supply chains intact well Kevin I'm certainly looking at that area very closely and I've introduced legislation to create the supply chain visibility that we need for core equipment personal protective equipment swabs other testing materials that we understand could be in short supply we need to have better visibility and transparency around our ability to serve our citizens and I think that legislation will be part of this new bill well you're talking about transparency senator you know this over the last 24 hours you and some of your colleagues have come into there's been questions about stock trades that that you made and I'm wondering right now if you can say a thousand percent that you did not provide any illegal information that would have benefited your stock portfolio in the midst of this crisis absolutely certain I have no involvement with the investment activities conducted by third party advisors I made that decision before coming into the Senate in fact I made that decision in the private sector where I worked in the investment management business and many of your viewers will know that this strict rules under the SEC prohibit things like insider trader trading trading on material nonpublic information these are core tenants I'm the only CFA in this in the Senate I know exactly what is required under the law I held myself to that in the private sector I'm holding myself to that standard and even higher in the Senate so I have no engagement with my activities in terms of investment as well as the fact that these third party advisors have no communications from me at all so did any of your staff communicate with them did anyone in your family communicate with them or no no that's not how we have it set up there's a complete disconnect from from me and my family with the Investment Advisers we have an employee in our personal family office that intermediates between the advisers and there's no that that they would need to talk to us or that I would want to share anything I certainly don't have any information that I would want to share with them at any time in order to comply with all the applicable SEC rules the Senate Ethics rules and this is how I conduct my affairs it's how I've always conducted of my affairs and we'll going forward as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or anyone from the Senate Ethics probes had they called your office that they contacted other senators who are facing these questions I can't speak for other senators certainly but I'll tell you a hundred percent if anyone reaches out I will be completely responsive I believe in transparency I think the stock Act and the Senate is important it has provided this transparency I make any trades or transactions or my my third-party intermediaries do knowing full well that these trades are going to be reported it's important transparency that I think you know will be easy to provide the details should we have any questions and I'm happy to comply do you think did you do you understand though the concern I hear what you're saying that you're saying that you're that you did nothing wrong but do you understand the concern and the optics at least of how this looks not just on behalf of your self senator but the other senators who have been mentioned in this especially at a time in which Americans are truthfully wondering if they're gonna have enough to pay their bills over the next two weeks well certainly I understand why these rules exist I have been part of enforcing these rules and actually bringing additional rules in the private sector to promote compliance and prevent insider dealing and so the important thing to me is that everything be made transparent and I can't speak for other senators but I certainly appreciate why these rules are in place and the importance of complying and that's why I've over complied in Congress I would say that very few people could have a problem with saying that I'm I've turned all of my ferry's all over to third-party advisors and I'm not conducting any of that myself so I've given up the ability to transact freely in my in my financial life and Senator just one final question do you have any regrets over how you conducted your financial dealings over the past several months as it relates to this not at all in fact I've made extra careful precautions to not just comply with the letter of the law but the spirit of the law and I'll continue to do that and I'm gonna continue to do everything with the spirit of transparency and the law as I've always done throughout my career all right senator thank you for your time and best of luck in Georgia as well as all across the nation in dealing this weekend with this global pandemic thank you senator back to you in New York all right thank you so much that was our Kevin surly our chief Washington correspondent speaking with Senator Kelly Lafleur republican of georgia

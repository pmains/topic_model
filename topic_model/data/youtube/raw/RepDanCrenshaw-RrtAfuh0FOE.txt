we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody um today we're going to talk about uh why you should maybe be a little bit more optimistic a little bit happier and i think that would be a good thing i think one of the problems uh facing our society is a lack of gratitude this this sort of overwhelming feeling that everything is worse than it's ever been before and that's a problem that's a deep psychological problem and maybe we'll hit that today um but what we're really going to talk about is the objectivity of of that assertion and whether it's really true or not at least in the aggregate um i don't want to take away from anybody's personal hardship but in the aggregate and this and as surely as it informs policy making it helps us to have some context and some facts about what is true and what isn't when it comes to what is improved and what hasn't and where we really are so we're having a repeat offender on uh marion toopey marion thanks so much for being back on delighted to be with you and so the reason you're back on the show is because you're the editor at humanprogress.org you're a center senior fellow at the center for global liberty and prosperity and the co-author of the simon project uh you specialize in globalization and global well-being and the politics and economics um you specialize in europe and south africa is that you're from south africa right i was born in europe i grew up in south africa in britain and now i'm a very proud american citizen i take the debt on very proudly good and well glad to have you um you uh you've been studying this for a while i just got a recent book out the the 10 global trends that every smart person needs to know and many other trends you will find interesting if you're not smart guess you don't need to know it but um so well i mean part of the reason a part of the reason behind the title is that a lot of smart people who should know better are actually confused about the state of the world now you can understand that people who have nothing better to do and you know who who work hard you know don't necessarily follow the latest trends in the reduction of poverty or violence or whatever but people who who are responsible or who should be more responsible and who should be telling the truth about the real state of the world very often don't and so it is intended for smart people but also any other person who wants to do it to read the book well before we get into the the actual statistics behind all the trends and there's a lot um you know poverty uh death rates health care pollution um racism uh you know war like you know all of these uh metrics and we'll get into all of them but but you said you said just said something that was interesting and i kind of just want to hit on that which is the people who should be telling the truth about where we're at in the world don't now that's interesting and the question is why what is their motivation to not tell the truth about what the world really is well i i don't think well a lot of people are what i would call midwits which is to say that they are pretending to know much more about you know the state of the world much more about the literature out there than they really do i don't think that people in general go out there and uh lie um you know intentionally i just think that a lot of people simply are not aware of the later statistics very often people perception of the world is about 20 years off but also there are a lot of a lot of negativity biases in human brain where even people who should know better will focus on the negative simply because our brains are structured in such a way that we are much more pessimistic than we ought to be um maybe we have discussed this the last time but it's worth uh repeating the the idea of availability heuristic where basically um we will we will we will pull from the memory file in our brains those memories which are very tragic or very traumatic so for example like an airplane flying into a building um and uh and that gives us a sense that you know it it is that things like that happen much more frequently than they really do whereas in fact your likelihood of dying due to terrorist causes in the united states is much lower than say for example sleeping on a wet bathroom floor and killing yourself that way but because nobody has ever seen a person killing themselves by sleeping on a bathroom floor we don't really we don't really pull that memory from that memory file terrorism is terrorism is much more sort of present in our brains than than accidents uh that are much more numerically likely to happen also bad is much more powerful than good we are much more concerned with losses rather than gains good things tend to happen over long periods of time which is to say that you know to build a house or finish a degree in college or reduce global poverty takes decades whereas bad things can happen very quickly like the covet pandemic which sets humanity back so there are a lot of these negative biases in the human brain so it doesn't mean that you need to go out and deceive people just means that you are much more likely to focus on the negative because we are humans and because we have evolved to look at the negative side because um the world was much more inhospitable in the past than it is today yeah it's it's kind of an evolutionary adaptation and that makes a lot of sense i would agree with that as far as it concerns the masses um but i do but i do think and i and i and i do see sometimes um that there is an elite few that knowingly perpetuate these myths i mean somebody has to aggregate the data right so somebody has to actually write the papers and the articles and and spin people into this frenzy and so on yeah carry on sorry well it's just this elite few that has a motivation that is that is that goes beyond negativity bias um they i think they i think they know that they're being dishonest and they know about negativity bias these are well-informed educated people who know how easy it is to as you said manipulate people with the bad um over the good it's just more powerful and um in in order to and i think there's a and taking it a step further i think that there's a there's a bias towards crisis there's a bias towards crisis because crisis demands action and action is everything in order to take action you get power and so really it's a power grab i i think by by a select few and i think it i think it's you know if i look especially how the left thinks um they always have an interest in making you believe that things are worse than they are that people are starving the people are dying that everything's in a disaster and the only way to solve it is if you give them more power to fix it and take the extreme actions that they that they want and that they uh they put inside their agenda well i'm sure that there are some bad apples out there i wouldn't want to deny that one of my pet peeves is when people are talking about the massively shrinking middle class in the united states that is you know i i have a few friends who keep making this point all the time and i show them the statistic and say you know the reason why the middle class is shrinking in the united states is because the upper class is expanding you know you always have to add up to 100 percent but that makes them mad you know i mean that's what's so it's a crazy thing they're like exactly and you're like wait what and and some people and some people will repeat that and those people simply i i don't know i mean they cannot be helped and that shouldn't be happening people you know shouldn't be shouldn't be saying that um but um yeah is what it is yeah again it's it's biased towards everything is a disaster and that's why you need that's why we need us the the kind-hearted people who actually care you know it's it's a disaster um so i'll just i'll read a couple um a couple quick myths debunked or or just statistics that are that are pretty incredible extreme poverty is declined from 44 to 10 between 1981 and 2015. infant mortality has declined from 43 to just four percent the same time period um so we're looking at the last 40 years basically just to round it out life expectancy has risen from 40 to 70. human population growth rate has crashed we're having fewer children although i some would argue that's that's not necessarily a good thing at least for some countries um deaths from natural disasters have declined over 90 percent this is an important one when it comes to conversations about climate change and increased intensity in hurricanes we produce 25 percent more food than we need or largest surpluses in history there's no scientific scenario for either of these trends to reverse themselves um deaths from natural disasters are at their lowest point in 120 years just 2 900 people died from natural disasters in the first half of 2020 far lower than the average figures for the last decade um so i mean there's there's like there's at least what 10 um yeah 10 major ones that you want to go over what's um as you did all this research or any which one of these was the most surprising was it had to do with poverty the environment social issues um was there is any point in your research where were you yourself even surprised um greening of the planet is something that was really surprising i mean you know we could talk about all sorts of things which are incredibly important such as the increasing life expectancy um and uh more food on the table around the world including in the poorest countries in the world but i think that the greening of the planet was very interesting um i i think the stats go from 1986 to 2012 or so and um you know an international team of scientists found that the world has greened by uh 13 um and the reason for that of course is that uh co2 is plant food and the more co2 in the atmosphere you have uh the the you know the the more foliage and the more trees grow and so forth and so that was one of the one of the very optimistic things that we have found that i wasn't aware of just to give you an example what about what what are the what else on the environment um let's stick let's stick to that um let's stick to that one this is one where people people think our world is about to burn up like a match yeah i mean uh that is actually quite astonishing if i may digress a little bit because uh it seems that there is a certain section of the population here in the united states but also throughout the rich world which sees the covet as an affirmation of their view that we are in a climate crisis whereas the two are as far as i can tell completely unconnected i mean covet is uh coveted is an outbreak of a pathogen those things have been going on since the dawn of humanity um and and yet it seems like uh moving into the new administration uh we are talking you know it seems like the environment is going to be their number one priority which which seems crazy they keep talking about it as a crisis um although you know there is going to be a mild to climatic change for for many decades to come um and and so i'm not on board with the with the whole world is world is blowing up as a result of climate change and i think that we have time and i think that we should address it by uh by technological change and innovation and this is where some of the trends in the book come into it so for example the world has much more natural gas reserves uh than than than we were aware of and natural gas is falling in price and that's a good news uh because if you can switch from burning of coal and oil to natural gas you're going to basically slash your co2 emissions in half natural gas is much better for the environment than burning of coal um and and you know moving forward i hope that people will change their minds about nuclear power because here you have a steady stream of power that doesn't emit any co2 into the atmosphere so that's a pretty cool concept you know it's a technology we've had for 70 years and it's a tragedy we're not making greater use of it but if we cannot help it and if people keep on being very negative about nuclear power then the next step would be fusion reactors and uh maybe instead of subsidizing solar panels and windmills we should be putting more effort and money into creating fusion reactors which will provide humanity with plentiful energy without any negative environmental externalities other things on the environment that we found was a massive increase in aquaculture which is a cool thing if you don't want to kill a lot of wild fish why not simply grow them um you know so here's a revolutionary concept yeah and and because that's a problem because not everything's rosy like overfishing um uh stresses me out a little bit right yeah so overshare fishing tends to happen in global commons in other words where nation states don't have control over um fishing areas those tend to get overfished when you know when they're when property rights are not properly established or they're being challenged in some way and so um yes overfishing is a problem because it's it's free for all and so the way around it what you want to do is to is to increase aquaculture aquaculture is not being done in the primitive sort of way that it was done you know 50 60 or 70 years ago where the fish were raised in pools and fed lots of antibiotics and so forth now we just put a big um you know now now we erase them in the actual ocean uh itself uh we can produce a lot of shrimp a lot of lot of uh um a lot of salmon and even uh even caviar now so that's pretty cool too um and so and so yes there's a lot of positive news on on that score as well yeah and that's extremely necessary especially in the pacific um it's the chinese are guilty of this more than anybody i mean they they will they will go across the ocean to get into other people other countries um economic exclusion zones and over fish there it's a big problem um and they're very militant about it um we were talking about the greening of the earth so i got some statistics from from your book here tree can it be in the u.s alone is increased by 34 percent that that's a huge amount just in the last 40 years yeah um globally land areas the size of alaska and mount and montana combined that that's basically the uh the increase in tree canopy around the world i remember growing up uh in the 90s and uh the big thing was the rain forest the rain forest was burning down every like everything we did in class was about that um and uh i mean not to say that it's not a problem we we want to protect the rainforest um but it kind of turned out that i don't know either we succeeded or because that just sort of fell off the radar um after yeah i mean that's not the only one i mean we are pretty much the same age i remember a lot of talk about about sahara expanding and it's going to consume the entire african continent we had a lot of talk about acid rain uh you know we had you know about the destruction of uh all the all the bees in the air there was the sex change fish um there was uh there were all sorts of things which didn't come true they sort of fell by the wayside um of the last few decades basically all of these scares have not taken place and you know instead of focusing on something like the acid rain or whatever maybe we should be focusing on pathogens and be ready for covet uh then you know but um but either way now of course all of these environmental concerns have been combined into this mega concept which is climate change and uh whether it rains or whether it's dry whether it snows or whether it's sunshine you know everybody sees climate change behind everything and it's unfalsifiable like no matter what is happening they're right right it's an unfalsifiable claim which which is a good indication that it's a wrongful claim well i don't think it's yeah i agree with you that that some of the claims out there almost appear like a like a religious dogma that can that cannot be falsified um i sort of assume that you know climate has always changed and always will be and maybe it will not change in the ways that humans will would like but the way to address it is uh well basically there's two schools of thought on that the school of thought that i subscribe to is that we are going to adapt you know if the dutch could build a little one-third of holland is underwater basically under the water level if the dutch could dry out uh holland uh 500 years ago surely we can do so today you know prepare for rising sea levels uh when you know in holland three 400 500 years ago was a much poorer place than even the poorest countries in the world today so we should be able to do what the dutch did three or four hundred years ago about rising sea levels so um adaptation is one thing and uh and of course technological technological improvement i would love to see the world powered by fusion reactors or nuclear power so that we don't have to spew more co2 into the atmosphere but anyway so that's one school of thought the other school of thought is that we are basically going to do two things we are going to restrain the growth of human population and two uh we are going to restrain growth of human consumption and i don't think that those two are realistic i don't think that we want to restrain the growth of human population by say the chinese means or whatever um first of all it's not a problem because uh total fertility rate is already collapsing around the world and we are going to the world's population is going to peak in 2060s 2070s and and by the end of this century we are going to have fewer people than its peak you know it's going to stabilize probably around 9 billion people by 2100 so overpopulation is not really a problem and secondly i don't think that um i don't think that you are going to win any election or remain in power uh as a politician if you are going to say to people they should voluntarily basically revert back into the stone age not use electricity not fly into exotic destinations not eat interesting food just because um because it may be damaging to the environment so i i don't think that future of humanity should be based on us denying ourselves the benefits of civilization and and modern life and if if third world countries or developing countries are anything to go by um it seems to me that the greatest thing that the chinese people and the indian people and the bangladeshi people are aspiring to would be to have the sorts of lives that we do and it would be deeply moral to prevent them from doing that and and along those same lines the more developed the country is the more likely it is that it cleans up the environment better again in the last 40 years um so in the years exactly right in the u.s carbon monoxide fell by 73 led by 99 nitrogen oxides by 62 compounds from car exhaust by 55 so even though we're massively increasing our productivity and population all of these things go down we grew our population by 60 percent in that time period total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 74 percent so you know these are important things these are very simple facts but they're important especially for policymakers because right now um you know right now we're looking at an incoming administration the biden administration that will no doubt um re uh reimpose many of the overly strict uh epa regulations from the obama era and probably go beyond that simply because the democratic party has has just moved beyond the the and gotten more progressive than obama ever was so and then the question is why and that should always be our question right like they it's such a simple-minded proposition that if if if one environmental regulation is good then 10 must be better that's like no that's just not how anything works right there's trade-offs and at a certain point at a certain point you've gotten to about the right balance um that that has to be true objectively there has to be sort of a a balancing point where if you go beyond it it's just too costly without the benefits and if you're if you're and if you're not reaching it yet then you're allowing too much pollution i think in america we've been at that balance point for a fairly long time maybe a lot of us would argue frankly we've been beyond it we do some very very silly things on the regulatory side when it comes to protecting the environment like very silly things um so let's say you know again why what what are these people thinking like do they not know these do they not know these facts do they not care what what is going on well this is a subject for a huge discussion let me first reaffirm what you said about wealth and environment no matter which global global rankings you look at the countries with the best environment are invariably the richest countries that's because people who have money can afford to pay for uh clean air clean water and so on they take care of their animals of their wildlife poor people when they have nothing uh to to eat will slaughter that giraffe or um or whatever uh the even animals in the zoo as we've seen in caracas in in venezuela after after their socialist experiment went bad um so you want to become rich rich people are best stewards of the environment that's just that's just a fact it's called the environmental kuznets curve people can look it up um what is happening well one possibility that we should consider is that for a lot of highly educated and rich people environmentalism has replaced traditional forms of religion that in many ways we are sort of returning to the uh pagan times when people worship nature um you know two and a half three thousand years ago and that really environmentalism has become a source of new religion now why would that be i i'm talking about people like aoc i'm not talking about mainstream environmentalists i consider myself environmentalists i'm sure that you consider yourself an environmental yeah in that sense that you want you don't want nature to be to be destroyed after all i told you i'm stressed out about overfishing i mean part of human happiness is to be surrounded by beautiful things and and and beautiful nature and i in that sense i'm i'm i'm very uh environmentally conscious um but for the for the for the nut jobs out there uh i think that the environmental uh striving provides them with a meaning uh and a purpose in life and an immortality project which cannot be supplied by uh traditional religions so people get a meaning in life and their immortality project can can be consisted of all sorts of things um having a profession that you enjoy and that you want to excel at maybe having a family and raising the best children that you possibly can um maybe it is uh maybe it is your um your church and so forth um but but in all of those activities we are in a sense involved in immortality projects we are creating a heroic version of ourselves we want to accomplish something we want to become part of something larger environmentalist activism environmentalist activism i think does provide certain type of people with that kind of with that kind of focus that kind of mission in life michael schallenberger has a book out apocalypse never which goes into details about how environmentalism has replaced traditional forms of religion so that's one thing the other thing is that environmentalism is proving to be an excellent way to shut down political debates and to uh restrict uh freedom of speech you know this whole business about not providing denialists a platform and and things like that um especially when it comes to people like you and i who don't deny climate change but who are fundamentally opposed to some of the socialist ways of quote unquote fixing the world fixing the environmental problems if people like us can be prevented from speaking if we can be banned as denialists then it makes life much more difficult for all the socialists out there whose ideas about solving solving the environment are fundamentally about restriction of economic freedom and extrication restriction of human liberty yeah yeah and i question their motivations um that's that's the bottom line uh you know i i think there's a deep need for more power and the quickest way to get more power is to make people believe they're in crisis which is why why your book is so important i mean perspective is an important thing right the way you frame reality is important and you gain perspective by by contextualizing facts and so that that's really what we're doing all right let's move off of the environment i kind of it's an interesting it's a big topic for me so i end up spending too much time on it every every single time um so let's talk about a a less controversial one which is racism yeah yeah that was a joke obviously extremely controversial right now and um and uh it's it's if you listen to the media if you listen to the movements going on you would think that america is more racist than it's ever been and um this is objectively not true i think we all sense that it's not true too so i think intuitively we know this is not true but objectively by whatever measures we can look at uh it's just not true i in in um in your book you cite some statistics uh that are that are really shocking actually so in 1958 only four percent of whites were in favor of intermarriage between blacks and whites that's that's shocking um at least two to me in the year 2020 uh you know where or it's it's just shocking let's just say that 2002 90 of whites opposed laws against intermarriage so which obviously implies that and that's just opposing laws against intermarriage um you know and that's in if you looked at 2020 um i don't have a statistic for that but it would seem that um whites are probably overwhelmingly um supportive of intermarriage so it's a it's an indicator of um of of how far we've come as far as these things go what other indicators do you look at and what do you think the truth is behind many of the narratives that we're seeing today um the the the problem with progress is it is self-masking whenever you accomplish a good thing we'll talk about race in a second but let me just outline the the concept i'm trying to put across whenever you accomplish something good that becomes your new baseline and whatever problems remain become all the more visible because the the low-hanging fruit has already been picked the the big things have been taken care of okay so let's look at the history of race relations in this country i mean obviously um we had slavery now that got solved during the civil war uh then there was uh jim crow and basically separate development and uh different laws for blacks and whites and lynchings lynchings seem to be seem to fundamentally decline after the 1920s but it only takes but it really takes until 1960s that the last remnants of separate uh you know legislation and really the american version of apartheid is gone and uh what you have is illegal quality of blacks and whites before the law and so and so um over to racism then the problem becomes over racism people making crude jokes uh calling people black people n-word things like that and then that disappears over racism disappears and so what you are left with is covered racism or uh or what people think they they think is covert racism and microaggression so that's where we are now uh in in an in an era where um where things that we used to think of as discrimination and racism have been solved and what you are left with is microaggressions and things like that and um and and and that is a perfect example of progress masking itself is that there can actually be people out there in the united states today who say nothing has changed things are as bad as ever well that's obviously not true but it is a perfect example of this progress masking itself yeah yeah i like the way you put that progress masking itself i mean the other thing they point to um in today's age is uh disparities now now there's a logical fallacy there which is which is that they tie those disparities to over racist discrimination and that's a pretty loose connection um especially when you actually start to break apart the data but those disparities still exist um they're they're undeniable uh but the proper question analytical question is why because if you want to solve something you have to understand it so which kind of gets to um some of the other things that you that you put out in in in the book about um poverty decline um which is globally is is you see an enormous decline in poverty but uh again our or the the critics of of modern times point out things like uh growing inequality uh growing wealth at the top i mean so how do you respond to to these things i mean what's what's the right balance to and to contextualize all this yeah i mean uh not to talk about myself too much but i am i'm a classical liberal i'm basically a person who believes that in in equality before the law and equality of opportunity that you should be able to live your life to your fullest potential and whatever god-given gifts you have you should be able to put into practice without prohibitions or restrictions by your fellow men that's essentially my definition of liberty and definition of equality i should perhaps say but that's not but but other people have different um different definitions of equality and what i'm seeing with tremendous concern almost almost um almost fright is that increasing number of americans especially educated americans are leaving universities thinking that equality of outcome is what should we should be striving for now i grew up in a country which which was based on an economic system of equality of outcome that was communism and what we had to show for it in 1989 1990 was a mountain of dead bodies 100 million people who got killed during the 20th century throughout the world in an effort to accomplish equality of outcome a society where everybody had the equal amount of wealth nobody was in a higher uh you know there was no hierarchy of classes and things like that i i think that um this this notion of equality of outcome has been tried it has led to tremendous catastrophe throughout the world and we should be very careful that because we are playing with fire here when you have ethnic religious racial groups at each other's throats saying you have 42 of this whereas we have only 12 of that that can lead to a lot of violence that can lead to a destruction of a country now of course in those cases where inequality is an outcome of of uh discrimination uh then the society needs to address that this is where my insistence on on equality of opportunity comes into it but again we have to be very careful of describing every single difference in socioeconomic outcomes to discrimination uh because you really have to um you have to delve into the subject much more than to simply say just because you are black or white your station in life is this and that yeah yeah i mean it's it's in again connecting disparities with discrimination i i think is is the ultimate um logical fallacy that that is making people angry right it makes people feel like they're oppressed it makes people feel um like they're being attacked it makes people feel hopeless and um and again the more suspicious side of me thinks that's kind of the goal of some of these um elites is to make people feel that way because they're easier to control if they feel if if you tell them i'm the only one who can help you that's why you should vote for me uh because you are oppressed and they're trying to get you and uh the only way you'll ever get out of this is not by your own power you can't because the system is so rigged against you yeah so i wonder how far the far left can take this within the context of american democracy because um because obviously different groups have a different sense of historical guilt uh very different sense of their own accomplishment for example it's very difficult to see a lot of asians or a lot of jews being um feeling aggrieved about their state uh in in the united states and if you're going to pit um people against each other um it seems to me that i i don't know to what extent you can hold the coalition of um let's say that you're on the far left all the all the non-whites together and then all the whites together if you are on the far left on the far right in other words what i'm trying to say is that as the recent election has shown it it doesn't seem to be working out for the far left the way they thought it would work out which is that all the brown and black people were were on the same uh we're on the same page do you see what i mean yeah yeah yeah i think that's right i think they hit a wall and it's actually started to reverse um as long as as long as the conservatives are willing to uh have the conversation and um and i think we need to uh you know we've been afraid to for so long it's such a taboo subject can we even talk about this stuff well uh yes we can and we have to and uh when we do uh we actually gain some support uh because i think people intuitively understand that it's true it does it definitely makes some people extra mad and i think for too long the right just tried to pacify everybody but we just lost as a result right we didn't we didn't persuade anybody uh nobody knew where we stood and so the left was able to build a narrative about what the right thought but no it's time for the right to stand up for classical liberal principles and colorblind principles i i think it's it's extremely important i mean even if you take it let's just take it away for a second from black versus white and and and consider for a second the other part of the left wing the other left-wing obsession which is men versus women i mean on paper i i you know it seems attractive to a certain type of person on the other hand all the women out there have fathers and many of them have husbands and and sons and that sort of thing and it's very difficult to investigate a society where uh a a woman's loyalty will always be to the struggle against the uh patriarchy um as as opposed to being also open and accommodating to to the men in their own lives uh and vice versa and vice versa i mean you know we are all surrounded by by women with that they our mothers or or or or sisters and so forth so the notion that that people take a lot of pleasure in keeping women down um seems to me also completely out of whack with reality i i don't know who those men are but i certainly haven't met any yeah i think that's true the last thing um i want to hit on is which actually surprised me was uh the myth that people are getting more unhappy see i wouldn't have thought that's a myth i would have said yes people are definitely more unhappy um and but also not just intuitively i mean if if you're in my line of work you would definitely think that people are way unhappier than they've ever been because i'm in politics and people are just unhappy um and i and i'm constantly scouring social media to understand the general trends and boy it seems like people are very unhappy um so that's why it surprised me but but also um you know i would challenge the statistics on this i as far as i understood it young people especially especially young women are much more prone to suicide these days than they were in the past much more prone to mental illnesses and anxiety so okay so what's the truth here um is this just a global aggregate statistic that you're pointing to here because here in america i'm just i'm not i want to challenge this i'm not so sure it's true remind me which trend is it uh do you have it in front of you oh it's um just just the general notion that people around the world are generally becoming happier yeah ascending levels of subjective well-being correlate strongly with rising per capita income etc yeah i'm i'm i'm uh so um i'm pretty sure that it's an aggregate level globally um in the last 20 years especially people have been spending a lot of time uh looking into happiness and there are certain things which which came out as a surprise one is that actually contrary to widespread belief there is a link between wealth and happiness in a sense that people who are becoming richer when they see their incomes rise they tend to also become happier and this holds not just in poor countries but it actually holds in rich countries as well so that's the that's the latest research on on happiness and income the other thing is that people always um think individual human beings always think that the world around them is much less happy than than they themselves are i think the gap is about 30 percent so if you think that your happiness on a scale from one to ten is uh six you think that the people around you are happy only at four that sort of things you always think that people are much more miserable miserable than than we are uh so that's another thing to keep in mind and then of course last last thing i want to say on this subject is that everything depends on which countries you look at and your timeline there has been an undeniable increase in uh in contemplations of suicide and also in suicide again amongst american women partly as a result of the social media but again you have to look at the aggregate and over long periods of time you know progress is not about everything getting better for everyone everywhere at all times there will always be uh places in time and place where where some people are going to fall through the cracks and are going to have a very tough time but you have to look at the overall trends if you want to get a sense of the world as a whole yeah and what you said there about um happiness and how you see your own happiness versus other people's um that that also bears out in other statistics where we look at the entire country americans because this is interest interesting i'm trying to find the exact statistic but basically it goes like this um americans tend to think that they're that the country that everybody else is worse off when you ask them this question in a survey but you ask them how they are and they're like well i'm doing great but like you know it's so so there's there's such a clear disconnect there and um and so and so on on the happiness hypothesis here um i think i think both things can be true and the aggregate the the world has gotten happier um but there is a problem with especially our college students um who lack perspective who maybe didn't come from poverty and into some great new opportunity but maybe you always had opportunities that are constantly reading articles about how the world is going to burn up and are constantly reading about inequality and we're constantly reading all of these sort of crisis narratives that that other country is more racist that people are being hunted down in the streets and all of these things and they're deeply unhappy as a result of it and so it's it's it's narrative building and um and it's sad you know it's it's uh again it's why it's why your work is important it gives people that perspective right it gives people a a counter argument to the crisis narratives that they're being fed constantly um one thing to consider and i think schumpeter made this point about 70 years ago is that capitalism in some ways the seeds of its own destruction in a sense that it creates so much wealth that western rich societies can maintain large chunks of the population devoted to doing nothing else but criticizing and destroying the society itself and that that's basically the social sciences and humanities in the united states today these are professors who for whatever reason believe that they are being underappreciated underpaid that they should have a much greater say in the way that the society should look these are people who generally believe that they should be in charge that you shouldn't have a society that is based on a sort of spontaneous order but that things should be ordered in accordance with the latest formulations of a uh of a social science major and these people are basically dominating the intellectual sphere the cultural sphere they're dominating our education and they are the ones who are filling young people's brains with poison and but that is an unintended feature of the extraordinary wealth that america is able to produce that this class of people can not just exist but can actually flourish and expand um because we are willing to pay for it yeah again it's lack of perspective you know the richest man in the world rock of you know maybe it's rockefeller um at some point in time if he had a migraine he couldn't get medicine for it you know like it just just think about that for a second he has all the wealth all this power calvin coolidge's son i mean this is something that i would love for every kid in america to read calvin coolidge's son in 1926 or was he 25 was playing tennis on the tennis court at the white house and he was playing it barefooted and he developed a blister which got infected and because they didn't have antibiotics until 1928 he developed blood poisoning and died here is the son of a president who dies from an infected blister because basic medicine that we can take completely for granted simply wasn't invented yet wow i didn't know that yeah it's a horrible story it's a very horrible story calvin coolidge is generally a very underappreciated president um especially for conservatives the last president i was in full agreement with yeah that's a long time ago that's a long time ago and but also a covet i mean i i i want to say also this and that is that you know for thousands of years people have been dying of things they didn't even know what they were polio smallpox all of these things can be traced back to ancient india or pharaonic egypt three and a half thousand years ago and for thousands of years people were dropping dead left and right yeah uh not knowing what was killing them and uh it really um you know these were pathogens that we couldn't identify we couldn't name people thought it was god being angry and god knows what else nowadays we are going to have behaved the vaccine within 12 months of the outbreak of the of the of the wuhan virus i mean this is an extraordinary um extraordinary moment in human history where because of the wealth of western society the knowledge that we have accumulated over millennia supercomputers devoted staff and and private corporations as well as government funding of of the of the vaccines themselves we are able to produce an answer to a pathogen we didn't know existed a year ago yeah and there's no gratitude for it and everybody's everybody's only only people can only talk about the failures i suspect that people are going to start turning on each other just now just about now in the next couple of weeks about who is going to get this thing first and you know and there will be claims made about discrimination or whatever but i think that fundamentally um the most important thing is that people should be tremendously grateful that they are alive today not everything is going well for us undoubtedly but at what other point in history would you want to live and what's your standard you know like what is going well and compared to what you know because that's the true question and that that's what that's what our media and our and our politicians seem seem to refuse to answer because and and again i think because they have dark motivations i i think because they have an interest in making people feel this way because it it um it lends credence to the idea that this other person should be in power um so i really do think it all comes down to power and i've i i didn't say that as much in the earlier times of the pandemic but but as we've refused to learn basic lessons um and uh and and acknowledge uh obvious trade-offs with lockdowns and and everything um i i've come to believe that that that there are underlying motivations behind a lot of these a lot of these comments um and it's and i think it's highly destructive so that's how i feel um but uh you know it's it's it's it perspective again is is so important in these things um we're coming at the end of our time here uh marion anything else to add before we uh conclude well on your last point about uh power hungry pow-grabbing uh politicians public figures and so on um you know i i hear you i don't know if i want to go as far as ascribing certain um motives to to to to certain people but then again you interact with them much more than i do what i would say is this people who are out there saying things which are demonstrably not true and which they have been told are not true and making those comments again and again those in my book are the most reprehensible people if you know better if you have been told that something you are saying is wrong and you go on saying that then you are beneath content yeah well it's like so so so by that by that standard which i would agree with um any any politician that's advocating for closing schools at this point is is is by that's living by that standard below contempt because there is there all the science says that kids should be in school uh when all of the all of the studies on on trade-offs and everything yeah and so the trade-offs the trade-offs are tremendous i mean the the unhappiness amongst young people who are who have been put through this you know easily in my view outweighs uh the the the threat of them uh picking up the disease or dying from it and other examples would be okay once you have the statistics on on okay what is the percentage of um i guess spread from restaurants per se and we can we can we can look at this i uh my friend uh mayor of coronado richard bailey was was on the news and you know local san diego news trying to trying to stop the state from closing down the counties like look we have the statistics right here single digits um percentage-wise is the spread happens in gyms and restaurants and these are the places you want to close down this isn't where the spread is happening you know this we have the facts and yet you're still punishing these small businesses so this is this is beneath contempt i mean this is this is horrible uh what these politicians are doing and again so i have to ascribe some kind of motivation like they're either they're either lying they're malicious or they're stupid none of these are good none of these are things that we should want in our elected officials um is i've just lost complete patience with it over over time because the facts are out right i had a lot more um uh you know patience for it i think in the first couple months of the pandemic so i feel very strongly about these things um well that's good because 2024 is around the corner and uh i hope that's uh as soon as he started talking about that the connection broke down that's funny okay i think we got him back i'm sorry i had absolutely no idea what happened i just heard speaking sound and it was all over i'm sorry can you splice it yeah oh yeah yeah it's fine that was funny i just thought it was hilarious that as soon as you started you're like hey the chinese are listening they uh they canceled us we got cancelled but you can you can cut that out yeah okay oh no no we keep it it's funny um but hey uh marion thank you so much for your work and uh appreciate you being on thank you very much for having me good luck with everything and uh talk to you soon all the best all right bye bye

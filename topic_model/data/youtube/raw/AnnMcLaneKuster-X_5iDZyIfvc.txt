thank you very much bill and I have so grateful to the national committee to preserve Social Security and Medicare for their support and endorsement today as phil mentioned yesterday was Medicare's 47th anniversary I spent the morning down in Nashua and Salem visiting with seniors at the Senior Center there and I spent the afternoon talking about home care I've heard all across New Hampshire over the past few years from folks who have worked hard we have paid into the system all their lives and now rely on Medicare in their retirement these seniors and those gathered with me today aren't looking for a hand out what they're looking for is our leaders who will protect the benefits that they've spent their entire lives earning and paying for people in New Hampshire care deeply about this issue and for good reason we have over 220,000 people in New Hampshire who depend on Medicare to cover the health care that they need from routine hospital visits and prescription drugs to emergencies and hospice service and that's why this debate is so important at the end of the day it's not just about feeding plans or policies but rather is really about the priorities that we face as a country and when it comes to Medicare the choice could not be clearer earlier this year as phil mentioned congressman bass and the House Republicans passed a radical budget then when essentially and the Medicare guarantee it's a budget that would push seniors into the arms of insurance companies and force them to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets and why would Republicans make these deep cuts to Medicare so that they can give massive tax rates to millionaires big oil and companies that ship jobs overseas in place of the traditional Medicare guarantee the Republican plan would provide every senior with a voucher to use in the private health insurance market it sounds simple enough but what Republicans don't like to tell you is that the vouchers quickly will not cover the rising cost of health care meanwhile seniors including those in you will have to pay more out of pocket when they get sick and that's not right every single senior deserves quality health care that's why Democrats and Republicans passed Medicare in the first place and that's why we must keep this solemn promise to our seniors now look there's no question that we need to cut the deficit and reduce our debt and i will go to cut wasteful spending so that we can do that in a balanced responsible way that asks for shared sacrifice for all Americans that's the New Hampshire 1 i've said this before i will support any proposal from any politician of any party that cut spending in a way that protects our priorities a house Republican this recently introduced HR 4631 a bill that would increase accountability in spending on major government conferences I support this common-sense bill and others like it and I urge Congress and bass to do the center but what I don't support our efforts to undermine Medicare and balance the budget on the backs of seniors in the middle class all in order to give tax breaks to millionaires and big oil that they don't need and frankly we cannot afford Republicans have their priorities backward we shouldn't be undermining Medicare to make room for more massive tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans we should be ending those tax rates so that we can protect Medicare for our seniors and the next generation yes we have to work together to bring down the cost of health care and to improve Medicare but we need to do both in a way that doesn't hurt seniors and intent instead of takes the fat out of the system and focuses on prevention and wellness New Hampshire horrors are with awareness and I'm very proud to say that just in the last couple of days more than 2,600 voters have signed a petition we launched calling on Congress to protect Medicare for our seniors now you wouldn't always know it from Washington watching Washington but we can do that we can put the partisan political games inside and find a bipartisan approach to get this done but we can't do that with the commerce that we have we can send the same people with the same ideas and the same approach back to Washington and somehow expect a different outcome we need a new approach in Washington that's focused on common-sense bipartisan solutions that will strengthen the middle class and protect our seniors that's what I'm offering in this race and that which I'll bring to Washington every single day when I'm elected to Congress thank you and with that I have time

and the chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from Oregon mr. bone amici thank you to the chairs and ranking members and thank you to our witnesses for being here today I came to this hearing from a hearing in the Select Committee on the climate crisis I know that the climate crisis is a one of the greatest existential threats of our time and I'm extremely concerned by this administration's attempts to disregard congressional intent when spending or delaying the spending of appropriated dollars on clean energy research development and demonstration which are all part of the going to be part of the solution to addressing this crisis and in fact the department doesn't have a great record in 2017 the GAO found that the department had violated the impoundment Control Act regarding the distribution of arpa-e funds so mr. Simmons are you aware that secretary Perry testified before this committee in June of 2019 I'm I would imagine that I knew that at the time but I have no recollection of that specific hearing well are you aware that during that hearing then secretary Perry committed to distributing the department's appropriated funds for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 in accordance with congressional intent I know that the secretary Perry has always been very clear about distributing funds consistent with congressional intent thank you and has the department distributed appropriated funds for fiscal year 2019 in accordance with congressional intent I believe so do you know well I as in in my office which I can't really speak to other offices because I don't know all the situations we have worked very hard to comply with congressional intent we appreciate that certainly according to testimony from one of our witnesses from the Natural Resources Defense Council on our second panel today which I hope you'll be able to listen to if you haven't already reviewed the testimony the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy entered fiscal year 2020 with 820 million dollars of unobligated funds from previous years so that's equivalent to nearly one third of the offices annual budget do you agree with that figure is that correct its it's close it was it's 35% of our of our budget okay but but either about eight hundred twenty million dollars of uh net obligated funds um yes 835 in your testimony your quick to point to examples of EERE issuing large foa's totaling millions of dollars and you suggest you will release the remainder of your fiscal year twenty twenty foa's in the coming months how can this committee be certain that the department is deliberately allocating these dollars consistent with congressional intent and scientific integrity principles rather than with the president's goals as outlined in his budget request to that I think is just to say look at look at our our track record in terms of unobligated funding our track record you know for FY coming into FY 2020 is consistent with the previous administration's unobligated funding going into FY 2016 in FY 2017 in terms of the the funding opportunity announcements themselves those topics are very much aligned when when the when the program directors come and brief me on upcoming foa's one of the things that is discussed every single time about every single topic is what is the congressional language around this topic you know why are we why are we doing this topic I take very seriously that you know that direction from Congress and want to make sure that we are allocating funding and our funding opportunity announcements are consistent with you know with that direction from Congress I appreciate the response but it seems inconsistent with having 820 million dollars of unobligated funds it could be used for research and development that we so desperately need the from the from the time of from a FOA is is released it takes about nine months till we have the first award of that of that funding opportunity announcement that means that when we get kind of when we get to later in the fiscal year we're going to have some carryover we're gonna have some carryover money into the next fiscal year because it is a it it takes a while to go through that that process to have four applications to come back to have the the merit reviews and then to go through the award process because even after we have selected the winners it then takes time for to negotiate the to negotiate the actual award unfortunately that is longer than then I would longer than I would wish but it does take 9 to 12 months frequently and I do want to just and as I yield back express my concern about the situation where the Department of Energy with Drew and then reissued the with regard to the advanced solar energy technologies and I know there's some some documentation that's likely to be included in the record in this and I yield back the balance of my time well I'd like to

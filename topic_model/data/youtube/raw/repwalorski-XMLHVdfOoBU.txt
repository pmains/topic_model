I want to start by thanking our hard-working mayor's all of our elected officials in in my district that have worked together on task force and our health care workers as well I want to thank our governor governor Eric Holcomb for making Indiana a leader on coronavirus response and transparency the state's five-phase reopening plan is a responsible way to restart our economy while still working to contain the spread and flatten the curve Indiana also pioneered a first of its kind small business PPE workplace we're eligible small businesses could apply for bundles of face masks face shields hand sanitizer free of charge the marketplace is fulfilled more than 20,000 orders so far - just want to give a shout out real quick to a mayor jerk and give us a shout out in the Hoosier State we are in full production because of the defense production act of domestically producing large supplies of PPE I'll also note that Indiana's being open and transparent about how it's using federal funds governor Holcomb recently detailed to the Indiana delegation how the state used its five billion dollars in federal funding on comprehensive testing costs for emergency operation centers PPE for critical workers and businesses long-term care strike teams congregate hongki for critical workers and businesses long-term care strike teams congregate homes and child care providers and a 300 million dollar grant assistance program to our local communities the coronavirus is unlike any in our lifetimes in our country has experienced a devastating loss of life emergency actions like stay at home orders were necessary to slow the spread and flatten the curve but we're also seeing a broader toll on Americans health that we just can't ignore such an advert such as adverse outcomes for women's health and individuals with substance abuse we need to protect women's health by ensuring they can see their ob/gyn receive a mammogram and give birth in a hospital without fear in my district the local domestic abuse crisis line saw a 50 percent jump in calls as well we're seeing drug overdoses back on the rise I commend the Trump administration for enabling telehealth treatment but safely reopening our mental-health facilities is vital to stop the spread of this addiction to opioids and other drugs that continue to plague our communities

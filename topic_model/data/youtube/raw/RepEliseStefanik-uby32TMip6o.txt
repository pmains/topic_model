Thank You mr. chairman I had the honor of hosting secretary Mark Esper at Fort Drum just a few weeks ago and in our discussions with family members but also service members he focused on the need to address things that were eating up our readiness and one of the examples was online training what are some of those other examples of exercises things that we're asking our men and women in uniform to do that are eating up the readiness and the reason I'm asking this because our number one focus is on readiness recovery how can we address that excess whether it's training exercises I'd love your perspective ma'am he's beat me up over that every day every day just on email last night because he's at Fort he's at first camp division right now and he said the commanders are telling them because of the European rotational requirements behavioral health stuff other medical issues about 200 to 300 of our soldiers there probably aren't going to go because of theater requirements so quickly depends on what authoritative documents you're talking about but 350 - one is the army self inflicted training requirements we have just reduced those now down to individual marksmanship pt battle drill collective tasks and took all the other mandatory training and the Secretary's allowing commanders to accept risk - mission risk to force it doesn't mean things like sharp eeo suicide prevention aren't important but by us telling them to do that every year for an hour in the classroom it's not working so he's not a fan of that he's not a fan of online training requirements like trips so every time people want to go on leave or pass think I spent a whole day filling out this questionnaire which takes forever so he's already shut that off last week but then the bigger issue becomes what are other theater required issues like the CENTCOM the individual requirements are three pages long if you're going to deploy the CENTCOM theater so we are working with OSD PNR Mr Wilkie steam the Joint Staff and trying to find out what would make - environmental Geographic issues like diseases and things what would make Africa different than CENTCOM different than Europe for a rollover drills and those kinds of things but how do we get that litany of things down and say hey here's your basic requirements to get an airplane and go and that so it's a holistic look at everything but when I say everything it's about a 73 page document with 900 something tasks that we have uncovered that he's made us do which is we'll go as fast as we can to give commanders more flexibility thank you for noting the importance of programs like sharp by addressing some of the mandatory online training what I thought was particularly helpful hearing from secretary Esper and our men and women in uniform was that this we need to have principles that we practice every single day not just broken down into an hour of taking an online training course my second question is about some of our future challenges when you look at 21st century warfare with the creation of army futures Command and the need to be ready for Wars of tomorrow how do you envision AI artificial intelligence being incorporated into the army modernization priorities that you have already established it fits right in with everything we were talking about earlier about all the multi it's part of our multi domain task force approach from an Intel cyber electronic warfare space perfect perspective but just last week secretary McCarthy directed the g2 assault and myself to go out to Microsoft and go we were going to partner with industry to figure out how to go faster with AI and not slower as we incorporate what artificial intelligence will give our commanders sooner than later so we're doing that I think we're doing Amazon next week and we're doing Microsoft like a week or two later but trying to trying to learn from industry who is so much further ahead of us on that and figure out how to integrate it into our training policies etc great I'm glad to hear that I think that's very important particularly as we look at near peer adversaries in terms of their investment when it comes to AI and they've really integrated it into their militaries but also how they're approaching readiness in the 21st century and making sure that we have the capabilities we need thank you with that I yield back

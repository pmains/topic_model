and thanks to all of you who are joining us uh tonight for this really important community conversation um i'm so glad to be here tonight with my representative to the texas house representative ann johnson and with our neighbor and world-renowned immunologist dr peter hotez um i'll say just a few things before i turn it over to rep johnson and then to dr hotez and then to you all for questions because that is why we are here but it is amazing to me to think that it was nearly a year and a half ago almost the day that i met dr hotez because he was testifying in the us house of representatives to our science space and technology committee about novel viruses and diseases and how we as a country should and could support ongoing research efforts to have vaccines in the pipeline to make sure that we were leading in preparedness and we were beginning to talk about the coronavirus but you know while he's been a leading voice in this field for many years um he's been a real leader for our country ever since that day over the last 18 months as we have faced this pandemic together and i was so thrilled that he's been able to join us for telephone town hall for our congressional district uh many months ago now um and i'm just so grateful that he's here with us again today to talk about where we are in this pandemic to talk about the delta variant that i know is very much on everybody's minds as well as the recent cdc guidance um and the situation that we face here in our city um in our state and across the country and how we move forward together um and so i'm i'm most grateful to him for making himself available to you all in this forum and i really want to leave the majority of our time today for your questions but i do want to remind you that congress has been focused for the last 18 months on this pandemic has been taking every opportunity we can to be helpful with all kinds of relief that you all have heard me talk about before and i won't go through all of it now but what i will just remind you is that i as i always tell you i am so proud to represent you and i'm here to help you so if you have any challenges any concerns any questions after this discussion please remember to reach out to me and my team in our office um because we know that this is this is a health crisis that has created many other crises and of course we're talking about that the challenge uh in terms of unemployment in terms of housing getting people back to work making sure that people are housed making sure that our country and our communities are coming together safely and reopening safely um and and there's just so much in front of us as the landscape is changing um and so it's a really wonderful opportunity to get together with these incredible leaders in our community um and i'm i'm grateful to all of you for being here and i'm delighted to to convene this group and to be here to to answer your questions so with that i want to turn it over to representative johnson uh for a few remarks and then to dr hotez thank you so much rep johnson for being here thank you so much congresswoman fletcher it's an honor to be with you and dr hotez i am proud to be your state representative for texas house district 134 which includes our medical center and so i have gotten a chance over this past year to work with the both of these individuals regarding covet and what we've been trying to do locally with pushing out the vaccine with making sure that we are following the rules of socially distance and wearing a mask and we are seeing here this example of tackling these issues required not only local effort national effort and state effort i do want to thank congresswoman fletcher because she has been key in this fight for what we've been trying to do in austin as many of you know we have had this conversation around the fact that we have the highest rate of uninsured in the nation for children we have millions without health care coverage and so having health care coverage has always been a priority and a discussion that we need to advance and congresswoman fletcher has worked in congress to ensure that we would get even greater support if we would do medicaid expansion i was proud to be part of a group to offer legislation on that and i am disappointed that we continue out of austin to fail to get health care expansion done that would cover texans i am more disappointed today that again we are seeing governor abbott who is overreaching his authority and taking a stand on what i believe is the wrong side of health care and stating to people that they don't need to wear a mask and even more so ironically declaring a disaster declaration around coven to grant himself more powers to then turn around and try to tell local communities that they cannot implement things like vaccine requirements or mask mandates and so i am here in washington dc at the moment advocating on behalf of your voting rights i've always believed that there are certain things that should overcome partisanship and health care has got to be the priority while i am here in dc i have been calling many of you in the district and i will tell you the number one thing that is on your mind is what are we doing about coven about moving into this fourth wave and what are you going to do to take care of children i am proud to be a group that has sent a letter to governor abbott asking him to not tell schools that schools can't implement their own local rules for your children's safety i hope that schools will take the strength and the courage to ensure that health care is their number one guiding factor i want to thank local communities like dallas williamson county and even mayor turner who have recognized that abbott's steps are not constitutional it's too much and it is risky and dangerous and that the safety of employees of court staff of everybody has got to be the guiding factor i want to thank dr hotez because he has been at every point the one sounding the alarm i was proud that we could participate with local medical communities to say mass golf parties were not the right thing to do and we will continue to advocate for those common sense solutions that will keep people safe but i worry that this is a different moment this is a perfect storm of going into a fourth wave with a virus that is impacting children and significant disinformation and misinformation that's being put out there so it is my honor to have dr hotez to be able to tell us our constituents just what it is what we can do to protect ourselves and our children and so dr hotez it is an honor to have you on grateful to have from the right source the right information to protect all of us well thanks so much for that very generous introduction and it certainly is an honor to be with both of you both with uh the the congresswoman lizzie fletcher we've worked together now for a while and it's been i love i've loved every minute of of it and because because she gets it very quickly and she and really works hard to understand medicine and science and and that's unfortunately becoming increasingly rare these days and and with representative johnson it's it's been also a terrific honor and and um i've been really i've been saying i would look forward to working with you now i've been working with you and it's been it's been fabulous and and i appreciate the opportunity i was kind of hoping we wouldn't have to do these anymore and and not because i didn't want to see you i mean but i would have liked to seen you at um maybe having a margarita hugo's but not but not not under these circumstances where the virus is accelerating yet again and i honestly and i think at the last time we did something like this i think i said we can we don't have to have this happen anymore um at that time there was a greater sense of optimism because we were accelerating our ability to vaccinate the nation and you know back in may things look like we're around we were on a roll the deaths were going down and we were rapidly progressing in terms of vaccinating the american people we had the the green light to go forward and immunize adolescents uh 12 to 17 and they developed a very robust immune response and i said you know what i think we could get here and and the reason being i said if we could vaccinate all the adolescents and adults in the country we could reach a point where we can interrupt virus transmission because so many people will have been vaccinated even without vaccinating the little kids i think we might have been able uh to get there but um you know as john lennon once said life is what happens while you're busy making other plans and unfortunately other life intervened in life to intervene in the form of two things one uh the delta variant came in from the uk from india then through the uk and then into the us and and as most people know by now that that delta varian is much more highly transmissible than anything we've seen before it has a reproductive number of six to eight that means if a single individual gets delta then on average 68 other unvaccinated individuals will get it that's two or three times higher than the original lineage and we think we understand why now and we could talk about that and so that kind of raised the bar in terms of the percentage of americans we have to vaccinate so the more transmissible a virus agent is the more peop the higher percentage of people need to be vaccinated and in fact there's even a simple equation which you can do this at home if you have a reproductive number of six to eight the simple equation is one minus one over the reproductive number so with measles for instance where the reproductive number is you know to what between twelve and fifteen one minus one over fifteen that's how you get to something like 0.95 and 95 of the population vaccinated and that's why when measles vaccination rates go below 90 we see measles outbreaks in schools as unfortunately we've seen that in texas well with delta it's one minus one over six one minus one over eight gets to be about eighty five percent of the population vaccinated and that's and that's not eighty-five percent of the adults that's eighty-five percent of the whole population and that's a high bar because since since off the top uh kids under the age of 12 are not yet eligible to get vaccinated that basically means all of the adults and all of the adolescents so you're hearing about the president setting the bar of 70 of adults forget it it's that's not even close we need pretty much all of the adults and adolescents you might say well that's impossible well the answer is it's not impossible it's happening right now it's happening in vermont it's happening in massachusetts they're reaching those targets and you know what they're having a pretty good summer yes there are you know there have been some outbreaks but overall they're doing pretty well and and i'm pretty confident they're not going to have a big issue getting through the school year i think they're going to be able to work this out because they're going to have all of the teachers vaccinated all of the staff all of the bus drivers and all of the adolescents and so middle school and high school is going to be go really well and then for the little kids if in addition to having masks on the little kids community transmission will slow because so many kids are vaccinated unfortunately we're not so fortunate down here in the south we're going in the wrong direction and have been for a while and it's actually hurting the whole country so let me take just to take a step back let's look at the state of louisiana right now which is on fire in fact most of the south is on fire but louisiana is the worst affected state right now and we're starting to see lots of young people go into the hospital we're seeing lots of kids going into pediatric icus right now and the school year hasn't even started so why did how did we get there well the state of louisiana did actually an okay job of individuals over the age of 65. so when you look at the difference between the north and the south and individuals over the age of 65 it's not that bad it's not that different so um you know we're looking at maybe 80 percent of those over the age of 65 in louisiana vaccinated versus 99 in the northeast or 95 to 99 so a difference no question about it but not that dramatic a difference where the bottom falls out is in terms of how we're doing vaccinating young people so we're looking at about 15 16 of the adolescents are vaccinated in the state of louisiana over 70 of the adolescents that's a big difference 70 70 compared to 17 with young adults also really low percentages maybe 30 40 of the young adults so that's why things are looking so dire right now in the state of louisiana it's not a mystery you've got the delta variant that's twice as transmissible as anything we've seen before as transmissible as chickenpox which you know most parents or still remember what chickenpox is all about highly transmissible second none of the adolescents are vaccinated for all practical purposes barely any of the young adults and on top of that you have a number of the red state governors saying um you know certainly no vaccine mandates for the schools but also no mask mandates either now this the governor of louisiana has realized oh my god you know this is a bad situation and he's turned it around right now and he's now i think as of yesterday or today not proposing mass mandates for the state of louisiana uh in an indoor setting so you know it's it would have been better to happen sooner but maybe there's going to be some mitigation there but now schools are opening and you know i worry with such a low percentage of with so much community transmission because vaccination rates are low and so few kids and uh teachers and staff vaccinated they're they're in for trouble and we're already seeing you know the pictures of at least two pediatric icus uh one in baton rouge and the other one in new orleans they're filled up not regular i see these pediatric icus and and so that concerns me that we're gonna and we're seeing this now in arkansas we're seeing it now in mississippi and again even before school starts so i think we're in for a really rough school year and the frustration of course is it's it's an unforced error we did not have to get here had we you know either had vaccine mandates for the schools or at least the advocate you know the right level of advocacy for it had we been more attentive to what was going on instead kind of holding fast to these ideas these health freedom medical freedom ideologies which are incredibly self-defeating and and destructive so okay so what's gonna happen now in texas um i think it's gonna we're gonna see lots of differences in different parts of the state so the state of texas is not not unified on that just like the country's not unified texas is not unified either so along the border with mexico they're doing surprisingly well with vaccinations the urban areas are doing better than the rural areas if you go into east texas the counties in east texas forget it nobody's vaccinated and even though things aren't accelerating yet i think it's going to be a matter of time so i think east texas you know all of the rural areas around tyler i think that's not going to go well houston harris county i think we're kind of in between we're not doing terribly compared to the rest of the south we're doing about the average for the country i think right now which and that's not great because that average is not a real average it's really a bimodal peak you've got the underperformers here in the south you've got the uh overachievers up in the northeast we're somewhere in in between so you know we've what we you know if there's no other take-home message for houston harris county is we've got to dramatically expand our vaccinations so i think right now the numbers are like around 50 vaccination harris county it's not good enough it's you know we've got to get towards around 85 percent of the county vaccinated and you know when you so that's about a you know 25 say roughly a 25 difference well heck if you look at the population of harris county what is it four to five million people 20 you got to get a million people vaccinated and you know this is not some abstract thing in the future we got to do it now and that's so the question is for me if that's the case what do we need to do to vaccinate a million people now um and you know i think some of it's going to happen organically because people are now realizing that their unvaccinated buddies and family members are going into hospitals and icu's because the the fake message that was out there before was that if you were young and healthy and you know went to the gym every day and had a good diet don't worry about it you don't need that vaccine that's that's for old people and of course that's not true it's not a substitute for virus neutralizing the antibodies i think young people are starting to get that so there is kind of a auto correction that young p and we have some data on that in the south that people young people are starting to get vaccinated but it's still happening too slowly um other than that you know i think we have to really look at the schools in person classes and i look i'm the parent of four now adult kids but when my kids are little listen i understand the importance of in-person learning better than anyone and and i still very much support that but we can't set up our kids to fail we've got to give them the tools they need to succeed and the two tools that we have are vaccines and masks and so to me um the if you know if i were if i were king of texas which i know i'm not and uh you know don't have that ability i would i would put in vaccine mandates for the schools and i would put in mass mandates for the schools but you know unfortunately that's that's not there but that's the best thing we can do for the kids right now as we ramp up vaccinating um the the state of texas is as fast and quickly uh as we can so those are our challenges um i think we have to recognize that you know we what are we doing are we are we promoting ideology are we trying to get our kids through the school year and trying to have a good quality of life and you know i'll bank on the ladder at any time and so that means all hands on deck to expand vaccinations and all hands on desk deck to you know if if we still need mass as a backstop it's it's not that big a deal let's go forward and and do that um and i'd say you might say well dr hotez is there any silver lining well there is um you know we have done a reasonably like the rest of the south we've done a reasonably good job at vaccinating older texans over the age of 65 not perfect you know in some places it's only half in some of the east texas counties but most of the state probably over three quarters so so no question we're not going to see as many deaths in this big summer surge as we saw last summer search but here's what you're going to see you're going to see a lot of young people hospitalized and that's scary you do not want to be hospitalized with covet you do not want to be sitting there and especially an intensive care unit with the icu nurse saying you know we don't know if we're going to have to intubate you or not right i mean that i can't imagine anything more terrifying right than than being in an icu with covin not knowing if you're going to be intubated in the hopes that it'll work out so we're going to see that we are going to see some pediatric icu admissions i just don't know how many i think the other big unknown is we've all been hearing about long covid and we don't have great numbers for younger kids but we do know there's a very good paper in the journal of the american medical association jama finding that 26 percent of young adults go on to have long cove at lasting more than six months and that's not fun right it's exercise intolerance it's shortness of breath it's heart palpitations maybe longer term cardiac damage it's brain fog and brain fog sounds sort of innocent but it's not now we have mri studies magnetic resonance imaging studies from oxford university showing at least in the 40 to 50 year olds that brain fog is linked to gray matter brain degeneration and the paper which is still in pre-print form says it looks like the cognitive decline you see in aging and this is done by an alzheimer's research group so if you're a young adult you know this is a time in your life when you're starting a family or you know maybe starting a mortgage on a house or applying the graduate school or taking your sats this is not a time where you want to look at cognitive impairments and so again the really important to stress that i think what the bad guys do meaning the anti-vaccine groups what they do is they they throw out the death rates and they say hey look the death rates i get it they're high among those over the age of 65. but look at the death rates and adolescents they're not very high or look at the death rates and even young adults are not very high well first of all we are seeing young people get sick and and very sick because the delta variant seems to be a little bit more more severe in illness and but what you're seeing are hospitalizations and that long covet and and that's not something that you want to think about having to deal with as a young person so mixed mixed picture right now a little more dire than positive partly because i'm really concerned that we're already seeing young people hospitalized and the school year hasn't even started here hisd houston pinton school district was at august 23rd in louisiana now i think some of the parishes are starting next week august 9th in mississippi they some of the high schools started early started last week and they already had to they already had to shut it down because so many kids had covered they went back to virtual learning and i don't want to see that happen and we don't we don't have to we don't have to live this way we just have to get everybody who's eligible vaccinated and masked and recognize you know it's a disappointment this delta variant is a bad bad actor that is the reality but we now have the tools to do this we have good vaccines and they're highly safe people are not dying of vaccination as the anti-vaccine people like to say vaccines do not cause infertility vaccines are not experimental they are not developed quickly i mean i can go through the whole list of talking points and i'm happy to do that on this call but this that's the bottom line for the message

well miss McCarthy how serious do you consider lead poisoning of humans especially children it's one of the most serious things that we face her Wow okay so let's go back because in July 2015 Flint mayor doing wallings emailed EPA regional five administration Susan Hedman about a leaked internal memo that was sent by EPA employee Miguel de Toro to a flint resident the memo revealed that Flint's water tested high for lead and del toral recommended that the EPA intervene administrator Hellman replied that the memo should not have been leaked called it a preliminary draft report and did nothing to address the serious threat that lead had created for the citizens of Flint when you were made aware of these communications between miss headman and mayor wallings did you ask miss headman to resign I do not believe that she indicated that any memo was leaked this is factual so I mean I'm trying to just get the fence the facts are here so I mean knowing this did you ask her to resign no service I mean so why not fire her I mean you know the seriousness of this issue and yet you still don't do that in fact I'm going to quote you you praised her when she when she resigned she was I mean that's not she was not criticizing Miguel's report she was indicating that it was interim there was more data to be done and she was giving a heads-up because she knew that it had gone public okay so you know about the seriousness of blood poisoning and yet this is the action you take this once again I'm going to step you back you made another comment here earlier that is insulting to us congress is specific on this about states rights and not stepping on them I want you to go back and start looking at your your edit in regards to waters of the US now let's keep going is that a serious response really in regards to your response with Miss headsman is that seriously our response for somebody who understands said that the complexity and seriousness of lead poisoning that's that's that's a appropriate response she did nothing to discuss my point I'm she did nothing point is you know better she knows better well all week this is not my first rodeo with you over and over again we've gone it I mean remember Southwest Colorado and then ineptitude that you actually had there too there's a responsibility I look at the gentleman next to you as taking responsibility I'm looking at somebody else I want to see responsibility too and the American people desert demanding I mean all I've seen it I've seen the Chairman over and over again you still don't get it remember after remember you still don't get it you have bred a culture at EPA that is a built a fraud denial incompetence and bureaucratic nepotism that's what you've done well sir I'm not trying to shift responsibility issue having this whole hearing that's all you've done is is you never take an accountability for any of the problems at the EPA it's could we have done something better do you admit wrong we could maybe we could have done something a little bit faster the timelines are very convert and and very factual so let me ask you another question I'm gonna go back to another thing the committee has made multiple requests for EPA's documents relating to Flint when do you expect those requests to be fully complied with sir we're working on all of the requests give me a date with a date I mean this is I mean you you are you are professional at slow walking and delaying information that is pertinent to this investigation over and over again some of the document productions have been redacted will you provide this committee with the full unredacted copies of those documents well we released just 30,000 documents sir we'll keep releasing those and I'm happy I asked you what no no I asked you a question specific terms are you gonna release unredacted forms of these of these emails of course we'll respond to Congress and allow you to do your jobs as well yeah I just can't give you a schedule sir whether that's the same old same old crap that we hear over and over again and that is not what the president promised promised us he said the most transparent administration period and that includes you I mean I'm sick of this and America should be sick of this bureaucratic nepotism and you're the culture of the prob I see somebody who's addressing it right here is governor of Michigan but I don't see anything coming from your part of this problem it doesn't condone that not only am I asking you to be fired if you're not going to if you're not going to resign you should be impeached I yield back

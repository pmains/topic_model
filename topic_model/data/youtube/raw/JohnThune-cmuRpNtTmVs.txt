thank you madam chair for holding this important hearing um during my time as chairman of this committee we considered and enacted the fa reauthory's reauthorization Act of 2018 which included several Provisions related to bolstering the nation's air traffic control system and improving the experience of the flying public and as the next FAA reauthorization approaches is essential that modernizing the nation's air traffic control system remains a top priority as I've said before I'm deeply concerned about the fa slow progress on next-gen despite robust funding for com from Congress in numerous legislative directives from this committee to complete such an essential modernization initiative in a timely manner travel disruptions especially those related to recent ATC issues and the failure of the nodem system in January we've only highlighted the critical importance of technology modernization especially as it relates to improving management of the national Aerospace system so I look forward to this discussion and acting administrator Nolan thank you for being here to testify as I previously mentioned the implementation of next-gen is going to be crucial in the coming years these Investments as well as employing Concepts such as Dynamic airspace management will allow the United States to better utilize existing infrastructure increasing the capacity and efficiency of the nas recent ATC issues at airports across the country have certainly highlighted the need for modernization so could you describe how fa is working to get back on schedule to implement the various priorities of next-gen in a timely manner yes sir uh thank you for the question uh Senator so we continue to work uh and to deliver on the benefits of next-gen when we think about the work we've done again around navigation around communication one of the a couple of those successes is by going from voice to data uh we're we've been able to eliminate We Believe over a hundred and thirty thousand misread clearances and we understand that's a big issue we continue to work on we've metroplexes that we have around the country that's been a big effort 11 of those in places when we think about we have optimized profile descent so that ability to to send out the altitude without the the step Downs that were a thing of the past those have become more a thing of the past now that allows certainly is a fuel saving and it's an efficiency piece that ability for us to be able to have Airlines know when to push off their degree so that you're off the gate into the to the runway all of those are efforts that we are doing and we continue to do we work closely with the next gen advisory committee we got the advanced Aviation advisory committee we have the Drone advisory committee and all of those committees inform the work that we do and we are looking we continue to look for opportunities as I mentioned in my opening remarks one of the challenges we face and will continue to face with next-gen is that level of equippage not everyone is equipped to the same level and so that ability to take advantage of all that next gen can deliver in the moment in many respects will depend on what the industry has equipped to so that that's a challenge for and we'll continue to work through it so I mean and it's it's just been it's been a very slow process with lots of delays and I'm concerned that by the time many of these initiatives you're talking are completed they're going to be already outmoded or obsolete in comparison the latest technology so what actions is the fa taking to avoid this issue is next-gen implementation continues it's one of continued you know partnership and collaboration uh we are in on ongoing almost on a daily weekly basis with the airline industry and with you know Partners around the world in terms of how do we how do we get better at that the journal we're on is there and and Airlines the industry are seeing the benefits of it there is more work to be done yeah undoubtedly again back to the equippage piece there there are just certain things you have to have to be able to do a particular approach for example our ability to Sunset some of the Legacy systems some ils's ndbs things like that now that we have GPS based navigation right so it is our ability to work collectively and have that a a similar Vision between us and the industry about what we want to achieve and how quickly we can get so is this committee looks toward developing this fa reauthorization Bill do you believe there are opportunities for the fa to incorporate adaptive or dynamic airspace management Technologies into this its next-gen initiative or otherwise enhance real-time inner age and coordination with the Pentagon and other stakeholders and I tell you that because we have an air force base and a training area the Powder River training complex um and the B1 currently operates there uh B-21 is coming in we're going to get the first training unit the formal training unit and first operations unit there and and we really need the fa's help on this right and it's something we've been focused on for a long time can you comment on that yes I would say we're strong Partners not only with the dod to ensure that we can work together and that we are aligned and when we think about airspace and airspace uses we're a strong partner and we we really we welcome the suggestion and we look forward to see how do we do more of it well I hope we can count on your help on that because it has become it's it's one of the biggest obstacles to large Force training exercises and the types of uh you know capabilities that we can use or or benefit from in that airspace so I hope you can help thank you sir

aspired the chair now recognizes gentlelady from Missouri mrs. Wegener chairman of our oversight and investigation subcommittee Thank You mr. chairman director Potter I have some very important policy and oversight and investigation questions in my capacity as chairman that I have to ask but I would be remiss if I didn't start by saying that earlier today miss Grimes testified that you would not submit to the internal investigation because you believed that you could not be disciplined miss Grimes testified that you refused to abide by the internal investigation because no outcome of that investigation would be able to hold you accountable additionally the Fifth Circuit ruled that your office and your agency are unconstitutional because of your isolation from oversight you have a very simple question director what who do you report to is there anyone who you believe has oversight of your actions I report to the President of the United States and I can be removed if he finds that I have done something improper for cause and that's the problem we have here but even even if my agency were organized in a different way that would still be the case suppose I had a three-person Commission you do not I reclaim my time you do you do not hold yourself to the same standard that you hold your employees to I do yes well but you refuse to participate in any investigation and do not believe that anyone has oversight you cannot be disciplined for any of the allegations you cannot possibly even participate in that investigation as Wagner I am fully participating in these investigations I wish I didn't have to but I am no I don't think a lot sir you were asked if you were you admit you could voluntarily participate but you are not participating in a sexual harassment proceedings and and you have held yourself to a different standard move on director wand in the 2018 IG report concerning FHFA s housing finance examiner program the IG states that not only has a new training program not produced new examiner's but the entire program has now been suspended after receiving an anonymous online tip about the quality of the training the anonymous tip talked about the lack of professionalism with training etc etc the IG reports that after this anonymous tip FHFA suspended the training program director wat FHFA spent 7.7 million dollars of the taxpayers money on a crucial training program which apparently lacks professionalism among other things but more importantly cannot complete its mission to train even one more commissioned examiner what steps is FHFA taken to remedy this problem sir we are constantly engaging in efforts to upgrade examiner capable how many years will it take director wat to spend over seven and you don't have one new examiner and you've said seven point seven million dollars let me give you a little history if you don't mind well I don't have much time I got a lot of ground to cover sir this this agency FHFA was a brand new agency stood up as a combination of power agencies we inherited all of the examination staff from those prior agencies have you added any new examiner's are you in fact one less down yes we have all right I'm gonna let you submit the rest of this in writing I'm gonna move on FHFA I'll move on mr. miles let me revisit some questions I had for the inspector general did Fannie Mae these were yes or no is very quickly did Fannie Mae recommend to FHFA in 2017 that Fannie Mae consolidate and relocate its Northern Virginia offices to a new office built to Fannie Mae specifications yes or no use the microphone please yes or no what the respect congresswoman I don't think I can answer it yes or no but we did make a recommendation to consolidate our offices is it true that the primary reason Fannie Mae wanted to move to these new offices was because moving to these new offices would enable Fannie Mae personnel to work in a quote open workspace environment yes well that was one factor but it was not the primary factor mister are a direct watt did you approve using and spending 727 million dollars 727 million dollars three quarters of a billion dollars while you're in conservatorship let me remind you of the taxpayers money to relocate the Northern Virginia workforce from buildings that you owned to renovated buildings that you now rent the net effect of that move was to yield more than 300 million dollars to the taxpayers way I use you said you could sell your owned properties for 140 million how much did they sell for direct well net effect of that decision was to return over 300 million dollars it's not add up how much did you sell that building for director wise I don't know how many million dollars and you spent over 727 million dollars of the taxpayers money moving to a rented building yes ma'am that's absolutely consistent with what we've been trying to do director watt Wow sighs Fannie Mae reduce the number of employees they have we're statutory reclaiming my time your statutory responsibility sir is to preserve and conserve the assets and property of Annie Mae and I would say that you have delivers time-related REO back time of the gentlelady has expired

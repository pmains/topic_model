senator rand paul very good to have you are you okay with this relief package as it stands now let me think about it we're going to print up money and give it to people who haven't lost their job what could be dumber as an idea to print up money we don't have or borrow it from foreign countries or borrow from whoever we have to borrow it from and give it to people who are still working it's a really bad idea i mean people always talked about oh well stimulus works in the short run since they asked lord maynard keynes one time well what about the long run he said the long run will all be dead so these are the people that don't care about their kids or their grandkids they care about the short run but even if you look at it for those who are not working that's tucked in there or is it taken out of there well here's the thing is this makes president obama look quite conservative because when president obama addressed unemployment they simply extended unemployment here we're adding to unemployment so when you extend it that's a little bit of a hand up when you add to it what you do is you give people an incentive to not work and so if you pay people more not to work than to work what you get is institutionalized unemployment but what i was going to say is look i got people waiting five to ten miles to get across the ohio river because a bridge is out we've been trying to fix this bridge for 10 years so if you ask me what should government do with what money we do have i would say fixing bridges and infrastructure would be more important than writing checks to people who did not lose their job it's a terrible rotten idea it's a liberal idea and republicans who are for it ought to be ashamed of themselves about passing checks out to people who didn't lose their job well apparently one of them is the president he likes the small business relief that's tucked in there and the help for the airline industry you do not then well we don't have the money i mean we're a trillion dollars short in our annual budget this adds another trillion so basically what you're voting for if you allegedly say you're a conservative you're voting for two trillion dollars of deficit in one year last year we had 3.3 so there's nothing conservatives about this and my question is what happened to the republicans who ran against obama's spending and debt and all their big bad ways of big government republicans are showing themselves to be just as bad as the people they criticized um you know senator uh you talk about the the switch that's coming right now in administrations of january 20th when joe biden takes and i i had to sense and correct me from wrong sir that you do not see joe biden as the legitimate next president united states you had said that fraud had happened the election in many ways was stolen so if do you believe that joe biden taking over january 20th indicates that he has stolen the election and stolen the white house well you know we have a long history of election fraud in our country seven out of 10 republicans agree with me that there was significant fraud in this election it not only fraud the election law was changed by people who had no constitutional right to change it so a secretary of state in pennsylvania or georgia has no legal right to change the election law and yet tip the ultimate outcome of the election center do you believe that that fraud uh that that chicanery was so rampant that it literally changed the results first of all no court has ever addressed that no court has ever looked at the facts of fraud but we had two lawyers for the trump campaign present to us on wisconsin and nevada yesterday in our committee in nevada they had 4 000 people who voted illegally i've not heard one person on the left dispute it or even come to discuss it fifteen hundred people who were dead tens of thousands of people who did not uh live at their house they were voting from a commercial or a vacant lot so is it is it in in numbers that rob donald trump of reelection um no court has ever heard it no no court and no proceeding has ever heard the fact just interested in your opinion from what we are told by the people who have counted the votes between dead people people who voted twice illegal aliens and people who had illegitimate absentee ballots yes there are enough votes in in several of the different states to do that the one thing you can't quite estimate is how many people well some of you can how many people voted after the election that wouldn't have been counted according to the election laws the other thing that's hard to actually put a number on is many of these states it was not legal to solicit votes for the government to solicit votes and yet the secretaries of state sent out solicitations they're still doing it in georgia they are soliciting people to vote by sending them applications in the mail the law does not allow for that the secretary of state has just assumed this upon himself so that is something that should be and should be heard in courts and hasn't been so when mitch mcconnell refers to donald trump uh you know as having lost the election and that right now it looks like the president-elect the united states is joe biden is he wrong to some of your republican colleagues who now given the meeting of the electoral college participants and they technically put joe biden over the top uh did they and are they acknowledging a sham well no i don't think the election is going to change i think joe biden will be the next president but what i would say is it's sort of like roger maris beating babe ruth's record he got an extra eight games to do it in so it's not a fair comparison i think that there was fraud significant fraud and i think the only way we can fix it is in the future by changing the laws because frankly we've seen this in the past lbj was a big cheater pritchard in my state went to jail for cheating there's a lot of cheating that has happened in our history but the courts also have a long-term history of never listening to the arguments they have punted 60 times but it's important that the left not get to misconstrue this none of the court cases were on the facts they were on standing and procedural technicalities nobody has ruled that there wasn't fraud and so i've got these left-wing crazy people senator i understand but the president is well within his right to continue protesting this election some have even said not even going to the inauguration to express his displeasure with how it was all handled do you support him not acknowledging defeat maybe acknowledging once all of this is certified with the electoral college on january 6 with a joint session of congress but that uh the president should not graciously concede because there's nothing to conceive well you know he's going to have to make his own decision if it were me i would say yes they stole it i've tried everything i can do in court to get them to listen we have examples of fraud and the reason why the fraud is important is we need to go back now and go to every state we can possibly make sure that the election laws are in order and we need to say secretaries of state cannot change the election law so i'm going to be working on this in every state that republicans have a chance of passing a law to make sure that this doesn't happen again but we shouldn't sweep it under the rug and say oh no fraud here the courts won't hear it yes there was fraud but yes also people unconstitutionally change the law secretaries of state do have not have any power to change the law and we need to go back to those states to georgia state legislature and say never again will we allow a secretary of state to do what this one did senator rand paul thank you very very much

mr. president senator from Kentucky no amount of money not all the money in China will save us from ourselves our only hope of rescuing this great country is to reopen the economy if you print up billions of dollars and give it to people they are unlikely to spend it until you end the quarantine the good news though is that the scientific community finally has facts instead of conjecture the models that use three point four percent mortality were fortunately very wrong random samples now of thousands of people have now been tested for antibodies or immunity to coronavirus to large randomized studies in California shows similar results the number of people who have already developed antibodies to the corona virus is 25 to 50 times higher than the number that is being reported as infected this is great news this study means that the mortality rate may well be 25 to 50 times less deadly than previously thought the virus is still dangerous and we shouldn't ignore the risks but we should put those risks in perspective these randomized tests indicate that instead of a 3.4 percent mortality that the rate could be as much as only a tenth of a percent or two-tenths of one percent we now have solid scientific evidence from randomized studies that we can manage this disease without continuing the draconian lockdown of the economy the question the question before us isn't do nothing or print endless amounts of bailout cash the debate should now include the one choice that will get our economy growing again reopening American commerce so today I rise in opposition to spending five hundred billion dollars more the virus bailouts hope bailouts have already cost over two trillion dollars our annual deficit this year will approach four trillion dollars we can't continue on this course no amount of bailout dollars will stimulate an economy that is being strangled by quarantine it is not a lack of money that plagues us but a lack of Commerce this economic calamity only resolves when we begin to reopen the economy opening the economy will require Americans to rise above partisanship to understand that deaths from infectious disease will continue but that we cannot indefinitely quarantine make no mistake about it this has been a difficult month for our country for many of us we have not seen a greater challenge I'm encouraged to see how our communities have responded in Kentucky we have seen tremendous collaboration people from all walks of life have come together to help each other we have worked to identify and supply additional protective gear mass and gloves to protect our doctors and nurses who risk their lives on a daily basis UPS has set up an airlift operation out of Louisville that includes a health care facility for FEMA this lets FEMA make overnight deliveries from anywhere in the country over three million pounds of masks gloves and other equipment have been shipped to the Louisville Airport by UPS we've worked with some of our Bourbon distillers to assist them in transitioning to producing hand sanitizer we've helped repatriate Americans trapped overseas we've also seen in our communities have banded together to support neighbors businesses and those in need when protective equipment was in short supply we discovered a way to use industrial masks and we supported legislation that allowed this to bring 30 some-odd million masks into the medical community when the FDA wouldn't approve kovat tests other than the CDC's a test that initially failed we introduced legislation that circumvented the FDA and circumvented the red tape to get testing done quicker over the years the u.s. accumulated more than 23 trillion dollars in debt though spending money that we do not have borrowing from our kids and our grandkids future the gargantuan federal bailout that just passed over two trillion dollars brings us closer and closer to a point of no return a point at which the world loses confidence in the dollar a point at which our debt an existential threat to our security the United States was already having to borrow simply to pay our promises to senior citizens the u.s. is borrowing about a trillion dollars a year just to pay for everyday obligations this is before the pandemic bailout the US was already borrowing nearly 2 million dollars every minute with the recent two trillion dollar bailout we are borrowing faster than we have ever borrowed before had we practiced sound budgeting in the past we would have been better significantly better positioned to weather this storm Congress's failures of the past coupled with the pandemic crisis the president could seriously jeopardize our economic future in this moment we need to think carefully about what we do next to stop the spread of the virus commerce has been disrupted businesses have closed and millions have lost their jobs right now that number is over 20 million unemployed the job losses will continue no matter how much money you throw at it until you reopen the economy our government has intervened with unprecedented scale to prop up our economy we've injected two trillion dollars I don't believe it makes sense for the government to provide support to businesses and families I do believe it makes sense for the government to provide support to businesses and families that can't make it through this I've supported expanding unemployment benefits to workers displaced by government quarantine including self-employed individuals that have lost their businesses but make no mistake the massive economic calamity we're experiencing right now was caused by government passing out $1,200 checks indiscriminately to people who haven't lost their jobs will do nothing to rescue the country if we were going to make discreet payments direct payments the criteria should have been sending checks to people who needed it people who lost their jobs people furloughed people had wage cuts instead of directing help to the unemployed though some of these bailout checks will go to people couples who earn nearly two hundred thousand dollars a year but you could give everybody in the country $12,000 and it wouldn't end this recession our recovery only comes when the quarantine has ended now experts will disagree on the exact date that we should reopen the economy but saying rational council should continue to push for the quickest and possible opining about never shaking hands again is a recipe for keeping the economy closed until no one dies from infectious disease well the infectious disease experts should be queried so too should economists we should seek counsel about balancing the harm to health caused by disease with a harm to health caused by enforcing dysfunction on the economy not easy decisions perhaps most importantly leaders in each state must weigh in on the problem New York City's open date will be different than Fargo North Dakota we need to get past a one-size-fits-all approach to infest infectious disease realize that most of this money that's being loan to small business is not alone most of this money will not be repaid it will ultimately be considered grants and will be added to our national debt let's be honest about this applications for the program open to overwhelming initial demand the current data indicates that the money's gone so now well here we are again with leadership from both parties saying let's do another 300 billion what's another couple hundred billion but realize the money desired is not money that we have saved for a rainy day this money doesn't exist anywhere it will be created or borrowed even more alarming than the money is the idea that one senator can stand on the floor and pass legislation spending a half a trillion dollars and have no recorded vote and no debate look I understand the hardships of senators returning from around the country so I have not invoked the Senate rules to demand a recorded vote I did return today though so that history will record that not everyone gave in to the massive debt Congress is creating my hope is that across the country they will remain a vibrant voice for limited government for our constitutional republic I don't want to see this massive accumulation of debt destroy this great country so my advice to the Senate and to the American people is let's be aware of what we're doing by creating all this new debt and that's think before we jump to a terrible terrible conclusion

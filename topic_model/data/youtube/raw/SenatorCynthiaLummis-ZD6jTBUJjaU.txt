thank you mr chairman appreciate your holding this hearing on the important work of the sec and chairman gensler it's great to see you again and um so i want to dive into a component of the llamas gillibrand bill which you've had a chance to see that deals with section 301 of that bill i agree with statements you and your predecessor jay clayton have made the initial coin offerings where digital assets are sold to investors expecting to profit from the seller's efforts should be considered investment contracts senator gillibrand and i share your concerns about information gaps that can arise when digital assets are later used and traded by others and the need to ensure users can make informed decisions in the market so we believe that it is those that raise the money through an initial sale of digital assets and those that continue to provide essential managerial efforts should be held responsible to provide disclosures to the market and that innocent secondary purchasers of digital assets that may or may not be aware that their trading insecurities should not be subject to strict liability so in our act the responsible financial innovation act rather than attempting to impose new complex difficult to apply rules on secondary purchasers not involved in fundraising transactions section 301 of our bill provides for robust technology neutral disclosure obligations that would hold responsible those who benefited from that fundraising not the innocent users of digital assets who have no way of knowing what the sponsor is up to so my question is this do you have any thoughts on the need for disclosures in the digital asset markets and section 301 of our bill so i thank you for the question it was good to meet with you and senator gillibrand and discuss these as well i think that the disclosure as you say is key uh we even recently just were setting up a new uh industry office to help the disclosure on in this field in our corporate finance area i do think that that as you say the innocent purchaser let's say the public the public is does not have a disclosure obligation when they buy a stock on the new york stock exchange and it's not the public that should have a disclosure obligation if they buy some crypto security token but the the the entrepreneurs the the the sponsor the promoter the entrepreneurs that's where the the disclosure obligation ought to be and i think we have authorities now to facilitate and actually have a different set of disclosures just as we have in other fields we have different disclosures on something called asset-backed securities than we do for equities but i do think where i might respectfully differ from i think what might be in the question is that i think um in the secondary market five years after a stock is issued you know a stock of a great u.s company is issued there's still a disclosure obligation and i think that's what congress did in 1933 passed a law saying you've got to make a disclosure if you raise money from the public but the congress knew that wasn't enough and in 34 they came back and said you know what we also have to cover the secondary market in two ways cover the intermediaries like the stock exchange and the broker-dealers but also say that there's got to be what's known as periodic reporting you know the annual report and so or maybe there's no difference here but i think that the investor should not have an obligation it's the intermediaries and then it's the common enterprise or the folks in the middle and are you thinking that that disclosure option or obligation uh would be similar for uh initial coin offerings under our bill or should be under our bill similar disclosure options uh as were instituted in 1934. um i i think uh similar in kind but probably there's some things there's it might be a little bit different list i mean there might not be a board of directors and things like that so i i really do think you your bill had a list we might differ on that list we might have other things to put on that list but it's not necessarily as you say everything that a big multinational company is doing okay well i i i want you to know that senator gillibrand and i want to continue to work with you and your staff uh to make sure that uh to the extent that we don't philosophically disagree that any of those sorts of gaps uh that you have identified in our bill can be addressed uh because i don't have i don't see our bill having an avenue to come before uh this committee or the um congress uh before the end of the year but we do intend to have it to reintroduce it in january and we want to make sure that between now and january we've worked with you and your staff to make sure that we can address items that we can mutually agree need to be in i look forward to that and particularly as i said earlier in ways that we can ensure we don't undermine the 100 trillion dollar capital market the definition of security the definitions of other things that really are under this committee and stay under this committee and we've talked about unintended consequences of our bill before with you we want to address those unintended consequences obviously you you see things that maybe we don't because of your perspective mr chairman thank you really appreciate your being here today mr chairman thank you

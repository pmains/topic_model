thank you uh chairman costa and ranking member you're welcome johnson appreciate it uh today's hearing represents much of kansas legacy i get to represent the big first district of kansas and former senator bob dole um used to be in this seat and he paved the way of course for the mcgovern dole international food for education and child nutrition program which as you all know helps fight hunger by providing nutritious meals to children in schools in developing countries the origins of food for peace program actually came out of the district as well at a county farm bureau meeting in southwest kansas years ago and so the list of reasons why international trade and food assistance programs like these are important to my district important to kansas and that list goes on and on uh mr um charles first off a question for you kansas is the wheat state wheat's the number one commodity used in u.s donations if you add up all of the aid destinations they would represent a top 10 market for u.s wheat in that same vein the last two farm bills have granted usaid flexibility in implementing aid programs however more than half of that funding is from market-based assistance meaning non-u.s food how can usaid prioritize in-kind donations of u.s commodities like wheat kansas certainly has a very proud legacy when it comes to food assistance overseas i i will say as you as you noted wheat is is is the biggest commodity that we source here um here in the united states when we look at assistance we really are looking at how to deliver the most effective assistance and including how to make sure that that wheat is accompanied by the kind of wrap around services to ensure that it's actually addressing the most critical food security needs that it's targeted at the most vulnerable and that they're provided the kind of wrap around nutrition and health services that um that ensure that uh that that can be effective great uh thank you and my next question uh is for you administrator whitley as you mentioned the 2018 farm bill created international agriculture education fellowship program or iaefp i applaud usda's successful launch of ia efp in africa but i'm concerned with usda's recent decision to relocate a iaefp after only one year in a country while i recognize the need for this type of program in many geographic regions such a move in the program's second year would undermine or could undermine the intent sustainability and overall success of the entire program what do you need from congress to ensure multi-year sustainability in a particular country so that we don't risk exiting a country prematurely before progress is made and accounted for thank you congressman man uh the recent decision to offer ag programming under iepf uh to another country we do think is within the legislative authority of how the program was written the funding is available on an annual basis and we award the uh on an annual basis however the programs do have a three-year component to it so we will monitor and assess the program over a three-year period for its overall effectiveness but we can only allocate the money on that annual basis great thank you i believe that iaefp to be successful the department must find ways to extend his presence in awarded countries or regions we can't expect to monitor any program with only a year's worth of results i just think you know once these programs are stood up we've got to do it for a few years to really know if we're having results and and there has to be a sense of longevity and sustainability to see effectiveness and really effective use of tax dollars so thank you both for being here and for what you do and with that i yield back

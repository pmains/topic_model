tears California cars been brad Sherman and Eric Congressman Paul Tonko congressman Tonko first to you what's going to happen when senator Sanders takes the stage oh I think he'll offer a agenda and an appeal to the the convention goers to come behind a candidate that can bring us to a victory that doesn't allow for a trump candidacy to be victorious he's you bringing us to that point I think there's no denying campaigns are emotional creatures and it takes a while for that emotion to to evaporate but what we have here I think is an acknowledgement that working families the great many of us in the middle income community are best served by a candidacy of Hillary Clinton and not by Donald Trump gosh Ben Sherman what's the role tonight do you think of senator Elizabeth Warren is she I mean it's an interesting role between sort of helping to unify your party I think I think both Sanders in Warren can do a lot to unify this party and you've got to remember that while Sanders has millions of voters around the country the most angry 200 were out in front of this stadium and the vast majority are all ready for Hillary they will certainly be for Hillary if they can ever really imagine a trump presidency a lot of these angry Bernie people they can't imagine themselves looking in the faces of families they know being deported by a president Trump because they don't even think that's possible as we get closer to November and as the prospect of a trump presidency becomes more than just a joke those folks will be with us as well and of course they're watching performance the crowd loves this yeah these are always big parties Republican was a big party to it's sort of fun but i always say what i always say is that how mean and nasty everybody is and then come November it's a peaceful transfer of power exactly and I think that's the whole process here are the convention people coming together knowing that yet settled on one person who's the most electable I mean there's much more here that unites us Greta as a party then divides us and I think the fine tuning that's come into play from both campaign has been helpful and we're going to see inspirational efforts this week to might not a successful don't I'm curious how the breaking the glass ceiling will be portrayed because i remember in 1984 when Geraldine Ferraro was a democratic on the Democratic ticket for vice president and the whole place is went nuts but different time doesn't seem like that women thing is so such a big deal this time but anyway it will be the first time in any way it's

American taxpayers deserve to know where when why and how government is spending their hard-earned dollars this is why I partnered with my colleague from Tennessee represent of Jim Cooper to introduced HR 38:32 this bipartisan legislation requires federal agencies to supply an online accounting of their program activities in an easily searchable inventory so that Americans can keep tabs on where and how their tax dollars are being spent the inventory will account for how funds are allocated total amount appropriated obligated and outlaid for services and the intended population served by each program it will also provide performance reviews for each program including any and all inspector general or Government Accountability Office reports all of the information provided for the inventory will be updated regularly to provide for a more real-time accounting of federal program dollars I ask for support from my colleagues for this legislation I think it's time has come and I yield back

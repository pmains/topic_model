each February we celebrate the countless contributions African Americans have made to this nation we recognize inventors like Garrett Morgan applaud visionaries like Langston Hughes and honor pioneers like Jesse Owens all of whom are from Ohio's 11th congressional district we do so because Black History Month represents inclusion and innovation black history is American history and embraces the diversity that makes America great our power lies in our differences to quote dr. Martin Luther King jr. we may all have come on different ships but we're in the same boat now every American should have access to the American dream yet it remains out of reach for too many despite tremendous progress racial prejudice and social injustice still exists the evidence is all around us as a community African Americans remain hopeful our people are resilient and grounded in the belief that determination and hard work can overcome all adversity it is this same spirit that unites our country today as one nation we need to speak out against injustice in the land of the free and the home of the brave we must give everyone a chance to succeed this Black History Month I call on my congressional colleagues to recommit themselves to our founding principles we have the opportunity to pass policies that reverse years of bigotry and injustice we must level the playing field for all let's develop a new formula to restore the vote reauthorize the child nutrition act and combat harsh sentencing through criminal justice reform let us not only celebrate the past but create pathways toward a better future these actions won't just honor a race of people they will further the hopes and dreams of an entire nation thank you

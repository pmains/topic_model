road paving requests from west virginians can you share more information about these subjects and any other pertinent information that west virginians need to know certainly first of all i'd like to express my appreciation to senator manchin and his all of his hard-working staff for including us in in this uh opportunity to to reach out and tell a little bit of our d.o.t story but uh the potholes the potholes are a particular scourge on the roadways of west virginia they uh they come every year just like clockwork they form over the winter they're they're due to water seeping beneath the roadway surfaces and expansion and contraction of that uh water as it freezes goes to a freeze-thaw cycle if you're uh they're not uh particularly uh only in west virginia uh many states that go through this type of thing but uh west virginia is unique with our beautiful mountains and country roads that go through those river valleys and all of the great topography we have but if you're driving on a road in alaska you don't see the potholes there because they go through one freestyle cycle per year in west virginia with our four beautiful seasons we can 40 freeze thaw cycles in a single season we're uh we have we've embarked on taking care of those potholes to repair all of our potholes by memorial day it's a lofty goal it's an ambitious goal but we're dedicated to do that we've taken steps to make sure that every transportation worker in the state knows the proper way to do that there is no more throw and go pothole repairs in west virginia we uh we take care of them the right way by milling tacking the holes clearing them out really good putting the material good material in there compacting it squares nice square potholes so the repairs are working it's getting it's getting our roadways ready to pave when the weather gets warm and we can really get after taking care of getting a good surface on the road because we've taken care of those holes and kept people from having the expenses of front end alignments flat tires this is important to people probably our number one complaint and we're focused on it like i said a a very ambitious goal of getting all of these repaired by memorial day each and every year next we welcome deputy cabinet secretary scott manderola from the west virginia department of environmental protection senator manchin has heard a lot about recovering abandoned mine land from west virginians can you share more information about recovering abandoned mine land and any other pertinent information that west virginians need to know thank you very much for the question marian um the abandoned mine lands program focuses on improving the environment and improving the waterways for the citizens of the state by dealing with acid mine drainage and other issues associated with pre-law mining features we do this in two specific ways our program has an emergency response group that deals with emergencies associated with subsidence landslides blowouts any other aml features that may cause an emergency for the citizens of the state the second way is through the revitalization of dead streams from acid mine drainage that's more of a long-term program so as an example of emergency response the town of smithers had a landslide that was caused by a down dip pre-law mine and a blowout that occurred which essentially saturated the soil and caused that landslide that landslide blocked the main access road to a large section of the community through the emergency response procedure we can contract immediately with vendors that can go out and open the road and then work with them through the emergency funding to come up with emergency repairs construct retaining walls excavate the material and permanently fix both the mine seal and the landslide so none of that will occur in the future the second approach is more of a long-term approach the revitalization of dead streams from acid mine drainage acid mine drainage causes hundreds of miles of streams in the state to be essentially void of aquatic life there's three main approaches that we take when we're dealing with acid mine drainage the easiest and least maintenance intensive would be something like limestone sands placing limestone sands in the headwaters of streams middle fork creek is a good example of this every time it rains some of that sandstone or limestone is washed into the stream increases the ph in the stream and neutralizes the acid from the acid mine drainage of pre-law we can do that relatively simple you dump a few loads of the sand in the watershed and it does its work pretty much all by itself a little more intensive would be the installation of dosers we've done this in three forks creek and by strategically placing dosers where the heaviest loads of the acid entering the streams are we're able to increase the ph restore the aquatic life for hundreds of miles of stream in that three forks drainage even more intensive as far as operation and maintenance would be the a facility such as the tnt treatment plant the tnt mine was a pre-law mine it it discharges a tremendous amount of low ph water high metals water into muddy creek we our engineers designed and constructed a wastewater treatment plant that's placed at the outlet of the tnt mine that water goes straight into that treatment plant but in conjunction with that we also collected all of the main aml loads from further up the watershed pipe them to that treatment facility and now all that water is discharged back into muddy creek meeting water quality standards what this has done is removed the main load of acid from the stream and now has opened up 13 miles of of the muddy creek drainage and connects it from the headwaters all the way to the cheek the mouth at the cheap river this has allowed all of that to maintain aquatic life and to the point where we're even seeing walleyes coming up from the cheap river and spawning in that area which we haven't seen since in 50 years since pre-77 thank you next we welcome commissioner alan mcveigh from the west virginia insurance commission senator manchin has heard a lot about state black lung benefits from west virginians can you share more information about state black lung benefits and any other pertinent information that west virginians need to know certainly and thank you mary and hello i'm alan mcveigh the west virginia insurance commissioner i'm happy to be participating in this event today west virginia's workers compensation system for occupational pneumoniconiosis or black lung disease allows eligible west virginia employees who have been exposed to hazardous levels of dust in the workplace to file a claim for benefits our system provides that this claim should be filed within three years from and after the last day of the last continuous period of 60 days or more during which the employee was exposed or within three years from and after a diagnosed impairment was made by a physician in the case of death the application also can be filed by the dependent of the employee within two years from and after the employee's death west virginia is unique in that we offer an objective evaluation group of physicians known as the occupational and ammoniconiosis board who evaluate each claimant who files for these in our state all timely filed claims to meet the exposure requirements are referred to the op board for pulmonary testing to determine if they have permanent respiratory impairment due to dust exposure if the claimant is found to have impairment by the op board a decision is issued the grants permanent partial disability representative of that impairment with associated medical benefits permanent partial benefits can go up to 65 percent and claimants can also petition for a permanent total disability award to their occupation occupational pneumoniconiosis in cases of profound disability medical treatment is contingent on the amount of the impairment that's found eligible survivors of west virginia employees may also file for west virginia state occupational benefits in these cases the op board refused medical information and will issue a determination as to whether or not occupational disease was a materially contributing factor to their death west virginia state black lung benefits represent a tiered system based on the impairment due to dust disease this allows workers with mild impairment to receive some payment if a worker is found to be entitled for both state and federal programs there are offset provisions applied pursuant to federal regulations many west virginia employees have filed both types of claims and the benefits are coordinated between them to make sure the claimant receives the care and payments they are entitled to that sounds like a complicated system but the top priority of our agency is to assist consumers if a consumer has any questions at all or needs assistance related to this or any other type of insurance i encourage them to contact our team and we will provide assistance we can be reached toll-free at 888-879-9842 we also have a lot of information on our web page to

programs are the lighthouse program and the fair program the lighthouse program is a personal care program that provides in-home personal care to senior 60 years of age with some deficiencies in their activities of daily living there is a suggested donation for the lighthouse program those funds donated provide additional services to additional seniors throughout west virginia those services are specified to be one-third of housekeeping services but two-thirds of those services are personal care services there's a maximum of 40 hours a month in services the second one is the fair program which is family all sizes and alzheimer's in-home respite both in home respite and we also have some congregate respite programs throughout the state in this program the client is the caregiver this is the individual that's taking care of the client that has dementia or another instance of some type of brain injury type of thing they're allowed this allows them to get a break it allows them to go out to the grocery store go out golfing go out in the yard or whatever gives them that chance to relax and rewind it also has a suggested donation and again those funds go back to provide additional services to more seniors in west virginia in the last year we provide over eight thousand eight hundred thousand units of services through those two programs the next program we have is the older americans act these are our federal administration on community living programs funds the services provided in home in that program include again personal care housekeeping home delivered meals and some chore services housekeeping in this is a is the cleaning of the home where the individual senior lives in those homes and the ensure services are those services where we may do lawn care shoveling snow heavy lifting type things uh and that one has a confidential donation the bureau also works with the bureau of medical services in in the administration of some of the agent disabled waiver programs that program provides care in-home care again it has a financial eligibility and an eligibility based upon five areas of deficiencies in the activities of daily living financially the program has a requirement in both assets and that the income is less than 300 of the social security supplemental income that program has two factions to it two options one of them is the individual provider agency the provider agency hires the staff trains the staff pays the staff and it allows them to do services such as uh in-home personal care transportation to essential errands such as groceries pharmacy banks and also allows that person to stay independent in in their home in the community it also allows some transportation in community time which allows a senior to go out to a restaurant or go out to a mall or shopping gets them out of their home meets their neighbors and allows them to be in the community and away from isolation one of the other two programs that options within that program is the personal option of partnership with public partnership where there is an agency where the senior themselves can decide what their services are not relying on an independent agency that agency hires a worker that the client may have in mind they hire the worker they administer that program on behalf of the senior and they select and hire that worker and take care all those responsibilities on behalf of that senior both of those programs are available and it's an option to the senior and both of those programs have case management services available for additional information on any of these programs that i've mentioned you can call the bureau at 304 or you can visit our website that is westfordwvseniorservices.gov thank you thank you next we welcome chairman charlotte lane from the west virginia public service commission senator manchin has heard a lot about utility terminations from west virginians can you share more information about how west virginians can go about requesting assistance with utility terminations and any other pertinent information that west virginians should know thank you i appreciate the opportunity to participate in this forum unfortunately many west virginians struggle with utility bills the first thing a customer needs to do when they receive a termination notice from their utility company is to contact west virginia 2-1-1 to see what financial assistance may be available to them just dial 2-1-1 on your phone and you will be automatically connected with someone who can assist you they should also contact their local wv office to apply for assistance such as lyhi for renters who are struggling to pay for rent or or utility bills because of financial hardship during the pandemic or due to the coronavirus you may be eligible for the west virginia rental assistance program through the west virginia housing development fund detailed information including eligibility requirements are on the west virginia housing development fund's website next the customer should contact their utility company let them know they are having problems paying their bill and need assistance they should ask the utility about setting up a deferred payment plan if after speaking with the utility the customer is still in danger of service termination they should call the public service commission at 1-800-642-8544 that's 1-800-642-8544 we have a team of consumer affairs technicians who will act as a liaison between the customer and utility company to try to help work out a solution to avoid termination thank you to all the agency representatives in an effort to ensure west virginian's questions are being answered we have invited delegates and senators for the west virginia state legislature to participate in our discussion each of them work with constituents in our state and have a really good understanding of the needs that occur within our state with that being said i'd like to share the platform with my colleague andrew robinson who actively interacts with the west virginia state legislature to welcome our west virginia senators and delegates hello everyone and welcome i'm so glad to be here to facilitate the question and answers with our legislators who are hearing from west virginians daily allow me to introduce our legislators first we have the honorable senator jack david woodrum of summers county the honorable delegate lisa zhukov of marshall county the honorable senator glenn jeffries of putin county and the honorable delegate joe statler of monongale county the senators and delegates have prepared various questions prompted by the trends in which most west virginians have contacted their offices requesting assistance now delegate statler western insurance commissioner alan mcveigh was just spoke to us and what concerns are you hearing from west virginians regarding the west virginia insurance commission thank you andrew and i'd like to first start off by thanking senator manchin and the staff for this wonderful opportunity to bring these questions to you if a constituent has worked in the coal industry at one point in their career and eventually pursued another professional opportunity in a different industry can this person still apply for black lung benefits i will be happy to answer that question for you delegate statler it's good to see you our system provides that a claim should be filed within three years from and after the last day of the last continuous period of 60 days or more during which an employee was exposed or within three years from and after a diagnosed impairment was made by a physician and that those are the trigger points for claims so they can be filed after someone leaves the industry also in the case of death an application can be filed by the dependent of the employee within two years from and after the employee's death so yes an employee can leave the mining industry go to another occupation and still be able to file claims for these benefits thank you thank you thank you sir for this answer senator woodrum we just heard from commissioner frazier from the department of division of motor vehicles what concerns are you hearing from west virginians regarding the division of motor vehicles well first let me start by thanking senator manchin for uh making it possible for for us to ask these questions for our constituents uh commissioner during the covet 19 pandemic new policies and procedures were implemented because of restricted facility access did you find that some of these policies provided a better customer experience and if so do you plan to retain these customer friendly policies as you resume normal operations thank you senator woodrum that's that's a great question in order to reopen and provide service to our citizens they needed we we had to make adjustments to the operation in all of our regional office offices first we initiated an appointment system to be able to control the flow and the amount of customers in our offices when the pandemic was at its peak we installed plexiglas for the safety of both our employees and our guests coming into the offices we provided contactless skills test exams to allow citizens to be able to get their needed driver's license we were one of the first tech states to resume skills testing and even lent a lot of guidance to other jurisdictions as how how this was accomplished we re-established the call center to to be able to uh offer services over the phone for our customers we implemented online drive driver's license driver's license knowledge testing and we implemented the electronic titling system we have kept many of these these changes such as plexiglass and the appointment system the appointment system is still in many of our offices but all of our regional offices welcome walk-ins if needed again we will be able to temporarily suspend walk-ins and still remain operational with the appointments only and not have to close any of our offices the plexiglas remains and will be a staple in all of our new offices we build going forward we resume having examiners in the vehicles with the tester to to comply with amber requirements and best practices but should there ever be any need we can revert back to that contactless skills testing temporarily or as long as we need to the call center will remain operational and we'll we will continue to continue to expand services it can offer to our citizens the online knowledge test which i'm very proud of is still available and even has been rolled out in the state school system we will continue with electronic titling system and on our way to being the first state in the nation to offer digital digital title commissioner thank you for providing this information delegate zhukov we just heard from secretary crouch from the west virginia department of health and human resources what concerns are you hearing from west virginians regarding the dhhr thank you andrew and thank you to senator manchin and his staff for hosting us today it's great to be able to ask questions that our constituents ask us for secretary crouch for our constituents who are dealing with child custody issues what services does your agency offer that can assist family members stay connected during times of transition thank you delegate zhukov taking care of our children uh is is the most difficult thing we do in the state and and the most important thing we do in the state uh i want to thank our foster families out there and our kinship families and our adoptive parents out there who've stepped up and do a great job our responsibility to them is try to provide support to them to make sure they have what they need to to to have a smooth transition with their families so we do provide what we call social necessary skills we provide transportation we provide parenting skills out there these socially necessary services are available to all of these families we also provide mental health services to to families and to children who need those as well as a tan of payments for for families who meet those criteria to make sure they have additional funding excuse me for their new families we also probably the most important thing is we have a kinship navigator who can assist families new families in going through the system and getting the care they need so we're very focused on trying to make sure that these families have what they need because they have stuff stepped up in in a way that is so important for our children in the state we also one one other final thing is we provide support to uh try to keep children uh safe as well through uh various programs medicaid programs bureau social services who who all work together to try to keep these children uh protected and safe so we thank the families thank you for your question uh delegate zukov thank you secretary crouch and thank you to your staff they have a really difficult job to do every day and we appreciate the service they provide to our west virginia families thank you for that senator glenn jeffries we've just heard from secretary jimmy riston from the western division of highways what are you hearing from west virginians in your area about the doh first of all i'd like to say thank you to senator manchin and his office for hosting and allowing us to participate in this forum mr secretary core maintenance has become a commonly used phrase by the department of highways can you explain what core maintenance entails and why it is important thank you senator jeffries for the question it's a great question it's a question that goes to the very heart of who we are with the division of highways all those men and women out there that work each and every day on those core maintenance activities are working to extend the life of our roadways to get them in good condition and keep them that way these these activities are designed to get the water away from the road if we can take care of the things that deteriorate the roadways then we will obviously we'll extend the life of these roadways all of these activities from patching the potholes to pulling the ditches to stabilizing the shoulders to cutting the canopy back so that the roadways can experience a wet and dry cycle these things are critical to the life of our roadways and to keep them in the condition that our citizens not only want but they deserve these things are worked on very diligently by the men and women in the division of highways their planned activities all of these plans are on our website we show our plan we show how much of this we accomplish our goal is to complete these plans in one three-year cycle to take care of every one of these activities for our entire roadway system that that happens to be the sixth largest highway system in the country uh we're also one of four states that take care of all the roadways in west virginia in our state so west virginia is is we've got a big job here and we've got really good people working really hard to do it and those car activities has taken us back to our routes to where we can extend the life and get get those 36 000 miles of roadway ready to pave and once they're paved that payment will last a great deal longer than we've seen in the past the under investment that we've seen in infrastructure across the country has has shown up in the quality of our roadway and the citizens have noticed i think they're starting to notice that the core activities that we're performing are making a difference we experience many many floods in west virginia uh we're seeing less and less damage from those flooded areas in particular the uh the isolated floods where we really get hit hard in a really a lot of rain in a very short period of time by having those ditches full where they can handle that runoff by having the pipes replaced and in good shape having those canopies cut back to where that water can get away from the roadway and go to where it belongs it's certainly saving the state tons of money i hope that answers your question but uh this this is who we are the division of highways first and foremost is a maintenance organization senator woodrum we heard from commissioner roswell about hot topics and all the programs that are available in the bureau of senior services what have you been hearing from west virginians regarding the bureau of senior services thank you the west virginia bureau of senior services operates the state health insurance assistance program which is commonly known as ship that is designed to provide up-to-date information to medicare beneficiaries and their families commissioner can you describe what kind of services and information you provide through the state health insurance assistance program to medicare beneficiaries and their families yes senator woodrum appreciate the opportunity to give you more information available for your constituents it does stand for the state health insurance assistance program it is a program administered by uh the community living administration of the uh and part of the acl uh if the objective is to provide confidential help uh and free of an objective to beneficiaries of medicare and their families it includes one-on-one assistance and outreach out into the community the purpose is to empower the seniors and medicare recipients educate and assist the individuals and their families and their caregivers to make informed decisions about health care and to optimize and maximize the benefits available to them there are counselors throughout west virginia the state provides support to medicare beneficiaries helping them become eligible for medicare as well as understanding how medicare works with other insurances such as employer insurance medicaid coverage and learn what merit medicare options are available ship also helps to screen for low-income assistance programs and to help medicare costs and works to resolve problems on behalf of the beneficiary and their medicare coverage and that working to solve problems is a big part of what we do not just getting them on the programs and eligibility ship counselors also receive training from the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the administration for community living our counselors are both paid counselors staff of the bureau in-kind counselors and we also have volunteer counselors we can provide you additional information on ship by contacting our toll-free number at 1-877-4463 or you can contact the local senior center who also has ship counselors and we also have the aging disability resource centers and you can contact them by calling online at wbnavigate.com i hope that helps you with your questions commissioner thank you for providing us this very important information delegate zhukov we heard from chairwoman charlotte lane from the west virginia public service commission what have you been hearing from your constituents regarding the public service commission as you know rural areas across the state of west virginia lack cell phone service what recommendations do you have for constituents who need emergency services when frontier landline services are not available thank you delegates delegate zhukov this keeps me up at night i wish i had an easy answer people living in rural west virginia often don't have cell phone service at their homes when their landline phone service goes out they have absolutely no other option other than to get in their car and drive miles to wherever they can pick up a cell signal when the cell when the call they need to make is to emergency medical services every second counts this is not acceptable that is why the public service commission can has continued to demand that frontier reinvest in their copper network and maintain service to rural west virginia we have told the company these continued extended outages must stop lives depend on it frontier's investment in building out its fiber network and expanding high-speed internet is important but we cannot allow them to continue to shortchange our rural customers thank you so much and thanks for the help that your agency gives us um all the time for these type of issues we appreciate you very much thank you elliot statler we heard from deputy secretary scott manderola from the department of environmental protection what have you been hearing from your constituents regarding the dep thank you andrew when looking to implement infrastructure tactics such as the rodent projects permits are required to be obtained through the dep before a project is to be initiated what is the time period for these permits to be processed thank you delegate for that important question um time frames are a very big concern for us particularly for the infrastructure money because the last thing we want as an agency is for our permits to hold up or stop the spending of infrastructure money the main permits that are required for things like road projects sewer line projects are going to be storm water construction permits and currently if you're disturbing more than one acre and the time period for the construction is less than one year and you're not disturbing over a hundred acres then it's a it's a 45 to 90 day time frame to issue that stormwater construction permit because it would not need to go out to public notice if you're disturbing more than 100 acres or it's going to take more than one year which most of these infrastructure projects would be in the latter category then issuance of those permits is statutorily determined to be no more than 180 days depending on the how complicated in nature the permit is we often get them out before that but we have to get them out within 180 days the other type of certification or permit that the agency needs to issue for these type of projects would be called a 401 water quality certification now this is a state certification that's required to go along with a core of engineers 404 permit if they are if there is work that's going to be done somewhere in a water of the u.s and often bridge projects road projects would be crossing streams so they would be involved in that now the corps of engineers has determined that a reasonable period of time to issue these certifications for the state is 60 days they often will extend that to 180 days but more typically we are trying to issue these within 60 day time frame again the last thing we want to do is slow down the spending of infrastructure money um it's very important to us as an agency not to be the cause of any money being left on the table for the state of west virginia thank you again for your question thank you very much for the answer on this important issue senator glenn jeffries secretary crouch has provided helpful information regarding his agency what additional questions do you have for the secretary thank you andrew mr secretary i routinely receive phone calls from worried family members even citizens suffering from substance abuse needing help as everyone knows west virginia is ranked number one in issues dealing with substance abuse and has been has been for a number of years now as a state we have tried almost everything with some support from loca from the federal government however i believe it's time we try everything every new program every new idea every new model that the federal government believes could work to address recovery re-entry generally getting people back on their feet can you explain what programs models or ideas you have which would be implemented in west virginia to address this crisis yeah thank you senator jeffries that this is a huge priority for for dhhr for the state of west virginia in 2017 we were number one in the country per capita in overdose deaths the legislature we submitted a piece of legislation to create the office of drug control policy in 2017 and began a real concerted effort to tackle this problem uh the following year our overdose deaths reduced by 22 the year after that our overdose tests reduced 13 then the pandemic hit and the isolation and the lack of support systems out there for individuals who who had substance use disorder problems was significant uh overdose deaths soared across the country and in west virginia we are i believe now back on track and and attempting to follow as you said uh all of the best practices out there throughout the the country uh one of the things that the legislature does and they've been a great partner with us is to create the ryan brown fund which was uh which was done by the legislature to provide funding uh to to direct funding to increase the number of treatment beds in the state of west virginia we now have over 1200 treatment beds in the state we've also increased recovery bets in the state where we have the ability to move folks from treatment into recovery and then into outpatient services first thing we have to do to reduce overdose tests is provide naloxone throughout the state and we have done that pushed millions of dollars with naloxone out to to our first responders out there and our providers and our folks at the local level we've created quick response teams which go out to homes uh for individuals who have overdosed and convinced them and that takes some time to get into a treatment program that's because that's becoming uh much broader throughout the state i believe we're in 35 counties now we're pushing that very hard that is being that is showing a great success as well we have lead programs law enforcement diversion programs where we get people into treatment uh as quickly as possible um that we have a regional uh overdose i'm sorry uh office of drug control policy staff to help these folks who who overdose and to go out and to try to reduce these numbers the another thing legislature did was develop treatment courts that we are seeing as huge with regard to another way to to deal with this problem throughout the state and and finally one of the things i i'm really proud of is we're assisting a program called game changers to try to go into schools and make sure our children don't start drugs and then that they understand uh the the the complications with that and the outcomes related to that so we're really looking at education here with regard to our children trying to make sure we we we fix this problem in west virginia so we are tackling this from every angle possible and we're actually seeing some good results in terms of leveling off some of these numbers in west virginia right now versus the national level so uh so thank you for the question uh senator jeffries

south dakota republican senator mike rounds is a member of the armed services and foreign relations committees and he joins us now senator obviously a lot of moving parts a lot of opaqueness here too for the american public i'm hoping you can give us a better glimpse of what's happening here what we know is that mr putin right now is in charge of his own schedule we are not this has been going on since last march he's continued to make his build up it's unfortunate that we find ourselves as a nation in the position of offering diplomacy but not being in as strong a position as we should be with regard to providing defensive capabilities uh to the ukrainians senator you mentioned last march and then our our position it seems like we're trying to catch up i wasn't aware that this the origins of this go back that far and if that's the case why aren't we why haven't we been prepared better why weren't we over there helping to train uh more effectively why weren't we giving them or selling that's the sort of systems that would allow the ukrainian people to defend themselves more effectively i think mr biden has had his focus in other areas uh the fact that he was working on getting out of afghanistan in the meantime he's been working on his own domestic policies here at home and right now i think mr putin has followed this whole thing and he's decided that this is the right time in which he can push his agenda and unfortunately we're not doing as much as we could be doing without actually encumbering any of our uh troops just to give you an example if we would have started with our defensive capabilities in ukraine earlier that might have made mr mr putin rethink whether or not it was worthwhile uh to actually come in and attack them knowing that he could have loss of life that was greater than what he wanted second of all right now as you know we've had in the united states a change in our heart with regard to being a a producer of energy and beginning with mr biden stepping in and shutting down pipelines deciding that he didn't want to do oil and gas leases on federal lands that sent a sen a message to the the crude oil or at least to the markets that they're going to have to increase the price on crude oil which right now as you know has resulted in significant increases to the american public over 40 percent increases due to inflation on the supply side with regard to to petroleum the same thing impacts russia except on the other side mr putin gets more for his products right now if we opened up production again and we said immediately let's go on out let's open production up again let's start being a producer again that would drop the price and it would give mr putin less dollars less money to actually use to fund his armies senator along the lines of that uh one question being asked today is about north stream two and if we can in fact trust the germans to shut down the pipeline if there's a russian invasion where does this stand right now my understanding in talking with other members who have actually spoken with uh german officials they have very little doubt but that the germany would shut down that pipeline that's the information i'm receiving uh personally from other members and i tend to believe them because i think germany right now is recognizing that mr putin has to be stopped he has to have a very very strong message sent or otherwise he's going to do it again europe needs to have peace if they're going to thrive i don't think germany wants war more any more than anybody else does i don't think anybody wants to have war and i think part of that sends a message to mr putin that if he does this all hell is going to break out but it's going to be economic hell and it's going to be one that's going to really hurt his country badly and there's going to be pain and suffering don't get me wrong there's pain and suffering on our part of it as well when you do sanctions you're telling your own business people that they can't do business financial services are going to hurt but germany clearly i believe understands how serious this is as their neighbors are being attacked or at least threatened at this point hopefully mr putin still has time to back off but it's getting closer to the point where he's going to have to make a decision he's got some front line troops on there that they normally don't allow to deploy they go back in and train again but they don't leave them on the front lines very long unless they're going to use them senator rounds thank you very much really appreciate it thank you

we now turn two questions and i'd like to begin uh by once again acknowledging that tomorrow marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of daca and as we have acknowledged daca has allowed thousands of young people to come out of the shadows and gain access to work authorization and driver's licenses daca's protections opened up opportunities for these children who had grown up in the united states to pursue paths that previously seemed impossible so many daca recipients like dr larios now adults in their 20s and 30s who grew up in the us and have gone on to contribute greatly to their communities these dreamers are unmistakably american in every way except citizenship but like dr larios they live in constant fear and uncertainty about their future and that's because of congress's failure 10 years later to provide daca recipients and dreamers with legal status and a pathway to citizenship it's well past time for us in the senate to pass the dream and promise act and to ensure that dreamers like dr larios are able to stay permanently in this country that is their home dr larios like to begin by thanking you again for sharing your story with us and particularly noting that uh you mentioned that you're the only one in your family between your parents and your siblings that is undocumented can you tell us what daca's 10th anniversary means to you and how having daca has impacted your life specifically in access to higher education yes thank you very much for the question um senator yeah for me when i think of the 10th anniversary of daca it really reminds us of what is possible when we give undocumented youth the opportunity to truly thrive to be integrated into their communities to be able to give back it has taken a village to allow daca to continue standing today many members of congress in this room have stood by daca and have supported the advocacy efforts of undocumented youth across the country we have had to fight for our lives time and time again especially when the program has been challenged at state and national levels and although i'm proud that the program continues to stand today i'm disappointed that even after a decade our futures are still uncertain and our anxieties around deportation have not been abated i shared earlier in my testimony that i could not have become a doctor without the protections of daca and i stand fully by that statement accessing an advanced degree especially in medicine requires a work permit it requires a functional social security number medical institutions want to know that when you admit students they can complete fully their training and we have to undergo vetting through background checks to work in va centers and hospitals across the country we're required to take licensing exams that also require proper documentation and of course we have to complete residency and daca has made all these things possible for me but it is not enough to provide full security we still need permanent solution and a path to citizenship so thank you dr ladies and again for uh not just your story about your uh example and your service our country needs the best doctors and we need more particularly throughout the covet 19 pandemic you've been on the front lines not just an essential worker but a front line essential worker and i believe you deserve better than to live in fear of losing your status and your protections i want to turn to a slightly different topic now during the pandemic as mr burrella reminded us international student enrollment in schools has dropped by 21 percent but even before the pandemic we were seeing a decline in students coming here to study between 2016 and 2019 the united states saw a seven percent decrease in international student enrollment this decrease cost our economy approximately 65 000 jobs and 11.8 billion dollars however during the same time period australia saw a 45 percent increase in student enrollments and canada a 52 percent increase mr barol you testified earlier that when it comes to international students and increasing competition for global talent our losses are others gains can you explain why international students are choosing to study elsewhere over coming to the us and what we can what can we do to better attract and retain international students thank you chairman uh there are three factors that international students are mainly looking at when deciding where to go study the first is obviously the quality of the academic program of the university and the availability of their course of study particularly in advanced fields in this area the us does very well we know we have some of the best programs and the best universities in the world but two other factors are also uh in on the minds of international students one is the ease and expediency of obtaining a student visa and i really can't underscore enough how how much other countries have done to streamline their processes uh removing student interviews for example and expediting student visas again australia canada can process a student visa in four to eight weeks we're hearing from universities today that some of our students that were just admitted are getting their first in-person consular interview appointment in november 2023 so that gives you an idea of where you're going to choose where to go to college and finally students are also looking at a place where they can stay after graduation to work and contribute to that country and again we do not allow our international students a pathway currently to graduate and continue on to work and contribute to the us economy thank you

hello I'm congressman Paul Gosar representing Arizona's 4th congressional district I regret not being able to be with you this evening but I wanted to extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to all of you for your service the Army and Air National Guard are essential to the state of Arizona's safety and emergency management your service and dedication to protecting Arizona goes above and beyond answering the call of duty one of my goals for this year has been working to better honor and recognize the heroes who risk their lives defending our country that is why I started a weekly segment called military Monday to highlight the remarkable individual stories of our service members from across Arizona my office has conducted interviews with members from different branches of our military and shared their experiences and perspectives with thousands of followers on social media and in my weekly e-newsletter we have recognized seven different service members so far this year and every single one of them has continued to give back to our communities and help build a better stronger Arizona even after their careers in the military have ended example like Justin Chavez a former US Marine now working in Bullhead City at the northern Arizona veteran's Resource Center helping homeless service members or my plenary who served in the US Army before taking up a myriad of local government positions including the Prescott Valley Town Council Parks and Recreation Department and the upper Verde watershed protection coalition and then there's Joan McDermott who served in the US Army Nurse Corps now she is the commander of the VFW post 90 401 in Lake Havasu City through military Monday it is clear that service is not just some word thrown around to describe our men and women in uniform but rather it is an ideal that is firmly instilled in the hearts of everyone who has answered the call to defend the United States this service comes from protecting those who cannot defend themselves but also from protecting the men or woman standing next to you servicemen and women past and present can never be properly thanked for the dedication and sacrifices you have made to our community in return we need to be always ready and always there for each one of you it's always my greatest honor represent heroes like you in the House of Representatives thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts today and I look forward to featuring you on one of our military Mondays real soon

well thank you mr chairman uh across the congress we all talk about the provider shortages the nation is facing especially mental health providers that are available for black and latino communities and the pandemic has taken a disproportionate toll on minority communities on the provider shortage has only grown more dire more dedicated support for a larger and more diverse pediatric workforce is critical i believe to address children's mental health needs now and into the future so dr benton what are three things this committee can do to address the recruitment training retention and professional development of a diverse clinical and non-clinical pediatric mental health workforce well thank you for that question senator um it's one of the issues that i struggle with every day as a training director and as a physician um some of the things that we could do now is developing pipelines at a much younger age so in my testimony i mentioned the fifth graders interviewing me they were interviewing me about why did i become a child psychiatrist um and i was really pleased that they're asking these kind of questions in fifth grade so starting a pipeline where we're present and we're reaching out to communities of color is really important um education and destigmatizing mental health conditions in the black community and the latino community by partnering with trusted community organizations loan repayment is an incredible issue many of my physicians say i can't afford to work for you because i have loans to repay and you don't pay enough and so loan repayment for all the mental health professionals i think is important and incentives for people to choose mental health that could be part of loan repayment or some other payment measure would be really helpful and then reaching into the communities where minority populations are would be extremely important so we tend to recruit from um communities that are affiliated with academic centers we don't reach into the communities where patients are actually receiving services those are some of the things that we could do now to support diversification of our workforce well i appreciate those insights and we may reach out to you to build upon them as we explore the initiatives here uh in part of the the reason i raise this i look at the first half of 2021 alone children's hospitals reported cases of self-injury and suicide in ages 5 to 17 at a 45 higher rate than during the same time frame in 2019 and for children under 13 the suicide rate is twice that for black children than for white children so what can we do to do to reduce the likelihood of suicide in children and adolescents particularly minority you and how do we better target our resources thank you senator menendez this is um one of my areas of passion so among minoritized youth across ethnic groups the rates of suicide attempts are higher than they are among non-minority groups and one of the one of the challenges has been identification among minoritized youth and access to services that are culturally competent and or demonstration of cultural humility the data demonstrates pretty strongly that cultural culturally concordant therapists and patients have better retention and treatment and better outcomes in treatment over time and certainly it will never be the case that we will have one-to-one matching for patients by ethnic group nor am i sure that is the goal but the goal is for groups that where there's not concordance between the patient and the therapist that there be cultural humility that we train individuals to learn to inquire and understand the cultural experiences of others when we're engaged in treatment and so the training opportunity is there but it's essential because we are saying for youth across each ethnic group increasing rates of suicide while they are declining for non-might or minoritized population so it's vitally important and finally about the roughly 17 three and four year olds are expelled from their preschools each year and despite black children uh making up only about eighteen percent of the school population they make up forty percent of all expelled children and even more troubling is that within the high rate of expulsion for black toddlers is how often black boys are expelled so how can we better support training for pre-k teachers and child care providers in basic behavioral health techniques to combat bias and give these important social emotional regulation tools to children from their earliest ages and i'm happy to entertain anybody who can answer that well thank you thank you dr menendez and i would hope that dr hoover would respond as well prevention and education is key addressing bias among school personnel is essential to address this and providing more resources and supports in centers where children appear every day at daycare and in primary care with some preventive education around what's normal and abnormal development i'm sorry dr hoover i wanted to give you an opportunity to comment not at all i know the time is short i'll just quickly add that investment in early childhood mental health consultation programs across states is critical and as you alluded to culturally responsive teaching practices there's a lot of evidence to suggest that those can help in reducing discipline referrals and expulsion thank you

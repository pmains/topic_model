Mr Speaker I rise today in support of this bill in support of American families this week we've heard powerful and heartbreaking stories from families who have lost a loved one at the hands of an illegal immigrant oftentimes these individuals were able to operate freely because of the sanctuary policies of certain US cities policies that ignore federal immigration law it is time this Congress put the lies and welfare of American citizens and legal residents first it's time to protect the innocent this means not another Kate Josh Dennis Danny grant and countless others it is time to penalize cities that willfully ignore federal law to the detriment of citizens and legal residents I encourage my fellow members to read demoni from this week's Senate hearing read about the lives lost the brutality of the crimes the lack of remorse by the perpetrators and the heartbreak of the families today we have a choice protect fellow Americans or give sanctuary to criminal aliens thank you and I yield back the balance of my time

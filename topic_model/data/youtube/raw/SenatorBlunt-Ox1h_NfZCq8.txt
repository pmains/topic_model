man president today we are on the Senate floor at a time when once again we're attempting as a country to reconcile things that should have been reconciled long ago the deaths of George Floyd of Brianna Taylor of a med our brewery shocked the country outraged the country three of them in a very short period of time brought up again this division we have in our country where we look at the country and particularly look at law enforcement in two different ways the discussion I had with and have with my sons is different than the discussion that many of my african-american friends in fact as far as I know all of my african-american friends that have ever talked to me about this have with their sons with my sons I would say if you get in trouble look for a police officer that is not the police officer discussion that african-american fathers often have with their sons that discussion goes more like if you're picked up by the police do exactly what you're told until I get there and we'll straighten it out once I get there that's the two views of what happens and we see in all of these cases some reason to believe that those concerns are absolute and legitimate there's because of that I think a wide support for the protests going on around the country that our leadership stake out today on the Republican side everybody with great I think understanding and emotion and empathy talked about the importance of peaceful protest as we see these things having had happen a problem madam Speaker is that Madam President we have protest peacefully during the day that turn into violence and chaos at night the peaceful protest shouldn't become a cover for for violent activity back one of my good friends whose plans of protest marches told me today that there has never been a peaceful protest marched plan for the nighttime the nighttime is not the time for peaceful protest marching it might be the time for a candlelight visual the vigil but not not time for peaceful protests so what we see at night people who either weren't part of that daytime protesting activity or were there in the daytime so they could transition to violence and looting at night is absolutely outrageous absolutely unacceptable we saw we saw George Floyd's brother yesterday go to the place where his brother died and say if I am NOT looting if I am not rioting if I am not destroying other people's property why would you be doing that he was saying I've lost my brother and I'm not trying to destroy my neighborhood because I lost my brother I'm not trying to destroy his neighborhood because my brother is gone but we see activities happen that are just that are unacceptable on all fronts last night and st. Louis we had a four police officers shot in the line of duty in what sometime earlier in the day had been anticipated that at the City Justice Center there'd be a planned violent activity you don't manage to shoot four police officers unless you're thinking about it and normally thinking about it in advance but that's what happened fortunately those those wounds were all survivable but talked to people in the police department of st. Louis today and they had six other events last night where police were shot at during the course of the night and we need to realize that the police officers who are working the National Guard's men and women who are working are out there risking their lives trying to protect others we need to realize that when they go to work everyday the members of their family have every reason to be concerned all day every day of what might happen they don't know what door the person they they love may be asked to to knock on what car they may stop what moment may happen that makes the difficult life of being in law enforcement even more difficult we've certainly seen plenty of tragedies there in recent years - it hasn't been that long ago that police officers were being ambushed routinely and in a number of police officers killed while on duty not while they were trying to apprehend a felon but when somebody just walks up behind them in the car or on the street and their life is ended then we see the horrifying image of George Floyd's murder and we have the same fear for people in that situation and the people that they love in fact nobody should live in fear in our society of just their personal safety not the law-enforcement officers not their families not people who are peacefully protesting are people who have violated the law and are being arrested as they should be but not with the result that we saw whether that arrest was appropriate or not and no arrest is it appropriate to decide you're going to be the punishing officer as well as the resting officer and those who are in power should be held accountable those are empowered should set an example I talked this morning to the police chief in Kansas City Rick Smith who tomorrow will be joining a unity March with other leaders in the community and protesters in the community marching along with the protesters with chief Smith and other officers and other elected leaders and that's one way to begin to resolve this I'd also think Madam President having had some experience with this particular topic that the Justice Department needs to reinstate full their their full review of Department pant the pattern and practice this is something that they walked away from in recent years but in our state we've had three departments since 2014 that had a full pattern and practice review by the Justice Department at least one of those entered into a consent decree with the Department as to how they would focus in the future I think one of one of those three st. Louis County asked for the review st. Louis County the city of Ferguson st. Louis City all believed that they benefited from that review reviewing an officer or a number of officers is just often not enough so I'm encouraging the Department of Justice to get back to having one of the options on the table a full review by the Civil Rights Division or some other division in the Justice Department depending on the circumstances of not only the the procedures but also the pattern that a department may have fallen into we cannot continue over and over again to have the same thing happen as we as society try to grapple with the same exact problem this is not a new problem it is long past the time we should have figured out how to deal with it if departments need help in figuring out a deal with it that's one of the things that whether it was st. Louis or Baltimore the Justice Department shown some ability and some success in doing I hope they'll look at that again as they look at these three incidents that I mentioned it and others it is time to move forward it as well past time to move forward it's time when people should have a society that they have confidence and the institutions of the society and those who serve in law enforcement and public assistance of all kinds should also have the appreciation and respect that we should have for them and of course that's a contract where you earn that respect but you also get that respect when you've earned it as well over 99.9% of those who serve every day do

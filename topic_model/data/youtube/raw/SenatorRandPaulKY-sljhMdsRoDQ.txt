and as we've been covering a number of cities including our nation's capital continue to experience violent unrest i want to welcome senator rand paul of kentucky to get his take on related matters hi senator paul thanks for joining us today thank you thanks for having me jennifer so let me start with this you and your wife were recently victims of a mob attack in dc after last week's rnc events how are you both doing following that experience are you moving forward with pressing any charges you know i would say that we're shaken but physically unharmed but i guess a lot of people don't understand that you can be attacked by a mob surrounded by them prevented from going anywhere and that that is an attack and had the police not been there i think the attack would have continued and become violent we've all seen the images of what's happened in portland where a man was drugged from a car beaten senseless beat until he's bleeding out from his ears we saw another man who was taken from a shop trying to defend a storm beaten senseless until his body is contorted into what they call de-cerebrate prostering which is a an indication that you've had a brain injury so yes we were very concerned for that even when the police arrived and began to try to help us move because we couldn't move we were surrounded and they were hurling threats at us even when the police came we were worried that they were outnumbered but the police were very brave and i talked to the president i do believe they deserve accommodation because i think we might not have survived without the police being there and are you moving with the pressing any charges do you know if any arrests and relations have been made they're doing an investigation and i don't know enough about where the investigation lies i do think that yes you should be arrested for accosting anyone and saying they can't move and shouting threats at them you know is that something you should get 10 years in prison for no but at the very least it's disorderly conduct but i think it could also be inciting a riot it could be terrorizing somebody it could be holding somebody unlawfully there's all kinds of things that people could be charged with but i think the mayor of dc decided to do nothing basically she was offered help with the national guard but i think it's an indication when we can predict that violence might come to a city we need to be prepared and i think a large show of law and order is a way to prevent it had there been a larger showing and possibly national guard in the streets i don't think this would have happened but uh we are we're very concerned of what could happen uh still shaken by this and believe that we would have been trampled kicked in the head beaten to death had we not had the police there and we thank god that the police were there yeah that video was certainly frightening to say the least but and something i also noticed some of the people that harassed you they called on you to say brianna taylor's name when in fact you authored a bill that would ban the no knock warrant that was the type of warrants that were used that led to her death ultimately do you know if majority leader mitch mcconnell is planning to bring that up for a vote we're pushing for it but there is a certain amount of irony that i've actually authored a bill named after brianna taylor because i've had a long-standing objection to no knock raids i think they endanger our policemen who have to go in at night unannounced but they also endanger those who are inside and there have been errors sometimes it's the wrong address or sometimes someone gets caught in a crossfire this one's complicated because the people inside fired first at the police so there's a lot of things going on but i don't think we should be doing the no knock raids i had a conference call with sheriffs today from kentucky who say they've never used no knock raids so i think there's a a good idea and a good it's a good time to get reform but kind of ironic that i've been a part of this criminal justice movement even worked with president obama on these issues and yet i'm targeted and attacked and i do believe that these hoodlums would have inflicted harm on us my wife and the other two ladies that were with us so no i'm horrified by this but it's also a terrible irony that i've actually been an advocate for criminal justice reform and they're targeting me senator finally i want to get your take on this we just heard from president trump briefing the press a majority of what he spoke about at the white house right now was the violent unrest that's happening in several cities across the country specifically in portland wisconsin i have a two-part question so we've seen a self-described antifa member being accused of killing a trump supporter over the weekends at the same time there are reports showing an increase in our militia groups forming and organizing through facebook carrying out their own response to the riots issuing a call to arms what's your reaction to that portland murder by the antifa member and do you think that these militia groups are justified in their actions i think that anybody causing mayhem disorderly contact you name it they all need to be arrested now once they're arrested we need to determine whether or not they're being funded by an interstate source then it becomes a crime across state borders and that's a federal crime so yes we need to investigate this but the only way you can do it is actually by arresting people people throwing molotov cocktails people setting fires they all need to be arrested and for the more serious crimes like a molotov cocktail or arson absolutely they need to be arrested they need to be going sent away for a long time to jail setting a fire trying to kill a policeman with a molotov cocktail or others those are serious serious crimes now what would i suggest to people thinking they can you know take their law and sort of create safety by going out and themselves arm in the streets i would stay the heck away from portland i would go in the opposite direction as far as you can go from portland don't go to portland thinking you can create and make it a safe space leave flee portland get the hell out of there because it's not safe because the local people the local sheriff the local i won't say sheriff the local mayor the local governor are doing nothing about law and order there and this is the question people are going to answer in november they're going to have to decide do you want to live in a country that looks like portland basically a country that's on fire with no law and order and that's a real question that's coming because joe biden and kamala harris are not denouncing the violence in our cities they're not denouncing you know a lot of this that's led by black lives matter and if they're not going to denounce that then i think they become complicit all right senator rand paul from kentucky joining us today to discuss some of these pressing issues facing our country today thank you so much for your time we appreciate it thanks jennifer

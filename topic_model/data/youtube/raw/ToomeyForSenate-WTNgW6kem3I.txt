please welcome to good day philadelphia representative pat toomey thank you for being here thanks for having me good to see you barack obama in your area today he is high valley allentown it's terrific i'm glad he's going to be in the valley i'm glad he's going to be in pennsylvania will you go up for his visit no i won't be participating in the visit okay let's talk about jobs that's what he's going to be talking about now in town in the lehigh valley today he says yesterday one of his greatest fears is that we will not close this unemployment gap how would you close the gap how do you create jobs and that's got to be the number one priority so i'm glad he's focusing on this i hope it becomes a priority i would say a few things number one let's end the bailouts of failing companies this does not create jobs this perpetuates failing enterprises number two let's rescind the unspent money from the stimulus bill that clearly is not creating jobs while unemployment rate is going up over 10 percent let's put some limits on federal spending because we can't borrow and spend our way to prosperity with that savings i would suggest we do two things reduce our deficits and lower payroll taxes lowering payroll taxes gives every worker a take-home pay raise on day one and it lowers the cost for employers to hire the next worker that'll create jobs but some of the stimulus money is being paid back some of it is bank of america says yes the tarp money uh bank of america one bank says we're going to try to pay this back now yeah and that's a good development i think we should terminate the tarp program some of that money was never invested in the first place good let's not do it and then let's have an expedited process by which we get the funds back as quickly as we reasonably can from those banks that took it so that we can use that money to pay down deficits and as i say lower payroll taxes to create jobs you know the president's plan for afghanistan is basically a platform for anyone who's running for any office to kind of make a headline and the headline that i read from your remarks is that you're republican running for u.s senate right you like his plan though you're not quick to jump all over it you know i think the president had a very very tough decision to make when you're talking about war and peace and sending you know men and women into harm's way that's a very tough call i think the president probably made the right call under very difficult circumstances i'm going to support his decision in afghanistan but you know he talks a lot about the inattention that afghanistan had during the bush administration all those years but you say his inattention to iran maybe is even more startling what worries me about iran is we have this process of just perpetual negotiations and discussion and what's clear is that the regime in iran intends to develop nuclear weapons and i think that's completely unambiguous they have violated all kinds of commitments u n protocols u n agreements so i just think we should take the most uh aggressive sanctions economic sanctions we should be very firm we shouldn't give them any more deadlines we shouldn't prolong this because all they need is time to develop the technology to build nuclear weapons so so we should have the the most strenuous economic sanctions we can impose now you know down in washington they are debating the health care reform plan a lot of language a lot of legal mumbo jumbo but here in philadelphia you just heard over at children's hospital there are workers that have been told that they will be fired if they don't take a seasonal flu vaccine what do you make of that you know this is the first i've heard of that and it strikes me as very surprising but i have to tell you candidly i'm not familiar with the uh the the logic behind that so i'd want to understand that before i well it's the first time in their history they have done it and we're gonna have dr mike in just a little bit to discuss this debate this because it is somewhat controversial it's pretty surprising they just feel that they can keep their patients safe if everybody is inoculated yeah yeah and i think just that's one of the sorry just to say that that's one of the things that people are debating with the health care are we going to be forced into making decisions that may not be this health care bill goes in the wrong direction all kinds of mandates over a trillion dollars of new spending all kinds of taxes even on workers on employers on employees it'll be a job killing bill the latest polls show that by a little bit of a margin people want that public option the more they learn about it they'll understand that it'll drive them off the private coverage that they're satisfied with and that that's not a good option good to see you thanks very much

joining me now from Pittsburgh congressman Tim Murphy and in Los Angeles congresswoman grace Napolitano thank you so much for being here this morning and obviously you're here because both of you have shown an interest throughout your careers in mental illness and in remedies that might kind of ease the struggles of so many what I'm wondering is if you look at policy making in Washington and policy makers do you see the same kind of dedication that you have anyplace else across the political spectrum most certainly not candy unfortunately it does not hit the radioscope in Washington are almost in any state house and I can tell you I've been on this for over 20 some odd years and it's always something you don't talk about you don't discuss because of the stigma and I think we need to address that heavily congressman Murphy and your and your former life you were a child psychologist so you're you come to this with a good deal of expertise as well as a politician there is no constituency here that votes and isn't that the problem actually the the constituency are the parents those with mental illness and they're everybody else in society this is something we have to pay attention to look as we're trying to piece together what happened in Arizona unfortunately people are going at the low-hanging fruit and they're blaming a political discourse which may have some role in in the in the underlying aspects here but we also need to look at em there'll be other things that come out the music the video games the social ways of people handle anger but it goes up to these other levels too in terms of our we acknowledging and appropriately treating mental illness and in the case like this are there also aspects of drug abuse which by the way are the most predictive of violent behavior now members of Congress hopefully will be motivated by this as will people in the state houses and state Senate's to look carefully at their mental health systems and their involuntary commitment system laws and make some determinations do we need to do some things so that these things can be prevented in the future okay congresswoman to be totally honest here there's no more money in the budget and I find impossible the notion that state houses who have cut billions nationwide out of services where the mentally ill or that the federal government is going to pony up any more money you are so right and unfortunately it's not something that we focus on or that brings votes as you've heard before these youngsters don't vote the parents there's not been enough cohesive enough to be able to say to them treat it like the illness it is you do diabetes you do a as may you do heart disease but you do not do mental health and unfortunately that has been the case for many many decades and I think we need to begin to impress upon both the state and federal governments the urgency of this because every time there's a tragedy there's a lot of hoopla for a month too much dice dunk goes away everybody forgets about it and we're on to the next thing and because congressman Murphy we're not talking about a and again we we have not officially diagnosed this man but it appears to all the professionals to have been suffering from schizophrenia having said that whatever his illness was if he had one we're not talk about one man we are talking about one man who shot 20 people killed six of them and all of the friends and the family and all of those and a country in this case affected by this why is it so hard to get people to focus on it well let's look at a couple things at one is that we don't know if things would have been different if we could have prevented this tragedy we do know that appropriate and timely mental health treatment has prevented tragedies and will prevent tragedies part of what Congress needs to do is look at this as we do we put money into things and resources need to understand when you have a chronic illness you're twice as likely to have an accompanying mental illness when you treat that mental illness you can reduce health care costs massively and this is what we need to be looking at not just where we spend resources but where we save resources unfortunately also the system that can personal budget office always scores things in terms of how much money is spent but never scores things in terms of how much money is saved but I believe this issue has touched the hearts of so many members of Congress who are constantly stopping me and saying is there something else we could have done is there something else we can do and i believe so by over by looking at some of the laws here and looking at some of the ways we do have health care spending and we are looking at the aspects of mental illness as a treatable thing about if we have to pay attention to those things let me i want to show you a quinnipiac poll that came out that that Baxter was out in the field between the tenth and eleventh of January I and the question was what do you think is the main reason for the Arizona shooting forty percent said it couldn't have been prevented twenty-three percent said the mental health system fifteen percent said political rhetoric nine percent said gun laws when you look at that can you tell me for see you congresswoman Napolitano where do you stand on this what do you think is the main reason behind this shooting I think the ability for the parents to be able to get their children he'll know where to turn to know what the symptoms are maybe to the education institution to be able to help them understand what their roles should have been tore should be the friends to be able to cause somebody be able to not hide this anymore because if there were warning signs and people didn't know that they couldn't step forward and be able to help this individual I believe I don't think it was political I think we are political entities and we are target's we've received threats in my office you tend to take those minimally because if you're scared then you shouldn't get in politics it's one of those areas where I believe that we are not informing and educating the public enough to be able to help them make the decisions to help those that they love and I'm not saying it would have prevented it but it certainly would have been able to have as Tim is so eloquently stated help for this individual before it got to this point all this it's not something that happened yesterday it's been going on for years congressman Murphy when you a little earlier you said that you sense among your colleagues who have come to ins and what else could we have done let's take the money off the table because I think we're all realest here what else could Congress do other than increase funding for states to provide services is there something else is there a change in the law that's needed here is there something else you could do I think there's a lot of things the states can do what although what grace and I want to do and perhaps in the Energy and Commerce Committee which I serve do some hearings and go through this piece by piece I think there's some things in state laws and questions of were they applied in federal laws in particular the involuntary outpatient commitment law the arizona has a something that states ought to be taking a look at if this if this rose to the level for the school to say they needed to contact police on campus or other places to have this case review to bring this attention appearance the question becomes why wasn't the next step taken for involuntary outpatient commitment why was not the step taken to have this young man evaluated this is a question of schools all of the country and parents over the country are asking should they go that next step but there are things that can be done and these are legal procedures that can't take place that's something i want to know where things stand on state and federal level with can be done but in generally the federal government does not get involved in these involuntary commitment cases unless there's an actual threat of contacting about a federal employee but we do want to know what happens and what else we can do in the federal level to provide assistance congressman Tim Murphy congresswoman grace Napolitano thank you so much both of you for your time we will be watching those hearings thank you okay thank you candy

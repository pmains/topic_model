the irs admits to targeting more than just conservative groups the irs and wereful trying to soften the impact of the irs conduct by calling it not unlawful targeting but inappropriate screening methods somebody just a bunch of comedians are they serious senator lindsey graham joins i love it how it's sort of this softening term that they use yeah well here's the big picture who did they pick and why they picked people who were criticizing the president that says all you need to know is no accident they picked conservative groups tea party groups who were given obama a hard time on many fronts particularly obamacare to think any other to reach another conclusion is absurd well you know what i think it's a fact i guess they have to do some sort of internal review but the first report to come out is where they're looking at themselves and runs in the honor system in fifth grade when we all got on the honor roll because we're on the honor system i mean it's like you know the irs investigating the irs and we're supposed to like oh wow a report take this one seriously boy remember the bush days when everything that could be investigated by an independent group was asked to be investigated by senator obama what happened to this most transparent ethical administration in the history of mankind starting with obamacare that passed under the cover of darkness and every benghazi have you heard from any survivors i haven't heard from any of the survivors i have not but let's go on to something else um you wrote a letter to the ambassador um a russian ambassador united states and you basically threatened that the reset relations between the russia russia and united states are in serious jeopardy we've now got china thumbing its nose at us and now russia about snowden well i think this is exhibit of a exhibit a of how far we've fallen as a nation in the eyes of the world our friends are unsure about us and our enemies no longer fear us and seems nobody respects us as do snowden he is not a patriot he is not a hero he betrayed his country he's under indictment under the rule of law these countries have an obligation if they want to be part of the family nations to return this man for prosecution but this says a lot about president obama in the eyes of our adversaries and really the world in general and uh it's how far we have fallen well the hong kong says that the doj they asked them for more documentation they didn't get of our justice fire i couldn't figure out how to detain someone that's what i mean first we hire a 29 year old and with who has access to security stuff then we know where he goes and we can't even get them well we've got a lot of incompetency i'll be the first to admit that and some of it's not just not a competency that a lot of these folks in obama administration are up to no good but i don't buy the idea that the chinese or the people in hong kong that we didn't dot the eyes and cross the t's they didn't want to help and god knows what he's given to the chinese and now to the russians so to anybody to suggest this guy some kind of makes america a better place based on what he did it makes us more dangerous i mean america is a more dangerous place because of what he's doing except for the nsa chief said there's going to give us 50 instances of how it's jeopardizing well that was supposed to be last week we still haven't gotten it so it's very hard if we're now on monday we're supposed to get last week we haven't gotten the 50 instances it's sort of hard for us to believe on faith that that we're getting to tell you this it's a good thing to monitor terrorist phone calls and emails and we have found a lot about what they were up to and you're not going to stop these guys unless you they don't mind dying and they don't mind taking you with them but prove it to us i mean don't say you're going to give it don't i mean he says he's going to give us this information he doesn't so it just makes it more unbelievable the program may be destroyed already and you know what what damage has been done by this guy that was even a bad thing a lot of american people a lot of people are horrified about what snowden did a lot of people are horrified about what the snow did but they also wonder about nsa well all i can tell you the nsa program is designed to monitor terrorist phone calls and emails and and when they call somebody or an email is sent within the united states you have to get a warrant but here's what i don't understand and more likely the guy in yemen was talking to a major in the united states army major assange they were conversing with each other and we missed that so that's another example i mean so you're trying to tell me that this was such a great program that has been that has been you know uh that has been thwarted and we've got boston we've got this we've got an awful lot of failures and you've got the head of nsa saying i'm gonna give you 50 instances and we haven't gotten well here's what i think i think the program is necessary i think it's legal i think it has helped but we're still too politically correct any time a major in the united states army is talking to a person on the kill list a leader of al qaeda in yemen who happens to be an american citizen i want to know about it all right what's this reset is the reset really an issue that you're telling okay hillary clinton hillary clinton and barack obama came into office never going to clean up the world after bush bush was this big ogre it made the world a very bad place and obama was going to give speeches and hillary is going to reset with the russians well that we have reset with the russians we're in 1965. who would you pick in a stare down contest between putin and obama where would you place your money secretary uh um clinton did she really reset relations with russia what happened in magazine who changed the talking points this administration's foreign policy is a failure our enemies have absolutely no respect for us if you wanted to understand how relationships are between russia the united states and china snowden tells you all you need to know they have failed uh in securing our national security and securing us as a nation they have failed to earn respect bush made his mistakes but the biggest mistake of all for the president united states to tell people we're going to do something like red lines and not do it senator nice to see you always nice to see you thank you now to

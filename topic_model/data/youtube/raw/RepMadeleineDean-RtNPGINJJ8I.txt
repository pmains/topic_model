now as promised to one of the newly appointed impeachment managers by speaker pelosi congresswoman madeline dean thank you for joining me tonight thank you ari for having me on uh you have been picked for this important post at this time what does the impeachment in your view achieve and what is your approach to what will be the second senate trial of donald trump well again i i find this to be an extraordinary honor it's a solemn duty and i'm honored that the speaker asked me to join the impeachment manager's team that will be led by jamie raskin at this incredible time in our history uh you know what gene robinson said it's so simply and it was an expression i used over and over on wednesday the 6th before the attack on the capitol i was up in the gallery standing next to dean phillips and i said do they see that they have taken this too far it's so dangerous they've taken it too far and then when i was escorted to the secure room where i spent four hours i talked to republican leaders i use that same expression they've taken it too far so what have we achieved sadly by voting to impeach this president a second time you know what it is it is an indictment of the high crimes and misdemeanors that this president is guilty of an attack literally on our country and now we will take it over to the senate where the case will be tried i hope that we will convict and i say that with a heartbreak that we will convict this president uh to forever mark him as someone who was guilty of inciting an attack on our own country speaker pelosi has put her confidence in you i mentioned at this time you'll be making this case to the senate it's a deliberative body in every sense and the constitutional founders wanted these senators of course to make this judgment and knowing that they have constituents so you'll be making this case to the nation i want to note lisa murkowski is a one senator who says now donald trump's words incited violence which led to the injury and deaths of americans as a republican senator she says unlawful actions cannot go without consequence the house has responded swiftly and i believe appropriately with impeachment as a senate juror she would seem to be someone that is open to the case you'll make you'll also be presenting to people who have been really strong trump allies regardless of anything that seems to have occurred take a listen to senator lindsey graham we impeach the president today today without any evidence it's just sheer hatred if this becomes the norm be careful what you wish for today under this theory the radical left if you can impeach a president after they're out of office why don't we impeach george washington he owns slaves the logical a fact check is simple i was just going to say the logic on it is well george washington's dead donald trump right now has the legal option to run for president again unless the senate decides differently under the constitution but i give you the floor to both respond to that and more broadly how will you appeal to try to win over these basically republican senators you would need you'll be making the case to bar trump from office lindsey graham knows better he knows that the evidence is sadly right before the american public the president is on videotape on phone call on tweet after tweet inciting riling up and radicalizing a base he played on bigotry fear ignorance smear or political gain not based on truth lindsey graham knows better and he also understands that what we did to impeach is an indictment the evidence comes in in the trial so mr graham senator graham be open for this trial be open for the evidence and the facts that are right before your very face and you too have been complicit in lying to the american public i'm a i'm a lawyer in my early training but i was also a professor of writing and rhetoric and ethic and so i think a lot about audience our audience are those senators our audience is also the american public the american public knows what happened on wednesday was the culmination of a pattern of behavior of incitement and lies the power of words and lies to to have people go to the capitol they wanted to assassinate the speaker they wanted to hang the vice president this was a bipartisan attack on the country they wanted to assassinate the speaker the vice president hunt down members of congress and they didn't mind killing people in their wake yeah uh it's it's important the case you're about to make this is a as serious as it gets uh we we hope to call on you again and hope you'll within your busy schedule perhaps return and i'll be asking you and others to really make sure the country understands the difference between the criminal standard you are not going into the senate advocating the immediate jailing or incarceration of donald trump and the constitutional standard which is is there enough evidence here that it would be in the in the public safety interest united states to bar this person from holding these powers again that is the core question um as lawyers we know that and and i know that we'll continue the dialogue thank you congresswoman dean thank you for having me art thank you uh coming up we have our shortest break just 30 seconds new reports from the fbi on the white supremacists who showed up also new evidence that we're gathering from the rioters themselves

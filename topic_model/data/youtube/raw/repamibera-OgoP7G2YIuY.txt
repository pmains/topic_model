a chef now as one of the few physicians in Congress you know I do have a real interest in global health and looking at the the current threat of Zika virus you know we're grateful to have dr. Frieden and dr. facci and representatives of USAID in committee a few weeks ago as we're looking at Zeke and as we're gathering you know information I know the president's requested one point eight billion dollars the one thing as a physician you know we know and very much so we're recommending if you're pregnant if you're a reproductive age to take all precautions obviously the one thing that we do know is making access to full family planning services available in areas where we know there's endemic Zika and you know within USA IDs purview within the 1.8 billion dollar requests I'd be curious again the one thing is empowering women of childbearing age to have full family planning support services whether that's some birth control whether that's you know we're seeing increasing cases of sexually transmitted Zika virus as well so you know I'd be curious and I would want to make sure that we are providing the full resources in these endemic countries we are doing an enormous amount congressman and I really appreciate the expertise you bring as a physician and your concern about this the president is extremely focused on the Zika virus challenge the White House National Security Council is actually coordinating the all of government response on this and together with the World Health Organization with whom we are working very closely and its regional offices for the Americas for the Panama for the pen american health organization we're working with relevant international organizations and others the president has emphasized the need to accelerate researcher efforts to make better diagnostic tests available to develop vaccines Edison's improve mosquito control measures and ensure that all citizens have the information that they need in order to be able to deal with the virus so we are using multiple lines of effort an all-out effort we do not want this obviously to become as challenging as Ebola was and as you know we mounted a response to that and the same kind of effort is being put

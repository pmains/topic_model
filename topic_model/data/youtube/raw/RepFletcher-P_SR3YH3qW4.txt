i rise today in support of the fair act i've heard some of the debate in this chamber today and as a litigator i i disagree the fair act is about restoring justice for the american people it is for consumers it is for workers it is for small business people it is for people whose civil rights have been violated it is for millions of americans who are denied their right to seek justice and accountability because of forced arbitration there's certainly a role for arbitration of disputes and other forms of alternative dispute resolution in our system of justice i know this from my own experience representing individuals and organizations in the courts and before arbitrators but the fair act is important because it recognizes the role arbitration can play in resolving disputes and it also recognizes that it can play that in disputes between willing parties while it recognizes the fundamental rights of people who've been subjected to arbitration agreements without their true consent the fair act protects the freedom to contract the freedom of choice and the freedom granted in our constitution including the seventh amendment for these reasons i urge my colleagues to vote yes and i yield back

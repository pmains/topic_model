Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in support of the 2015 national defense authorization agreement this house will consider later this week I am very proud to represent Fort Hood the largest military base in the world on November fifth two thousand nine five years ago our communities suffered an unthinkable tragedy when a radicalized Islamic extremists name that Alice on opened fire on Fort Hood and fatally shot 15 million women and one unborn child more than 30 others were wounded that day Hassan's radicalization was well known to the FBI and the DoD as early as 2005 Hassan plotted with the known terrorists Anwar al-awlaki and expressed his radical views to his classmates this administration dismissed these concerns in the names of political correctness five years ago the president promised to take care of the victims of this shooting but shortly thereafter he turned his back on them and declared the attack to be work force force violence these victims and their families are still waiting for justice our communities has suffered long enough in the name of political correctness I'm very proud that my colleagues in the house is that according to senator Cruz have not dropped the ball we have stood for Fort Hood community and the victims of this terrorist act even as the president failure to act the House and Senate have agreed on this legislation that that they will allow these heroes to receive the purple hearts and make them eligible for the benefits they deserve the victims and their families will soon receive justice and closure I'm proud to support this legislation and I'd like to yield the remainder of my time to my strong partner in this effort Roger Williams of Texas I want to thank my colleague congressman john carter for his words but more importantly for the many years of hard work he has put forward to care for the soldiers at Fort Hood mr. speaker the 2009 terrorist attack at fort hood was an unthinkable tragedy at that time it was the only story the news reported for days who was this murder why did he do it could there be more like him as other military installations at increased risk of this type of attack to how did we not see this coming after the attacks September 11th we asked these same questions that's the difference between workplace violence and a terrorist attack the fort hood shooter was not a diss grown in pluck his anger out on his colleagues he was a hate-filled vengeful Islamic extremists who intentionally planned the horrendous terrorist attack and carried it out with no remorse Islamic extremists like him want us to fear them every single day they want to hit us where it hurts by taking innocent American lives in waging war on our military members they have zero regard for human life not even their own that's why our response to terrorist attacks on american soil must be consistently tough precise and without hesitation at the memorial service honoring the lives of 13 americans and one unborn president obama pledged to take care of those who were injured in the families of those who killed yet five years later he has completely neglected them because president obama designated the attack workplace violence these men and women are not eligible to receive the benefits treatment compensation that combat troops killed and injured in combat zones receive the negligence has caused many injured victims to have have to pay their own pok out-of-pocket expenses for treatment costing some hundreds of thousands of dollars one victim was pulled off active duty and her paycheck went from 1400 hours a month to two hundred dollars a month and lost her military health insurance others scrape by on disability payments but still have to pay the remainder of their medical bills from their own pocket my friend sergeant Alonzo Lunsford was shot seven times but was turned away when he tried to check into an army PTSD clinic due to the fact that he was not injured in combat this is not my definition of taking care of her as heroes however the National Defense Authorization Act gives the Obama administration yet another opportunity to honor his pledge to provide for these men and women who were victims of terrorism this bicameral bipartisan bill provides authorization for awarding the Purple Heart to members of the armed forces killed or wounded in a domestic attack inspired by a foreign terrorist organization this is a common-sense solution that should have happened immediately following the attack at fort hood i want to thank chairman McKeon and again congressman Carter for their tireless work on behalf of our troops and for many of my Texas colleagues who have joined the fight to restore justice just as we United as a country after these senseless attacks let's once again unite as Americans to fight for the truth honor our fallen and demand justice for the victims of terrorism in god we trust' I yield back gentlemen psalmist

my name is susan block and i live in west hartford connecticut i'd like to share a story with you that occurred in the fall of 2008 i was an active 69 year old woman cycling in croatia having the best time being with other people who loved an active cycling life and i was aware of a symptom that just didn't feel right in my body i had always been very aware of things i was a yoga teacher i walked i was a cross-country skier and when i got back from my trip i went to the doctor who originally told me at my yearly physical that she wouldn't have a practice if everyone was as healthy as i was but she did take my symptoms seriously and had some tests done and she when i went back for the consultation she just said susan this is the most unfair news that i have to tell you and she paused and compassionately said you have ovarian cancer it was a total shock to me and to her and during that time during living in shock and disbelief i went through eight months of chemotherapy and major abdominal surgery and it took me to july of 2009 when i couldn't wait to get back to life and to be back on my bike again and and to be with family and friends and just to go back to what was my wonderful life before cancer during that time i had a wonderful two-year remission i never ever made room for cancer returning i was so busy living and it was just like this is the best and been there done that and so it was every time i went back for my checkups which was every three months i had a big smile and it was like i'm feeling great and it was even with that smile and that positive attitude that i found out in 2011 of march that my cancer had returned it was even more devastating for me the second time because i had made no room for it i was told that the drug that would give me a 70 chance of getting back into remission was a drug called doxyl and so a year ago in may may june july i was told i would need six rounds of disc drug doxel and so i began my my having the treatment for those three months may june july and when two days before my august treatment i received a call and they said don't come for your treatment because we don't have the drug and i said oh well does that mean you're getting it next week no we don't know when we're going to get the drug i didn't know what to say what do you mean that the very thing that was giving me hope that was giving me a reason to live that was extending my life buying me time was being taken away from me and i did everything on my own i made phone calls i did research i felt i've got to find doxel because for me it was like i wanted my life and i i was in shock from having the uh going having cancer again and then then i had to resort to trying to find the drug when i when i just couldn't find it anywhere after calls and research i decided that i needed to involve senator blumenthal and i wrote him a letter um and i also contacted the hartford office and talked to maureen downes and grady keith and um they were so compassionate and so willing to do whatever they could possibly do once they heard my story of how can this happen how can you be having treatment and in the middle of treatment be told that we can't finish the next three treatments and it was also not in my best interest to change drugs that is not good for the whole process um they gra maureen and the people in washington and grady they really literally dropped whatever was on their plate to research and to help me and that along with informing senator blumenthal and shortly thereafter it was probably a couple of weeks later i got a call from senator blumenthal himself who said i have some wonderful news to tell you unless you've already heard it and i hadn't and he said we will have your doxel for you next week and i literally burst into tears and had goose bumps and i still feel the emotion because it was this it was saying i'm giving you your life back and he was and they all were they were helping to give me my life which i wanted desperately um and in my letter to senator blumenthal i need to share with you that i was saying that i was speaking out for myself that was true but i was also speaking out for sister ovarian cancer people and patients other people who had other forms of cancer other people who are on other medications because i was becoming aware that other drugs were not available either and i said this is for myself this is for all the other people because we deserve what is our birthright which is our life we deserve life so thank you for listening and um i am very grateful to be back into living life once again thanks to what was done for me with the help of senator blumenthal and uh and everyone in his office thank you so much hi my name is frank clifford and i have bladder cancer three years ago i was diagnosed with it they did a cystoscopy type surgery where they didn't have to cut me open but they were able to remove the tumor it reoccurred again a year later and after removing the tumor they put me on a treatment called bcg which is a chemotherapy that's used for bladder cancer unfortunately my body has a very bad reaction to it and they had to stop the treatment a year later i was diagnosed again with a bladder tumor and it was removed and they found that a drug called mitomycin would be a very good match-up for fighting it the problem was that the mitomycin there was a nationwide shortage of this drug and this is where i learned that not only this drug but there's many many others where there's a shortage in the united states of america and i found that very hard to believe uh so i decided to try to do something myself what can i do and i asked all my friends to write to their senators and their congressmen and i received a response from senator blumenthal where he said that he was going to look into this that he was on a committee that was into studying you know what's going on with the shortages of drugs and an oversight committee that was going to look into you know why this is happening and to try to prevent it i was able to get about 60 of my friends to write to their congressmen and their senators and through their intervention i was able to get the mitomiycin treatment and i'm very grateful for it i'm in my fifth week of chemo treatment i have one more to go but there are many other people that have the same problem where they can't get the chemotherapy treatment or other drugs that are used in association with chemotherapy and i think it's really important that we find out why this is happening and try to do something about it if there was some way that there could be notification when the company was not going to be producing it that some other company then could start manufacturing it just to keep the supply up there there's a lot of people that really need this and i'm really hoping that we can get some help thank you today's measure against drug shortages recognizes that in the greatest country in the history of the world there is absolutely no excuse and it should be unacceptable that these drug shortages in workhorse medicines exist from the day that i became your united states senator i began hearing stories about how people are denied essential anesthesiology as well as cancer medicines allergy drugs because they are in short supply these drugs are workforce medicine they are life savers and so today's measure which i'm very proud to have helped to lead will provide for early notification and warning if the supply process breaks down and shortages are threatened but it's only a first step we need not only better notification warning but also public-private partnerships to make sure that there are sufficient supplies and that there are no drug shortages encouragement and incentives for industry to produce these drugs often generic sterile injectables and essentially because the profit margins on them are often so low the markets are simply not working which is why we have gray markets and price gaffing and threatened price increases skyrocketing to 700 and 800 percent raising the cost of health care generally these facts have been documented by the general accountability office and we need even stronger measures which i am pledged to achieve and i will continue work building on this first step so that we truly end drug shortages in this country i'm proud of this first step and i pledge even stronger measures you

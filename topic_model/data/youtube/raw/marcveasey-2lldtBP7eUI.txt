developing this morning Democrats in the house ramping up pressure on the Senate to act on that gun reform we've been talking about more than 200 lawmakers are signing a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urging him to call votes on two house-passed bills that would strengthen background checks for gun purchases well joining me now is Texas representative mark VC mark thank you for being here good morning so congressman you joined your colleagues in making this call to the Senate how do you think that these bills would help prevent gun violence like the ones that we've had in the last week oh these bills would help a lot I mean first of all they would enhance background checks to make it to where people couldn't go around the system to be able to purchase guns like for instance private gun sales gun shows they would in order to be able to purchase weapons through those particular platforms they would have to go through someone that has a federally licensed firearm a federally a Federal Firearms License and that would help out a lot and then the Charleston loophole that's the enhanced background check the other bill that we've already passed we've sent to the Senate and it would stop what happened in Charleston South Carolina where that particular killer was able to purchase guns just because of a glitch in the system and we've sent these to Mitch McConnell we've sent them to the to this to the Senate on the Republican side they need to take action on these now it's not going to be perfect I don't think that you can craft any perfect bill but we've just seen too many instances where people are able to go and purchase handguns legally and then be able to commit mass atrocities and that has to stop the president congressman also tweeting on Fridays serious discussions are taking place between House and Senate leadership on meaningful background checks have you been privy to this at all what can you tell us and on the Mitch McConnell point how likely is it that something will actually move forward here well you know I think that if Mitch McConnell wants to show the American public right now at a time where they really need to see his leadership the most that he's serious about this that he would bring the Senate back now to pass the two pieces of legislation that we talked about earlier he says we need to have a conversation about guns but I would say that we need to have more than a conversation we've been we've been talking a long time now we need action we need to be serious about this if you look at the polling out there even Republican support measures such as restricting assault-style weapons purchases right even Republicans overwhelmingly support background checks along with Democrats and independents and he needs to look at these numbers and he needs to get moving but our House and Senate leadership actually talking to each other to actually do something here I do believe that House and Senate leadership are talking but again it's one thing to talk we need action this is very very serious this could happen again at any time I think with these mass shootings in particular I think that they shake the psyche of the American public in ways that other killings don't because people need to feel like that their personal safety is well enough to where they can go out and go shopping and buy some groceries and if you can't do that it's going to have effects on our economy and just the way we interact with each other that will negatively impact our country congressman what do you make of the president's performance as he was there in your state this past Wednesday visiting the hospital and the subsequent campaign-style video and the thumbs-up photos that have come out yeah I was sickened when I saw the thumbs-up photo it's like he absolutely just does not live in the reality that the rest of us live in the president needs to start listening to people outside of the people that cheer moan at these rallies he needs to listen to people that have been affected by tragedies that have happened in our country whether it's shootings whether it's people that have lost everything in hurricanes he really just needs to be more conscious you know you live down in this state where 22 people right a week ago and the yes we accused shooters from your area do you think the President had the tone bright especially no I don't think that he's I don't think that he set the tone right at all it took him so long to even respond initially to the shootings I don't know what he was way four and then of course the leaders there told him that it was not a good idea for him to visit El Paso and he came anyway and gave a thumbs up picture so no I don't think that he set the right tone at all again he needs to start listening to people outside of the the people that he gets pumped up at these rallies I know that there are people inside of the White House that would like for him to change his tone of course there of us on the Democratic side that would like for him to change his tone but I think more importantly that the American public has had it they want to see a real president and not someone who is just so out of touch with reality that that they think they think they're starting their own TV show all right congressman thank you appreciate your time thank you

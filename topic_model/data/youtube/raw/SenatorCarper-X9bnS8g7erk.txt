I I think this might be might be mistaken I think this might be this first time no we SAT side-by-side and open to hearing my mistake in her great day for America I'd like to think so all right welcome to our guests and those are testifying and those who are not but we appreciate the effort of all of you to join us here here to today today's a subcommittee hearing will review the federal efforts the ongoing federal efforts to protect the public health by reducing diesel emissions and center bras gonna have about five minutes for for opening statements give or take and then it will recognize our panel of witnesses and you'll have roughly five minutes for your for your opening statements if you go a little beyond that that's okay if you go away beyond that that's that's not okay so but your entire statements will be made part of the records and we'll have a couple rounds of questions after that we just had our last vote of the day and I saw a number of Senators streaming for the exits and I don't think they were coming here it was probably smelling a what is it aviation fuel so a lot of them are probably heading home by now but we're here we're very much into what you have to say and so are other staffs a lot of staffs are actually watching on television but my colleagues and I were sent to to Washington as I'm often reminded to govern to find a common sense solutions to the challenges that they face are our nation I don't believe that Americans are especially interested in ideas that are democrat or republican they want us to come up with ideas that will work and we can all agree on to make our country even better like I like to say I think I've heard sin abrazo says in the end we're in this together and we need to figure out together how to how to get to a better place but cleaning up dirty diesel emissions provides us with an opportunity to work across the aisle and something we don't do enough by these these days and I remember when does George Voinovich sat in the seat now occupied by by Senator Barrasso and when he sat in this seat sharing the sub-committee he one day said to me you know we this is we ought to work on reducing diesel emissions in our country and they talked about how we could get a if I think a dollar for every dollar of investment we get about a $13 public benefit and he convinced me about five minutes but this is a good thing to do and we've had that we had a great success for our country a lot of bipartisan support for that and what we're doing today actually hopes to to build on that but our nation relies too heavily on diesel power to transport commuters to harvest our chops and to build our our infrastructure one of the good things we always say about the diesel engines is that they the last a long time and the bad thing about diesel engines is that they last a long time a clean diesel engines made today are reaching near zero emissions but that does nothing for the millions of engines already news they're going to be with us for 20 years and more despite new engine standards the EPA estimates that there are some 11 million diesel engines in America that are lacking the latest pollution control technology 11 million these older diesel engines amid black carbon and toxic particles which we all here today cause significant harm to the environment and to our health retrofitting or replacing older diesel engines with american-made technology can dramatically reduce diesel emissions unfortunately there are few direct economic incentives for vehicles and equipment owners to retrofit replace their old engines and programs like the diesel emission reduction act help provide the right incentives to clean up our existing diesel fleet an idea that came from my friend senator voinovich is I said earlier deira is one of the most cost-effective clean air federal programs and it does indeed provide a an economic and health benefit of some thirteen dollars for every dollar of monies that are spent through voluntary grants and through loans deira has reduced to deadly emissions save lives and employed thousands of workers who manufacture sell or who repair diesel vehicles and their components in each state it's really a a win-win-win situation the other day I was getting off the train in Delaware John and trying to rush to get to someplace on the riverfront the chase center in the riverfront for this big dinner we're having to honor outstanding school performance you just superior super stock performance in some of our schools and then I run out I wrote in my minivan trying to get to the the event and I was late and it was I didn't want to end before I got there and I pulled up trying to get to the chase on the riverfront to pull up behind a bus it was just like stuck in the road right in front of me by the place I need to turn right was just I had the bus the bus wasn't moving and the bus on the back of the bus was I sign and was one of these Chinese buses going over they you ride for five dollars and go from Boston to Philadelphia whatever got right behind his bus sitting there when I waiting for this bus into hoping it'll turn before the light turns red and what I was sitting there behind the bus and there's a diesel bus and it was heard there's a sign in the back of the bus and the sign said Double Happiness thing about that double happiness and and that when i think about about what we're doing here with with diesel emission reduction it's really triple happiness it's really triple happiness because one we can use American technology to put Americans to work we can end up by using something's already existing asset and diesels make it better and we can reduce emissions and make our American people healthy that's at the win-win-win it's also triple happiness last Congress we reauthorized add your program through 2016 we made some changes to try to improve diras effectiveness unfortunately a President's budget for fiscal year 2012 zeroed out Adira funding and although I appreciate dedication to reducing the federal deficit cutting such a successful problem doesn't make sense i like to say something's not working and we ought to make it better if it's not perfect make it better i like to say if as we allocate money to do certain things if we ought to ask the question can we get a better result for for less money but in this case with $13 a benefit for every one dollar of investment that's pretty good return as a pretty good return in this one that's hard for me to understand why the president would say no we're going to zero that program out just makes it seems counter counter intuitive but i'll continue to work with my with my colleagues with Senator Barrasso and others to ensure that this program continues to be funded at reasonable reasonable levels although a great success deer has not been able to greatly reduce emissions from our nation's construction equipment the bulldozers diggers backhoes they build our nation's infrastructure produced some twenty-five percent of america's mobile diesel emissions at risk our children who live near construction sites computers stuck in traffic and workers who operate construction equipment in fact heavy equipment operators who were exposed to diesel exhaust are forty-seven percent more likely to die from a heart attack forty-seven percent the better address his problem today I'm introducing the clean construction Act of 2011 this common-sense approach is simple in areas of poor air quality non-attainment areas of non-attainment 42.5 p.m. federal transportation projects should reduce not increase deadly diesel emissions and the clean construction act accomplish this goal by requiring just those limited places whether they're non-attainment for PM 2.5 but requires the that one percent of the cost of transportation project in a particular matter non-attainment area be used to upgrade dirty diesel equipment the bill applies solely to particulate matter non-attainment areas where significant air quality problems already exist now some will criticize this bill as diversion of transportation dollars I understand that now where I'm going to ask my colleagues to recognize that one percent of the cost of a small set of projects as a reasonable price to ensure that fewer Americans dive from diesel so it and this will do that in closing a look forward to hearing from our witnesses we look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the health impacts of diesel emissions and ways to get greater diesel emission reductions they also look forward to working with Senator Barrasso with other colleagues to reduce diesel emissions that threaten our communities and our children Sen

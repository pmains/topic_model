Madam president tomorrow Northrop Grumman and the United States Air Force will unveil the new B-21 bomber a sixth generation aircraft that will revolutionize the Air Force's long-range strike capabilities I've had the special opportunity to see the first Tales under development at Palmdale and I'm excited that this incredible feat of U.S engineering will finally be unveiled to the American public and to our adversaries it's an exciting day for the Air Force and it's a special exciting day for Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota which was chosen to be the first home Maine operating base one of the B-21 Raider Madam president we've come a long way at Ellsworth since I first came to the Senate shortly after I took office Ellsworth was recommended for closure by the department of defense's Base realignment enclosure Commission and so one of my first priorities as a U.S senator became getting Ellsworth taken off the closure list statistically speaking our odds of pulling through were not high but thanks to an all hands effort by the Congressional Delegation and state and Community leaders we won the day and we were removed from the Brack list that August and then we got right to work on building up the base so that we would never again find ourselves in the same position in 2007 the Air Force Financial Services Center opened at Ellsworth 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th attack Squadron and its command and control station for MQ-9 Reapers and in 2015 a nearly decade-long effort paid off with the quadrupling of the training airspace for the base the Powder River training complex is now the largest training air space in the continental United States and can be used for large Force exercises that draw combat aircraft from across the country and it's well suited for B-21 training this is just one of the efforts that we undertook to put Ellsworth in the best possible position to secure the B-21 mission and I'm proud that it paid off with last June's announcement that Ellsworth would become the home of the Raider Madam president the B-21 represents a significant step forward in our long-range strike capabilities and it will come not a moment too soon between chronic underfunding in a high operational Temple during the war on terror our military preparedness became seriously strained a 2013 national defense strategy Commission report warned that our nation's Readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia or China this was not just because of the wear and tear of our own forces but also because of the significant Investments being made by China and Russia in their militaries with the intent of neutralizing our military strengths we've made progress since then but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done and the importance of continued investment in our nation's military and our technological Edge cannot be overstated the events of the past year should remind us that there will always be bad actors who represent a threat to Peace and Freedom and being prepared to meet those threats and the best way of is the best way I should say a preserving peace and keeping our nation secure it's disappointing that the National Defense authorization act yearly legislation to authorize funding for our military and our National Defense has been so low on Democrats priority list this year we're two months into fiscal year 2023 and yet the Senate still hasn't taken up the 2023 bill Democrats are more focused on spending hundreds of billions of dollars on their Green New Deal priorities and they were on passing essential legislation for our nation's defense as efforts continue to negotiate a way to bring the ndaa to the floor I hope that we're able to pass a comprehensive bill that rejects the president's inadequate funding requests and addresses all of our key defense requirements as always one of my top priorities is ensuring that each Year's ndaa addresses the needs of our Airmen at Ellsworth Air Force Base right now I'm working to ensure that the base continues to receive full funding for the many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the B-21 Raider mission in late October I had the opportunity of reviewing the progress at Ellsworth firsthand with Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall and suffice it to say things are going to be very very busy over the coming years the B-21 training and operational missions will require significant investments in new infrastructure including a low observable coding restoration facility and a radio frequency facility to support the Raiders stealth properties as well as a weapons generation facility to support its nuclear capability the ndaa will continue this essential military construction and ensure that remains on Pace in preparation for the arrival the B-21 we also need to ensure Ellsworth remains a premier training space for our bombers which is why I'm pursuing a provision to require the Federal Aviation Administration to establish a pilot program to support the development of dynamic airspace Dynamic airspace sometimes called adaptive airspace refers to efficiently scheduling and managing airspace and adjusting airspace boundaries as military exercises exercises or other flights proceed through them this concept will better enable the Pentagon to meet training requirements for aircraft like the B-21 which need larger volumes of training airspace to accommodate longer engagement distances and as always while we prepare for the B-21 mission I continue to work to ensure that our b1s at Ellsworth receive all the resources they need to remain a responsive and lethal component of global strike command as they demonstrated in the just completed bomber task force deployment to Guam Madam president while updated planes and Equipment are essential as always our greatest resource is the men and women who wear the uniform and I will continue to work to improve quality of life for our Ellsworth Airmen and their families more military families will be moving into the community surrounding Ellsworth with the arrival of the B-21 Mission and another one of my priorities making sure that the infrastructure is in place to provide ample support for these new families I work to include a provision in this year's ndaa that would allow the Secretary of Defense to continue to adjust basic allowance for housing rates if an installation is experiencing a sudden increase in the number of service members assigned there this will help ensure that families at Ellsworth and elsewhere will have the resources they need to secure appropriate accommodations I'm also working to ensure that the Douglas School District is able to integrate and support Air Force members children and provide sufficient classroom space and I'm grateful to the other members of South Dakota's Congressional Delegation for working with me to ensure that this year's ndaa will authorize up to 15 million dollars in Impact Aid funding for schools experiencing forced structure changes like the anticipated growth at Ellsworth Bennett president I'm looking forward to tomorrow's unveiling of the B-21 Raider and to that day in the near future when the first Raider lands at Ellsworth it's an honor to be part of building up the base and to represent the men and women of Ellsworth and United States Senate and I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that our Ellsworth Airmen and our men and women in uniform in every branch of the military have everything that they need to carry out their missions Madam president I yield the floor

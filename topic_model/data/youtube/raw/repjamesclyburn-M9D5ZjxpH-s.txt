thank you very much for you limited time I'm very pleased with the speaker to join my colleagues and people throughout the United States to celebrate Black History Month it may come as a surprise to some the Black History Month is also celebrated in Canada and the United Kingdom although they do so in the United Kingdom in the month of October thanks to the hard work and persistence of ecology Woodson and the association for the study of Negro life and history known today as the association for the study of african-american life in history the celebration of Black History was inaugurated in 1926 in response to ms Woodson's advocacy it was to be for one week the second week in February in order to envelop the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln februari 12 and Frederick Douglass februari 14th first proposed by students at Kent University in 1969 and 70 the week was officially expanded to a month in 1976 Gerald Ford was president at the time when the month was established President Ford urge the country to and I quote honor the too often neglected accomplishments of black Americans end of quote talk about health care these days and in no area has the contributions of african-americans been lured neglected and dishonoured as much as in the field of health care how many people are aware of the contributions of Charles drew who unlocked the secrets they led to the ability to perform blood transfusions or Daniel Hale Williams who perform the first successful open-heart surgery or Samuel kuntz who perform the first successful kidney transplant not done on the tentacle twins because of these and many other flights in many other fields Mr Speaker I have not always celebrated this occasion with pleasure during those discussions back in the late 60s and early 70s I and many others felt that the appropriate action was not just to expand from one week to a month but to mandate the incorporation of african-americans contributions and achievements throughout the curricula of all our schools year round but with each passing day I grow more and more appreciative and respective of the lesson taught in first Corinthians 11 13 which I shared with you in Jim Clyburn version and I quote when I was a child young and inexperienced I spoke with the reasoning and understood of a child but as I grew and matured I put those childish thoughts expressions and ways behind me I have come to understand mr. speaker the Black History Month is not only about celebrating past achievements and contributions is also a time for reflection and introspection Aristotle much intoned in life without contemplation is not worth living I have spent a lot of introspective moments over the last several weeks and over the last several days I reflected on the comments made by dr. Martin Luther King jr. at the annual meeting of the medical committee for human rights back in 1966 when he said of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane that is what was on my mind when I address this house on the day that we passed a patient projections protection and affordable care act on that occasion I refer to the affordable care act as a civil rights act of the 21st century it may seem a bit odd to some to hear the Affordable Care Act referred to as if civil rights earth but that is exactly what it is the Affordable Care Act outlawed discrimination against children with pre-existing conditions outlawed against people with disabilities and outlawed discrimination against women just because they are women there's a speaker I want to believe that we have grown and mature the young where we were when our country allowed insurance companies to discriminate against women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer I would like to leave mr. speaker that we have put behind us a childless practice of kicking children off of their family insurance policies as soon as they turn to the one even if they are still in school or have not yet found employment and mr. speaker what could be more challenged and immature that allow insurance companies to deny benefits to the sick and disabled in order to gain big bonuses and payouts for executives these arguments are not new in fact they are reminiscent of an age-old debate 60 years ago during my years of student protest there were those who urge us to slow down you are pushing too hard too fast they would say some of those who wanted a slower approach claimed to be on our side like those egg white ministers who implored dr. Martin Luther King jr. to slow down arguing that Christianity took 2,000 years to accomplish all it has those ministers to believe that the escalation of marches and demonstrations to secure civil rights was unwise and untimely in 1963 while sitting in the birmingham city jail but the King started repented a letter a letter that of course he finished after leaving jail but in that letter he dealt with the whole issue of time in his letter but the king said time itself is neutral it can be used either destructively or constructively dr. King continued more and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the people of goodwill we will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions are the bad people but for the appalling silence for the good people dr. King continued human progress never roles in on wheels of inevitability it comes to the tireless efforts of men and I might add women wouldn't to be co-workers with God and without his hard work time itself and ally of the forces of social stagnation we must he lose time creatively in the knowledge the time is always right to do right I believe these words ring true today in our current situation our nation has waited for nearly a century to find a way to bring all its citizens into the healthcare system the time was right to do right for the American people and with that Mr Speaker

and thank you chairman pal for being with us today it'll come as no surprise to you that i want to focus on digital assets and fed master accounts so my first question is about the accounting treatment of digital assets uh specifically sec staff accounting bulletin 121. so this bulletin requires publicly traded companies including banks to hold digital assets in custody as an on-balance sheet liability so will the accounting standards contained in this bulletin that requires it to be on balance sheet be applied by the federal reserve to banks and bank holding companies that so that's something we we too are saw that and understood the implications and i think that's something we're working on with our with our fellow bank regulators and i don't have an answer for you though but that's a that's certainly something we're focusing on very closely right now and and i would note that um the basel committee on bank supervision has declined to establish a capital charge for custody digital assets because they're always off balance sheet they've created a framework called the prudential treatment of crypto assets that continues to acknowledge that they're off balance sheet so if the standards of the sec staff bulletin are adopted that would be the first time that custody assets are placed on balance sheet do you think it's smart for the us to be imposing bank standards beyond international norms so again i mean that was the sec has authority over over accounting rules and this that's what this was and we now have to consider that exact question uh and that that's what we're doing i can't really i can't really say more because we are working our way through it but i i my understanding of it is the same as yours though which is custody assets are are are off balance sheet have always been but this is you know the sec made a different decision as it relates to digital assets for reasons it explained and now we have to consider those yeah and thank you i encourage you to uh to to consider that and appreciate that you're looking at it and you're aware of it that's great so i'll turn to master accounts now of course uh the board and the reserve banks have refused to provide congress and the public with transparency with regard to the application process at its core a master account is a public benefit conferred by the fed to a private institution and since a master account is a public benefit really doesn't the public have a right to know which institutions have master accounts and which have applied for accounts and not received them both the fdic and the occ publicly list similar application information on their websites today so could you commit as part of a transparency uh project to make publicly available a list of institutions that have received master accounts as well as the institutions that have applied and not received them so i'll be glad to look into that you know our system well and it really is that the fed the board you know we set rules but but the reserve banks really make the decisions about granting accounts subject to those rules and we're trying we actually think we can improve on that system with the current proposal we have and are considering comments on that right now as i'm sure you know very well yeah and and as you also know that applicants for master accounts are getting whipsawed between the federal reserve board of governors and the banks that one says that the federal reserve says to says that the the banks have all of the authority they need meaning federal reserve bank of kansas city and others have all of the authority they need to make these decisions and yet you go to the reserve banks and they say oh no we're waiting for uh the board of governors and so there's a whip saw effect and we get no answer the the black hole continues to exist and you know my frustration level has long since been at a boiling point it continues to be at a boiling point there's no responsiveness it's a black hole and i wish to just once again use this opportunity uh to encourage you to address that it is it there's just no excuse there's no there's no excuse anymore mr chairman thank you you

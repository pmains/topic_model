Thank You mr. chairman mr. secretary thank you for being here today over the past decade the worldwide consumption of fish and seafood has increased 17% this means more seafood is being imported and exported around the world for more countries into the US according to the CDC study report in February of 2017 97 % of fish and shellfish consumed in the United States are imported last year we had a u.s. dollar trade deficit a 4.5 billion from shrimp alone and representing a historic seafood capital of world Biloxi Mississippi could you tell me what is the department doing to help reduce the seafood trade deficit well it's one of my pet peeves I hate the idea that with all the water surrounding us and all the water inland that we have a trade deficit in fish and I've been putting a lot of pressure on the fisheries management group and at NOAA to try to deal with the situation I think there's some potential that some of the constraints that we've had on fresh catch here maybe need to be relaxed a little bit I think it's easy to be a little bit overzealous and therefore hold down the the production of fish second I believe there are some inappropriate practices in some of the foreign countries in their aquaculture it seems to me that we should be very careful about importing seafood from places that do not adhere to the same standards we would have for aquaculture here in the US so we're mindful of it both from the point of view of seeing what we can do either with aquaculture or re-evaluation of what are the needs of the fish stock so that we can my goal is to have maximum sustainable catch be the target for our domestic fishing industry and as to the foreign industries through the degree that they are conducting their activities inappropriately we're going to try to constrain them as best we can well well thank you and I appreciate your agency's work on that subject switching gears being that I represent a Gulf state and we've been hit really hard by natural and man-made disasters in the recent past these disasters have had the negative environmental and economic impacts particularly on commercial and recreational fishing industries their supply chain in their communities could you tell me if any what investment is the Department of Commerce making to help industry and these communities recover and be more resilient well we have repeatedly declared the fish disaster situation and I don't remember just all the places where we have but it's quite a few and there are a couple more applications that are pending so that's one very specific step the best thing we can do though is to try for getting an early warning system so that people can try to get prepared because it's not just the fish themselves it's also the vessels that are at issue and I don't know if you were in the room and a mention but in this past hurricane season know our forecasts were 25 percent more accurate and more and they were more timely than they had been before we're trying to increase the advance warning that we can give to the affected communities so that they can try to prepare themselves and also trying to be more accurate in the location and the severity so that that's one of the major steps that we're in a position to take then when disasters do hit as you know Congress has made appropriation and we'll try to deal with that well thank you for your support and assistance in that regards last question you know I come from a very rural state where agriculture is our number one industry and as you know overall NAFTA has been good for US Agriculture since implementation agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico have totaled approximately 310 billion and increased by more than 300 percent from pre NAFTA levels the administration is wrapping up final talks with our trading partners in Mexico and Canada and the u.s. farm economy is in a major downturn right now and the farmers of my district are very worried about our Mexican and Canadian markets going to other countries for their AG products in fact Mexico announced they have already begun discussions with numerous countries in South America for corn and other grain products can you provide the committee with the latest update from the NAFTA negotiations from an agricultural perspective surely we've now had seven rounds of negotiation and a lot of issues mostly not the most contentious ones but a lot of issues have been negotiated a lot of language has been put to bed we think there's a practical time limit not a contractual one not a legislated one but a practical time limit on the negotiations due to the political calendar Mexico as you know has a general election coming up in the beginning of July Canada has its provincial elections in June our fast-track Authority the trade promotion Authority expires on the 8th of July here in the States and of course we have the midterm congressional elections in the fall why all that's important is it's my view that if we don't have a resolution within the next month or so very likely it'll be kicked over for quite a little while because of the election cycle especially in in Mexico where as you know there is one candidate who's running on a quite anti-american platform mr. secretary thank you very much mr. chairman I yield back

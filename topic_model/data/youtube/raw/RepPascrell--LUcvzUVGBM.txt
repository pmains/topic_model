historical park in my hometown of Paterson New Jersey to include he start Hinchcliffe stadium it overlooks the Great Falls of Paterson directly adjacent to the current boundaries of the Great Falls National Historic Park it was built by the people of Patterson is a public works project in 1931 and in 1932 and named for Patterson's mayor at the time John Hinchliff Hinchcliffe holds the distinction of being one of the best and the last surviving stadiums in our nation to have hosted Negro League Baseball during the 30s and 40s the New York black Yankees in New York Cubans called Hinchcliffe home these games featured future Baseball Hall of Famers such as Patterson's own Larry Dobie the first player to break the color barrier in the American League Hinchcliffe also hosted events and this is what so many things that are fascinating about the stadium every sport except hoppy hockey was played there you name it and it was played at his club Stadium it was utilized by the Patterson public schools for high school sports as well the proudest aghori Falls National start Park Act which passed the House in 2007 became the law as part of an omnibus public lands bill until 2009 established the park as it was originally introduced this bill including Hinchcliffe stadium within the park boundaries this language was replaced during the legislative process with a provision calling for a study of the stadium's historic significance the study concluded last year resulting in a much deserved national historic landmark designation for Hinchcliffe stadium I believe that his Co stadiums legacy is inextricably intertwined with the mission of the Patterson Great Falls National Historical Park which tells the story of Alexander Hamilton's drive to create our nation's first planned industrial city there's always a little competition going between Patterson and Lowell Massachusetts as to which was our first industrial city but we 25 products they only produced two so anyway it's a standoff though the modern labor movement began in paterson silk mills when workers fought 48 hours for work eight hours for rest eight hours for what we will Hinchcliffe tells the story of what we will the human side of the workers who came to patterson to work in mills to waves of immigration and great migration Hinchcliffe is the embodiment of Hamilton's vision for an industrial economy powered by free labor and immigration not slavery as i discussed of my meetings with national park service director john jarvis regarding this legislation Hinchliff stadium and its unique place and its unique place in history present a sterling opportunity for the Park Service to meet its stated goal of reaching out to urban communities the legislation would vastly enhance the significance of the Great Falls National Historical Park enjoying new audiences for our national parks it is true that the stadium currently sits in a state of disrepair I'm being charitable it has been out of you since 1997 when Patterson public schools the property owner could no longer keep up with the maintenance costs this stadium has been listed as one of the country's most endangered historic places by the National Trust first art preservation this legislation will not place the burden of restoration or maintenance on the National Park Service which as we know already faces a significant backlog of such work instead this legislation is intended to draw private donations as well as the state and local investments to make the necessary improvements at inch with the stewardship of the National Park Service will provide certainty about Hinchcliffe future facilitating fundraising efforts it's a great place the historic district is a play right three minutes from City Hall the second highest Falls the Mississippi River you would never think to find that in an urban setting and you would never expect to find hitch for studying there either so I'm asking the community to pass this legislation and I'm certainly open for any questions thank you thank you Miss pascual are there any questions from the committee mr. mistake ho first of all I just wanted to put in a word that this is something that all of New Jersey cares about even though it even though the teams that played their head the name New York this is we're used that our way

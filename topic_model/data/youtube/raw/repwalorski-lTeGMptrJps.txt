thank you to ranking members brady and smith for holding this timely meeting to examine some of the challenges facing small businesses and family farms today to you three guests that are here today i could not say any better than how you said it you all could be for my district in indiana i continue to hear from family-owned businesses and farmers and hard-working middle-class hoosiers just like you across my district who are terrified and literally terrified of what's actually happening with this democrats proposed tax hikes will have on them i was grateful to serve on this committee when we passed the most significant overhaul of our tax code in 31 years the tax cuts and jobs act has made the tax code simpler and fairer cuts taxes for hard-working americans and owned businesses after its enactment in 2017 we saw historic job growth rising wages booming economy until covet hit but now that we're putting the pandemic behind us instead of working on pro-growth policies to rebuild our economy democrats under president biden are seeking to raise taxes on american families and job creators all to pay for their left wing wish list in particular democrats have honed in on repealing stepped-up basis crucial provision which allows family businesses and farms to pay capital gains on our property's increase in value since the time the land was inherited and only when the property has been sold by a surviving family member without this provision the next generation of hoosier farmers could be forced to sell their land just to pay the supercharged death facts this video i did another burden on family owned farms and businesses at a time when they are most vulnerable after the death of a loved one nothing says quote unquote sorry for your loss quite like a massive tax bill from the irs let me tell you who's going to suffer from this proposal it's certainly not the wealthy who will be able to find a workaround it's the multi-generational farmer or small business owner in my district who's trying to make ends meet and it's just not one or two there are many spread throughout a heavy agricultural district like mine all of this at a time when these folks can ill afford it they're working night and day to recover from the damage the pandemic costs to their livelihoods tax increases are the last thing that family farmers and businesses need right now these are the people that make america great these are the food producers and job creators whose families have been doing this for generations after generations just like yours i've always fought and i will continue to fight to ensure that more of their money stays in their pockets and not the governments thank you mr chair and i yield back

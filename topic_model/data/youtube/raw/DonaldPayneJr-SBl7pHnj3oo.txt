mr speaker i ask my republican colleagues to think about the message that president trump's muslim ban sends to our young people what the president is telling them is that our doors are closed that they are that the tired and the poor the persecuted and the oppressed are no longer welcome i reject that message and i'm glad to say that i've heard from many young people who reject that message i want to read from a letter sent by a middle school student from west orange new jersey in my district her name is kalista kalisa wrote immigrants are basically what america is made of immigrants work very hard in the country and they get things done these people fight for their lives i'm glad that kalista recognizes president trump's ban as a threat to american values but i'm concerned that other young people will see it and think it's okay to reject others based on how they look or how they worship or where they come from mr speaker the president's ban is illogical it is dangerous and it sends a terrible message to young people of this nation and i yield back

Thank You mr. speaker I want to congratulate and thank the sponsors of this amendment for introducing this amendment it begins to break down the taboo in American politics about discussing drug policy intelligently it also begins to hopefully result in the federal government having a more humane and human policy on medical marijuana I heard the gentleman from Virginia say that the DEA says there is no medical use of marijuana that's true they've said it the DEA has no credibility with people who have looked at this on this subject on most subjects with respect to drugs these days one reason there is no proof of medical of successful medical use of marijuana is because the DEA systematically tries to make sure there's no adequate research on that denies the use of supplies of marijuana for medical research but we have ample proof from the 16 states which have legalized the medical use of marijuana we have ample anecdotal proof we know that for people suffering pain for people suffering nausea from AIDS and cancer for many people marijuana is the only thing that produces relief and enables them to eat and to get sustenance and to regain weight and to perhaps regain health we know this we know this from thousands of cases the DEA doesn't know it because it refuses to see it infuses to allow systematic research that's wrong it's inhumane now it may be that I wish this amendment didn't specify the 16 states instead of because maybe a seventeenth and eighteenth will come along in this this year I hope it will but certainly the federal government has a better use of its resources than trying to prevent the policy that 16 states have adopted the humane policy of allowing the medical use of something that has been proven to be medical medically useful in many cases to prevent that doctors ordered this actors and other medical professionals or to determine treatment not bureaucrats in Washington so I support this amendment and I hope that maybe maybe if it passes maybe if we have a rational policy with regard to medical marijuana maybe two other things will happen maybe the DEA will get its head out of the sand and will permit proper research so we'll get better research and better results and maybe also will begin a discussion of our general drug policy toward marijuana which is certainly a much much more benign drug than alcohol which is legal then tobacco which is legal and we have a very irrational policy toward it a policy which reminds one of the policy in the 1920s that had such deleterious effects with regard to alcohol and alcohol use so I I congratulate the sponsor this amendment for having the courage to help break the taboos concerning the subject and for introducing an amendment that if it passes will result in many many thousands of people being more helpful and more comfortable and will be a great thing for this country I thank you a yield back

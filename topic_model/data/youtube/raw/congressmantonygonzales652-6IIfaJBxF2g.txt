welcome back we have breaking news this morning this is a third migrant Bus arriving in New York City this morning uh this bus coming from Texas it is the third bus of the morning where we are watching illegal migrants get off of the bus and uh go into New York we are expecting uh more buses to continue as you know Texas governor Greg Abbott continues to send buses to New York and other big cities this is the ninth bus this week uh ninth bus this week it's Tuesday this has Customs and Border Protection data shows officials have encountered nearly 267 thousand migrant children since President Biden took office joining me right now is Texas Congressman a member of the House Appropriations Committee Tony Gonzalez Congressman it's good to see you thanks very much for being here you are right there on the border and you see things firsthand assess the situation for us right now in Texas yeah it's horrific you know just when you think it can't get any worse it does you know we recently had a high-speed chase go through a small town of Hondo where that ended up in a fatality the you know one migrant was killed another migrant had to be flown to San Antonio for immediate uh health care and so you know the same thing in Uvalde you know Uvalde had one of the the worst school shooting in Texas history well guess what our schools are going into lockdown because these high-speed chases continue to come through our towns there's just no one in sight Kamala Harris thankfully is coming to Texas next month but guess what she's coming here to do a fundraiser so she's not they're not even serious about helping anyone along the border meanwhile people are dying things are getting worse migrants are sleeping on the streets and now they're getting busted everywhere in El Paso they're sending three to six buses every week all over the country unbelievable I mean what we're seeing take place is just remarkable and this White House Is Not not acknowledging it at all let me ask you Congressman one of my sources at the border told me that they understand that Venezuela and some other countries are emptying out prisons prisons and the prisoners are headed directly to the Border can you confirm that you know Marie I've heard the same thing I've actually heard it for months and it started in other countries as well uh you know there is a major Crackdown in Central America in uh in uh uh not El Salvador in particular and a lot of a lot of gang members are fleeing there and they're coming to the United States we've seen that for months I've heard the exact same thing about Venezuela and other places so a lot of these some of these actors that are coming over no one wants them in their backyards you know people always ask hey why is why is it why are Democrats failing with the Hispanic population I represent a district that is over 70 percent Hispanic and the Administration has completely abandoned us house Democrats in particular have abandoned everyone along the border it's why Republicans are going to win back the majority in the house unbelievable El Paso is a city under Democrat leadership and they'll vote today on whether or not to spend an additional four million dollars on bussing those migrants to Blue cities it's already spending 250 000 a day on migrants congressmen so will the leadership which is Democrat agree to spending the money to send the buses oh yeah I think a hundred percent the Democrat leadership will because if you're a mayor of a town doesn't matter if you're a Democrat Republican you're trying to keep Law and Order you're trying to keep people off the streets and what you're seeing is these migrants overwhelm cities first it started with small cities like Del Rio and Eagle Pass but now it's large cities El Paso is a large city and here's it it's there's no end in sight it's not going to end there it's your city next we're talking about Texas today but if we go on we continue along this path it's just going to continue to spread I will say House Republicans have a plan we have this commitment to America that we have rolled out we are the the conferences United behind it where we're going to focus on ending Catch and Release where we're going to focus on technology On the Border if you'll remember Maria you know uh about a few months ago there were 53 migrants that were found cooked to death in the back of a trailer that was in my district well that could have been prevented if there was technology at the border and then ultimately we have to enforce the laws that are on the books all this goes away if there's repatriation flights people that do not qualify for Asylum gets it back yeah it's amazing because Democrats did not say a word when all those people cooked to death in that car that you're referring to in that truck uh you had dead people right there in plain sight you're looking at people drowning in the river grand every single day Democrats don't say a peep about it and yet as soon as 50 migrants show up in Martha's Vineyard then it's a crisis then oh they're upset meanwhile you're facing what six seven thousand people a day throughout Texas uh look yeah go ahead no every day you're absolutely right and the First Responders imagine if you're a firefighter and you you you come on a scene where there's 53 people through 53 fatalities the the mental health of our First Responders is at an all-time crisis that's a great point and Meanwhile we're looking at a live picture of Port Authority right now we're about 50 migrants have come off of this bus this is the third bus of the morning and the ninth this week uh in New York uh the mayor is building the first of two tent camps for illegal migrants on top of the 6 000 hotel rooms already provided compare that to El Paso City's Welcome Center is taking 90 minutes to process each migrant bus essentially working overtime to keep these crossers off the streets Congressman how much do you tie this to the crime spikes in our country you know I mean I I know that we don't know who it is and we don't know their backgrounds but I I think it's been up to 60 well it's definitely 61 after you handed but I think it's up to 80 people that have been identified as having crossed onto the border into Texas that are actually on the terrorist watch list that's exactly right that's the most dangerous part of this all you know many many folks are coming over for a better life they don't qualify for Asylum they don't meet our Asylum laws but they're coming over for a better dog but in embedded in there are Bad actors people nobody wants in in our country nobody wants certainly in their neighborhoods whether they're gang members whether they're terrorists 78 people on the terrorist watch list you know I'll remind people it only took 19 terrorists to kill about 3 000 Americans you know a couple decades ago this is a real and serious threat oftentimes too these Bad actors they they're coming here with a organized criminal organization so essentially the cartel is growing the cartel is expanding you know they're in a they're in an opportunity to pick up more and more territory these are people nobody wants in our backyard it's why this Administration you know they've turned a complete Blind Eye house Democrats you'll never see them at the border you'll never see them understanding this that's why it's important House Republicans on day one we roll pull out this commitment to America and then we fulfill our promise to America I mean it's unbelievable to me that the people who are deciding who comes into America are dangerous drug criminal cartels who by the way are taking home two to three hundred million dollars a week and they are charging whoever they want to come into America they're the they're the police guards of this great country and and no comments and Tiana Lowe jump in here because we haven't even started on the drugs and I don't call a hundred thousand uh people dying in America a fentanyl an overdose no no that's a poisoning this is poison that's coming into our country and it's coming through this wide open border killing young people they're poisonous yeah so yeah there are boys in our children yes Congressman hi I'm curious about so new numbers from border patrol which yes confirms that we've had two million migrants crossing the southern border at least documented but now for the first time ever the majority of migrants coming across the southern border are not from Mexico and the northern triangle they are from other countries how much of a concern is that with regards to Crime with regards to drug trafficking that these are not countries these are not Guatemalan refugees and also how much of that is attributable to Biden revoking those safe Third Country agreements with those migrant countries that really staunched that Northern triangle flow or is this all of a covid phenomenon as the White House likes to say yeah you know we we beat up we beat up Biden and we beat up uh secretary mayorkas but there's another actor in this and that's Secretary of State blinken this is his role instead of going to Europe and going to all these places he needs to be going to Central and South America and working with these countries to essentially take back their people and work these agreements they've completely given up no one talks about the state department the state department has failed America probably more than anyone else whether it's the 13 Americans getting killed in Afghanistan or whether it's these terrorists and these drug these these gangs that are coming over in droves he needs to be flying to Venezuela and finding out a way with a carrot or a stick to go you will take these Bad actors back and and the same goes for any of these countries I recently visited the northern triangle they said they've never even spoken with the Secretary of State this is a problem uh unbelievable yeah it's uh pretty remarkable what's going on and president Trump actually negotiated with all of those countries but of course on day one Joe Biden overturned all of Trump's border policies Congressman will be watching all of this thanks very much for weighing in thanks for your leadership here Tony Gonzalez joining us this morning in Texas thank you sir

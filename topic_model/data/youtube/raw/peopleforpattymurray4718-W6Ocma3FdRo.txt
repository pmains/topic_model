we have a culture that has unfortunately created a lot of hopelessness my husband he started to struggle with depression i did get him help but unfortunately it was too late most people who die by suicide don't actually ever get to talk to a mental health professional in the time that i was at forefront we were able to work on a legislation that really kind of changed the landscape we passed the first law in the country to require all health care professionals to get training and suicide prevention i just didn't want anything like that to happen to anybody else every single person out there has their own story seven short years ago i was living in my van homeless after experiencing decades of poverty i've been where a lot of the people that i get to meet are at giving backpacks is a non-profit where we take donations and we fill backpacks with necessities like toiletries snacks food items and we also put resources in those backpacks and we hand them out homelessness isn't just laziness it isn't just drug addiction it isn't just mental health right now there is a sea of people out there that need to be seen they just need to know that they exist that's what i want to do with the rest of my days is go out and remind people that they're not here for their struggles that they're here for much bigger purpose we are a better society if we have strong communities and i think when it comes to outdoors there's such a culture that has excluded so many people and so many groups for so long children's collective is an initiative to help break down barriers for women of color to gain access into the outdoors showing up and being the only one can just make it feel like a place that you're not welcomed or this isn't for you i think especially with covid where everyone's been a little bit more isolated and it's been hard to build those communities it fills a gap that was missing before we lose more kids to suicide than we do to traffic crashes i think that just helps put it in perspective if people who are struggling could connect to other people who've been there to find that hope i think that would make a profound difference this is our first award that we've ever received so for us it's a big deal receiving this award from senator patty murray means so much because she's just an inspiration getting this recognition that brings new eyes to it right here light attracts light when you see somebody doing good people want to go around that and see what it's all about and then when they see what it's about their light shines and before you know it you have thousands of lights shining [Music] you

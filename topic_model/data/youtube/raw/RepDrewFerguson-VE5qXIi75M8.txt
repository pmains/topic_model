thank you Mr chairman move strike the last word all right let's let's go through something right quick because I think we the mental gymnastics that the my colleagues are going through to arrive at their statements about going after folks in this bill it's it it's it it almost makes my head hurt so let's let's read the language that's in the bill because the language was taken from existing language in the cares act it says that we're gonna we're gonna come after folks that have committed fraud and that means individuals who receive funds they are not entitled to because and the individual individual knowingly has made or caused to be made by another a false statement of material facts or knowingly has failed or caused another to fail to disclose a material fact that's folks that have committed fraud don't nothing in there about somebody that that received a a payment by accident if you if if you didn't commit fraud you're going to be leading your life just fine but if you committed fraud then we should come after you we should go after people that have committed fraud States should be expected to recover fraudulent payments so I just want to make sure that my cotton let's all agree on the language that's there that says that you have to have committed fraud to go after for for for states to come after you on this Mr Ferguson where are you reading in the where am I reading that it was taken from I don't have to get the exact section but it it comes from the fraud section that was in the original cares act no but within the context of this bill we're discussing today well there's existing protections that are already in place but let me make one other point here so we should if you if you haven't committed fraud you're gonna be fine if you've committed fraud you should be expected to be prosecuted okay that's pretty and I think we should all agree on that good the other piece about this about about taking money away from an agency from the Department of Labor um that we're going to take away money used to go after fraud and to prevent crime let's look at a couple of numbers here we got about 191 billion dollars so far they have recovered about 5.5 billion they spent about 1.6 billion they got about 400 million laying around in these in these programs that's not a real good return on investment it's not you know we're we're pouring a lot of money out and just you know just north of break even on this okay so if we're gonna to me it's fine to repeal the money on this and let's go do it a different way because we're really not getting that good of return on our investment and probably a reason is is we're probably not spending the money the right way so again look at the language in the bill if you are going if if you have committed fraud then expect to be prosecuted if you haven't committed fraud please live your life freely and let's if we're going to spend money going after fraud let's spend it the right way let's let's not waste it okay with that Mr chairman I yield back

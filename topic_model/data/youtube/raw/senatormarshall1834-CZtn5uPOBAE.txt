yes senator marshall okay thank you madam chair i want to call up marshall amendment number one for myself and senator tuberville i want to first express my appreciation for the hard work of the co-authors of this bill senator grassley senator fisher for all your efforts put into this legislation i know you both are champions for your state and you understand the issues facing cattle operations across the country and you're doing what you feel is best for the ag producers in your great states of iowa and nebraska i certainly agree there's a problem simply stated at times during this cattle cycle any cattle cycle there's not enough shackle space for the quantity of cattle in the supply chain and the demand at the supermarket at home and abroad that pain is always amplified during so-called black swan events like pandemics or fire and i want to make it very clear i'm concerned with the level of concentration in the packing industry not to mention the amount of foreign ownership in the industry as well this is harming cow calf operations and small feeders no matter the industry if you have three or four companies controlling 80 or more percent of any link in the supply chain problems can arise i want to make it clear i support most of the bill kansans support most of this bill transparency is the nectar of free enterprise and capitalism but capitalism without competition creates opportunities for exploitation all that being said i agree with american farm bureau and kansas farm bureau and the kansas livestock association that these mandates will actually harm feedlots and cow calf operations in kansas by empowering and giving more control to the big four packing plants thus along with senator tuberville i'm going to offer the following amendment but withdraw it this amendment eliminates the market acquisition mandate for fed cattle i understand the frustrations of all the senators who authored and support this bill and i share those frustration but a market mandates the wrong approach economists already warning that this mandate will reduce cattle prices received by cattlemen it could cost cattle producers anywhere from 23 million to 249 million each year and 90 percent of those costs appear to be borne by cattlemen in kansas and the southern plains states while this is an attempt to regulate the packer the result is actually additional regulation of the cattle producer this will give the packer most of the leverage to decide who gets the good deal and who gets the bad deal the smallest of our feedlot producers and cow calf operations will lose in this arrangement the way to best address market problems is not through additional regulations that manipulate the market rather we need to eliminate the red tape that ties the hands of industry let small producership meet interstate commerce pass our bona fide beef branding act to provide more accurate label and address some of the concerns that senator thune mentions past our fair meat fair meat packing act to help small and medium-sized packers compete with the big ones reduce labor burdens and allow packers to increase line speeds there are several other transparency positions in the bill i can support but i simply cannot support a marketing mandate that disproportionately impacts kansas cattle producers again this amendment is simple and would would remove the marketing mandate man i'm sure i don't intend to ask for a vote on this amendment today instead i'll reserve it for floor consideration should this legislation come before the full senate i believe senator tuberville who was a co-sponsor would like to speak and supported this amendment i do withdraw my amendment and ask the chair to recognize senator tuberville to speak on this as a co-sponsor thank you very much

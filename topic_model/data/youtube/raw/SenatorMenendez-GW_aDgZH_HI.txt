senator menendez in new jersey is recognized thank you mr chairman uh a 2021 report by the financial health network uh found that nearly 60 percent of all overdraft fees in 2020 were paid by low and moderate income households and about 25 percent were paid by latino households specifically mr moynihan mr sharp mr diamond your banks each charged over a billion dollars in overdraft fees last year and while each of your banks have recently reduced or modified the fees your customers particularly your low income and minority customers are still at risk of incurring an overdraft fee every time they make a payment from one of your banks so can you commit to us today that before we see you next year your institutions will fully eliminate overdraft fees senator we have an account that has no overdraft fees available for our customers and we believe that the customer should have a choice of the way they want their services and the way they want to pay for them at the company senator if you look at the last quarter call report you'll see that the overdraft fees in our company dropped 66 percent from last year recently we announced that they'll drop further because during that quarter we made some of these changes we don't believe the full elimination of them is actually a good result but the amount of overdraft fees we'll collect we told people will be down 90 that is a 12 to 13 year commitment that we've been able to live up to because we're big because we have the operating costs and because we're allowed to do mergers and put together a great franchise it allows us to pass those benefits for the customers and so i think we eliminating i think has attributes which are different than people say which the rent payment could be rejected but we reduce the cost to ten dollars uh on those instances we also have four million people in a no overdraft account and it's opens 25 30 all the new accounts so i think you have to look at that that requires certain standards to have a note no five dollars a month i mean anybody can open it has a id yes a diamond you know we also offer it we think it's the right thing to do 23 opt-in so it isn't like everyone wants it but those who want it sometimes it's abused but i want to there's two sides to this which are very first of all i have faith in the american public to make their own choices uh when people use it remember there are a lot of occasions where if it's not used okay they will be charged a higher fee in the other side that includes parking tickets rent mortgages or you need pharmacies at the uh immediately and you get bound so people want it for those reasons and it reduces it can often reduce the cost on the other side uh and stop them from to payday lenders so that's why we're trying to navigate this i do agree with the concept it does get overused and we try to do things like financial counseling and on occasion just turn it off for someone because we think they just use it too much i don't i i have faith in the american people as you do mr diamond i don't think that their choices is to end up in overdrafts your banks made 64 billion dollars collectively last quarter 64 billion so it's clear to me that there's no reasonable explanation to continue to charge overdraft fees on working families uh you just had a conversation my colleague and friend senator scott one of the reasons so many americans are still hesitant to enter the formal financial system is this issue i hope you'll give more consideration to how you deal with this uh overdraft issue i think it or newer to everybody's benefit i've heard story after story from new jersey constituents who have fallen victim to scans and fraud on zell and in many instances the banks have denied their customers relief that's why in july i led a letter to with some of my colleagues to seven of the banks that created and jointly owned zell which includes most of you i found several of your responses really inadequate in particular the responses from jpmorgan chase and pnc did not address the fundamental questions we asked regarding the number of frauds and scams reported by your customers as well as information regarding refunds and referrals to law enforcement so mr diamond and mr demcheck will you commit to making the information we asked available to me and my staff as your other colleagues have absolutely and i'm sorry we didn't meet it the first time and yes i the same i'm sorry we didn't send it in the first time i appreciate it because that information helps us as we're trying to figure out that consumers are slipping through the cracks of regulation e and d detail information will help us figure out what we do with it finally uh mr sharp in march bloomberg reported that wells fargo disproportionately rejected refinancing applications from african american and hispanic homeowners you and i had an opportunity to i appreciate your visit uh one of the things that you told me in response to my questions was this was partially due to the fact that wells encourages more minority borrowers to go through the full applica application process while some of your competitors turn them away at an earlier stage is that is that correct uh we just one clarification is we encourage all borrowers not just minority borrowers okay but but that would include the whole universe of minority bars therefore uh it why don't the rest of you do the same encourage encourage them to go through the full application process okay the silence is good to be fair i just don't know if we do or don't but but i'll you know we will look at that would you would you respond to us for the record please because yes you know look the latino community is two trillion dollar domestic marketplace impact already will grow exponentially but it needs to be treated fairly in the process uh and ms fraser it's good to see you because this is about the only diversity we have in this industry thank you thanks sir

SCHEDULE OUR FIRST GUEST INDIANA CONGRESSMAN JACKIE WILL OR SKI. UH CONGRESSWOMAN, NICE TO SEE YOU FOLLOWING THE CONSTITUTIONAL OVERTURNING OF ROE VERSUS WADE BIDEN IS SUPPORTING AN END OF THE FILIBUSTER. TO PROTECT THE SLAUGHTER OF CHILDREN IN THE WOMB AS A WOMAN. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE EFFORTS BY BIDEN AND HIS DEMOCRATS TO ADD TO THE 66 MILLION DEAD BABIES THAT HAVE ALREADY SUCCUMBED TO ROE VERSUS WADE? CHRIS THANKS. I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS JUST NOTHING MORE THAN DISGRACE DOESN'T SURPRISE ME FOR ONE MINUTE. THESE LEFTIST DEMOCRATS , HOW WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THE RIGHT TO KILL BABIES ? THIS INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR BLOOD TO KILL. THEY WILL COME AFTER ANY OBSTACLE THAT WE TRY TO PUT IN FRONT OF THEM TO MAKE SURE AND JUST DO WHAT THEY DID. NEW YORK STAND THERE AND CHEER. IT'S A DISGRACE. IT'S A DISGRACE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND I'M SO GLAD THAT DREAM COURT RULED HOW IT DID AND THE FIGHT IS GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE STATES. THIS ISN'T OVER. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN A PRO LIFE LEADER FOR A LONG TIME, AND I'M NOT DONE FIGHTING UNTIL WE SEE THE END OF THIS. AMEN THE SUPREME COURT'S BEEN BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS. THE LEFT IS HAVING ANOTHER MELTDOWN OVER THE SUPREME COURT, LIMITING THE EPA'S REGULATION OF POWER PLANT EMISSIONS, A MAJOR BLOW TO THE DEMOCRATS. MANMADE GLOBAL WARMING RELIGION. HOW MUCH OF A VICTORY IS THIS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST GOVERNMENT'S ANTI PROSPERITY OVERREACH? WELL I HOPE I HOPE AMERICANS TONIGHT ARE REELING AND REALIZING WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS THAT THE E P A TOOK POWER AND NEVER HAD DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, IT WILL WEIGH OVER INTO THE ABUSE OF POWER. IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE A GOVERNOR IN A STATE AND YOU HAVE A CERTAIN TYPE OF ENERGY, NOBODY CAN TELL YOU NOBODY CAN TELL YOU. IT'S ILLEGAL INDIANA AND MY STATE. WE'RE SITTING ON HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF COAL. AND COAL MINES, SO I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST VICTORIES THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT WILL DIRECTLY DEAL WITH THIS ECONOMY, THE ENERGY WE PRODUCE IN OUR COUNTRY AND FINALLY MOVING OFF THE GREEN BILL AND THE GREEN PLAN, AND BIDEN IS CRAZY QUOTE UNQUOTE TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES . I CALL IT COMMON SENSE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDWEST, AND YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR DISTRICT LISTENERS. COMMON SENSE WILL TELL YOU WE GOT OFF THE ROAD SOMEWHERE AND WENT CRAZY LEFT TRYING TO BRING IT NOW BACK INTO MAKING SURE WE HAVE A PROSPEROUS, POSITIVE ECONOMY, AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT WITH THESE KIND OF RULINGS. NOTHING WRONG WITH AN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND OUR RESEARCH INTO FUTURE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AS WELL FINANCED, UH, SKODA'S ALSO RELEASING A CONTROVERSIAL OPINION TODAY ON THE TRUMP ERA BORDER POLICY KNOWN AS REMAIN IN MEXICO. THE HIGH COURT RULED THAT MR BIDEN CAN GET RID OF THAT POLICY AND THAT HE DIDN'T BREAK THE LAW. BUT THE CONGRESSWOMAN, I REMEMBER WHEN BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA CREATED THE DACA PROGRAM USING HIS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY, THE COURT SAID THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD NOT STOP DACA USING THAT SAME EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY YET NOW MR BIDEN WANTS TO END A TRUMP POLICY AND THE COURT SAYS, OH, THAT'S OK. HAS THE SUPREME COURT CODIFIED UNEQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW TREATING DEMOCRATS BETTER THAN REPUBLICANS WITH THIS RULING? WELL, LET ME JUST SAY THIS IS A DISASTROUS RULING, RIGHT? I MEAN , WHAT WE HAVE HAPPENING DOWN WITH, UH, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE BORDER BECAUSE JOE BIDEN OPENER BORDER JOE BIDEN IS THE ONE THAT SAID, COME ON, COME ON. NO RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER, AND NOW WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE CARTELS. 52 PEOPLE DEAD IN A SEMI MORE REPORTS TODAY OF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE ARE FINDING INSIDE THE CARDS. THIS IS INHUMANE. IT'S SICK. IT'S DISGUSTING. AND JOE. BIDEN OWNS THIS HORRIFIC, HORRIBLE DECISION . I WOULD CALL ON THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WORK FOR THE HUMANITY OF THE POPULATION ON BOTH SIDES HERE, WORK FOR AMERICA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BORDER IS SEALED AND CLOSED AND WE TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE OF OUR COUNTRY, AND WE STOPPED THE INHUMANE TREATMENT, ALLOWING INNOCENT PEOPLE TO DIE. TRYING TO COME ON BIDEN'S IDEA OF JUST COME ACROSS THAT RIVER. COME IN THOSE SEMIS, TAKE YOUR CHANCES AND SEE IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY LIVE TO DO IT. THAT'S SICK. THAT IS INHUMANE. THAT IS WHO THIS PRESIDENT. THIS IT IS AND YOU KNOW WHAT? AND VERY FEW, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE HENRY CUELLAR IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE CRITICIZED THAT POLICY AND BY THE WAY, YOUR STATE KNOWS FIRSTHAND THE DANGERS OF MR BIDEN'S OPEN BORDER POLICIES. YOU'RE SAYING RECORD HIGH FENTANYL DEATHS IN YOUR STATE, SO YOU'VE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION. TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR ILLICIT FENTANYL VICTIMS. WILL THIS LEGISLATION HOLD POLITICIANS LIKE MR BIDEN ACCOUNTABLE? AND IF NOT, WHAT WILL IT DO? WHERE IS THE THING? I AM SO FED UP CHRIS WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION, DOING NOTHING AND CAUSING THE DEATHS OF NUMEROUS YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT IN INDIANA. WE ARE A BORDER STATE BECAUSE OF THE POISONOUS FENTANYL THAT'S COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITY, AND THESE KIDS ARE ACCIDENTALLY OD'ING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT'S NOT JUST MY WORLD IF HE'S NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HELPING THESE FAMILIES RESTORE JUSTICE. I AM MY BILL SAYS AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR A STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, YOU CAN FILE A SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT AGAINST CHINA AND MEXICO AND THESE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE PRODUCING THIS POISONOUS FIT, NOT SENDING IT INTO OUR COUNTRY AND BRING JUSTICE TO THE FAMILIES OF THESE VICTIMS. IF HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT, I AM TOO MANY DEATHS IN MY DISTRICT TO JUSTIFY WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE BOARD, AND WE SEE EVERY DAY IN THE NEWS ON NEWSMAX. WHERE THESE GUYS ARE BRINGING IN FENTANYL AND A TINY TINY LITTLE BIT WILL KILL AN AMERICAN, IF NOT 100,000 TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPEN BORDER, BRINGING IN TOXIC POISON AND OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING. OH YEAH. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED OUT IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAD HOME WOULD HAVE KILLED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT BROUGHT THAT FENTANYL IN. THEY WERE RELEASED OUT ON THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.

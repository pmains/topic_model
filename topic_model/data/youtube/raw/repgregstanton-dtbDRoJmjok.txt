thank you very much chairman for holding this hearing the COBIT pandemic has impacted every sector of our economy and upended the transportation sector unlike anything that we have ever seen some since day one of this crisis our transportation workers have been on the front lines they have kept critical Goods and freight moving across the country help get people into critical services and their jobs and make sure planes continue to operate and make sure that and I make sure that infrastructure projects keep advancing across America for mr. Willis throughout this crisis it has been important to mitigate against the spread of the virus within the workforce minimizing exposure while workers are performing their duties and ensure sufficient staffing as efforts continue to reopen states and communities across the country our transit agencies taking the steps necessary to ensure the health and safety of our frontline workers and if not what more should be done only [Music] really about how important frontline transportation workers are could not agree more and we believe that many of which were included in the legislation to make sure that employers are complying you know from CDC guidelines and enforceable and that will actually occur you know getting masks out the frontline workers great or supportive of that but if there are not real federal mandate to make sure that employers are doing the right thing here in protecting workers and we're not doing enough so I think your your comments on how important is work 14 I went according to trying to work horses are really important if we believe that let's have been 270 means that we know that we know are asking that too many too many thank you for the answer and on the issue of when a worker test positive for covin 19 what steps are now being taken with other exposed individuals that's crucial if we're going you know again thanks for the answer next questions for mr. Shaw what assistance has your employer provided employees who fortunately have contracted kovin 19 or those that have been exposed to Cova 19 thank you for the question congressman the assistance that my employer has provided is basically the world FMLA family-first code that they put them out of work and give them the 40 hours that's about it alright thank you for that it's unfortunate to answer but I appreciate the the the answer itself miss Carr United unlike unlike elect major other major airline excuse me requires passengers to wear masts how is this policy worked across the company's fleet and our passengers generally hearing to the directive so as you said this is a company policy of Congressman which unfortunately means that we don't have the federal backing to support this on the aircraft if the passenger takes it off the most that I can do is to ask them to put it back on we need federal guidelines we need a federal mandate that states you must wear this on board the aircraft with the exception of taking a brief moment to have something to eat or drink we have to do this to ensure that the spread does not happen on board our aircrafts okay I really appreciate your advice and that in that regard it is well taken and I and the other members of the committee are listening thank you very much I yield back mr. chairman

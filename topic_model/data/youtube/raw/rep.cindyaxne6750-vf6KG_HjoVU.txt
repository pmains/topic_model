done in September 2018 Wells Fargo announced it planned to reduce its workforce by laying off as many as twenty six thousand workers and then in November of 2018 wells announced it was laying off a thousand employees four hundred of those were in Des Moines is that correct we we never announced that we said we were gonna lay off up to twenty six thousand employees what I said at a town hall where I did you lay off 400 employees in Des Moines I was just referring to the first part of you I appreciate that but that's not an accurate statement apparently what I said was that that between five that over the next three years we expect our total employment to reduce by between Thank You Evan ten percent and that I appreciate that but I'm cursin concerned about the people in my district we're four hundred of those people in Des Moines four hundred folks were displaced in the Moines and what was the reason for that layoff in Des Moines it depended upon their their job some of those folks were displaced because of the fact that that the amount of servicing demand that we had in the mortgage servicing business had declined there were other other reasons somewhere but so I have a signed affidavit here saying that an employee in Des Moines was told her job was being moved to India and that employees in that area have gone to India to train those replacements and then I've also heard from employees that are using your virtual classrooms for that same purpose to train people in other countries are these most recent layoffs really just you moving jobs overseas no that's that's incorrect okay well you've added more than ten thousand employees between India and the Philippines in the last five years and I know you're building a new facility in the Philippines for another 7,000 employees I believe can we expect that more of your planned layoffs are just going to be jobs moved overseas no I don't think that's gonna be the case we have 20,000 job openings in Wells Fargo today ninety ninety percent of those are here in the US probably more than that we hire between forty I appreciate that I fail to understand though how we're laying people off in this country and building jobs overseas thank you thank you the gentleman from Wisconsin

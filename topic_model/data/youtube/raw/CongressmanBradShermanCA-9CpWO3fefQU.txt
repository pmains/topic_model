Oh strained fraid chairman Roy said this is the most bipartisan committee in Congress I hope it's true we've got to avoid the temptation to evaluate everything even a British trade deal through the prison of whether it's a vehicle to express our support or opposition to President Trump I know Nigel Farage campaign with Trump but that's not a reason for Democrats to reject the Republicans to support any particular trade deal a million of the British people have signed a petition to exclude Donald Trump from their territory that is not a reason for Democrats to support or Republicans to reject a trade deal we've got if we want just a symbol when we don't have to look at the trade deal except its cover I suggest instead we not judge it by its cover but by the contents that have yet to be written and asked what's in it for American working families I look forward to talking to our witnesses about what should be in it and evaluating it a sense of jobs not a job evaluation for the administration gentleman yields back his time the chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island mr.

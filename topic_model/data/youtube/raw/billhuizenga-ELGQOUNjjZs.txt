well thank you and I thank my friend from Maryland for his leadership and my friend from California on this and I can't think of anything that is more important that we are talking about here in Washington because there are three critical foundations which our nation was built upon the freedom of speech the freedom of conscience and the right to life you know Thomas Jefferson the author of the Declaration of Independence and who was our third president said quote no provision in our Constitution ought to be dear to a man than what which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprise's of the civil authority and quote what he means by civil authority is government Mr Speaker I stand here today in the wall of the house of this chamber Americans freedom of conscience and our right to life is once again under attack and this time in California the this this law at issue in California is a classic example of government using its power to force citizens to promote messages that conflict with their personal beliefs pro-life pregnancy centers are a valuable asset to women to men and to the families and certainly to those babies and not only around the country but certainly in Michigan these centers provide at no charge practical advice and resources information emotional support for expecting mothers and and those fathers and families in need you know as leaders of this nation we should be off poor resources and praises for their efforts not forcibly targeting the targeting these these PRCs with unconstitutional government mandates you know through the work of my wife Natalie who who served for a number of years on the board of a local Pregnancy Resource Center in West Michigan I have seen firsthand the overwhelming positive impact that they have on the community my sister-in-law still serves on that board this is real impact in real lives to women and certainly to their babies you know maybe even more importantly even after that baby is born these resource centers will oftentimes provide care and clothing and education and emotional support and I know in my own church in West Michigan we regularly have those those dresser drives where we fill a dresser for that for that pregnancy center and that we are providing those diapers and providing that formula we're there to help those mothers make it through well the federal government should never force or attempt to coerce medical professionals employers resource centers to perform or promote abortions against their beliefs our basic freedoms and founding principles were established to protect us from that exact sort of intimidation so I want again thank my friends for leading this effort but these Pregnancy Resource Center's work we know that they offer compassionate care to those who need it the most and should be treasured by the government and not targeted by them and with that I thanks thank my friends again in the open

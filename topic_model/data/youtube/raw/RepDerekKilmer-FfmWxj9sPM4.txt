cognize for one minute Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to mark the end of Capitol Hill ocean week in my region the Pacific Ocean was and is central to Native American communities it also gave rides to a proud maritime tradition along our coasts entire industries sprang up and for generations of folks have made a good living as fishermen and boat builders dock workers and service members the Pacific is a place teeming with the diverse life that we ought to protect for future generations if we want to protect our natural resources for our children it's time to cherish our past and protect our future and with that in mind I'll suicune introduced the maritime National Heritage Act this legislation would designate the first and only heritage area in the country focused on maritime heritage it give Washington State greater access to resources to protect lighthouses and vessels and other landmarks that contribute to the history and who we are in Washington State this bill is a good way to remind folks what our oceans mean to us and why they are so vital Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman

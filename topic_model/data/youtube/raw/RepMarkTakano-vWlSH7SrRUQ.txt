I rise in support of my bill HR 5229 as amended mr. speaker the initial transition from military to civilian life is often the most difficult time for returning veterans the federal transition assistance program otherwise known as tap is designed to ease that shift by teaching veterans about their benefits and preparing them to enter the workforce attend school or both as the ranking member noted the program has largely been successful veteran unemployment is at a seven-year low however supporting transitioning veterans requires more than a one-size-fits-all program there are more than 135,000 former service members in my district and just one approach cannot meet the needs of every individual certain veterans communities are still being left behind women veterans Native American veterans veterans from the US territories and veterans with disabilities they face challenges and aspire to jobs that differ from the broader population of returning service members we cannot be satisfied with a program that allows large groups of veterans to slip through the cracks the improving transition programs for all veterans Act is a bipartisan bill that requires the VA to launch a research program examining if and how the current programs meets the needs of minority veterans groups in collaboration with the Department of Labor and defense the bill would require the VA to recommend changes to tap that would address and better serve these veterans in their pursuit of meaningful employment following their military service more than ever before our military reflects America's diverse mix of people and cultures each of these transitioning service members regardless of gender race or disability has made the same commitment to defending this nation all of them deserve our full support when they return home I'm proud to have introduced this bill with the gentlewoman from American Samoa ms radha wagon and i want to thank mr. Winthrop chair of the Economic Opportunity sub committee and chairman Miller for their support and moving this forward I call in my colleagues to pass to promptly pass this legislation thank you and I yield back

well it's uh great to see everyone and i'm really thrilled to be joined by fcc chair rosenwursel who's back in new hampshire virtually uh this time to continue our conversation about the importance of ensuring that people in new hampshire have access to high-speed affordable broadband recently we brought the chairwoman to the manchester public library and we had a few virtual events as well thanks to broadband connectivity we were able to get together that way to talk about this important issue which we know is not just a new hampshire issue uh it's an issue of national significance so this is another opportunity to join with chairwoman rosenworcel and um hear a little bit more about the resources and information that is available for folks i think it underscores the fcc's commitment to new hampshire and for a state like ours and for other states across the country we know that access to high-speed broadband is just not a luxury it's a necessity especially for the kind of future we hope to create i think the numbers about what we see in new hampshire um are very well known and um you know i know the chairwoman understands the unique situation that we face we've got five percent of folks in our state who live in an area where there's just no broadband infrastructure to speak of um in 62 of our state uh lives in an area where there's only one internet provider and so even where the infrastructure is available we know that broadband may be too expensive to reach everyone uh that means about 10 of new hampshire households don't even have an internet subscription so i think these are stark numbers and um we know that there are significant there's a significant population in our state that's dealing with a lack of access to affordable broadband so we've been working um with a number of communities to help secure secure funding for broadband infrastructure uh specifically obviously there's tremendous support in both the american rescue plan as well as the bipartisan infrastructure bill uh to build out uh the networks we need to support the needs of our businesses and our in our residents alike but beyond that we know that there's more to do when you look at the american rescue plan it provided 7.2 billion dollars in additional funding for fcc's e-rate program that helps get our schools and libraries connected to the internet we talked about that during the chairs last visit to new hampshire under this program schools and libraries are eligible for 100 reimbursement for costs associated with eligible services and equipment the kova 19 relief and government funding package that the house passed at the end of 2020 also included seven billion dollars for broadband initiatives and as i mentioned before the bipartisan infrastructure bill has about 65 billion dollars included in it for broadband and that includes uh 42.5 billion to fund a grant-based program uh to build out a broadband network and focus on deployment uh 600 million dollars to allow states to finance broadband deployment that's based on a bill that senator hassan worked on two billion dollars for programs funded by usda including the reconnect program that focuses specifically on rural areas and 14.2 billion dollars for an affordable connectivity benefit uh which builds on the emergency broadband benefit that i know uh chairwood chairwoman rosenwursel we've talked about uh during your last visit and that particular program provides a permanent thirty dollars a month voucher for low-income families to afford internet service so this is um a long way to say that we've been working to leverage resources for new hampshire to close that gap but there certainly is more work to do and we all know that access to high-speed broadband is essential in a 21st century economy it is essential to make sure that residents can access education government services health care commerce and all the other you know services that they can access online so we're going to continue to work on this but i'm just really pleased with the attention that the fcc has paid to new hampshire and has done to stand up uh an affordability program that's really made a difference so i'm eager to turn this over to chairwoman rosenwursel for some comments uh and then maybe we can get some additional details of um you know where we've been over the last year and where we hope to go with a new program chairwoman it's nice to see you and i'll turn it over to you yeah thank you congressman pappas um it's a treat to be here with you it was even more fun to join you in manchester you know i'm a new england native so it's not a hardship assignment to wind up coming up and visiting you back home hopefully i can do it again soon as you just rattled off there are more programs than we've ever had in this country before to get every household and everyone connected to high-speed internet service so i think we are on the cusp of generational change where we decide that getting every household connected is as important as it was a century ago to get every household connected to electricity a 100 of us nothing less we've got to figure out how to reach people in the most rural locations and also make sure everybody can afford it because as you mentioned during this pandemic we've gone online like never before it's for work it's for health care it's for education it's for entertainment you name it we all need to be connected and we absolutely want to make sure that affordability is not a barrier so the fcc has been running a program it now calls the affordable connectivity program that helps low-income households get online and stay online so they don't have to make hard choices between gas and groceries in their internet bill we've got 15 000 households in new hampshire that are already on it but the truth is i know there are others we can reach and we want to make sure that we get you the information you need so you can get the word out in new hampshire because i know that programs like this are most successful when people hear about it from folks in their community and people in institutions they trust so i'd love it if we could turn it over to someone from the fcc you could tell us a little bit more about the program if you have specific questions we can follow up after that and would you be able to take it away sure thing thank you let me pull up some slides real quickly here start by saying thank you chairwoman rosenworcel and thank you congressman pappas for inviting us to join you today the affordable connectivity program as you guys have mentioned is a long-term replacement to the emergency broadband benefit and it will allow students to connect to classrooms individuals to work remotely and it connects all of us to family friends telehealth services and other critical resources so the benefit provides eligible households with up to a 30 a month discount for broadband services including associated equipment rentals such as a modem up to a 75 discount for households located on tribal lands and it can provide a one-time discount of up to a hundred dollars for a laptop desktop computer or tablet purchase through a participating provider if the household contributes more than ten dollars and less than fifty dollars towards the purchase price it's important to note that the connected device must be provided by the same provider that the eligible household is receiving discounted broadband service from as part of the affordable connectivity program it's not a coupon or a rebate and it can't be used at a third-party retail store to buy a device the acp is limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount per eligible household and it's not a direct to consumer benefit so it's a discount off the monthly service bill and or device and then the provider seeks reimbursement directly from the program and the program is administered by the universal service administrative company they also administer the lifeline program and they host the application portal which is acpbenefit.org so we'll talk about who's eligible now a household is eligible for the affordable connectivity program if the household income is at or below 200 of federal poverty guidelines or if a member of the household meets at least one of the following criteria they participate in certain assistance programs such as snap medicaid federal public housing assistance ssi wic or lifeline they participate in some tribal specific programs such as bureau of indian affairs general assistance tribal tna tanf or food distribution programs on indian reservations if they participate in the national school lunch program or school breakfast program including through the usda community eligibility provision and that's for either the current school year or the previous school year and if they if someone in the household has received a federal pell grant during the current award year or if they meet the eligibility criteria for participating providers existing low-income internet program and keep in mind that a member of the household must only meet one of those eligibility criteria not all six of the ones we talked about in order to be eligible for the program current lifeline participants are automatically and are automatically eligible and in most cases they don't need to apply separately for the acp but they do need to select a service plan in order to start receiving the benefit and households can receive both the lifeline and the acp benefits at the same time and they can be applied to the same qualifying service or separately to a lifeline service and an acp service with the same or different providers so for example you could have a home internet service supported by acp and a wireless service supported by lifeline the program opened for enrollment on december 31st and there are two steps households need to take to enroll the first is to go to acp benefit to complete an online application or print out and mail in an application you can also call 877-384-2575 to request a paper application be mailed to you that you can then fill out in return after they've completed the application they need to contact their preferred participating provider to select a plan and to have the discount applied to their bill some providers may have an alternative application that they ask households to complete and it's critical for how eligible households to remember that they need to both apply for the program and contact a participating provider to select a plan and this is true even if you want to apply the benefit to your existing service with a participating provider already in the program i'm going to share some important consumer protections that are part of the affordable connectivity program so the affordable connectivity program rules include some new consumer protections consumers can choose the service plan that best meets their needs including a plan they may already be on consumers can't be denied access to the program or program supported services based on their credit eligible households can't be excluded based on prior debt with a participating provider consumers can't be forced into more expensive or lower quality plans in order to receive the acp consumers can change their benefit to a different participating per service provider at any time and the program rules are also designed to reduce the potential for bill shock or other financial harms for participating consumers and in addition to those protections we've also created a dedicated acp complaint process and that's available at consumercomplaints.fcc.gov next i wanted to quickly touch on what some legacy ebv households that are transitioning to the acp program should expect in advance of the march first end of the transition period uh households enrolled in the ebb program as of 12 31 21 will continue to receive their current monthly benefit until march 1st of 2022 most emergency broadband benefit households will not have to take any action to continue receiving the new 30 monthly benefit after the transition period ends on march 1st households located on qualifying tribal lands will continue to receive a 75 monthly benefit and will not need to take any action to continue receiving the affordable connectivity program benefit after the transition period ends on march 1st the monthly discount for all legacy ebv participants not located on qualifying tribal lands will be reduced to 30 and consumers should contact their provider if they're concerned about a possible increase in their monthly bill or they're interested in changing to a different service plan we do have a toolkit available just like we did for ebb so you can go online and find a number of great resources that you can download print out and customize so to help us spread the word about the acp program and i've got some resources here as well fcc.gov acp is where you can find all the information about the program again the number to call for support or to request a mailing application is 877-384-2575 and you can find our toolkit at fcc.gov forward slash acp toolkit and if you have additional questions after today's after you've seen the video or today's event you can email acpinfo fcc.com and with that i'll turn it back over to you congressman well ed thanks

and stakeholders who can help us disseminate this information to our district and across new hampshire i really appreciate that um just one thing i wanted to highlight again i know the programs are transitioning uh march 1st so if um you know these thousands of households in new hampshire that are enrolled in the emergency broadband benefit will probably have a seamless transition to the new program but when will um new individuals and households be eligible to get online with the acp so i i can jump in here they they could start signing up for acp on december 31st of 2021 so today they can go online and enroll and start to receive that benefit terrific well thanks very much for that clarification and uh thank you again uh madam chair for your time here today and for bringing us all

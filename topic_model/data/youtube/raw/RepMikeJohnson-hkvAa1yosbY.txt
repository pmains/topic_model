good afternoon and thank you for joining us today this important panel which we're going to discuss keeping our community safe for all americans making sure that families can live in peace and making sure that every child can play safely in their front yard i'm matt whitaker i'm the co-chair of the center for law and justice at the america first policy institute working right alongside my co-chair pam bondi who i'm very proud to work with as many of you know prior to joining afpi i was the acting attorney general in the trump administration i've been a former u.s attorney in a previous administration and have been at the department of justice over seven and a half years seven and a half years in total um you know i have been attracted to being part of afpi for a long time as many of you have because when it was formed it was a creation of a lot of people that i thought were rock stars in the trump administration no one bigger or better than brooke rollins who is just an amazing leader of this group and one of the most important interests i think for the preservation of our republic is what this center works on which is maintaining the rule of law and supporting the rule of law requires a commitment to many key principles including adhering to the original intent of our founding fathers as evidenced in the constitution understanding our shared commitment to the rule of law and the law as written and not at the whims of unelected nameless faceless bureaucrats or judges in black robes and making sure in addition to all that that we hold criminals accountable to the law when they violate it respecting and defending the rule of law necessarily touches upon several issues that are important to the america first agenda first and foremost is supporting the men and women of law enforcement making sure and ensuring that we have a stable and robust law enforcement community that upholds constitutional rights of our citizens and making sure that again we back and support the men and women of law enforcement who stand as the bulwark against criminality and lawlessness we must also protect our cherished second amendment rights and recognize that the right to keep and bear arms is essential to a free people we must hold elected officials accountable when they refuse their responsibilities office whether they through their executive leadership support defunding the police and compromising safety of communities we need to hold them accountable when they're social justice activists masquerading as prosecutors and refusing to sink punishment against criminals who repeatedly ravage our communities and we also need to make sure that the rule of law stands for combating human trafficking and illegal drug trafficking and finally we need to keep our most vulnerable citizens in our communities and in our schools safe from violence and so that everyone can have like i said a safe and stable environment to learn to live and to flourish so with that i'm going to turn over to my co-chair pam bondi why thank you general whitaker uh so because we're all about law and order today i can't think of three better human beings to be on this panel with us and i have the honor of introducing them all representative mike johnson of louisiana he has represented louisiana's fourth district since 2017 and you sure have distinguished yourself as a conservative among conservatives a true leader he's vice chair of the republican house caucus and previously served as chair of the republican study committee which if you're not familiar with it look that up it is the largest conservative caucus in congress prior to be elected prior to be being elected to congress he served in the louisiana house of representatives and before that and joined enjoyed a distinguished career as an attorney and true champion for conservative causes and i got to know him briefly during impeachment round one and he is a true hero and an american patriot who is just a great man so thank you um our our next our next panelist is sheriff bill waybourne who is also a friend of ours and you've got a cheering section over there all right sheriff waybourne has over 40 years of law enforcement experience currently serves as the elected sheriff of tarrant county texas a position that he's held since 2017. since assuming that role he's been on the forefront of developing the department's first human trafficking and intelligence units drawing on his experience to modernize and enhance department operations he's worked with texas lawmakers to expand texas's concealed carry and open carry handgun laws and it's an honor for me to introduce you sheriff waybourne thank you [Applause] next but far from last is matt and i are very close with general eric schmidt thank you for joining us eric when i was attorney general if i needed a conservative cause a conservative brief signed my first call was to eric schmidt thank you for everything that you've done as attorney general to fight for all of conservative causes eric has been the chief law enforcement officer in missouri since 2019 after serving as a state treasurer he also is the one who was able to obtain a preliminary injunction against the biden administration over its attempt to end title 42 that we know has been at the forefront of maintaining border security um a.g schmidt also served in the missouri state senate and eric thank you for everything you've done for our conservative causes thank you that yeah so my first question is going to be for you sheriff and you know you know pam said you spent 40 years in law enforcement you've distinguished yourself and i've you know as the bible says there's nothing new under the sun however i'm sure in 2015 when ferguson happened in baltimore and now you know minneapolis you see this movement to not only defund the police but to recommission redirect take resources away from law enforcement and put them in other community services um you know how has that affected uh the you know law enforcement community means a law enforcement officer yourself how has that impacted law enforcement how does it affect your recruiting and retention how are we going to make law enforcement a career uh that that is once again and i think i don't think it was ever not admirable so i don't want my questions because i think law enforcement has so much respect for the minimum law enforcement but but as a as a public policy consideration how do we restore it to what what kids grow up to want to be wear the blue and to protect their communities well first of all thank y'all it's an incredible honor to be on this panel with you all and here today from texas it's a lot cooler here by the way as uh is the ferguson effect was rolling along and we thought we were recovering from it and then of course 2020 happened in all of that business and the defund the police movement and in texas our legislatures took a stand on it and outlawed it said you can't defund the police in texas which was incredible and and i hope that the other states follow suit but it still the philosophy and the attitude has still affected every every city across the country every place ever county and state because the difficulty of recruiting today because of those things is just incredible we every agency that i know is down and you look at the big agencies across the nation like chicago that's 800 officers down dallas is 600 officers down over in tarrant county sheriff's office were nearly 200 down and they're not coming in the door and so it had an incredible effect on recruiting and retention people are bailing out they're just saying we don't need this and and they don't feel like they're back they don't feel like the politicians are gonna take make sure that they're okay that they're gonna hang them instead and uh so they're backing way off of that and sheriff i really feel like it's coming back around more towards law enforcement more than ever the polling shows up but take that out of it i mean the policies people care about number one being safe absolutely that's what they care about safe in their communities and that includes respecting the men and women in blue general schmidt speaking of that we talk about a lot these rogue prosecutors and you know we've been talking about it i think before it was popular to talk about them and now i think people are seeing folks are seeing the impact that they're having on their communities when they're letting murderers out of jail when they're arresting a store clerk in new york who is a victim of a crime for defending himself at his place of work i mean people are seeing this more and more and more and how important it is to our country to have great elected officials at the state level can you with your vast experience in law enforcement can you talk a little bit about that yeah prosecutor yeah we've seen it in st louis for example you've got a soros-funded prosecutor it's been a total disaster a total disaster in st louis has suffered the surrounding region has suffered it's hard to have a growing economy when people are afraid to walk from here to there so we've experienced that in missouri you've got that in kansas city as well and i think it's it's emblematic of a much larger issue which is the less acceptance of lawlessness you see it at the southern border you see it uh with a lot of the actions that the bite administration has taken totally ignoring the law knowing that they're wrong and it's up to them the state agencies to push back and ultimately win but you see this permeating it's sort of a party platform now when you had the leadership under the trump administration and president trump specifically who was unafraid to stand up and say this is wrong we are going to support the men and women of law enforcement we need to make sure we're prosecuting the bad guys and it you know regardless of your woke lexicon this is the right thing to do and so we've seen it specifically in with these prosecutors in big cities like st louis the numbers are a disaster and the police officers will tell you they won't even take the cases that they're bringing to them the warrant officers won't take the cases you also see when you those folks get into office you have a lot of experienced prosecutors in those offices who find meaning in you know prosecuting and when the leadership at the top is telling them not to do these things they've left in mass you have over 100 percent turnover in that office the conviction rate has plummeted they have people who got out of law school a year ago doing um a lot of their grand jury work so it's worse than people think because the headlines will show you the one the murder that's been let out but the truth of the matter is all these other cases are being handled by folks who are very inexperienced or who are these sort of woke ideologues who have no you know desire to really prosecute violent crimes so i think it's very important for you know america first conservatives be out there be unafraid to talk about these things and talk about the challenges and how we need to support law in order we need to support the men and women of law enforcement when these defund the police efforts start to actually hit the budgets we got to stand up and we have to fight back and i think that's the key yeah i was just going to follow up on that eric you know i think we've seen a movement to recall in california especially a couple of prosecutors that are soros funded i mean what you know a lot of a lot of uh what america needs is just the people to be restored to their rightful places the sovereign in this in this government whether it's state you know or local or even federal you know what what are what are the mechanisms uh you know each state's different california does have a recall what what is what's what what are what are the opportunities for this the ordinary citizen to to take back kind of the rule of law and and have it executed by these by these prosecutors well i think we need to demand better number one right and it's up to us as leaders people in this room and talking to our friends and neighbors to demand better but you also have a situation where you know every state's different we don't actually have original jurisdiction my office the attorney general's office doesn't have original jurisdiction on state crimes we have to be asked to come in and help that happens a lot in rural missouri but not so much uh in the cities and so we've got had to get creative so missouri was the first state in the country to have our assistant ags deputized as assistant u.s attorneys so we could prosecute violent crime in the big cities in st louis and kansas city under federal law and so we were you know carjackings and so i recognized very early on that the prosecutors weren't willing to do their jobs and so we have over 800 charges to date over 600 indictments to date we have also taken on clearing the backlog of sexual assault kits across the state because a lot of local prosecutors weren't you know in the big cities weren't interested in that they're talking about normalizing human trafficking in many ways by you know decriminalizing sex work is what they call it we know that human trafficking is a real problem so we've taken that on we've partnered with federal and local officials on human trafficking and so i think a lot of this is leadership it's finding the deficiencies of what they're doing which are stark and have real impacts on real people and i think that's important to point out i had a an older black woman come up to me who she said i'm tired of sweeping up glass on sunday mornings and so these are communities that we need to fight for and a lot of that is just enforcing the law prosecuting people who are committing violent crime partnering where we can and making sure people have respect for the men and women who wear that uniform you know and eric it's not just about what you said before it's about helping everybody not just going after the violent criminals because often we have so many drug courts in our country now that help so many people and if we don't have the right law enforcement officers out there and the right ag's and the right prosecutors to help these people to put them in diversion courts so they can get the help they need um our country's really lacking there in that respect too so it's across the board and i'll bring up we had the big opioid settlement in missouri a lot of states have and i know you have been a leader on this for years on the opioid epidemic those dollars we made sure they're not just going to general revenue dollars to be lost they're going to treatment and to help people who really need it and so again those are issues that we can take the lead on as republicans and i think show the folks in our states and across the country that we are the right folks to lead us forward that's right and on a very serious note sheriff waybourne let's talk about iovaldi for a little while um i was attorney general when parkland happened valentine's day on the ground notifying those families still talk to them liberal conservative doesn't matter to this day still talk to so many of those families a lot of mistakes were made there we know ilvaldi a lot went on there can you give us your feelings on hardening these schools and keeping our children safe while they're in school absolutely and first of all you know on behalf of texas law enforcement we're very sorry there's epic failure of law enforcement and new validity that is not the typical response of law enforcement is that i believe that that we have got to look at hardening schools and take it serious if i was saying one thing to a principal today are you ready are you ready to go are you ready to harden this target to protect our kids and the beat officers that are around that because what happens is for those of you who don't know about active shooters the job of the cop is the first one on scene goes in and goes after the bad guy and we keep coming in until we neutralize him and as sheriff judd from florida says we're going to shoot him and shoot him a lot but is that i think that we've got a we've got to recognize that we've got to do it we need an immediate response not a first responder and what i mean about that is a good guy with a gun inside ready to go whether it be a retired police officer or active duty police officer or a well-trained vetted staff member in that school in texas many many teachers are out qualifying today as we speak and they're getting ready to go and so at america first we have a school safety issue brief that we've released you can find it in the back of the room and also on our website but i don't think we can um talk enough about school safety now and protecting our kids yeah and pam in the trump administration we issued you know a school safety commission president trump appointed uh various departments and agencies to come together and come up with best practices to to take a a a sense of what everyone was doing and just then share that information i'm congressman you know i'm sure you feel it from your constituents but every time we have an event like uvalde uh you know sort of the american people rightly say you know do something congress and the real question boils down to the media immediately goes to gun control immediately goes to infringing our second amendment rights uh in in your experience you know sort of what what can congress do but most importantly what should congress do in response to these tragedies we could do an entire panel on that and of course there's a knee-jerk reaction every time there's a tragedy and our hearts go out but often the effort is directed in the wrong way and towards the gun instead of the person and the human heart and the house judiciary committee where i serve jim jordan and i were just talking about this in a podcast on friday about how they always bring these misguided efforts we have a responsibility to oppose the radical left's legislation because it's not only misguided in most cases it's also blatantly unconstitutional instead of going to the root problem i think it was thoreau that said there are thousands hacking at the branches of evil the one who is striking at the root and we need to go to the root causes of this and what i love about afpi and and the america first idea is that we're advancing the foundational principles of our country the rule of law is one of those right along with individual freedom and limited government and peace through strength and fiscal responsibility and free markets human dignity the sanctity of every single human life i think we need to begin there in addressing the problem go to the root of it instead of trying to infringe upon the second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens which is ultimately where this leads mike what can um congress do regarding our second amendment we have a lot of work to do and when we take back the majority in november we're going to get right on that yes i think my voice went lower instinctively because the offensive line here i feel like a little bit inadequate okay so um so i was a tight end by the way okay sure yeah um i was the water boy i'll help you out um so so pam there's a lot that congress should do that we need to do and in the majority we're going to one thing for example you talked about the good guys with the guns just two weeks ago in the indiana mall a good guy with a gun a good samaritan stopped an atrocity there right the we have to recognize that law-abiding citizens have the right thankfully the supreme court has had some good rulings as of late recognize that you have a right to self-defense and it's not just in your home but out in public as well congress has a role there i love the idea of concealed carry reciprocity you know think about the logic of this i mean sheriff if you thank you yes we when i drive across state lines to go visit a friend in another state i don't have to go get a driver's license in that state right why if you can pass the basic requirements to conceal carry in your state you ought to be able to do that everywhere and it just makes sense that's a fundamental freedom that we have completely agree i thought i'd get support from you and and uh there there are lots of uh things that we're talking about and this is worthy of discussion but maybe there should be uniform standards for concealed carry permits you know for all the states there's no reason that a law-abiding citizen california in new york should not be able to protect themselves and carry their firearm just as all the rest of us well let me tell you how this is playing out now so missouri led the briefing on the new york pistol and rifle case which was the seminal case that just happened this term where basically you had the heller decision 15 years ago that affirmed yes this is an individual right this well-regulated militia stuff that the left talks about this the second amendment protects your god-given right to defend yourself individually and then what happened the lower courts start chipping away at that and so you have the new york pistol and rifle case because in new york you have to go to a bureaucrat and prove that you are at risk or that you were in danger and then that bureaucrat might give you a concealed carry permit so we challenged that took at the supreme court and we won so that's a big case but what do you see happening now though in missouri just last week the fbi which has become completely politicized it's going after parents showing up to school board meetings objecting to masking and crt that's what they're doing and by the way not arresting people who are trying to intimidate supreme court justices but now they're going and trying to audit local sheriff offices to figure out who has a concealed carry permit in missouri and we fired back a letter that day once we became aware of it you're not doing that in our state we are going to push back and missouri is a constitutional carry state so we don't you know you don't even really need a concealed carry permit and uh you know the left thought that that was going to be the wild west and the shoot out of the okay corral that did not happen people have a right to defend themselves but to your point it gives us a great opportunity why this organization is so important it gives us an opportunity to explain to folks what the foundation of this country really was what the founders said was is that everybody had it backwards you don't need these rights you don't need permission from a king or a queen they come from god and government is just this shared project to protect your god-given rights certainly not to infringe upon them in the second amendment it's a big piece of that and your lawsuit just had if you have to ask the state for permission to exercise a right it's really not a right at all correct so yeah that was a great piece of litigation you know matt let's talk about a little bit about these big cities you know you're hearing starbucks now they're um they're pulling out of some of their biggest liberal cities because even starbucks they're scared to have stores open for their employees and i i don't know exactly it was the big liberal cities we can name you know portland seattle san francisco probably in new york um but i've always said bad people are always going to be able to get guns and any type of weapon to hurt us but it's the law-abiding citizens who have a second amendment right to defend ourselves but what do you think more um gentlemen i'll pose this question to all of you about these big cities now where they're they're burning they're they're crashing they're falling apart and i just heard in some town an entire police department an entire police department i just heard it on the news just resigned because they don't have the backing because sheriffs of course are independently elected but most police chiefs report to the mayor and you know if you don't have a mayor to back you up and not to not fund you and you want to reimagine the police in the middle of the night and send a social worker we love social workers but out to a domestic violence call you know that's fraught with peril i guess i'll just use the st louis example we have a mayor who's a radical leftist along with that prosecutor i mentioned earlier we actually the city of saint louis owes the state of missouri five million dollars for some judgment like a decade ago i did not make a big deal this we sent an email to their office said look keep the 5 million if you use it for more police officers ok your 200 police officers short you're trying to defund the police here's five million dollars to hire more cops to keep people safe didn't i didn't do a press conference on it we didn't you just she holds a press conference the next day well the attorney general is not going to tell me what to do if he wants to give us the money for vaccine incentives that's great but so there is a natural disposition for them to be opposed to these efforts to actually fund police departments so they talk about that they're actually the city of st louis is figuring out a way to find a million dollars to transport people outside the state of missouri to get abortions now because missouri has different laws of course in the state of illinois and so it is a it's a pervasive attitude of not not supporting the rule of law to figure out a way to build up their woke bona fides this is what we're up against and i think it's really important i mean when president trump was in office you had i mentioned our safer streets initiative where we had lawyers designating in the u.s attorney's office when operation legend happened remember you had this in 2020 you had you know all these you know sky-high murders record-breaking numbers in saint louis and kansas city there were there was help from the feds wanted to help because of president trump and we had the ability to prosecute those additional you know crimes that you know or bring those additional charges because we had the infrastructure and the bandwidth so i think this is leadership it's um the cities they won't prosecute the bad guys they use the money for these other initiatives and we've got to i think we just have to be strong and just say law and order matters it's fundamental for people to live their lives and be free is that as and i didn't answer a good question the rule of law as you just spoke of is so incredibly important and for this thing called the american deemed dream to flourish we've got to have rule of law and face and the gatekeepers on that are the american law enforcement period they get it starts right there before it ever gets to the court and what's happened in these wok cities is in some cases there's been some incredible police chiefs there and being a former chief is that they have got to be willing to be fired to stand on principle and walk away from that job and until we see more off chiefs that have the courage to say no not here not now and the first rock thrown we're going after you and uh but that's not happening in those cities so with entire agencies responding is not surprising who would want to work there that you're gonna and i've traveled the country and i know boots on the ground and that's what they're telling me says we don't have the backing and so they're walking away can i just add that ideas have consequences and i was doing town halls back in louisiana the last couple weeks we were out of session and anywhere i go louisiana is kind of a microcosm my district is for the rest of the country and and people are so distraught over what they see happening they're so distraught with the leadership not only of the big blue cities like we have in new orleans but these other cities are around the country and they can't understand why and you have to break it down to its simplest terms and it's what the two of you are alluding to is that there are two different philosophies we're in a battle of world views right now right and and we are and and the america first agenda believes in the greatness of america because we believe in the foundational principles that we've all been discussing here we believe that's worthy of defense we believe we need to pass it along to the next generation as reagan said it's not inherited in the bloodstream it takes our effort and work in defense but the other team the other side believes they have they have a very different vision for the country they have disdain for the founding principles that we all believe in and they're trying to trade it for something else a european style socialist you know utopian dream which is folly of course it begins with the premise you said something a moment a moment ago general that's so true we recognize that the declaration 246 years ago we made the bold proclamation that we recognize that our rights don't derive from government they come from god because if the government's the one that can give you rights yeah [Applause] obviously if the government's the one that can give you your rights the government is also the one that can take them away so we believe in inalienable rights and you know i just say we just had our 246th birthday as a nation we're still an experiment on the world stage that self-governance is an experiment a government of the people by the people for the people we are only going to preserve it if we keep these principles first and we defend them yeah that's such a great point mike i want to pick up on i guess a theme that's running through this but i you know as a former prosecutor i sort of want to hang a lantern on it and it's something that general schmidt mentioned is is we have especially in our major cities as pam was alluding to too we have prosecutors who aren't taking cases from the cops you have 80 of gun crimes in new york city are not being prosecuted they're being dismissed so you catch a bad guy with a gun and it's dismissed and and you know god heaven forbid i hope they don't give the guns back but you know some of these these police departments are messed up in how they respond to these things but it's these low-level offenders and the lawlessness which those cases not being taken up by the prosecutors i'd like each one of your thoughts on your perspective and pam i know you lived this in florida while you were attorney general but what is uh the importance of doing those uh lower level cases you know the smash and grab cases the the the the stealing in broad daylight those types of cases and how that by doing those cases makes actually a better environment for law and order and for peace and prosperity in the in in our in our cities if you are working traffic and you give a tolerance of 25 miles an hour over people will do it and e the broken window theory is alive and well and it should be enforced if you're the the nickel dime things if they're not enforced you're going to get bigger and bigger issues if code enforcement's not enforced you're going to get bigger and bigger issues it is an incredible thing that they let those things go because all that's going to happen is more trouble is going to come walking in it it was said one time that what we tolerate in moderation our children will excuse in excess you think about the implications of that and and going to the root of this the root of the cause of this is that this other side that we're battling against right now in a legislative sense legal sense they don't recognize right and wrong the reason they begin with the incorrect premise the false premise is because they've denied the existence of the creator who tells us what is right and wrong and so it's all relative it's all you know they don't even they believe in the inherent goodness of all people they don't believe in the fall of man the fallen corrupt nature of man they don't then believe that power can corrupt and absolute power can corrupt absolutely so the checks and balances and uh the the diffusion of power amongst many that it's not an important principle to them if you begin with the wrong idea it leads to dangerous consequences and that's what we're seeing well and you and we don't talk about this enough by the way this moral relativism that exists which is a much more kind of philosophical discussion that permeates all sorts of institutions um and certainly the left but when the rubber really meets the road as a prosecutor um those folks if they believe there are no consequences to actions that endanger other people right that burglary leads to the carjacking and you see an epidemic of carjacking now and by the way just by way of technology they're becoming there's more and more carjackings because in order to steal a vehicle you almost need someone in the car now you're not you're not hot wiring a 78 buick like you know these are key fobs and people are in the car it's very dangerous and so i think that we need to you know again be resolute on that one of the things that that i'm most proud of is my time as attorney general is we don't normally get cases in the city of st louis but there was a conflict case actually from my predecessor josh hawley i would never get a conflict case now from from the st louis prosecutor but it existed and uh early on in my term i actually wanted to prosecute that case myself it was a murder in the city of st louis for someone who actually had come here legally was about two weeks away from from ethiopia two weeks away from bringing his family to the united states he was working two jobs worked at a convenience store antonio muldrew walked into that store waited for everyone to leave pulled out a gun and shot this individual three times went to the back of the counter more people came in actually made change and did transactions while this individual was on the ground begging for his life when the rest of the people left put a bullet in his head and ended his life and the dream of his family and walking you know being four feet away from him and making the case in front of that jury we got the conviction and stood on you know outside after and for all the cameras and i wanted the people of st louis to know that there was someone who actually cared about crime and violence in the city and was willing to take the time to prosecute someone who had done that and i think that if we do that more often if we actually go to places and tell them how important this is this and this why this forum's so important what afpi is doing the law and order it is a foundational matter people deserve to feel safe in their communities no matter what their zip code is and they got to know that we care enough that we're going to do the hard work and we're going to call out this nonsense that's happening across the country because people intuitively know it's wrong they they they know it's wrong and we have to have the courage to say it's wrong and take those actions like prosecuting the bad guys clearing this backlog you know of of sexual assault kits working on human trafficking all the things that people can see and we bring more people to our side that way right so at afpi when the amazing brook rollins called me and asked if um i would co-chair with matt whitaker the law and justice section of afpi and with the great work of linda mcmahon and larry and so many others and chad now as our executive director i don't think we ever dreamed that we'd be having to talk about all of these issues and that was just a year ago but i think on a good note i think when people are driving to get their five dollar a gallon gas at the gas station they want to be safe while they're pumping their gas and i really think we're seeing a turn in our country for more good and that's something that matt and i really want to highlight at um at our center at law and justice is all the great work that our great police officers do and our federal officers you know you hear us talk about the fbi 99 percent of them are great agents out there working hard every day and all of our sheriffs in law enforcement who we want to continue to be law enforcement officers and our great prosecutors out there to support them and be there to have their their backs so you're going to be seeing a lot more positive things coming out highlighting and focusing on all the great men and women and it sounds corny but you thank them whenever you see a prosecutor or a military person of course i'm sure you do or a police officer i think it just goes volumes now if you're thanking them if you ever notice now how they really react and smile and say thank you for saying that i think people appreciate it now more than ever in this world i agree with you and we actually in our office started something called the back the blue award and so we go around missouri for for acts of of valor and kindness big and small we go around and we reward and recognize those individual officers it could be somebody pulling somebody out of a burning vehicle before first responders get there um somebody going above and beyond and the ultimate sacrifice obviously but also the officers who are helping those neighborhood kids with the lemonade stand and i think that's just so important for us to to recognize the work that they do we haven't touched on it yet but one of the responsibilities we have in congress is oversight in the next congress as well and we have to work on first de-politicizing the department of justice it's been completely weaponized under this administration and when we're talking about the foundations and the institutions the greatest jeopardy of this is that if if a free people if a government of mine for the people don't believe that their system of justice is actually blind there's a reason lady justice wears a blindfold right equal justice under laws is chiseled into the marvel above the supreme court building if people begin to lose their faith in that system it's very difficult to hold a constitutional republic together and that's where we are the faith in our institutions is at historic lows and it's it's it's treacherous for our survival you know ronald reagan in his famous farewell address he said you know they call me the great communicator but i really wasn't i'm paraphrasing him he said i was just communicating great things and they're the same great things that have guided our nation since his founding our our challenge our calling the work of afpi and all of us individually is to defend the great things they don't change that's what made america the most exceptional nation in the history of the world and we lose those things at our peril and i'm so grateful for y'all's work if i don't get another chance to say it thank you that that was beautiful is i i agree with what pam just said i still believe as ronald reagan said we're the shining city on the hilltop we might need to change a few light bulbs but we still that shining city and we've still got great optimism and i believe that law enforcement is going to come back to where it needs to be i'd love to see on television some more andy griffiths and adam twelves and and uh those type of shows but uh but i believe the nobility is coming back in in the in the eyes of the people and we will once again be a place where you can walk the streets with safety and uh and feel good about it and not worry about it and flourish good well i this has been a a great discussion i want to thank each and every one of you for being a part of this i think actually the rule of law is uh restoring i think it's going to take every single one of us working at every place i think it's ever going to take everyone in this room i know that there's a lot of patriots in this room and i would encourage you to do exactly what pam said which is to every time you see a member of law enforcement thank them for doing their hard work thank their tell them that you thank their family for the sacrifices that they make every day to keep us safe as an american people um you know this is uh this is such an important piece of the america first agenda uh you know making sure that the rule of law is uh the bedrock principle of our of our republic and making sure that that we have those that are standing in the gap and defending the rule of law um every day so i want to thank every all of you for uh being here today but especially i want to thank our panelists and and pam thank you for co-chairing this wonderful center with me thank you all god bless you

fact that you're now recognizes Miss Custer from New Hampshire for five minutes thank you Mr chairman and thank you to the witnesses joining us today for your testimony in particular I want to thank Mr Delena who's been such a great resource for us in New England I really appreciate our work together I'm co-chair of the bipartisan task force on mental health and substance use disorder with my Republican colleague Brian Fitzpatrick and David trone of Maryland and we are all grateful for the progress that this committee made in the 117th Congress passing important mental health and substance use disorder legislation and in particular the restoring hope for mental health and well-being that I might add past the house with 402 votes I think it was probably the most bipartisan bill in the 117th Congress but as we all know there's much more to be done I'm working closely with my a colleague from Delaware congresswoman blunt Rochester to reintroduce our legislation the stop fentanyl act and I hope that the chair will bring that up in a subcommittee on a future date this bipartisan bill was introduced in the 117th to invest in fentanyl detection and data collection stem the supply of Fentanyl and address demand for synthetics through overdose prevention and substance use disorder treatments as Mr Chester's testimony stated fentanyl is a complex National Security criminal justice and Public Health Challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach and that's why the stop fentanyl act devotes resources to enhance fentanyl surveillance empowering officials at the state local and federal level to support detection and Reporting we must continue to aggressively pursue the sources of fentanyl that have been described here today stopping the flow of materials for synthetic drugs into this country and cutting off the paths that bring these heartful substances into our communities this bill supports efforts to hold Bad actors accountable both at the international governance level and with the social media companies that our families and friends use every day as the experts in this room know a public health approach must be complemented by a well-resourced data-driven plan to stem the supply of fentanyl stop fentanyl is the path forward to respond to the challenges before us and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues on this committee who are interested in a comprehensive approach to protect our companies from Fentanyl our communities I asked for your partnership and support in order to best craft Solutions it's essential to definitively understand the problems Mr Delena it's great to be with you and I wanted to ask you you've seen how these efficient issues affect communities like my district in New Hampshire and the DEA has worked to prevent shipment through the postal system and crack down on chemists overseas as you described what is the top way that fentanyl enters the country and where should Congressional efforts be focused to complement your entries work your agency's work congresswoman thank you for the question and and for your work uh when it comes to fentanyl um a majority of the fentanyl that's coming into our communities crosses the Southwest border um predominantly through the ports of Entry but they use any possible way to get it across Mr Chester what role can hide us play in expanding our surveillance and data collection efforts moving forward our heighters play a vital role uh because uh they're in all 50 states uh they cover uh the vast majority of the population of the United States and 99 of 100 major metropolitan areas they're the ones that can provide us the bottoms up information of what's actually happening in their communities and they provide this information Nationwide they're extremely valuable resource and is there coordination and sufficient resources for data collection and surveillance to know um I Heard a reference to a new substance today that I wasn't even aware of but to know when there are emerging threats yes ma'am uh in fact the hiders are very valuable not only are they um do they work effectively in their own right but they are networked together very well particularly through their drug Intelligence Officers who are able to share that information and be able to to be able to determine Nationwide Trends based upon the local data that they're seeing from their particular height is I think that data collection and surveillance is going to be really important um Dr gandartra I'm going to have to probably leave this question for the record but once fentanyl enters our borders how does samsa work with First Responders to educate on interacting with fentanyl uh thank you for that question I will point to our grant program the First Responders comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act that educates uh uh First Responders firemen police officers on how to administer fentanyl how to recognize the signs for overdose and how to link to care great thank you and with that I yield back thank you the general election

Corey for the glory Bush for Congress campaign yeah I have my non-coffee I'm fancy like that mug because I don't drink coffee I'm not a caffeine person because I'm already - up so I have smoothie in here but for all you coffee drinkers shoutout to you okay so welcome welcome welcome and I want to introduce tell you all about someone I'm gonna have her go ahead and go back and introduce herself but I have a sister in the fight and she is absolutely amazing phenomenal I love her I love her like a sister I love her like a you know like a auntie and a cousin all at the same time she is so wonderful her name is dr. Victoria Dooley she is look at her she's so beautiful she is out of Michigan and she does she'll tell her story but I will say this about dr. Dooley before I really get started when dr. Dooley and I met you know of course we really didn't know each other we had seen each other you know tweeting and that kind of a thing but we immediately just jailed when we met she was she's a national surrogate for Bernie Sanders we were both doing that together and she's just just phenomenal but I will say this she she is one of the reasons why I am still here today and I can say that because I have my own Colette 19 story and if I was going through a situation with just this really bad horrible mic bout with pneumonia dr. Dooley made a phone call one day she just called just to check up on me when she heard how how I was breathing she got on the phone and called 9-1-1 from detroit trying to have them send an ambulance to the same to my home in st. Louis so that's the kind of person she is we're going to come back to dr. Dooley in just a second and she's going to talk to you all a bit so the reason why we're having this call tonight I want to make sure that everybody understands that there is two sides to who was most precise to Who I am but one big part of who I am is I'm a nurse parent I'm someone that just loves the community and loves to serve and so when Kovac 19 hit you know it what Kobe 19 did from me was it it was almost like a you know kind of like I've been trying to tell you we've come in like like you all have been on the right track with what you've been asking for from our government what you've never tiring you know from the health care system you've been right on target with it it's just that that thing hasn't happened and for quite a few people they people felt like oh it'll never happen or you know we don't really understand the needs Colvin 19 has changed a lot of that dr. Dooley and I have been advocates for Medicare for all and we are we don't waver on that so I'm running for the seat for US Congress because people matter and I believe that the only way we show that people matter and people over profit and people over property and people over you know we get all the peas you know the only way that we can show that is movie start having people that are in those seats to go ahead and make that change that are willing to do that so for me it's I'm running against somebody right now who has been in the seat for 20 years right now is it's about nostalgia it's about oh well you know this is the name that we know or you know we have to be loyal you know we have to get rid of that because this is this is the thing dr. Dooley and I have been all across this country talking about care for all holding town halls because we both believe that your health care should not be tied to your job status we both believe that you should have health care regardless of your your your race your gender just push it is you know you're sexy and so we're trying to is not doing a lot of care for all other than signing saying that I you know I support but while while that person is saying I support we're out fighting for it and I think that that makes a difference so health care is my it's my top priority because I've seen my patients die that dying just simply because they don't have access to the healthcare you know I see my patients sitting sitting in the clinic wondering this money and spinach do I take this money and pay my rent I've had mothers who have had this one mother who she will she came in with her four children this woman was suffering from chronic mental illness she made it to the clinic I don't know if anybody here understands how deep that is but she made it to the clinic without her own transportation with four small statutes there stair-step children she got there to the clinic and she sat there in the waiting room for like two or three hours with those children before she saw the doctor she made it in to see the doctor and then she came out just to find out that her medications she was not gonna be able to afford them that's violence on our communities that woman she went she she showed up because she want to help so I'm running because I'm gonna fight for it I want to champion the things that you need now let's have well before I do that one more thing this campaign does not accept not a dime of corporate money not a dime of lobbyist money we are 100 percent people funded 100 percent people powered and one of those reasons is the pharmaceutical company these health care systems cannot be they can't own us the day that I walk in to Congress if I'm elected nobody will own me nobody will have no and nobody will nobody can say okay now that I'm now that you took my money now you owe me and you have to vote this way I'm only accountable to the people I'm only accountable to you really briefly I am the people that I serve and I say that a lot and I say that because if you don't know my background I'm someone who I grew up in a household my father's been in politics for most of my life and I think my father is on here if you are hey Dad and my father was boost to the ground he did the work you know and that was my example but I also saw him take a lot of kids a lot of darts came at him just because he was trying to help people and so I said I would never do politics I went into ministry but I had a hard road I ended up being someone I was in house I lived on house I remember there were days when I didn't have food you know I made sure my children were fed but I didn't eat myself you know I I'm a survivor of sexual assault I'm a survivor of domestic violence I've been on food stamps and I'm bit low way I worked low wage for 10 years I've been uninsured I'm uninsured right now so while I'm running this race and I just went through pneumonia so with two hospital stays so this is why I'm fighting because I am the people that I serve and I I've been through so much and I don't want other people to have to go through those things so with that dr. Dooley dr. Dooley would you please introduce yourself and tell the people about you and what you're doing in Novi Michigan many months ago that we were stomping together with Amy the Lola yeah but it seems like it was so long ago just to see your beautiful face and your makeup is you smiling and laughing and breathing right it feels good to breathe I'm a family medicine physician I am a healthcare activist and why I'm so outspoken about Medicare for on health care activism I don't see how I could not be and you look at health care in this nation and how work so many people are uninsured and how it disproportionately affects people of color people who look like me and you I did my training in Detroit Michigan in Flint Michigan and so I saw how just the city of Detroit the uninsured rate frankly Detroit is twice as high as uninsured rate for the state of Michigan so it's a huge issue that that weighs heavy on my heart are treated some of those patients in Flint Michigan who deliver babies who are subsequently poisoned by their water and to give them a solution as we're going to be Medicaid to me that's unacceptable that that tells everybody that the poor right you have Medicaid card what does it say it says it's your low-income and to me that's not health care justice health care justice is being able to go to any doctor any hospital when you claim that you want to and for them to not judge you based off of some letters or some words in your health insurance card everyone is worthy in this country and what I'm seeing a lot of in my practice in Michigan we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country due to this codependent now and I'm having a lot of patients know we should hear from them you know my practice is kind of small we're like family right so people we haven't heard from in a while we're calling them and saying hey you know just calling to make sure you okay and we're learning that they're not okay they lost their jobs are uninsured and they didn't reach out to us because it's embarrassing and they didn't know what we were gonna be able to do for them with and being uninsured and of course anybody who was in my practice and became uninsured because of this pandemic we're gonna take care of you but it shouldn't be like that in this wealthiest nation and in the country there's an alternate universe where people are not only getting guaranteed health care during this pandemic but they're getting ubi they're getting like $2,000 a month this ultimate universe is called Canada has anybody heard about it there is a better way they're one of the wealthiest nations in the world and it's time that we treat human beings like human beings and for somebody to say we want to give you choice by keeping your private health insurance and if you like your private health insurance you should be able to keep it well what about the millions of people who lost their health insurance but wanted to have it because they lost their jobs because of this pandemic I have young women who worked in retail and in Michigan our state he's been a lockdown for a long time and they lost her job in retail and was losing their job they lost their health insurance and with unemployment yes senator Sanders champion giving us more money for unemployment but if people who were telling me it's taken five six weeks to get their unemployment check what are you supposed to do in that time period how are you supposed to eat and pay your bills so to me health care activism is just I don't see how much more doctors aren't as outspoken as I am about it not only in most position but I'm a social worker I'm a minister I'm a counselor because I care I went into this profession for the right reason because I want to help serve people and I believe that anybody who comes to my office regardless of their health insurance because just simply because they're a human being and so I am looking forward to the day that we have Medicare for all on these United States I'm not giving up because of wonderful people like you Cory my sister we are going to make it happen and I'm so proud to support you in your race absolutely thank you so much you know one thing that I have to shout out I have to shout out you and your husband and all the other you know health care professionals that are you know still working that are out you know on those front lines and you know and whether you're working in a hospital or clinic you know whether you're working home health you know you're still interacting with patients and so you know just shout out to you for continuing to see patients you know even as you're doing telemedicine and I think about you know while I was sick you know so initially remember everything you know nobody we all were kind of just like wondering what really is this you know what are the real symptoms for this thing you know how do you get rid of it you know can there be a vaccine like all of these questions do you wear masks don't wear masks all of that and we'll get to that in a moment but when this hit me it was in the very it was you know in the early stages of this thing really hitting the US and then hitting Missouri and so we didn't have much information and I just remember thinking something that I know dr. Dooley that you've seen and the people on this call you maybe this person as well where when that thing hit me it hit me like a train I couldn't read I had all these other symptoms but I said I'm not going to the hospital uh-huh I don't you know I don't have insurance I don't want that bill let me go you know first I was going to try to wait it out so I waited it out the first day and the second day it was so terrible I couldn't so I went to the urgent care I went to the urgent care and I paid my cash and to be seen and they you know patched me up you know gave me a breathing treatment and some meds and did a strep test and did a flu test and sent me out the door a few hours later I'm done couldn't breathe again you know even worse so I ended up in the emergency room so many people free clothing you know we you know precoded we were talking about these things precoded we've been talking about the healthcare disparities within this country and talking about how it's more than just having it's not just about access you know it's about having actual care you brought up something about it like we talked about people pulling out their Medicaid cards one thing that I saw the nurse was I'll never forget working in places where there is a drawer or certain equipment for people that are uninsured yes another drawer for people who have Medicaid and then there's another drawer or more or other equipment for people who have insurance yeah and that class system something that has to go away you know we and I were always wondering like what's the difference with this medicine in this medicine because you can't tell me it's a lot number because we're we're more sophisticated than that so it can't be numbers you know it's something what is the reason why people have what you say absolutely it's all about the dollar and for me to the hospital when so many people are fighting that we're fighting that before I know one thing that you have been working on was talking about like the black maternal mortality rate and just when we look at right now you know even looking at the numbers locally in our district well especially the st. Louis City area where I'm from the black community are you know the most of the cases and actually and then even higher than that black women are for the cases and that kind of bed is happening all across the country and we do understand that there are several Ria's quite a few reasons for that you know some of it being you know whether it's whether we're the essential workers so we're oftentimes in some cases we're low wage workers you know or and we are in nursing homes or long-term care workers absolutely we are we have and if we've gone to college we have this huge student that very more student debt than anyone and then also when you're talking about wage inequality we also don't make the we don't make our whole bank dollar we make the 61 cent so with all of those things put together and then we also go and I want you to comment on this we also know that women and children statistically I think the numbers are the last numbers I've seen is like women and children are 14 times as likely to die in natural disasters or environmental disasters 14 times it's likely because we don't have the adaptive resources and women are the ones taking care of something so like you just say it those essential workers those people working in those nursing home and all of that you know if something happened outside the door we gotta go get the patients or we gotta go get you know go get that so talk to us about the disparities and what you've been seeing absolutely I have had a disproportionate amount of black females who came down with Kobe because again they're essential workers or health care workers they're working in nursing homes or LPNs RNs and I just want to give a quick shout out to my sister nurse Angie she's an RN like you Cory and she's one of our frontline workers taking care of patients and so not but when you think about black women not only do we have all these racism that you have to face and we're not making our holding dollar and it's and we're trying to take care of ourselves on our loved ones not only about that but we're worried about our male the love the love our loved ones who are black males we're constantly fearing for our children I have two black boys and they're big boys are tall like their dads are tall and my 13 year old to me he looks like a baby but a racist white cop is going to say oh he was big he was intimidating I was scared he didn't look like he was 13 when my baby absolutely looks like he's 12 13 years old so not only do you have to worry about ourselves because there's so many injustice with us but we have to worry about men that we love our fathers our sons and so we have all these stressors that we have to deal with in toxic stress absolutely changes our biochemical makeup so that we are more prone to devastating effects of illnesses and not only that but healthcare providers don't listen to us black women are believed when we come in with pain complaints we come in with chest pain and have heart attacks you know 50% of black women have some form of heart disease so we are super high risk but when we go to the ER with chest pain we are less likely to be believed and so that's why we need people who are not only gonna say hey everybody deserves healthcare and it should be the same good quality health care for all people regardless of race income but not only that we need activists and the government who are gonna say you know what if you're a healthcare provider and you discriminate against a group of people based on the race or their religion or their sexual preference you are going to be fine and suffer some consequences right Kumada landlords are supposed to discriminate against people because of malaria religion and things of that nature so why do we have a system that does not say to doctors and nurses look you are gonna provide culturally competent Baedeker here or we are not gonna allow you to have this job because would you make decisions based off of how somebody looks or their sexual preferences or their religious you can potentially kill them we're not talking about the right to rent a hall which is a crucial right but we're talking about life or death here so we need people to see it speak up and say hey everybody has health insurance is going to be equal if the resources are gonna be spread out equally but not only that health care providers will be put on notice that you have to believe black and women right you have to have to I almost lost both I only have two children and both of them I almost lost the cut for that fact the first child I almost lost my child was born in 23 weeks I was 23 weeks gestation then I went in and said I was in pain and the doctor said oh no you're fine I said no I'm in pain your sign says if you feel like something is wrong something is wrong till your doctor so I'm telling you I'm in pain something is not right I'm not under you're fine and send me home and a week later I was back and had my child I remember when you told me that story Corinne it was so devastating but it's just so typical of how it's brushed off they don't believe us or or you know the whole myth yeah black women are strong but just because we're doesn't mean that we don't ever have any complaints or legitimate concerns as a small business my practice when I opened my practice I didn't have health insurance this was back in 2011 before about me it was law so me as a doctor I did not have health with no insurance and actually got sick one time before I got insurance and because I was a doctor I knew doctors they took care of me for free something called professional courtesy right and I'm like which I appreciated but it's like why can't we all as human beings have a human courtesy or that we can all be taken care of when we have health concerns because we have guaranteed health care is you human right from our government so it's just insane it's ridiculous and then small business owners not only that almost a super valuable employee who had been with me since the beginning because I could not offer her health care there was a time where I was scared that I was going to lose somebody who wanted to work for me somebody who I wanted to keep thinking about they may have to leave and go work somewhere where they could get health care so Medicare for all not only does it save money numerous scientific studies have proved that but it's also gonna help small businesses and if you're a small business owner or if not your business owner period you don't want somebody working for you who doesn't want to work for you only working for you because of the benefits when I was traveling the country I'm a lovely bike team owner she was I saw infertility she hated her job she worked for a healthcare company she hated her job but then her job paid for fertility treatment and that was the only reason why she was at that job so it would be better for that company if they had an employee who liked to work there and it'd be better for her she was able to work wherever she liked and enjoyed because we all had good comprehensive health care benefits so Medicare fraud isn't just about health care it's about freedom the freedom work where you want to work or not work and you'll be taken care of so it's more than just health care fraud its freedom it's empowering right and then some people also see like something that I will deal with is a big part after I I went from hospital work I was a transplant nurse in a local hospital and then I went into clinic work and so at the now at the hospital we my health care was okay but once I switch to the community-based clinic then that was a whole different story then it was based upon you know how much does the image that you know company want to pay into the healthcare and so what they would say is oh we have a lot of people who work here who have pre-existing conditions and some of them you know we have cancer we have diabetes we have lupus we have all of these things that cost a lot of money and so it's gonna make our premiums higher so you know you are gonna have to pay more because the people that work here are more sickly but I was here and so then it's like okay so now I'm paying I have to children's me and two children and I pay 826 dollars a month you know and just for the you know just for my health care you know plus everything else that comes along with that exactly the co-pays and all of that you know and my deductible was like $4,600 like but the thing is then it's like you know then you you it's like we punish people yes for things that they didn't ask for nobody asked for diabetes nobody asks for why exactly so that brings me to a point so we have this situation right now this whole mask situation aha now two masks or not two masks and I will I you know I have my opinion about it but yeah I was I was driving just a little while ago I'm driving past a park here in st. Louis the very well-known park here and as I'm driving people were out jogging and you know just the regular stuff and I'm looking and I probably saw maybe 60 people just just in that little short span and I drove past the park and I saw one person with a mask nobody else had on a mask and so I'm thinking to myself I just kept looking and I'm like is there a sign somewhere that says you can't wear masks you know because I'm like cool you know and then so and I think about people have said and I know there may be some people on this call that feel this way and you know but I think about I hear people say well you know it's not freedom it's not you know I you know that's my freedom to not wear a mask you know you can't make me wear my mask is my right to not wear a mask and then but then I think about we we wear shirts you know you wear pants or skirt afford or shorts or whatever it is you put on your body you know door the sign says no shirt no shoes no service in the same way there was a day when women weren't wearing pants you know there was a day some long time ago when women weren't wearing pants you know and then some and then that changed and now so when and so now putting on a mask because of what's happening in the end right now I think is is a service not only to for yourself and for your family but it's also forget for your neighbor and I think about um you know working in the hospital and so this is the thing working in the hospital we would have patients who were had tuberculosis or possible tuberculosis so if they came in and they had it or possible they had possible suspected tuberculosis we would have to put them in a special negative pressure room and we would have to wear a gown and we would have to wear a mask and sometimes we were car goes and but this was the thing every single time I went into that room I had to put that stuff on him before I walked out I had to take it off and then if I forgot a pencil or something I had to do it all over again and run back in for people that feel like they should they should not have to wear a mask my question is this if I was your nurse and you were in the hospital and the other patient that I had had to patients that name the other patient that I had was that that person with tuberculosis or possible tuberculosis if I felt like I don't feel like wearing a mask today and I went in that room and kept going in and out of that room but then I also was taking care of you would you feel comfortable with me not wearing a mask with that with that patient with tuberculosis or possible tuberculosis coming in also taking care of you would that be okay I don't believe so in the surgeon and I was going operating but I said oh I don't use a mask and I just go for a brief surgery to surgery I don't use a mask would you take that surgeon no yeah I do have freedoms you are free to not wear masks at home or you won't you but if you are going to go to people's place of business like I said we all know no shoes no shirt no service yes businesses legitimately have the right to tell you or you can't come in like it's not really that hard of a concept to understand if you think about it look I have to wear shirt I have to wear shoes this is no different and if you don't like it you don't have to partake of that business it's as simple as that right exactly and and you know I I keep seeing people say you know well the mask is not you know the mask is not for you you know it's it's for the other person actually I don't agree with that because I believe that the mask is for both of us because if you know if that other person doesn't work if you don't wear a mask and the other person has on a mask you still have that that makes that other person and that has on the mask they still have a high risk of getting it from you because you don't have on one so if we both have one on one then transmission is a lot lower by five percent or something and so anyway so I'm definitely a mask person and I wear two masks half the time I just double them up you know because I want to be a double mask you know you know that we think that like up to a third of transmission is from people who are having no symptoms no symptoms will code it and pass it on to somebody who can't have symptoms and will subsequently die so I'm not coughing I'm not having fever that doesn't mean that you don't have coal bit that she could be fatal to somebody that you loved or fatal to somebody that you don't know but like I said we gotta be more focused to being humans humankind in this country I had a patient was from another country one where they guarantee health care is even right pick one because it could be any of the other industrialized nations in the world because they offer universal health care except to the US well being said living in the US he noticed that there wasn't as big of a sense of unity in the US as it was in his countries and he was a higher income earner and he paid a little bit more tat in taxes when he said he didn't even think twice about it so that other people can have health care because he said when he him and his loved ones get sick they have health care too so he has a little bit more so he's not concerned about paying a little bit more today people less fortunate than him health care and he said that in the u.s. it's more device if they don't have the sense of we're all in this together and that's what medicare-for-all does it says look we are all in this together as humans as human beings if you can't think we got your back as opposed of Medicare for all who wanted or public option it's basically saying you're on your own if you don't know what website to go to on what date and what time you're not gonna have health care you are all in your all the Medicare for AUSA is look we are all in this together as human needs and that's the way it should be well and then you know when the person that when our mail carrier brings the mail I don't I can't name a day that I had to run back out and say hey not my payment you know so we all received our mail and we don't give the postal worker a dive we you know that that just happens you know the street sweeper comes and you know they sweep the street and that just happens you know so to feel like we're you know you know like this this is something that people should have to pay for and if you're lucky enough you know I've had people tell me that you know on carl's they'll say you know Corey I love your policies I love that you stand for $15 an hour minimum wage I love that you're fighting for environmental justice for all and you know your pro-choice candidate I love those things and you're fighting for you know to reinvest money into public school systems and all of these things but that medicare-for-all thing you know no I have a great job and you know and you know I have a great care and I don't want to lose that switching over to Medicare for all and and they'll say and I don't believe people should have anything for free and then I bring up the mail carrier thing but then also I let them know and I think your fire right exactly you know and then I let them know well this is the thing you won't lose people a lot of people think that they're going to lose their doctor like I love my dog they people say I love my doctor I love where I go I love the service you won't lose that at all you get to keep that and this is one thing that will change so as the nurse I've been the the staff nurse and I've also been the director of the facility so as the staff nurse I was the one that had to take care of you in the room but then go sit on the phone with Medicaid or go sit on the phone with Medicare and and acts can you have this done and then up for an hour and so now I'm taking now you have to sit longer because I have to sit here on this phone and it's happening over and over and over again and then as the director I'm the one saying administration I don't have enough staff because I have you know because the nurses are always gone on the phone trying to you know get stuff for patients instead of being able to provide patient direct patient care and so Medicare for all will take that away right now we cope in nineteen we have we have nurses who are nurses and doctors and oh shout out to you know our housekeeping staff shout out you know doctors saying all the center workers couriers and just everyone everybody were doing transportation our public transportation people shout out to all of them but you know when I think about how what happened what happens what happens to them you know right now we've been fighting for a better wage for the same group of people we've been fighting for healthcare for this same group of people and now this is the group of people that have to be there on their front line so what happens to them that's why we've been fighting and I'll say people may say well Cory you know you keep saying the same thing over and over again it's because it's true it's true don't change it hasn't changed nobody brought home Medicare for nobody brought home making sure that everybody has health care one thing that that breaks my heart is when I was working in mental and mental health and I would have youth in our youth site that could not go to school the school would say hey you can't come back until you have medicine you have to have your you know your medicine to be able to sit in class so you can't come back the child goes to the doctor and then the doctor prescribe the medicine after they could wait three four months to get the appointment the doctor prescribed the medicine and then Medicaid says or whatever they have says I'll pay for it pay for it so then the parent has to pay for it and the parent doesn't have the money and then so now the child can't go back to school so now we have a child that's sitting out and so that is another thing that feeds into something that we've been fighting for to break them to school to Prison Pipeline tearing it up you know but this is how we do this is how it happens when we keep me we are the ones that are supposed to take care of our you and medicare-for-all wipes all of that away Medicare for all states if mom moves because right now her life is she living is really transient life and things are going on if mom moves that she misses that Medicaid notice she won't lose her help that child won't lose their health care care yes it is a good thing that kids can stay on their parents health insurance those are 26 bucks the way we deliver health care now is if you live in Michigan you're you might have a really good health care company in Michigan Melissa say you go to way to school and st. Louis and then it's a Lewis is not a popular health care plan so I've had college students who go away to college and they cannot get the care that they need because yes in Michigan everybody accepts their insurance but they move to this new state and they're like what is that plan we don't set that plan here and it's like what good is insurance if you can't find anybody to accept it state lines right you'll have the same care and still have lots of options to be covered and you're talking about you know being on the phone and just the paperwork that's involved with private insurance okay let's say I need to get you a cat scan or MRI with Medicare you know what asked to do I write you the order you go get it but if you have a private insurance we have to get something called prior authorization what is that I gave my authorization when I gave you the order right I have to call it somebody who's not a doctor not a nurse had zero medical training at all doesn't know medical terminology so when I'm telling them the history it's an words they don't understand how to spell them because they had no medical terminology and after babies people to cover the imaging I had an early need just the other day who I needed to make sure she didn't have a blood clot in her lungs that would kill her and so I get on the phone I talk to this young person who has no medical knowledge and I go through this checklist and at the end okay yeah I guess she really does have the risk factors to qualify for this cat scan because she does have the risk factors for a pulmonary embolism you don't say I'm the doctor I told you she had the risk factors that's why I ordered the tests but I gotta kiss you I got expend our convincing you that she really does have the risk factors and I know she has as a doctor when school for twenty something years so it was just all this red tape of the day insurance company's game is deny deny deny there have been health care CEOs who came out and said when I do these things like prior authorization they just stamp them deny they don't even read there's been people who work to healthcare administrators who admit it we don't even read that we just reject them all their total endgame is to deny you care to save them money that's all they want and when people say I don't want to lose my private health insurance because I like it when you ask them why they like it say you should say things like it doesn't cost me a lot of money or I could see any doctor I want you would not have to pay me out of network fees and so the reasons why they like it are things that are gonna apply to Medicare for all was Medicare for all you can be able to go to any doctor any high school any fancy you want you because right now I'm seeing more and more people whose insurance companies are telling them you can only go to ABC pharmacy you can't go to XYZ pharmacy anymore you can't pick your all day finally see with some of these cells insurance companies but with Medicare for all you can you're gonna be able to see any doctor you want to book any pharmacy it's gonna cover mental health it's gonna cover their dental so teeth won't be luxury bounce anymore so when they say I don't want to give it up because I like it you have to explain the one Medicare frogs will be just as good as your insurance or even better Medicare for all it's a gift let's say you had five dollars and I had ten dollars and I say you know what Corey won't you give me that dollar bill I'm gonna give you this my giving my ten dollar bill we're gonna swap did I take five dollars away from you Corey no I gave you five dollars your gifts and that's what's helping with Medicare fraud we're not taking away anything we're swapping it out for something that's gonna be just as good or for the vast majority of Americans way better because everybody has to surprise bills and out-of-network fees I have considered how bad health insurance is in the u.s. today have kind of a good insurance because I don't even feel some stuff but still there's still some hidden ID network fees that come in they're coming to play so at the end of the day I have wealth care if I can afford all these fees I can do whatever I want to I don't have health care I had wealth care so we need to get rid of that Medicare fraud is a gift and and see one thing we have right now with going back to codon 19 I think about the day so when I came home from the hospital for my second hospital stay with this pneumonia and the pneumonia I had you know dr. Dooley and in a minute we're going to open it up for questions in just a few minutes you know the pneumonia that I had mimic cold it so much so much yeah you know and but because my test came out negative you know and so but when I came home from the hospital the next day my bills started to come to my house like so I'm getting the bills I'm not well yet and my bills are already well just pouring in and just the idea that I'm not well I'm still fighting this the bills are coming in what you know what am I supposed to do with that people are dealing with that all the time especially those there because there are so many people who have said I have so many people have who else said to me Cory and I have these symptoms and it's just like cold the aura wasn't able to be tested or I did your testing and it was a negative you know but I really feel like I have it and so under the you know when people say oh you know there was this whole thing about well if you if you have closed it we're going to make sure try to make sure that that is pay for that you know your treatment is paid for but what about the people who didn't have coder who has whose symptoms mimic that and still had those hospital stays still had you know you have these huge bills what do we do with that you know so this whole thing we would not have this happening right now at all this would not be a situation if we have Medicare for all I'm not I'm not that type of person to wait for something to be popular so add me to advocate for or to wait for somebody else to see who else is gonna join in with this you know who else you know I don't need to help rest would you say you're a woman of integrity yeah I mean yeah people need what they need we need what we need and so I'm gonna go out and fight for it and try to get that for you because you need it now you know you can you can say what you want about me but you'll be happy with me later when you get what you need or when your sister got gets it you ain't you didn't need it and now she didn't have to come to you and ask you for the money or for whatever it is so you'll be happy later you know I'll make you angry now but you'll be happy later with what comes with with what comes out of this so I mean that's what we did with Medicare for all well that's what we're trying to do with Medicare for all the person that's sitting in the seat right now that I'm trying to that I'm trying to win hasn't done anything signed up said okay yeah I support it but nobody know the people in the district if you're not really digging into this person's voting record you would know that this person is fighting for medic is it supports Medicare for all if in medicine if MSNBC calls me they're gonna hear about Medicare for all they're gonna hear about the CNN whatever I'm on those shows they hear about what I what I support there is no question I'm gonna talk about it because I'm trying to bring that thing home so let's open it up to some questions um we go we'll take about ten minutes and what do what do you want to know you got me and dr. Dooley is it you want to yeah I message you a couple of questions that already came in oh okay all right I'm sorry see I was so into it I wasn't looking at my phone if I'm a trap it's on you okay it's on the chest so let's see okay I'm assuming the opiate crisis was made worse because their lack of unified healthcare tracking absolutely and also opiate crisis is affecting a lot of rural rural people and we talked about not believing black women black patients believe that healthcare providers ER doctors were less likely to give black patients opioids because they didn't believe him right so they were more willing to believe the white people went pain and gave them more opioids and the fact that they believed the white people more and gave them more opioids actually contributed to the opioid epidemic disproportionately affecting white people in rural people so yeah absolutely you need mental health care and physical health care even when you think of something like Kobe you can get over the physical symptoms which are so glad you have sister but just the long lasting effects of fatigue the medical bills those are gonna cost stress and you might need some counseling or some mental health services so we can say okay we're gonna cover your phobic but what about all the mental health ramifications that come after the cold that you're not going to cover those it makes no sense our bodies are not these separate pieces o1 or mine or body or spirit whatever you believe in it's all one our teeth are not separate from the rest of our body and so that's why we all need and deserve comprehensive coverage yes there's another question I think will be better for you to answer dr. Dooley from Christy W how accurate do you think the antibody testing is I would say I think that it is its immunoglobulin right it's complicated it depends on the manufacturer and their data but the general consistence is is to approach the vast majority those tasks with some caution yeah oh wow I didn't know that they depending on the particular particular tests and each test should tell you something called the sensitivity and specificity so so these tests by certain manufacturers they're gonna have a percent that are falsely negative meaning you really didn't have antibodies but I didn't pick up on it and it's gonna have another percent of people who are falsely positive meaning you didn't have antibodies and you're gonna have some so Cove it's so new we need to do work on not only our COBIT testing but our antibody tests and so if you have a positive anybody test depending on which test it is you want to ask about the sensitivity and specificity you shouldn't say oh I have coded antibodies I'm gonna not wear a mask and just go out there and you know not worrying because I'm immune at this point we are the vast majority of especially those rapid tests aren't they're at a hundred percent so I would approach those results with caution and then whoever is administering the test for you they should have all the data about how often it's false negative and false and positive in people and they should be able to play that information free yeah I just saw an article maybe some of you have seen this article as well came out I think one day late last week or maybe early this week it was talking about one company in particular very well known medical equipment company and it turns out that their tests their Coby 19 tests are foot were forty eight percent they were you know there was an Arri error in forty eight percent of them so half the people that took them you know got the right answer the other half basically didn't so officials young mountains but if you have severe symptoms to give x-rays like yours were cat scan to show the viral pneumonia in both your lungs if you are young and you know otherwise relatively healthy and there's no other x in your flu is negative all your other buyers candles are negative if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it's like if you're walks and talks like Coleman in this day and age it is and so that's why the mote that weight Matt the majority of doctors are proceeding I've had people go to the ER and they get the x-ray and the findings consistent with Kovac but their test is negative but in their discharge summary there's a pneumonia suspect Kovac you know the test wasn't accurate that doesn't mean that we still are suspected that's the cost of it and with a nasal swab specific they're not as accurate sometimes people are in the hospital and the nasal swab is negative twice but then if they get sicker and the doctors end up having to do a bronchoscopy where they you know they go down into their their bronchioles into their logs and take take a sample from inside their lungs that's when they get the positive so it's no longer maybe in your nose it's all in your lungs so of course you're gonna get a negative test from your nose because now everything that's going on is going on in your lungs so yeah you shouldn't use any of those tests as of right now to make it better to say a hundred percent you know I'm safe because I are already having anybody's or I already had it so I can just go out and watch because I'm already I mean yes yes and we also have to like with my very first test as a nurse you know I just knew that I you know my first one didn't go well you know the person didn't go back far enough they didn't go back as far as far as even a flu um swab which that is not how good the person is at doing it you're right it just depends on how good is a person that getting your swab are they kind of timid I mean I feel like it's hitting your brain or like the second one Lord so it's it's stressful people want answers some people deserve answers but like I said at the end of the day most doctors are home by 4 blocks and talks like Kovac it is regardless of what what the test is okay we have a question from Joe Kunstler my daughter is a resident dermatologist will doctors be somewhat protecting protected from lawsuits under Medicare for all what it simply mean by protected for lawsuits but a large portion of doctors malpractice insurance as physician have to carry malpractice insurance and depending on your specialty that can range from tens to you know ten to several tens of thousands of dollars a year and the reason part of the reason why we have to pay so much of that is because if you harm somebody and they need health care for the rest of their life just like with auto insurance then they're gonna have a large amount of medical bills right and because we don't guarantee health care human right they have to build in some of that cost of lifelong medical care in the cost of your malpractice insurance so if you are practice of the practicing physician is not gonna say oh no doctors aren't gonna be liable at all if they do gross negligent malpractice but it should lower the malpractice costs of the physician because then you no longer have to account for paying for this person health care for life because their health care is already covered for life okay somebody was saying they want to see your CR are $24,000 icemaker I'm not going to get into you know the u.s. is the most innovative country in the world and if you have Medicare for all those innovative research drugs and they're mostly funded by taxpayer dollars we pay to fund the research for these new medications and then what a pharmaceutical companies do they jack up the prices to tens of thousands of dollars when a new medicine comes out so we are paying for this innovation but we're not getting any credit for it so with Medicare for are we still some of the cost of this innovation is going to be in tax payers but we're gonna benefit from it because then when the medicine comes out we're not gonna have to pay huge cost and then also you have to think about what is the point of being in a country that is allegedly so innovative is nobody can afford the medication okay who cares if it's an innovate innovative medication life-saving medication that you need if it costs two hundred fifty thousand dollars nine forty thousand dollars a year you're not going to get that medication I'll care how innovative the medication is if you cannot afford it you so that's just a myth that Big Pharma big health insurance like to put out there and a steer us in the cost and fear-mongering but it's just taxpayers so in this medical research and we're not getting any benefit by funding it whereas with Medicare for all who will get the benefit because we won't have to pay these astronomical costs dr. bill makes a really good point we're gonna do a couple more questions and then we're going to close out we're not going to keep you all we're gonna try to our best to stick with the time but this is so good and you all have such great comments and questions I'm here dr. bill says also Medicare for all means patients are less apt to refuse recommended treatments cut pills in half or not get prescriptions filled at all better compliance means better outcomes and fewer lawsuits so that is such a huge deal because you know I a lot of my patients would do that and I'm like you know you're at you know your PIN you're supposed to be taking this much insulin and you're only using this much you know and they're trying to ration that insulin and I'm like that's not how it works like you can't not take the amount that you need and still be what beat still be healthy so yeah that's a great point [Music] some people they won't even tell me that they're not taking their medication so better seem to tell your doctor you can't afford your medication so how people come in oh yeah doctor I swear I'm taking the medicine but with electronic medical records nowadays I get pushed pharmacy data so I can see when you ask for your medicine and then swear up and down that they took it I'm not seeing that they're doing that because they're Liars they have their all reasons they it's embarrassing it cost you know they're scared they don't think if they tell me I'm not gonna have an option to help them so what's the point every feeling that information so that I get on the phone or call the pharmacy you know when's last time the patient took this medicine six months ago and so then I have to come back and say look you know I know you're not taking the medicine I'll call the pharmacy I get the data into the computer system there is absolutely zero way you are taking these medication if you could just explain to me why I can help you find a way to get an alternative or even get that medication treat it some people don't realize that certain time some different companies we have prescription assistance programs and some of them are stricter than others but a lot of them are fairly generous as far as what income level that you can make up to and get some assistance to get the medication free mailed to you for free and so you know if they explained to me you know I can't afford it I can either switch them something else or I can see you know this particular time suitable company will give it to you for free if you make less than this you don't have to tell me how much you make but I'm gonna give you these papers and if you fit these income guidelines I want you to fill them out and return them so it's important to communicate with your doctor and if you have a doctor that you are scared to tell the truth to because you are gonna be in bear so you think they're gonna talk down to you that's an excellent sign that you need a new doctor yes yes so many people I've seen they'll go in and won't tell the doctor something but then they'll come out and tell the nurses you know and we have to go back in and sell the doctors this is what's really going on you know if anybody is in novi or anywhere near it in Detroit in near Detroit go see my sister I'm telling you she is a phenomenal phenomenal doctor and I just absolutely you are amazing you saved my life you touch my heart so much because I can said I was you in 2011 I would I did not have health insurance and if I didn't have colleagues who were willing to take care of me you know I'll be in a ton of debt or I just would have got sicker so yeah you're my sister I love you I'm always gonna be there for you girl you ain't getting rid of me no matter what so and my clinic is you know the clinic that I was sent to after discharge from the hospital is closed and so I didn't have a doctor people keep saying cool stuff in your care who's white who's taking care of you and I'm like you know I'll come back to Dulli because you know dr. Dooley is like hey use your nebulizer more do this do that because I don't you know I don't have anybody local so you know thank you for me and there people just don't know we have such so there's some just really great doctors and shout out to you as a black woman doctor you know we need so many more that understand our issues and we need people of color people that are you know we need people that are trans doctors we need so many we need my college should be free so they have to incur two hundred fifty three hundred thousand dollars a debt just by the dream of being a doctor exactly telemedicine acquaintance is Shannon I do do telemedicine appointments during the pandemic so as long as insurance companies are going to keep paying for them and hopefully they'll continue to pay for them forever now because this pandemic is gonna last for a long time it's gonna be another one eventually so we absolutely do do telemedicine visits and you know a lot of doctors are small businesses and some some of them they close because a lot of the staff got co-winner the doctor got coded fortunately my staff and I did not really have been tested we did not get coated so far and we are you know practicing safely we were in our mass social distancing Chiellini we're seeing Kovac patients by telemedicine we're not having them coming to the office just to limit exposure to the to our well patients um so we have a few more questions we're going to try to keep through these really quickly but I want to make sure everybody gets their questions answered one is about vaccinations about in and see this one is from Sarah Kent's asking about people just being concerned that people may not want to get the vaccination once it's available and just how you know how we were trained is important one thing about that Sarah I will say is it that that back is a little difficult depending on the community that you're talking to because not everybody is runs towards vaccinations even though they may be there and and we may see good in that a lot of people don't get the pneumonia vaccine a lot of people don't get the flu vaccine especially in the black community vaccines are you know once you get past the baby those first couple of years it's hard you know those other may talk about why because people have a lot of reasons to be just trusting of the health care community and if you don't have a doc in studies have shown if you have a doctor who looks like you you have a better outcome so since we don't have enough black doctors and nurses and every black person doesn't Piper that they feel comfortable with that's part of the reason you have a lot doctors don't believe us go to the ER and think so we have a lot of reason not to trust the medical community but you also have to think about in my office's my medical assistant she's surprised she's like cuz she asks you if you want the vaccine as soon as you get there and then I'm going the room and I'll explain to you why it's important and explain to you address your myths because there's a lot of bad information out there the Internet is wonderful but it's also horrible because anybody with a brilliant an opinion can get on there and blog and spread misinformation so she shot she's like doctor delete you know I always ask for people for vaccines and they say no you you go in there you change their mind I'm like well you know because I'm okay I'm a parent first me from a doctor and I researched vaccines before I give my kids and I'd give my kid every recommended vaccine after I've researched it but when I go explain to them address their myth sometimes people are concerned about mercury explain to them number one there's no mercury in any vaccine that I carry my office we carry preservative free single-dose vials you will not get any so mercury doesn't cause autism number one but let's say hypothetically you are still believe that it does you will not get a thigh OMERS on continued vaccine in my office and it cost me a little bit more to buy those individual bodies doses and I do it not because scientifically it's the right thing to do but more because people have legitimate concerns they might be thoughts concerns with their legitimate concerns so when I go in there and find out not every time but like I said my medical assistant she is she told me what so times she's shocked I she'll ask people and then I go in there and I talk to them and explain why it's important to get it so it's not a lost cause for everybody some people can be persuaded with the correct information from a health care professional that they trust that's right to my question and then we're going to close out let's see how can we get through to family members that aren't taking codeine 19 seriously you continue to I'll say you continue to take it seriously and show how serious you are one thing that I've seen that has helped other people too you know when people are not you know if I feel strongly about something and the people that are closest to me or people that are in my circle all right since you know don't feel the same way I stay diligent I stay you know in the fight for that thing and once they see that you know a lot of times if that'll help also you know just being serious about and I don't know if you live it who is this Danielle Hayden yeah I don't know if those people live with you or not but you know if they don't live with you then you can't come around me if you're not wearing your mask you know you can't I know there's this and I'm not telling I'm not telling anybody to do this but there-there is a comedian by the name of Lou Nell I love her she's hilarious she had a child who I believe was her child who wouldn't wouldn't adhere to you know social distancing and all of that she put it on Instagram and said you know yes I put my daughter out and I saw her she can't live here she can't come because you know I want to live and I want my apartment to live and and so since you won't abide by it you can't be in my home and so so I think I think when people see how serious we are you know that that'll make a change not they live with you you know I don't know that do you have a better one but that anybody want to pop some oh no you're not everybody there are cases of individuals who are at those protests to open States and they were out there the leaders of the protests and then a week later oh they got Kovac some of them even died from coping after going to those protests about opening up the states so some people you just aren't going to be able to convince and that's okay but should stand your ground like you said and and and to do what you know was right and it's a sad thing that some people don't take it seriously but at the end of the day that's on them your conscience can be clear and you just have to do what it is ready for you and lead by example all right this is our last question then we'll close out from Shannon Roberts I am a nanny with no health insurance no health coverage my children are grown when I apply for health insurance they wanted to charge me $600 a month insurance I pay out of pocket if I get sick I tested negative for clothes it but had all the signs of clothes it will the Medicare for all care of me as a nanny nobody behind Kanna baby it takes care of our own house population it takes care of those 19 year olds that didn't go to college it takes care of the 87 year old that has five different pre-existing conditions it takes care of the six year old that it takes care of every single person all the time all the time like you don't you can you can switch 12 jobs you cannot whatever don't work no don't move your cover and you don't have and undocumented people and ten people say you don't feel like undocumented people should be cover of it that's your opinion but think about think about the cogut end of it so let's say everybody was covered but undocumented people so I don't care if you documented or not so you undocumented you need coal but we don't treat you you go around spreading it to people who are documented why does that make any sense exactly our living breathing human being that's all it takes to qualify for Medicare for all absolutely and then we have so many we have a lot of people and I'll shut up about this we have a lot of people who went into the military but for those two things you know they went into the military for exactly you know and so that's a whole other subject is we have to have a whole other zone now but you know I just want to so

question is should security be strengthened at local airports reducing the chance of future terror attacks that's what Virginia senator Tim Cain and other local lawmakers are pushing for in the wake of the attacks in Brussels Congress continues to work on a measure to reauthorize the FAA what changes do they want to see let's find out for the man himself senator Cain joins us now from Capitol Hill good morning senator hey Steve great to be with you always a pleasure what are you looking for when it comes to airport security changes well what the attack in Brussels showed is that you know the airports tend to be very secure once you get through the security perimeter the TSA gate but the attack in Brussels happened outside the gate in the baggage claim area or in the area where a lot of passengers are gathering to get their tickets or even right outside the doors of the airport as people are dropping off so what we're doing is we have a normal bill to reauthorize the FAA and funding and we're expanding the use of funds Security funds to encompass security sort of outside the security perimeter so what we would do is basically two things significant additional teams that are called Viper teams but they're the security teams that basically just scan the crowd and they're trained to watch for anything suspicious they sometimes use canines that are trained to sniff out explosive and so we would expand the number of teams that can be used not only at airports but even at transportation infrastructure like Amtrak and metro and we would also do significantly more training for our security professionals for the kinds of things that happen outside the security perimeter so that this would be in addition to the normal TSA screening we want to give people a little more sense of confidence as they're coming into airports or train stations that there's going to be eyes on the security situation right and we saw in the wake of what happened in Brussels at the Brussels Airport them going as far as to actually drop people off away from the airport that you would have to then be essentially shuttled even to the front gate of the airport now we're not talking about going that far at this point just having additional presence correct that that's right we don't want their the airport experience shouldn't be sort of a militarized experience that's not what we're we're looking but we do want people to feel safe traveling you know air travel is just like a cornerstone of the American economy and also so many of us engage in air travel to go visit family members so it can't be just a super hardened experience but just a little more security presence outside what's the normal tsa security zone I think be very very helpful it can reduce the risk of a Brussels like a tragedy and it can also give travelers more confidence and when it comes to security issues typically those that tend to have an easier time working their way through Congress but you did say additional funds are we going to have support for this I think this one is a bipartisan initiative Steve I feel real good about it we have an FAA bill reauthorization bill on the floor of the Senate right now this is an amendment to that bill but thus far we've gotten very good feedback on it both from Democrats and Republicans so as we take this bill up likely today and next week I think there's a great chance that this will be added in it will be supported and headed to the President's desk all right before we let you go let's talk about something that is not bipartisan supported right now and that is the supreme court nominee the president today in Chicago trying to get support there for his nominee Merrick garland we're not getting it from Republicans in Congress right now at least we're not hearing that but you're on the inside what do you think now as far as the prospects of actually having hearings on the hill Steve if you just go by the words that my colleagues are saying on the Republican side the majority seems bound and determined to create a new horrible precedent that has never been done before and that is to say we're not going to take up a nominee and either vote yes or no remember Steve the Republicans have the votes to vote down this judge if they choose to it takes 60 votes to get confirmed to be a Supreme Court justice and the Democrats only have 46 votes so if the Republicans vote against it because they don't like the President or they don't like the nominee judge garland won't go on the court but what they want to do is actually not vote yes or no which to my mind completely violates the advise and consent Clause of the Constitution and it it's because of a unique disrespect sadly for this president 17 times in the past there's been the confirmation of a justice in the last year of a presidential term but person they want to treat this president differently than the 43 presidents before we just have to keep the pressure on hope that they'll look in the mirror and realize they're harming all three branches of government by doing this and that they'll have a hearing as they normally have done in the past and senator that was my follow-up is is the pressure being applied is the Democratic leadership pushing for this and are there any Republicans on board with this behind the scenes you have to name names but are you hearing that there are some that are not happy with this decision or is everybody on board there are a number that are not happy with the decision so I think to have said senators Collins and Senator Kirk they have a Republican senators remain in Illinois they said we got to do hearings and treat it in the normal course others are telling me behind the scenes that they're really feeling pressure it's interesting less pressure from the Democrats here they're feeling pressure at home I had a senator Republican senators say to me yesterday it's great to be back in Washington after a two-week break because the two-week break involve a lot of people really jamming us about this Supreme Court situation so hopefully if the American public keeps speaking up with the simple message hey senators do your job people will listen to it and and step back and treat this normally because if they don't they're creating a horrible precedent for the future the precedent they're creating for the first time in American history would be if you don't like the president you never have to take up the nominee and that message to senators including yourself to your job I'm sure you've heard that yourself many times that works on both sides of the aisle senator Kaine it's always a pleasure thanks for talking with us this morning

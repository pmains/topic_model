district in michigan over along the west side of lake michigan and i got to tell you sitting at financial services uh this story caught my attention i'm a freshman but i got to tell you this the story of mf global when it hit the news caught my attention what really caught my attention though was the next day when my phone started to ring by some very embarrassed ag producers in my district who very sheepishly said some of them didn't even know that there that mf global was their clearinghouse as they were going in and and other third parties were using them some of them did know that they had their money parked there and had had a relationship for a number of years what they didn't know was what was happening to their money that they had had there and that was uh that was something that i think has been a little lost in this whole story is the effects of what this has had in smaller rural areas that that count on these ag producers to come in be successful and use the system to to maximize their production well i can tell you these uh these farmers whether it's dairy whether it's soybeans whether it's corn uh whether it's other ag commodities have been harmed the cme that was pointed out commodities in exchange in chicago has been armed by this and if nothing else whether it's been financially it's certainly been a perception and it's been a reputation and you add all of those things together and the system as a whole has been damaged not to mention when i had a chance to question uh former senator corzine about where this money went and he had with a straight face say i have no idea or where how he was using this money and when he said he had no idea i pointed out to him as a background in real estate that doesn't work that doesn't work when your broker says well i'm not sure what happened to those escrow funds that doesn't work when an attorney says well i'm not quite sure what happened to my my uh my clients dollars that were put into a trust people go to jail for those things and we got to make sure that uh that this whole system is made right and made whole again and i can tell you that when mr corzine comes in and stays at the ritz carlton and is getting driven around as he admitted he would be done when he was out coming in for his hearings and i've got to go back to my ag producers back in west michigan and look them in the eye and say you know what the system is failing you right now because we can't give you answers and it's uh that is time for that to change and that is exactly why i think my my colleague from new york mr grimm is exactly on the right track here we need to have an independent voice we need to have an independent council that's going to come in and make sure that we can restore that trust in a system that's been down badly damaged thank you

MR. PADILLA: MADAM PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA. MR. PADILLA: THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. AS LEADER SCHUMER SAID, I RISE TODAY TO HONOR THE LIFE AND MOURN THE PASSING OF VINCENT VIN SKULLLY, WHO WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE GREATEST BROADCASTER IN SPORTS HISTORY AND A TRUE AMBASSADOR FOR LOS ANGELES, THE DODGERS, AND THE GAME OF BASEBALL. BORN IN 1927 IN THE BRONX, HE GREW UP NEAR THE POLO GROUNDS AND ACTUALLY BECAME A BIG FAN OF THE NEW YORK GIANTS BASEBALL TEAM AS A CHILD, AND I NEVER HELD THAT AGAINST HIM. HE SERVED OUR NATION AS A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE ATTENDING FORDHAM UNIVERSITY. AND AT FORDHAM -- LISTEN TO THIS -- AT FORDHAM, HE MANAGED TO PLAY ON THE BASEBALL TEAM, WORK ON THE SCHOOL PAPER AND BROADCAST MANY OF THE UNIVERSITY'S FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, AND BASKETBALL TEAMS. HIS CAREER AS A BROADCASTER TOOK UP SOON AFTER HE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE. BY 1950, HE JOINED THE BROOKLYN DODGERS BROADCAST TEAM AND IN 1954, HE BECAME THE TEAM'S PRINCIPAL ANNOUNCER, A POSITION HE WOULD HOLD UNTIL HIS RETIREMENT IN 2016. HE WAS THE LONGEST-TENURED ANNOUNCER FOR ANY TEAM IN ANY PROFESSIONAL SPORT. IN 1953, AT ONLY AGE 25, VIN BECAME THE YOUNGEST PERSON TO EVER BROADCAST A WORLD SERIES, A RECORD THAT REMAINS TO THIS DAY. WHEN THE DODGERS MOVED IN 1958, VIN MOVED WITH THE TEAM AND HE QUICKLY BECAME THE VOICE OF BASEBALL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. VIN WAS THE VOICE OF THE DODGERS FOR 67 YEARS, BUT HIS UNPARALLELED STORY TELLING AND LOVE OF SPORTS ALLOWED HIM TO TRANSCEND BASEBALL. MANY FANS WILL RECALL SOME OF THE UNIQUE CALLS OF SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE FOOTBALL GAMES AND GOLF TOURNAMENTS OF THE 21st CENTURY. HE APPEARED IN DOZENS OF MOVIES, TV SHOWS AND DOCUMENTARIES. VIN LENT HIS TALENTS TO "LAUGH IN" TO THE X-FILES, TO THE CLASSIC BASEBALL MOVIES AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES, "FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME," AND HE RELISHED SERVING AS GRAND MARSHAL OF THE 125 ROSE BOWL PARADE. HE WAS AWARDED THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM, RECOGNIZING VIN AS ONE OF THE SIGNATURE SOUNDS OF AMERICA'S PASTIME. AND EVER HUMBLE, WHEN VIN WAS INFORMED THAT HE WOULD BE RECEIVING THE HONOR, HE ASKED, ARE YOU SURE? FROM OPENING DAY TO THE WORLD SERIES AND EVERY INNING IN BETWEEN, VIN MADE EVERY GAME MEMORABLE WITH HIS LOVE OF BASEBALL. AND FOR GENERATIONS OF FANS -- GENERATIONS, HEARING VINCE SCULLY'S SOOTHING VOICE MEANT IT WAS TIME FOR DODGER BASEBALL. NOW, I GREW UP IN THE S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND AS A CHILD GROWING UP IN THE 1980'S, I SPENT MANY EVENINGS DREAMING OF GROWING UP TO PLAY PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL WHILE LISTENING TO VINCE'S VOICE NARRATE THE ACTION. WHILE HE WAS THE TALENT BEHIND THE MICROPHONE, HE WILL BE REMEMBERED BEST FOR HIS DECENCY BEYOND THE BROADCAST BOOTH. WHEN I WAS SERVING -- I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERDU JOUR ANGELA AND OUR TWO SONS BEFORE A GAME AT DODGERS STADIUM AND HE WAS JUST SO INCREDIBLY GRACIOUS WITH MY FAMILY. IT'S A MEMORY THAT WE'LL CHERISH. WE WEREN'T UNIQUE IN THAT INTERACTION WITH VIN. HE ALWAYS MADE TIME FOR FANS, REGARDLESS OF AGE, REGARDLESS OF OCCUPATION, WHEREVER AND WHENEVER HE MET THEM. YOU SEE, HE WASN'T JUST A SPORTS BROADCASTER, HE WAS A FIGURE LARGER THAN LIFE AND HE MADE ALL OF US FEEL LIKE FAMILY. ANGELA AND I CERTAINLY JOIN THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY, THE DODGERS ORGANIZATION, AND BASEBALL FANS AROUND THE WORLD IN MOURNING THE PASSING OF VINCE SCULLY. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE ENTIRE SCULLY FAMILY. THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT.

they came May 31st 1921 through June the first 18 hours of mass ratio terror they indiscriminately killed women children men elderly and they robbed they destroyed our church they put the 1908 is burned to the ground the store of black Wall Street's been lost almost 100 years in fact the very first time the airplanes are used to terrorize America was not a 9/11 not a Pearl Harbor but it was right here rarely seen video of the 1921 at Tulsa Race Riot people and their accomplishments their hope burned to the ground you must be senator Matthews I'm Elizabeth Warren it's so nice to meet you early memorials to the tragedy that had accounts on the destroyed commercial enterprises in the community and it's pretty sobering to look at that list it's a very long list this is destroyed unnecessarily and then look at the variety of all that was here that's what made it black most restaurants grocery stores hospital clothing factory interests look at what is not here today and now we see just lots of open landing and a highway [Music] were any of the white men involved ever prosecuted no in fact several dozen black men were indicted for inciting to riot and only recently have those indictments are dropped so the work that we're doing right now is about reconciliation here we trying to turn there people are traumatized by what happened in 1921 for decades this history went almost unmentioned it's like a festering wound that's untended the wound does not disappear and when we do decide that we're gonna dress that wound it becomes much more difficult to treat I say it's emblematic of the racial violence I occur to United States during this period generally and we don't talk about it we don't want to talk about it cuz it's not comfortable yeah we have to talk about white nationalism is a domestic terrorist threat just like foreign terrorism and we really need to have Department of Justice that is focused on you know willing to fight back willing to investigate willing to prosecute but it's it's powerfully important with him it is hard to really produce another one of these black wall streets for african-americans because we've been so penalized over the years that's why I love Senator Warren because she speaks on how wealth is so concentrated now in the 1921 Tulsa race massacre Centennial Commission on which I serve is working just on that we're gonna build a museum-quality facility called Greenwood rising that's gonna tell this whole narrative arc we're providing incentives for entrepreneurship we want to stimulate that black Wall Street entrepreneurial mindset so if if our our forebears could do it then in the early 1900's we can do it now there's a reason we do this yeah good for you and the work you're doing got your hands full

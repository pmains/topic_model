hello everyone well i hope you're doing well you know almost every week it seems like washington democrats are attacking hard-working americans from a different angle the economy is in a recession employers are starting to actually cut back on jobs consumer spending is in a decline and interest rates are going up and they're continuing to climb and inflation it's out of control even with all these issues facing us daily the white house and congressional democrats are out there proclaiming the economy is actually strong i'm honestly not sure if some of them are just ignoring the truth or if they actually believe their own propaganda either way the fact is that instead of doing something to reverse course and address these critical issues the byte administration has been doubling down by enacting new policies that actually exacerbate these problems take for instance the recent decision to just arbitrarily forgive some americans of their student loan debts this action is wrought with significant problems for hard-working taxpaying americans first of all the economic instability that we're facing right now is predominantly due to washington's reckless spending over the past two years even though this bailout is nothing more than spending more of the money that's taken out of your paychecks no one at the white house can actually seem to come up with how much the student loan bailout will actually cost taxpayers although congress and the white house have already spent trillions of your dollars in handouts and stimulus checks this one will not even only add to inflation it appears to be a blank check that no one really knows how much it will cost now for most of us that would be a real problem but not for washington democrats they really don't care how much of your money they spend the second major issue with this decision is that the president he doesn't have the constitutional authority to just arbitrarily forgive a debt even last year speaker nancy pelosi told the press that the president can't just forgive student loan debt she said quote while some people think that the president of the united states has the power for debt forgiveness he does not he can postpone he can delay but he doesn't have that power that has to be an act of congress drop mike that's it for once speaker pelosi showed at least a basic understanding of the balance of powers in our constitution however apparently she has forgotten that she said that since she is now praising the president for doing exactly what she said a short time ago was unconstitutional i don't think she forgot about it at all i believe she just doesn't care if it's legal ethical or unconstitutional as long as it leads to more votes for democrats in november so she can stay in power but unfortunately this disregard for the rule of law our constitution or even for what is basically right or wrong goes beyond nancy pelosi and it has become the standard operating procedure for many in washington especially the democrat machine obviously the white house cares nothing about following the constitution our laws or even the basic rules the rest of us have to abide by the list of laws for thee but not me by democrats well it's quite long it's simple things like nancy pelosi going maskless to a hair salon while the rest of us were being forced to mask up and stay at home or the bide administration using the fbi to go after political opponents such as what we've seen in the investigation into trump's campaign to the recent raid on mar-a-lago now some of you may argue that we're still waiting to see if the raid on mar-a-lago was justified but it gravely concerns me that collecting documents for the national archives would rise to a greater priority than investigating potential connections between hunter biden and foreign adversaries remember it was the same fbi leadership that ordered the raid on mar-a-lago that told us the hunter biden laptop story was only russian misinformation while they knew all along it was actually true the inequity of the rule of law runs wide and deep in washington especially with the myriad of federal bureaucracies and agencies in the past few days i was on fox news discussing more unconstitutional overreach of government regulatory agencies right now the security exchange commission the sec is writing strict regulations for crypto currencies the problem the supreme court has previously confirmed that the sec does not have the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies the sec by law is empowered to regulate securities as in stocks and bonds but not currencies but with a total disregard to the constitution congress and the supreme court the sec is pressing forward with these new regulations another financial regulatory institution the consumer financial protection bureau which in itself is an unaccountable and unconstitutional agency is also actively expanding its reach beyond its legal and constitutional authority the director of the cfpb is actively engaged in an attempt to take over the fdic and the biden doj they're just turning a blind eye to it and who can forget the irs targeting conservative groups and individuals during the obama administration which was clearly illegal and unconstitutional the list of illegal and unconstitutional overreach by federal bureaucracies goes on and on and on and we must put a stop to it so the question is how do we rein in these agencies how do we stop the unconstitutional acts by our own government how do we get rid of corruption by the people who are sworn to uphold the constitution well that is actually a role of congress but we have to have a congress that strongly exercises its role of oversight and investigation we have to have a congress that acts as an independent branch of government not just a political arm of the white house under our constitution there is a system of checks and balances where congress is tasked to hold the other two branches accountable to the law and to the constitution but to do that it's imperative that we in congress have a complete picture of what is actually going on especially within these agencies and at the white house i've been working with my republican colleagues to prepare a bold and aggressive agenda to hold government accountable and transparent first we need to use all the tools at our disposal to uncover the truth root out corruption and find the abuses of power that are happening throughout the federal government second we have to restore transparency to the american people on key issues you know one time in our history we actually had journalists that cared about truth and transparency unfortunately today's mainstream media care more about advancing a big government socialist agenda than actually pursuing the truth therefore we have to ensure that the american people know what's going on in their federal government third congress will have to aggressively assert our constitutional authority as prescribed in article 1 of the constitution this not only includes holding the other branches accountable constraining them to their constitutional limitations but also by effectively exerting our authority such as the power of the purse to rein in these agencies and fourth we have to use every tool in our constitutional toolbox to force the administration to answer for their illegal and unconstitutional violations for mishandling of issues related to our national security like the issues in our southern border the botched withdrawal from afghanistan the handling of the january 6 investigations and the general mismanagement of our country you'll be hearing more details of our plans throughout the coming weeks but there is one area that we have to address before we can clean the corruption out of our government it's something that i've been working on for a long time and it must be one of the first steps that we take and that's reforming the federal laws of hiring and firing of federal employees while there is and will always be corruption in government what we're seeing in america today is unprecedented and much of it can be traced back to some very strategic actions taken by president obama to ensure that his political operatives stayed in positions of influence even after he left office president obama as every president made hundreds of political appointments across the entire federal government these were almost exclusively people who were progressive activists and believed in a more socialist style government knowing that any political appointees made by president can be replaced at will by the next president president obama converted many of these appointments to general service government employees now gsa employees are protected by law and can't be replaced by the incoming administration not only does that ensure that they would keep their employment he also knew that under the current law it would be virtually impossible to fire them federal employees have a level of employment protection that is unique and it makes it nearly impossible to fire a bad employee under current law it takes an average of 360 days to dismiss a federal employee and it can even take up to two years if the employee appeals their dismissal for the past few years my staff and i have been working on legislation to reform the federal employment system which will allow for the timely dismissal of federal employees who violate the law or who don't follow the rules they don't show up for work refuse to obey the orders of the superiors or they violate the constitution my bill is called the merit act and i've been pushing this legislation for several years and i believe we must pass this in order to begin cleaning house in the federal government there are several other pieces of key legislation that we will be advancing to reform our government and in the coming weeks we'll be rolling out more information about them we have to have a level of trust in our government but that's only possible if we restore honesty integrity and a respect for the constitution throughout all levels of our government this is our opportunity to make significant change but we must be bold and aggressive the american people deserve a government like our founders intended one that's small in size limited in scope and fully accountable to the american people and that is my goal stay tuned as i roll out more of what republicans are going to do in the next congress to reform our government restore our economy and return our nation to one that is free safe and full of opportunity god bless you and god bless america

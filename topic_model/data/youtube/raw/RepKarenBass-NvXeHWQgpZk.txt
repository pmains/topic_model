congresswoman Karen bass with us right now Carson thank you for taking the time absolutely what is your sense of the thinking within your committee that it would be a party-line vote I think unfortunately it probably will be a party line vote I don't have any indication that my Republican colleagues are going to break rank I think they're in a very tough position because they know it they did do that it would be the end of their career what about forward some of your more moderate members outside your committee Board of the point congresswoman some of those who wanted district the president one thirty thirty one of those individuals what are you hearing about them well I think they're rock solid now I know that there are a couple that are thinking of voting against it but you know we have several of those marginal members on the committee and I know in terms of the Democrats on the committee that we are a hundred percent united you know this is definitely not a day to celebrate this is a solemn day all of us feel an incredible burden of history knowing this is just the third time that this process has happened in US history so nobody is celebrating this it was odd today that within two hours of this impeachment you know sort of announcement congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senate colleagues you know talked about this trade deal that was scored finally in the eleventh hour with Canada and Mexico was that just coincidence well you know I do think that it was because you know especially on something like a trade deal that is very very difficult for Democrats to come together on considering Labour's influence and all that when you have something that delicate that fragile you have to strike so if they just two hours I know I know you know on the other hand I think the good sign that that should send to the American people is that even though we are doing something extremely contentious even though there is tremendous tension between the house of the administration it is still possible to get things done and I know you know Neil that we have passed over 200 bills bipartisan bipartisan bills that are languishing in the Senate I understand why they won't deal with our partisan bills I don't understand why McConnell won't pass the bills the Democrats and Republicans have come together that much chagrin it is a long party lines and that the Democrat vote for vtune announced not a single Republican and it goes similarly maybe in the Senate could you work with this president if he dodges impeachment well you know what yes I can I mean I think again the example is the trade agreement you know we have to do the business of the American people and truthfully Neal that what really created the urgency here is the fear of the 2020 election the fact that the president seemed as though he was going to interfere in this election and we're not even sure that he's not continuing to interfere considering that his personal attorney is over in the UK Ukraine what is he doing over there right now if it's not looking for more conspiracies against who the president feels is his leading opposition very still have you congresswoman you're aware of these reports coming out about military leaders and tights politicians who have acknowledged and now all of this has come out that there was sort of foolery to the whole Afghan war for the better part of two decades what linking the American people goes back to President Bush and then President Obama and then through this one it's those Obama years that I'm curious about overstating success in Afghanistan how do you feel about that oh I think it's very troubling and frankly I had been concerned about the Afghanistan war from the I haven't read the report I will definitely do that but you know I just think about my colleagues who are here in the house with me who are permanently disabled for more injuries so I just think that's particularly egregious I do want to read the report and understand exactly express frustration with former President Obama that he might have been part of that crew of the cheerleaded Afghanistan sure if he was part of it but I will tell you something when I first got here I was really pushed to go to Iraq and what I found there was I found the military trying to persuade members of Congress to convince the administration not to drawdown in Iraq so if the if President Obama is responsible you know so be it but I also wonder whether or not the military was sugarcoating things too because I actually personally experienced that Congress when it's always a pleasure thank you for taking the time thanks for having me on

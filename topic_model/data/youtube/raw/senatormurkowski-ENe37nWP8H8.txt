so an official welcome to our infrastructure grants suppose and i'm here today at this unprecedented event that has brought so many federal agencies together in one place to give us access and information on this large yes that's been extended to our region and state to really fast forward and accomplish the priorities we've had stacking up for decades this this is dedicated to helping all alaskans better understand all of the opportunities all of the benefits that are coming our way as a result of the infrastructure investment and jobs act we work with all 165 cities and boroughs in alaska we're here at the infrastructure grant symposium to not only learn more about the available opportunities but to make sure that our members and so many others can benefit the most possible for alaska i think it's going to be transformational i think it will be transformational providing generational benefits all across the state and i'm here in anchorage today at the symposium trying to understand all the different grants that are out there the the infrastructure bill that senator murkowski helped write has just been outstanding the key is making sure we find out what we need to do in order to get this money into our communities and get these projects rolling i knew for our state why did we need help when it came to infrastructure where we are rated a c minus according to the american society of civil engineering it means that we do not have enough or we have poorly maintained roads we have structurally deficient and unsafe bridges we have a real need for better ports airports ferry service broadband connectivity affordable energy all of that needs to change and so we wrote a bill to change it and we did it without raising our taxes we did it in a manner that will actually work to reduce english i'm really excited to be here uh senator mikowski's put us in a fantastic position to move our communities and our state forward so uh really uh pleased for this opportunity to look at uh improving our energy broadband our ports and harbors roads and uh it's all on the plane so we are now at that place we're in a position to repair our older aging infrastructure we're in position to build out the infrastructure that our state never had doesn't have whether it's clean drinking water whether it's our sanitation systems but we're also in a position to strengthen and diversify our economy so that we can compete we can compete and we can thrive and we can prosper over the longer term there is a tremendous amount for alaska in this infrastructure law and i wrote many of many of the provisions that you will see specifically with alaska in mind and then shaped others to make sure that we could participate and benefit but i will tell you one of the things that i'm looking forward to within this this law is over the course of the next several years we're going to see thousands of new jobs here in alaska and in alaska that is [Applause]

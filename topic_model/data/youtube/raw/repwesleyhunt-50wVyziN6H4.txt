but this is actually not about race this is actually an issue of Public Safety and if I call this if I call this an invasion sir I'm not racist I can assure you I'm not racist what I can assure you is that I want to make sure that fentanyl doesn't indiscriminately kill any race religion color or Creed because fentanyl doesn't care where you're from fentanyl doesn't care about race fitting all kills indiscriminately this gentleman right here works his tail off every single day to stop that from happening now there's been a break in the dam and that's pretty obvious because a couple of years ago of course we had some problems but it wasn't Amplified to the level that we are seeing every single day and the reason why we have to be careful with what we call and what we deem racist moving forward in the future is because we stopped we stopped losing we start to lose food what they actually problem is Administration a Democratic party unfortunately uses race as a scapegoat for everything and as somebody that wants to make sure that we do attack racist issues when they do occur we can't be the boy who cried wolf and blamed racism all the time I am here to hold this Administration accountable to understand that there are issues of race that need to be addressed and Sir this ain't one of them I applaud some of your actions in El Paso it sounds like you're doing some great things but I'm going to tell you as being born and raised in Texas living in Houston we have a problem and this problem has precipitated over the course of the past two years that is a fact uh they get working together I get Reaching Across the aisle but this morning I can't believe that we had a one-hour debate over rather not we're just saying the Pledge of Allegiance before we convene every day one hour that to me is antithetical to the point of this meeting today I implore you all to be careful with using race because your son's no longer here and I'm sorry there's a hundred thousand sons and daughters that are no longer here because of fentanyl last year

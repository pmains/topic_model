EXTREMISTS WHO, NOW, GET TO MEET AND GREET THE PEOPLE. JOINING ME NOW, CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA MEMBER OF THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE, INVESTIGATED SCOTT PERRY'S ROLE IN THE QUEUE FOR THE FORMER IN THE DEFENSE, AND NOW WITH REPUBLICANS HOLD MAJORITY. BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, I WANT TO ASK ABOUT SCOTT PERRY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. >> WITH ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WITH KEVIN MCCARTHY, IT WAS THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE'S, AND THE LAUREN BOEBERT'S, AND IT IS PUTTING THEM -- SO NOT A SURPRISE, IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THEM, BECAUSE IT WILL SHOW THEIR ACCESS FROM DAY ONE. IT IS GOING TO DISCREDIT THE VERY COMMITTEE, AND ANY INVESTIGATION THAT THEY DO. FOR THE COUNTRY, IT HAS TO BE A TERRIBLE CIRCUS. WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION OF DONALD TRUMP, AND HIS ENABLERS INDIES ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION, TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS IMPLICATED IN IT, LIKE PERRY, BEING ONE OF THOSE. IT REMINDS ME A LOT OF REPUBLICANS, DURING THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, DURING THE UKRAINE INVESTIGATION, ESSENTIALLY, ACTING AS DEFENSE COUNSELOR FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. >> ON THE QUESTION OF SUBPOENAS, THERE'S A MOSTLY SET OF FACTS HERE. SCOTT PERRY GOT A SUBPOENA WHICH HE DENIED. HE IS NOW PROMISING SUBPOENAS OF HIS OWN. YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS PROGRAM BEFORE, TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE THE ENFORCEABILITY OF CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS. IT WAS WITH THE POWER OF SUBPOENAS PLAYING OUT. IT IS CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS WITHOUT. >> THERE IS NO REALIZE ASIAN OF THE HYPOCRISY WHAT TO DO, AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE ON HIS FACE WHICH IS, WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THE FALSEHOOD OF THIS EQUIVALENCE. DEMOCRATS CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS, OF THINGS LIKE JANUARY 6TH. IT JUSTIFIED REPUBLICANS ENGAGING IN VEXATIOUS LITIGATIONS, OVER OVERSIGHTS, AND HARASSMENTS, IN THE BIDEN MINISTRATION. ENDLESS HEARINGS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP, FOR NO EXAMPLE. WE WERE ATTACKED ON JANUARY SIX. THERE WAS MULTIPLE LINES FOR THE ELECTION AND, IT IS NOT THE SAME THING IS WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE ABOUT TO DO. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO POINT OUT, WHAT IS LEGITIMATE, WHAT IS ILLEGITIMATE, AND TO LAW LET THEM BLUR THE DISTINCTION, AND TRY TO DO WITH THE DEMOCRATS TO. >> IN TERMS OF TIT-FOR-TAT, ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THE ASSIGNMENTS, AND THEY HAVE VOTED PAUL GOSAR AND THE WAKE OF NEW COMMENTS THEY MADE, OR REVEALED COMMENTS THEY MADE AND SAYING THAT NANCY PELOSI COMMITTED TREASON, AND IT'S PUNISHABLE BY DEATH. PAUL GOSAR, SHOWED HIMSELF MURDERING HIS COLLEAGUE, AOC. IN RESPONSE, KEVIN MCCARTHY HAS PROMISED TO TARGET SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS, CHIEF AMONG THEM, YOU, AND TO REMOVE YOU FROM YOUR ROLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. CAN ANYONE DO THAT? >> THEY MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IT IS A SELECT COMMITTEE, AND IT IS A STANDING COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE. THERE MAY BE IN THE HOUSE FLOOR, AND SO, AGAIN, THIS IS KEVIN MCCARTHY, BOWING TO THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS OF HIS CONFERENCE, AND IN ORDER TO GET THE SUPPORT OF MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE THEY HAD PROMISED RETRIBUTION. IT IS GOING TO ENGAGE IN THIS BOGUS INVESTIGATION PROCESS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CALL OVERSIGHT. IT IS NOT OVERSIGHT. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, THEY'RE TRYING TO REMOVE DEMOCRATS FROM KEY POSITIONS, TO PREVENT THEM FROM, EFFECTIVELY, FIGHTING BACK. MCCARTHY DOES NOT LIKE WHAT I DID, AND IT ISN'T LIKE HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE, SAYING IT WAS TRUE MY COLLEAGUE ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, ERIC SWALWELL, IS TRYING TO DECAPITATE THOSE WHO WOULD HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE, ROOTING THEM FROM COMMITTEES THAT, IS A BIG PART OF THE COMMITTEE, TO. >> THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO VIEW THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, AND BROAD OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES OF THE REPUBLICANS. IT WAS GOING TO CREATE THIS ENDLESS TURN OF THE STORIES IT WAS SAYING, I DON'T KNOW, BASICALLY THE TRUTH WITH IT. SO THERE IS A DURHAM COUNTER INVESTIGATION. THE SEGMENTS ARE ON FOX NEWS EARLIER ABLE TO DELIVER, AND NO SMALL THING IN TRYING TO MAKE AN HOUR OF CABLE NEWS EVERY NIGHT. HE WAS NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE ANYTHING, AT ALL, AND THE WHOLE THING WAS OF FLOP. WHICH OF THESE TO THINK IS MORE LIKELY? >> THEY SAID, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THEY MAKE SENSATIONAL ALLEGATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLY, UNTRUE. SO, YES, THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT, THEY WILL BE FATHER FOR THE FOX NEWS ISSUE. IT WILL BE FARTHER FOR SOME OF THE RIGHT-WING BASE, AND BY THE END OF THE DAY, IT WILL BE A LOT OF STORM, AND FURY, SIGNIFYING NOTHING. I THINK THAT IT IS PROBABLY THE QUICKNESS TO THE END OF THE MAJORITY. AS WELL AS THIS MAJORITY MINISTRY, IT LIKELY, WILL ALSO BE THE SHORTEST REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN HISTORY, PARTICULARLY IF THEY PUT THE CIRCUS CHARACTERS, AND CLOWNS, ON THESE IMPORTANT COMMITTEES. >> OBVIOUSLY, FROM CALIFORNIA, REPRESENTATIVE, AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM HIS STATE, DIANE FEINSTEIN, WOULD BE 91, WHERE SHE TO RUN FOR REELECTION IN 2024. MANY PEOPLE ANTICIPATE SHE WILL NOT. KATIE PORTER IS RUNNING FOR U.S. SENATE, AND IS REPORTING BARBARA LEE, ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION, FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, MIGHT AS WELL. THERE IS REPORTING THAT YOU WILL THROW YOUR HAT IN THE RING. ARE YOU PLANNING TO RUN FOR SENATE? >> YOU KNOW, THE FOCUS I'VE HAD OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS IS REALLY ON THE STORM. IT IS GOING TO SURVEY THE DAMAGE THAT THEY SHOULD BE, WHILE OUR FELLOW CITIZENS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING. HAPPILY, THE STORM IS COMING TO AN END, AND IT IS IN THIS SUBJECT SOON, BUT I WILL BE VERY FOCUSED THAT I PROTECT MY CONSTITUENTS, AND THOSE AROUND THE STATE FROM THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE

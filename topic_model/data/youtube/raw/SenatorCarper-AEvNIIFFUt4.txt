earth is getting warmer we're a big part of the cause the United States is a major emitter of carbon dioxide that's part of the big part of the problem we need to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide in from our power plants from other vehicles that we drive from our industries and literally as individuals we can make a difference to simply by recycling more you could argue that my generation we're not going to be all that much affected by global warming but my children well and their children will too so this is as much for for those you're going to follow us on this earth as it is for for us and if we're not careful we're going to leave behind them a planet that's continues to grow warmer we may even reach a point where a tipping point word there's no way to turn turn back if we start now we can make a difference we can make sure that our children and grandchildren or we recycle the less energy we use and we are just getting started really in a big way and recycling in Delhi we can do a lot more and if we as individuals if we recycle more we can help turn the tide against global warming the largest source of carbon dioxide in our country is powerplants powerplants also emit a lot of mercury mercury gets into our air comes down in the rain and fish and gested pregnant women in just the fish and I carry around high levels of mercury in their bodies give birth to babies that have brain damage we have a lot of nitric oxide in our air from power plants we have a lot of sulfur dioxide emissions in our air and we end up with a lot of breathing disorders in asthma Delaware has the highest rate of child asthma in the country one out of eight and we can do something about that and we need to do something about that when this bill comes to the floor almost from the day that I arrived in the Senate I've focused on crafting a consensus around legislation to reduce the threat of global warming to reduce the emissions of that bad stuff enjoy our mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide which damages the health of unborn children and damages the health of children who breathe this stuff especially in older people I've worked on this for six years but we're giving a harder in the car

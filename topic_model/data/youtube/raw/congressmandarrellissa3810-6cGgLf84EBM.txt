I'm Speaker Newt Gingrich and I want to take a moment to endorse darrell Issa because I have worked with Darrell I know he's a solid conservative I know he's the kind of person the President Trump needs in Washington I know that he's fought to clean the swamp up long before most people had ever heard the term we need somebody as smart as hard-working as courageous as Darrell and that's why the National Border Patrol Council with its 18,000 courageous members endorsed them they know that he stands for protecting America he stands for solid conservative values and that he will work with President Trump to give us a stronger better America so I'm all for darrell Issa and I hope you will be too [Music] you

dole family or patriots and they've given so much to this country and the way in which he led is is something that we need to reflect on today without a doubt your district of course covers a great swath of the united states southern border i'm wondering your thoughts on the current state of the border crisis and how it's affecting people in your community yeah nothing has really gotten better on the border uh you know i had a call uh earlier this week with the del rio border patrol chief and they're seeing over a thousand apprehensions a day and and part of that is because of the biden's administration's lack of working with anyone from uh on the other side of the aisle you know i ask myself why does biden hate immigrants and that's kind of uh some bold language there but the facts are this over 550 immigrants have died have perished on this dangerous trek you've got children unaccompanied children that have been assaulted some in some cases sexually assaulted in in uh hhs custody nothing has gotten better the only way things overall get better is if both parties come together and make sure border security is a priority to another huge issue affecting every one of your constituents hitting them in the wallet inflation what should washington the bind administration be doing about inflation sir yeah no inflation is very real and in my district in particular which is very rural uh we've been impacted greatly uh step one is making sure that we have energy independence and uh you know and opening up our oil and natural gas lines here in the united states is step one you know i represent much of the southern border and one of the things that this administration has done it's shut down the border for economic purposes but it left it wide open for illegal immigration it's the exact opposite you should open uh the border for economic purposes welcome those that are coming to shop and and visit our doctors and do those things but you should be absolutely firm against those that are trying to enter this country illegally there's also the supply chain crisis we've got christmas on the horizon your thoughts on that and should the administration be doing more to address that critical issue yeah no these uh supply chain issues are very real and i think people are going to see it uh especially come christmas time and you know one the administration just needs to uh stop encouraging people to not work you know we're seeing labor shortages in every industry across the board when that happens there there is a trickle effect that uh that that limits uh that supply chain issue it starts and ends with the biden administration you know one it's it's enforcing the policies that are already in play two is messaging you have to message on this and make sure that we get this country back on track starts with the administration but it's up to house republicans to make sure that they they uh follow through with those with those uh promises congressman tony gonzalez republican of the great state of texas thank you very much for your time have a great day thank you mike

[Music] and i don't think that he should go uh meet with mbs until mbs takes some accountability for the murder of the american journalists and until they bring the war to yemen to an end but look at the irony we're going and begging saudi arabia for oil while we're exporting our own oil around the world i mean it makes no sense and the saudis are going to play us that is a democrat speaking out against president biden's energy policies and upcoming trip to saudi arabia republican louisiana senator bill cassidy joins me now senator i mean he's walking into the offices of mbs what happened to jamal khashoggi what happened to the pariah that president biden promised he was going to turn the saudis into in the saudi leader where's all of that now this is a this is a confluence of at least three things inflation being driven by the high price of oil number one number two a recognition that sometimes you gotta you can't pick your allies for um what you like to pick them for you have to pick them for what you need and lastly the biden administration's war on north american oil and gas production it's that last one that's been most impactful because if he had not started that war the week that he took the presidency would now have a adequate supply of north american oil and natural gas but because we don't he's got to swallow his pride and go to mbs and ask him to please please please put out more oil what do you make of these reports that president biden actually has been selling some of the spr reserves he's been selling that overseas to europe to asia the the optics alone are a little troublesome yeah the optics are are troublesome now what i've learned is that the companies buy it and then the company ship it overseas and what i've been told is that our refining capacity is at 95 percent so that there's a limited amount of refining capacity here so they ship it overseas now that's their side of the story i want to know a little bit more but as regards the refining capacity the energy information uh agency actually confirms that on the other hand part of the refining capacity being down is because of the regulatory environment and companies just throwing in the towel on certain certain uh refining plants so this administration just basically owns a high price of oil and gas in the united states well and we'll see how that plays out in the midterms we know what the predictions are anyway for this red wave we may see in november real quick any talk in washington right now among you and your colleagues about suspending the federal gas tax there is some talk but it's going to president obama when this was brought to him said it would make a minimal difference upon how much somebody pays for gasoline per week um so so this is a band-aid on on top of a gaping wound and the gaping wound is started by the biden administration's war on north american energy production i would say a better response operation warp speed just like we did it for vaccines and got a vaccine out in 10 months let's do it for north american oil and gas production and for refining capacity if we did that it would send a signal to the market futures prices would go down and that would help automatically or at least at this point on the price of oil and gas and gasoline senator bill cassidy it's great to have you here senator thank you for your time

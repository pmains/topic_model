that the proceedings of the quorum be dispensed with without without objection uh mr president um i rise today to speak uh some of the issues that were just addressed by the republican leader and that's the legislation that we will hopefully turn to next about creating jobs you know there's a a lot of occasions when legislation comes to the floor of this senate that that i like many members have a view on and we kind of weigh in on our positions but this legislation this legislation as it comes forward is something that i have more than just a kind of intellectual or political or philosophical viewpoint on this legislation is actually um involves the business that i was in for nearly 20 years i was proud of the fact that starting in the early 80s up until the time that i was elected as governor of virginia i was involved as a originally as an angel investor and then as a venture capitalist and helping start companies uh across this country proud to have been involved as a venture capitalist in funding almost 70 companies those companies that grew to now employ tens of thousands of americans although as the presiding officer and some of the folks realized a lot of those companies i involved with were involved in telecommunications i was the co-founder of nextel although even though i can't seem to be able to turn my cell phone off at the appropriate times but i think that that background gave me some sense of what it is to find a management team to identify the cap find the capital and get a company started to allow it to grow create jobs create economic prosperity this issue around capital formation encouraging startups encouraging entrepreneurs is an issue that we ought to be able to come together on i see my good friend the senator from kansas who i know is going to speak uh in a few moments after i'm finished and he and i have worked together on legislation called startup america that has been in endorsed by tech councils across the country been endorsed by and builds upon the work of the kaufman foundation been endorsed and built upon the work on the president's council on jobs and economic competitiveness this ought to be an area where we can um find common ground some of the ideas that that we're going to be discussing in this legislation are not only ideas that senator moran and i have worked on but i know senator coons and senator rubio i know senator toomey and senator schumer i know senator tester senator merkley senator brown the list actually in terms of sponsors or co-sponsors of a number of these bills number not in the single digits but literally in in the dozens probably in excess of 20. and for the most part almost every one of these pieces of legislation are bipartisan why do we need to do this because if we look over the last 20 years at where the jobs have been created in america we find that for the most part unfortunately the job growth from companies that are in the fortune 1000 really have been flat if not slightly negative so while we applaud and support america's largest businesses because of increased productivity because of globalization those are not the companies really adding jobs and while every member of the united states senate when they stand up stands up and applauds small business and and i and i know my colleagues on the floor support small business traditional small businesses the barber shop the retailer the hardware store there really hasn't been much job growth amongst those companies as well so where the jobs come from the jobs have come from startup businesses the kind of businesses where entrepreneur tries to scare up a little bit of capital and takes an idea to market nearly 80 percent i think according to the coffin foundation of all the new jobs created in america the last 20 years have come from these firms now we oftentimes think of these firms as technology firms many of them are the facebooks and googles but they're also the the companies that span the reach of all kinds of uh of different areas uh the lululemons in terms of uh clothing store or the under armour a company that's up in maryland these are the kinds of companies that we need to do more to support in their growth particularly right now when our economy is still struggling so what are we trying to do in in this legislation to my mind there's three or four areas that that these bills need to address first of all we need to make it easier for these startup companies to raise capital over the last decade a lot of the traditional sources of capital raising have actually diminished particularly since the financial crisis the number of venture capital firms that exist that fund companies have actually decreased the ability for a company to go public which perhaps we got a little too excessive in the late 90s when we saw dot com companies rush to go public and then that dot bubble burst and those companies failed but that access to the public markets has been seriously constrained partially because of added regulations partially because of added reporting requirements and partially because there's been i think a recognition that going public may not have been the right route for all of these companies the result has been that many of these senators time has expired i'd ask for an additional five minutes without objection the result is that many of these startup companies ended up end up having to sell to a larger company and many of the ideas and many of the job creation opportunities are then constrained so we need to make it easier for these companies to access capital some of the ideas that are going to be proposed in the legislation will do that some of the reforms to reggae reg d trying to look at raising the number of investors that a company startup company can have before they have to report all are i think sensible appropriate incentives to help these startup companies get going we also need and i i understand the the very important requirements put in place by the so-called sarbanes-oxley legislation a few years back but the cost of going public for startup companies now on average three to four million dollars those costs are not costs that many of these startup companies can absorb so some of the sensible reforms have been proposed by senator toomey senator schumer that i've been a proud co-sponsor on on a so-called on-ramp for start-up companies i think makes sense as well there's also other tools that we can use to help start up companies as they try to access capital we've seen a dramatic transformation of the internet over the last 20 years every business every part of our life has been changed there are now the ability to use the internet as a way for small investors to get the same kind of deals that up to this point only select investors have gotten that have been customers of some of the best known best best-known investment banking firms well we can now use the power of the internet to term called crowdfunding now there has to be appropriate investor restraints in this and investor protections but crowdfunding using the internet is another source of capital i hope that would be included in the legislation that we're looking at and i want to commend senator bennett and senator merkley and senator brown for working hard on that but there are other pieces of this legislation if we are going to compete and win in this global competition for talent and ideas and have these jobs create an america that we've got to take on that's why i was so proud to work with senator moran in our startup legislation that says attracting capital is one part of making a company successful another part of making a company successful is winning the worldwide competition for talent and unfortunately time and again what we are doing in this country is we are losing that competition for the best talent there are literally tens of thousands of jobs that are going unfilled right now because we do not have enough american-born scientists engineers mathematicians with graduate degrees we in our country because we have the world's best system of higher education we train many of the world's best and brightest but with our current immigration policies we actually train those folks at the virginia techs and the university of new mexico's get them that phd in engineering and then we send them home when they have an opportunity to actually get a job here in this country you can't talk to a tech company anywhere in america that says we are losing the competition for talent so what does our legislation do we actually do what tech firms have called for for years which is in effect staple that green card to those individuals who get not a bachelor's degree but a master's or phd in the science technology engineering or math field the so-called stem fields if they have a job opportunity in america allow that intellectual capital and talent to actually reside and help create jobs here in this country what we do as well is we create a new category visa for in effect an entrepreneur's visa we have a very narrow category within our immigration policies which right now that allows certain immigrants who want to come invest in our companies in this country and hire americans to get access to a visa we would expand that category so if an individual can demonstrate they've raised capital or willing to hire a number of americans why don't they allow we allow them to start that job here in america rather than going somewhere else to do it so we've put in place i believe reasonable small changes to our immigration policies that will again allow us to compete what our startup legislation does as well is it looks at how we can encourage our universities because we need capital we need talent but we also need the intellectual capital and that comes from ideas and our universities across this country do a good job of doing basic research our universities across this country don't do as good a job as they could and should in moving those ideas from the laboratory into the marketplace and i know my time is about to expire so i'll wrap this up what we do in our legislation as well is we don't add additional funding but we take a small sliver 15 tenths of one percent of our existing research and development dollars and actually use those as incentive funds to get ideas out of the laboratory into commercialization so i know that we are going to move to this legislation shortly i do believe that there were a number of members particularly newer members who've been working on this legislation across the aisle there was an attempt to put together a broad bipartisan bill i'm not sure that's going to come to pass on the floor unfortunately because on this issue i do agree with the republican leader this there should not be a republican or democratic legislation there should be a bipartisan piece of legislation here that will actually encourage startups to get the capital to get the talent to get the ideas so that we can actually make sure that we move forward on job creation the data is clear the jobs over the last 20 years have come from these kind of startup companies the kind that i was proud to help fund as a in my 20 years of of identifying funding and working on these startup ventures we need to do all we can to support them we need to move this legislation as quickly as possible and my hope is that we can move beyond the rather narrowly drawn capital formation legislation that we're going to look at and look at these other areas around crowdfunding around around appropriate visa policies around commercialization of intellectual capital to move these ideas forward with that i'm going to yield the floor to my friend and and uh colleague someone who has uh been a leader on this issue as well somebody who i know has been crisscrossing the country uh over the last couple of days recently came back from austin texas where he was celebrated as a as a startup guru and that is my friend the senator from kansas and let me also acknowledge a senator from south dakota who has been a leader particularly on the reg d reform so with that mr president i yield the floor

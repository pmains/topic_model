okay uh good afternoon my name is john madigan i'm the vice president for public policy for the american foundation for suicide prevention and it's my distinct honor to introduce the dean of the house mental health caucus our dear friend grace napolitano from california congresswoman thank you thank you thank you it's uh thank you very much for the invitation to be here and i know about dean there's too many deans around here uh but uh i'm very happy to be here and to have as part of the mental health caucus or mental health month is trying to have a series of discussions so it would educate and inform members of congress of the need to be able to pass a legislation that is going to be helpful i'm very pleased to join all the groups that advocate assistance to uh mental health organizations should i say to destigmatize the issue because it affects millions of americans the young the old it has no no uh barriers it's the rich the poor you you name it it's something that all of us need to be aware of and we as you can see wearing lime green uh to be able to support mental health for the month of may an ongoing discussion and in one of my last briefings we asked if people were interested in having not just once a year but ongoing briefings to be able to educate inform and be able to coalesce because if we don't coalesce and we're individually less successful the stigma we try to tell folks including some of our staff don't be afraid to ask for help because this is something that we're finding out people are afraid to come out the education must continue to parents to educators to business people to everybody because in the end it's a business issue too billions of dollars are lost because of mental health uh illnesses um it harms both human and the economic cost it's the tenth leading cause of death for americans and the the estimate i say it's a guesstimate it's 44 billion annually that's a large figure they suffer in silence and we continue to try to make sure that when families are affected it is a horrendous thing that we all don't realize because it doesn't happen directly to us but again latino adolescents have the highest rate of attempted suicide in the nation we continue to advocate for services on school sites that's why my mental health and schools act which i'm sure you've already seen and not you will and a sharing of the mental health resources so that people understand that there are now hopefully in mental health parity where we know their loopholes we're trying to close those be able to address the shortcoming of the insurance companies that don't want to deal with paying for mental health services so the nation the learning of the warning signs that's critical so that we all have an idea of what's happening to our co-workers our family members or dear ones but the national crisis hotline the 800 273 talk which is eight two five five with 24 hour confidential hotline assisting veterans and again veterans also have a very high rate of suicide as do college and university students so thank you all very much and i'll get off my band thank you very much for being here just uh today i received some emails from my good friend jill diamond from the world boxing council she's getting the promoters the fighters and staff to wear the green ribbon at every fight so we've got to thank the world boxing council okay before we start a couple quick shout outs grace mentioned the national suicide prevention hotline john draper raise your hand john's from new york city he's in charge of the whole national

applaud her she's like graces to california and the nation marlene is to ohio so thank you very much so without further ado it's my extreme pleasure to introduce one of my favorite colleagues from new york city and atlanta dr doreen marshall who is our senior director for education and prevention so listen intently and then there'll be time for q a there's also lunch in the back so please help yourself thanks thank you john it's a pleasure to be here with all of you i am the senior director of education and prevention at the american foundation for suicide prevention i'm also a psychologist and i am a suicide loss survivor i've been involved in suicide prevention since my fiance died by suicide in 1995. for those of you in the room that have ever thought about suicide i want you to know i'm so glad you are here your lives matter to tell you a little bit about suicide over 40 000 people this this year will die by suicide that's about a person every 12.8 minutes 90 of those who die by suicide are suffering from a mental health problem at the time of their deaths whether diagnosed or not suicide affects individuals of all races creeds religions ethnicities income levels there's no typical person who dies by suicide or who attempts suicide we use the term lived experience to refer to those who have struggled with suicide in their lives these can be individuals who have had suicidal thoughts suicidal feelings or have had suicidal actions such as a past suicide attempt for some of those individuals that struggle is current for others it's a past struggle and then for many it comes and goes throughout their lives and you are going to hear the stories of three incredibly incredibly resilient individuals today those with lived experience are many of us they are the people we come into contact with every single day they are those who cut our hair who serve our foods who maybe drove us to this event they are our colleagues our family members and our friends the number of people in the united states with lived experiences in the millions and we know that events like this are a way for us to open that dialogue with those with lived experience and if we're going to prevent suicide who can we better learn about suicide from than those who are living with the experience of suicide our organization afsp has a goal of a 20 reduction in suicide by the year 2025 and one way we are going to do this is to engage with partners but also to engage those with lived experience to to help us learn about the experience of suicide so if you're asking yourself well what can i do there are a few things we'd like you to do today we want you to recognize that suicide is a complex phenomenon that there's no simple cause and event when it comes to suicide to recognize that it's not an issue of willpower and that those who have survived the experience of being suicidal or suicide attempt are incredibly resilient these are not individuals that are permanently fragile but rather they teach us a lot about how to live with difficulties how to be resilient we use language that's respectful and that's certainly something you can do today we say died by suicide versus committed suicide we don't refer to attempts as successful or failed attempts we use value-free language when it comes to that with the only value being supporting life we familiar familiarize ourselves with resources such as those that we have at afsp also the national suicide prevention lifeline the 1-800-273-talk number it's important to note that our reactions to suicide are normal that they are a combination and an outcry of our experiences of stigma of what we've learned in our families and in our communities about suicide and mental health issues they can those feelings can evoke a sense of fear and helplessness and what i'd encourage each of you to do as you hear the stories today and as you hear people in your lives talk about their lived experience is to move toward it not away from it to learn from it to engage it and to not be afraid to have the open dialogues to tell you a little bit about afsp we are the largest non-profit focused on suicide prevention we fund scientific research my role at afsp we offer education programs such as school-based programs to help teachers learn about how to prevent suicide in their students we focus on public education and then of course in john's role we work with promoting policies and legislation that impact suicide so with that i'm going to introduce our our panel and i encourage you to just really listen to to their amazing stories of resilience and hope um to my left is uh taryn aiken taryn is the board chair and the founding member of the afsp utah chapter next to taryn is brandon marcico brandon is co-chair and one of the founding members of the afsp south central pennsylvania chapter brandon has also spoken about his lived experience at our out of the darkness walk and then my colleague shelby rowe is the afsp education and prevention manager at our national office she is also the past president of afsp in the chapter in arkansas we are thrilled to have them join us today and to share their wisdom okay taryn i'm going to turn it over to you wow i feel very tall good afternoon my name is taryn aiken i certainly don't need a microphone i speak very loudly it's an honor to be here with you today and share just a little bit of my story and what brought me to afsp i grew up in utah i grew up in the dominant religion there for those of you that don't know it's lds aka mormon um at the age of eight i i underwent a ritual in our religion of being baptized um being washed clean of my sins you know because i had so many by age eight at age eight there was a really profound experience that happened i began being sexually abused by a neighbor there was also another very profound experience that happened at that same time frame i i walked into my parents bedroom and found my father of a drug overdose that i would later learn was his first attempt at suicide however he did live through that the experience of what had happened to me at age eight is profound because that i believe was the turning point of my mental health and the turning point for who i viewed i was what my value was here on this earth and what i would experience over the next 25 years of my life at age 12 i experienced my first suicide attempt utilizing things in my own home a lot of what i had witnessed as a young girl my father was an alcoholic however in the lds religion you don't drink alcohol anymore so his alcohol changed forms as we know most addicts do it became prescription drug medication my father suffered severe depression and battled anxiety but again as a man that wasn't something we talked about he was supposed to be the strong one he was supposed to be the one that took care of all of us so he wasn't allowed to show weakness and and kept those things very secret and very private and and over the course of my life i watched him experience a lot the attempt i had at age 12 put me into the hospital and i'm very grateful for that experience because for the first time i was able to share what had been happening to me sexually and when they brought my mom and dad in and had me tell them what had been going on you know my mother did the best she could i know that now but she said i'm sorry that happened to you but we're going to move on and forget about it and i don't want you to talk about it again and unfortunately as a young child it taught me a powerful lesson it taught me that when bad things happen nobody cares and when bad things happen you keep it quiet so i lost my voice that day i started using drugs and alcohol as a means of coping with what would have become depression in my own mind i hated myself i loathed myself i thought i had done something wrong and over the course of the the next 25 years i i continued to use drugs and alcohol as a way of coping in and getting through life i also watched my father do the same thing when i was 26 years old i was at work at jcpenney when the police showed up and they said are you tara naked and of course i looked around and went oh hell why can we talk to you i said no whatever you got tell me is right here because there's a door i can run i'm not sure why they're there the police officer shared with me that my father had been shot my brain said in a drive-by i live in utah okay no not a drive-by uh he informed me that he had had shot himself and was at the emergency room and he needed to take me to him so i went again he survived that attempt my father at this point was losing everything he had gone through now his third marriage he had lost his job he had lost his income he had lost his home he had lost his cars i basically watched my father sell everything out of his home as he sat on the stairs thank you i'm a crybaby several years later my dad would would attempt again on october 5th of 2002 i found him dead of a drug overdose that was a profound day for me it was a day that my heart and spirit were broken because i knew that what i was seeing was real but my heart didn't want to believe that he was gone and i begged him and shook his lifeless body for what seemed like hours until emergency help arrived and confirmed to me what i already knew i also vowed then and there that day that i would do anything and everything possible to help other people so that nobody else had to lose their dad i'm a single mother i have two children i struggled even after he died with my own thoughts of suicide again wondering how i could go on how was i to live without him how was i going to do this and thank goodness i i sat at my computer one night and googled suicide looking for support looking for other people who had been where i had been and i found afsp uh i began the process to to found and bring a chapter to our state because in utah like most things we don't say the s word we don't say lots of s words suicide being one sex being the other because if we talk about it they do it right well if you were anything like me you were doing it anyway you just didn't know so i founded uh with the help of some great other survivors our utah chapter and have become a passionate advocate for suicide prevention and mental illness and wellness i'm a recovering alcoholic on june 23rd god willing i'll celebrate two years of sobriety and that's only because i've learned how and and found a program where you can talk about it it's an anonymous program but i'm not anonymous i celebrate recovery because it's how we live today it's how we get through hard things we own our part we acknowledge that we're sick we talk about people i found my voice again and it's a voice that will not be quiet it's a voice that i don't know how to shut up now although most people wish i would but i'm just really grateful to be able to share just a portion of my story today and and want to give time to these other amazing folks but if if i could leave any message with you it would be this that the one ingredient we lose as human beings when we get to that dark desperate point where we think that everybody would be better off and that our lives are so unmanageable that there's no way of going on as hope we lose hope and hope is the thing that we can each give back to each other and hope is the thing we can help those that we love who are struggling to find because i know that hope saves lives it saved mine anyway i thank you for your time today and i'm going to bring up my good friend brandon marcico thanks again everybody for being here like taran said we truly appreciate you being here to hear our stories taren gets me emotional so i apologize um our stories mimic each other um pretty profoundly subtracting from me the loss of my father to suicide we were both victims of sexual assault both grew up in areas where we didn't really talk about things as they were happening it was just swept under the rug i went from being a homeless child to growing up and starting the chapter here in the or there rather in the south central pennsylvania area naturally being in a the one with lived experience or an attempt survivor if you will i find suicide to be important everywhere it's not just something you talk about in a room with a group of people it's not just something that you talk about amongst your friends i have a whole section of my desk at work that's dedicated to afsp and has trinkets and marketing materials and just ways for people to know that hope saves lives like taran said earlier how can that help you guys we have a program with afsp in our education department that's called more than sad and it's just that if somebody is in their desk or at their office and they just seem a miss or something doesn't seem right to them don't hesitate to reach out to them and just ask them how they're doing if everything's okay there have been times where i've been on the streets and i've just noticed somebody just had that i need a hug look on their face and i've walked up to them and asked them how they're doing sometimes i get i'm fine sometimes i get thank you i just needed somebody to ask and then sometimes i get the situation i had to deal with last week where mother who had actually just lost her son to suicide the week prior and nobody had reached out to her she didn't know what to do she couldn't talk about it with her family she couldn't talk to her about her friends we'll just use the name bobby bobby just wasn't there anymore and she didn't know how to cope and it was a resource that she needed just with a random smile and a hug you never know how far that can go i'm huge on random acts of kindness because i got to a point where i didn't feel like there were any there was any kindness of left anymore i had lost my kind heart i lost my happiness i also was 12 years old in my first suicide attempt also with drugs um gladly unsuccessful and then fast forward to 19 everything went downhill again in my mind and there i was again drug addict addicted to alcohol addicted to drugs and attempting my last suicide growing up in a very rural area of central pennsylvania mental health is just something that you don't discuss you don't talk about being sad or it's not cool for guys to talk about their mental health problems or say the d word depression or mental illness or bipolar disorder but it's important that that gets talked about now and as adults i'm so glad that i found afsp because i do have that avenue now and that outlet to go to i came on board to afsp i'm strictly 100 a volunteer came in as a fundraiser walking in the overnight walk which is held now twice a year we're getting ready to do our next walk in boston even today meeting with a couple senators and their staff we've found people who are participating in events like that and that's a great way to help end the stigma none of you have heard about the the walks i'm very passionate about them because it does bring communities together throughout the country i think there was over 350 last year i organized our local walk in harrisburg pennsylvania and we were actually the most improved walk so it's just an idea of how people with lived experience are engaging other people in their community and doing doing some good things the overnight walk which is another love of mine uh is an 18-mile walk done overnight every year we're doing it in two cities they just completed dallas and again like i said boston will be coming up shortly any way to help end the stigma is the best way to prevent suicide there are far too many people who just can't talk about it won't talk about it don't feel they need to talk about it we had the national take your children to work day event in my office a few weeks ago and i was sitting there talking to a mother and she had asked me simply about my bracelet and what it meant so we got to discussing how it's about suicide prevention and bringing it out of the darkness and she shared with me a story that her son had told her that he was depressed and he wasn't feeling well mentally but she wasn't going to worry about it until he started cutting that was the the terminology that she had used and we had a very very detailed conversation following that just because it's important that when our friends our family and children cousins brothers uncles talk about how they're feeling about suicide and that it's a possibility for them that we do reach out to them and don't just sweep it under the rug i'll close with a saying that's kind of been emanating today um they don't know us they can't show us until they know us uh and basically what that means is just nobody knows what you're going through if you're not showing them so just make sure that you're reaching out talking to your friends family colleagues and letting them know that it's okay to talk about mental health and suicide as a whole so that'll be all i'll share for today and i'll bring up the wonderful shelby row first off i managed to make it up here without tripping over a single cord so that was good hopefully i'll continue without knocking anything over not the most graceful people this morning on facebook i was sharing with some of my friends that you know hey i'm a little nervous i'm going to be doing this panel discussion on congress and i have this lovely friend of mine named diana and she said you know i'm so proud of you shelby just know that all of the 22 a day gold star mothers have your back and we're all praying for you and i said you know thank you for helping reshape that because i am really really lucky that i get to be here for each person who dies by suicide there are 25 who survive i'm one of the lucky ones so i get to come and speak at events like this and they do not so hopefully with my voice can help speak loud enough for them as well i have worked in public health for over 20 years no i didn't start when i was 10. i'm older than i look i've worked in public health forever 20 years and i think i'm pretty good at it i since 2007 i've been working in suicide prevention extensively in 2010 i had the best year of my career up until moving to new york in 2010 i had helped write our state plan for suicide prevention i had helped launch online crisis chat in our tiny little state of arkansas we were the first states to launch that there were a lot of really wonderful things happening in my state that i'd helped play a lead role in and i was thrilled and then things in my personal life started to fall apart but i thought you know it'll be okay yes i'm going through a divorce yes i have a child in a mental health crisis you know i'm good at this i teach coping skills i run the statewide suicide hotline i know how to do this i debrief police officers and firemen when they're scared i got i have this i was very bold and you know i really didn't tell that many people in my life that when i was early you know young i have ptsd i had some really traumatic things happen early in my life but i thought you know i had healed i thought i was all better i thought you know flashbacks won't happen to me you know i you know i know how to cope i'm good this will never happen to me and that arrogance almost cost me my life i went through an acute ptsd flashback and didn't want to talk about it i would talk about what was happening currently with my divorce and my son but to explain ptsd would mean i would have to talk about those traumatic events and i didn't want to talk about those traumatic events and so my friends were confused my colleagues were confused and i was panicking and spiraling down and didn't know how to ask for help um i did reach out for help finally um and but i went to another state because again my arrogance was gonna cost me my life i trained a lot of the people in my community who did needs assessment who did crisis intervention and so walking in as one of their clients was was beyond what i could do and so i went to the next state fortunately i called and told them i went got good care but again when i was there i sat and the psychiatrist said well why are you here you have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition and i said well i have i have ptsd i said well why do you have ptsd and i said well and i got started you know to tell that first tragedy because you always know that people aren't really interested in your personal story and unfortunately like we would love to think that everyone is but they aren't and so i started with the versatile you know my husband was killed in actional shooting when i was 19. and he goes well did you witness it and i said well no he goes well then you probably don't have ptsd so i said okay maybe not and so the rest of the time i was there was you're in the hospital for six days i didn't tell anyone about my ptsd and so they were treating me for symptoms but not really getting to the core so i left the hospital more sick than i went in with a bill so now oh money had to have a wonderful discussion with my ex-husband on if i was a suitable parent but i came back talked with my board my staff about continuing my therapy my board of directors at the crisis center were fabulous my staff were clearly scared because their their fearless leader was not well i was really not well um so you know fast forward a month and a half there was you know a triggering event and my life spiraled down and i made a suicide attempt the night before thanksgiving in 2010 i woke up a couple days later and i asked my kids like why didn't you take me to the hospital i said well mom we were scared you would get fired and i was like whoa it's like okay you know so i needed to change a lot of things and then i was like you know i really i want it i was like this is my life-threatening health crisis i cannot be arrogant about this anymore um yes i'm very blessed there are many people with ptsd that they have flashbacks daily every day as they struggle with their fight or flight instinct mine are very random knock on wood it requires a new tragedy um to trigger that so it may be five years from now it could be tomorrow hopefully it's never hopefully i've built a big enough support system now to where that won't happen again i never want to be suicidal again i want to build a good enough support system with healthy coping skills with the right people in my life and part of staying safe is doing really awkward things like this because it increases that pool of individuals that know them at risk because i am calm cool and collected all the time you know i joke you know that i'm terminally pleasant you know with all three of my children when they went to the hospital to give birth they didn't believe me because i was still friendly and talking and it's just my personality but that's a risk factor for me so i need people to know i need to be open about my vulnerabilities so that i can stay safe i do hope and take away message is those individuals in your life that you know that no one is immune you know they may they can be successful and articulate they can be experts in any field you know we would never say well i can't believe that that heart surgeon had a heart attack you know can't believe they would be affected by that and for some reason in mental health we let that be a barrier for us we think well you know we that can't happen to us really none of us are are immune you know it is a humbling experience we can all be at risk we all need to look out for our friends and colleagues so never assume that someone is okay because of their professional training it is a health crisis and i can say beyond the other side it is very much a life-threatening health crisis your brain is not working properly at that moment but the survival instinct is strong and i'm so glad i had a chance to live can't wait to meet my husband's wives and my grandkids and all that wonderful stuff but it will take a lifetime of conscious effort to stay safe because i do not want to be one of those statistics so with that i'm going to hand it back over to doreen and john we are free to answer any questions that you all have but thank you for coming today i i hope you would agree that um our panelists have really shared the the inner part of their soul and and what they've experienced um any questions from the audience anybody grace is it true that the more you share the more you speak the more you're able to deal with your issues yes i would say very much so i heard it said once that you can't hate someone once you know their story and i think that's very true and i think you know just like anything the thoughts sometimes that we have in our brain if your brains like mine it can be a real dick and so sometimes the thoughts we have in our brain if we don't get them out by communicating it loses its power but as long as i keep it in here i'm trapped and it can get pretty scary and pretty ugly so i absolutely think the freedom and the healing that's taken place and being able to verbalize what's happened and gone through it has taken away some of its power for me yeah i'll completely mimic everything taran said um minus a few words um when i was asked uh last year to speak at the philadelphia overnight about my story it had really been the the first time that on a grand scale in front of what was it 1500 almost 2 000 people participated in the overnight in philadelphia i had spoke about it locally at our little walks to you know 200 300 people and i i've actually i've just came out about my my suicide attempts within the last four years um it wasn't something that we talked about in my family it wasn't that they were ashamed of it but it was just that i had so many other things that i'd come out about in the past that i just didn't want to deal with that stigma once again so talking about it and getting it out it really helps and it's my partner's mother actually explained it to me in a way the other day that it was so profound that she luckily now she's in remission from breast cancer and if it you can't you can talk about the breast cancer and you can there's the whole show your boobies thing but i can't go like this and show you all that i have a mental illness and i mean physically it's not possible

left so we'll go to the gentlelady from Missouri Thank You mr. chairman for hosting this hearing and thank you to our witnesses for their time with tensions over trade escalating and the Chinese Vice Premier headed to Washington Thursday for resumed talks I appreciate this timely opportunity to learn more about China's attempts to erode America's influence I I come from a trading state the state of Missouri where exports support eighty eight thousand jobs that's 18 percent above the national average I strongly believe that China must be held accountable for its malign trade and investment policies but we must be targeted American consumers and businesses shouldn't be the ones shouldering the consequences I believe our trade policy toward China should be aimed at curbing the predatory behavior of China's state-owned enterprises these SOS doctor how should US negotiators address this issue in talks it's a great question certainly very timely I mean my view is that ultimately US and Chinese economic objectives are squarely non-aligned that China ultimately wants to dominate some of the key industries of the future and if you look at sort of any deal on the table already this week it became apparent the Chinese were walking back from their commitments to me that's deeply unsurprising I think any deal if one is struck will be unsatisfying I think to the house to the Senate to the American people given the nature of what China wants relative to the United States so I don't think there's a straightforward intra sort of answer to your question I mean I think at the end of the day it will be about for protecting the industries here where time is going to exploit us trading in select areas that reps are not as competitive with them but I don't think there's sort of a very easier painless path toward Oh clearly and the Vice premiers on his way and the president's saber-rattling so we'll see where if we make any inroads here this week I want to make sure though that my farmers my consumers are not inadvertently and overly affected by this Beijing's allows its state-owned enterprises to borrow at extremely low interest rates from public financial institutions as a result zoe's have dominated project bids in Southeast Asia a primary target of the belts and road initiative i co-chair co-chair of the congressional asean caucus and i'm deeply concerned that these policies are designed to draw Southeast Asian countries into Beijing's sphere of influence dr. Kleinman how should the United States work with Southeast Asian countries to prevent these state-owned enterprises from boxing out more responsible investors [Music] Congress has already taken an important step in that direction asking the build act I would say I'm cautiously optimistic with our new Development Finance Corporation that some of the tools it has including new tools like equity as well as course the new lending cap if targeted could help to move the needle I think many of the countries in Southeast Asia understand what Chinese SEO is bringing is not necessarily well engaged with our economy there's not the skill transfer they want the debt issue so I think the problem for the u.s. until now is when we didn't have an alternative easily available that may change with this new DFC I think there's a critical role for Congress to make sure the DFC is lending in some of these countries the in support of US companies in competitive sectors but I would say I'm optimistic that we now actually have that tool dr. Schulman that the shear regime faces internal pressure stemming from demographic issues simmering dissent and and high expectations regarding economic performance given these dynamics I think it's important to remember that the belt and road initiative was originally a domestically oriented initiative designed to spread economic growth to quickly growing cities in China's interior bellroad initiative has now evolved far beyond his domestic origins and threatens to undermine democracy and good governance in developing countries do you think this shift was opportunistic or accidental and how should China's internal pressures from inform our thinking on the belt road initiative thank you for that question I think it's absolutely right to point out the fact that the belt and Road initially was very much domestically focused to benefit China's West in particular I think it's important to note that why you know in terms of why it's become such a big deal in terms of external economic engagement China's looking to create external markets to be able to sell its goods elsewhere they're also trying to export its over capacity and a lot of industries but it's important to note that actually you know when you look at the data the belton mode actually has not been very beneficial for China's domestic economy going forward what I think we need to look look to is going forward as I mentioned in my in my remarks if China's economy continues to face mounting challenges as we see that it is with the massive amounts of debt that they're taking on domestically China is going to continue I think to look to the belgian road as a way to get them out of this problem right to create new markets and also to try to continue to saddle countries with these debts and to come back to your question to dr. Clement it's not just that s o YZ are getting subsidized and therefore able to come in with lower bids it's that the Chinese policy banks that are financing these projects are then going in with these government's and saying okay and there's going to be a one bid and it's going to be from a Chinese SOE or maybe two bits both of them in Chinese SOE and so you're gonna have a situation where you have very inflated costs with corruption inherent in all of these deals so it's not just the subsidizing it's also the opaque nature and the way in which these deals are done and to expose that through civil society and investigative journalism is really critical No thank you dr. shom and I know my time has elapsed I have a really awesome question for you mr. chaudhary and I am going to make sure that it gets submitted to you it's about India that I'd love if you could respond in writing and I think for the take the chair first you always forward to

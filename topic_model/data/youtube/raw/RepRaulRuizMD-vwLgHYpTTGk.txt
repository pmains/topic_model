Gerald McGuire a professor and chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at UCR School of Medicine a doctor do you want to wave all right thank you thank you and I want to welcome individuals from the desert AIDS Project in Palm Springs Carrollwood director of clinical operations Gover Behavioral Health Manager good to see you both and I'd also like to extend a very special welcome to Joseph scraggy executive director of medical and professional education Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation we're so very fortunate to have the foundation here in the Coachella Valley also a very special welcome to Saad Niazi CEO Pacific Grove hospital and in do behavioral health and dr. Eduardo Xavier well done there seems to be some what are you doing there good ok uh dr. technical issues dr. Eduardo Javier program director addiction medicine fellowship UCR Hazelden Betty Ford and Eisenhower Beverly Grier CEO neuro vitality Center a dr. Sanjay vaswani medical director for behavioral health clínica de salud el pueblo doctor are optionbit big clinic chief medical officer at clínicas as well as alberto key has telehealth manager at cleaning has many causes um hey so I want to thank everybody for being here today and to share your expertise and provide critical information for the Coachella Valley residents and thank you for all the work that you do every day for our community especially as we impor this unprecedented crisis together may is mental health awareness month during May we are reminded to fight stigma provide support educate the public and advocate for policies that support people with mental illness and their families and it has never been more important than it is today there's a lot of anxiety stress and changes in our lives right now the environmental conditions caused by the corona virus pandemic and create behavioral changes and exacerbate mental health illnesses for many in our community loneliness depression stress and anxiety are on the rise and it's important that you are equipped with the knowledge and resources you need to help get you through this time whether you're fighting depression battling a substance abuse disorder or having suicidal thoughts we are here today to remind you that you are not alone and people want to help you the corona virus has changed daily lives and caused disruptions and hardships for people throughout the country families workers children our friends family and neighbors are struggling to find routines to stay engaged and just get by it is so important that you have accurate information and equipped with proper tools to manage your life stay healthy and get the help that you need that's why recently I held a virtual town hall with dr. Michelle Barbra best-selling author and educational psychologist and talked about parenting and family well-being during difficult stay-at-home moments so I encourage you and especially the parents out there to go back my Facebook page congressman Roe rule MD and watch them at virtual town hall on my Facebook page that's also why I've been fighting for years for legislation to address mental health challenges and expand resources for the community barriers in access to mental health services existed before the pandemic and they are pronounced now during the pandemic the need for more mental health services existed prior to the pandemic and the pandemic is making the need more pronounced that's why I've introduced legislation and several of them have been signed by a president into law for example HR 1839 the Medicaid Services investment and Accountability Act was signed into law in 2019 which extended the community mental health services demonstration program HR 5605 advancing high quality treatment for opioid use disorders in Medicare was signed into law in 2018 as part of HR 6 the supports Act that's why I introduced an amendment to HR 11:58 it was a minibus funding budget bill that was signed into law and it increased mental health services for police officers even that they have tripled the amount of suicide than others in our community furthermore I've introduced HR 25 19 the improving mental health access from the emergency department Act which would create grant programs to fund emergency departments to help get patients with acute mental health episodes to transition to the follow-up care that they need and five and even as important and even more important I have constantly fought against cuts to Medicaid program which the vast majority of substance abuse patients use to get their care with its many of our substance abuse mental health patients utilized to get the services that they need and I have voted against cutting or repealing the Affordable Care Act because within that provision mental health was made an essential health benefit that Geron says we'll have to cover so but that's very important because the Trump administration continues to push forward the lawsuit to completely repeal the ACA and I've also advocated it for telemedicine during the Kovach Care aid packages as well as hundreds of billions of dollars to health care providers institutions to cover the loss during the pandemic so they can keep their bottom line and keep their programs and departments open so this is why it's so important to continue to be busy do it for more pieces of legislation to increase research into suicide prevention expand access to trauma-informed care provide substance use disorder services and expand access to mental health providers it's also why for many years and dr. McGuire can attest to this that I have been working with UCR School of Medicine Eisenhower Health many cuz this eluded webelo and many of the folks who join us here today to ensure that district 36 and Coachella Valley residents have access to quality care including mental health care so in closing I will continue working on behalf of every single one of you in my district to support our hospitals and health care providers as they administer first-class mental health care and help all of us get the information and resources we need to weather this storm so today we are joined by experts who specialize in addiction treatment behavioral health neuroscience and mental wellness they're here to give updates answer questions and provide resources that help you and your families through these difficult times so after a special announcement from UC our school medicine about their expanded psychiatry and addiction care resources we will have a conversation where we'll cover unique mental health challenges the Coachella Valley is facing resources available for residents in our community rising rates of alcoholism and drug abuse during the corona virus pandemic and much much more so information is power knowledge is power because it empowers people to make the right decisions either behaviorally or when to seek care which can save their lives and can affect their families in their community especially in this moment we need a feel empowered and a sense of control not only for our own personal lives but for our families the people we love the people we care our neighbors and the community we're in this together and it's okay to seek help if you have any questions throughout the program please log on to the Facebook my facebook page as the questions below ask in the comment section in this program and we will try to get them answered during this webinar so thank you and right now I'd like to turn it over to dr. McGuire professor and chair of the psychiatry and neuroscience UCR School of Medicine dr. McGuire and I have worked on this project together for several years now is focusing on veterans and within the VA and and expanding that care as the anchor to the rest of the community and I am thrilled that it is finally becoming a reality dr. McGuire the floor is yours may speak you so so thank you very very much congressman I want to thank you for your support when I came here as a founding chair of Psychiatry six years ago in Europe and faculty member of our School of Medicine we met and you said we really need mental health resources in the Coachella Valley and I'm happy to announce that we have a foothold a beachhead they're working as the university to support the Coachella Valley we've worked with our clinical partners in the area and they're represented on the call today and we're happy to say that not only do we have approval and we'll be starting training just in a month of an addiction medicine fellowship so this is a partnership that we have with us in our health and the with Hazleton Betty Ford we'll have you see our fellows starting their into life providing addiction care to the Coachella Valley residents at the same time as you know we have a good pipeline of students from the Coachella Valley who get into our medical school and as you know what predicts their doctor's practice is one where they're from and to where they train so thanks to your assistance and everyone on this call we are realizing that now our first graduates from the medical school class from 2017 will graduate their four-year residency with us in psychiatry next year and we already have a fully operational psychiatric residency based in the western part of the county with eight residents a year we've grown from just four so that means we are producing eight psychiatrists every year and we've expanded with specialties in now addiction medicine based in the Coachella Valley and another shortage area of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry we have fellowships there and thanks to your support to our residents are learning how to care for veterans and their special needs currently our residents are working with the low VA as well as now the Long Beach VA and they're takin that expertise of our faculty to expand to the Coachella Valley as well to care for our veterans in the future in the meantime to UCR is expanding our owned clinical services to the Coachella Valley this next year and we're working with our partners all on this call to not only assist them in their care by providing our faculty to assist in the services that our great partners provide but in placing residents and they will partner with us on Resident and fellow training such that these graduates then who are from the inland regions of Southern California will train in the Southern Inland Southern California and stay and practice and thanks to other government support that we have we will also provide loan repayment to these graduates such that finances are not a barrier for those students who are our best and brightest to not speak a medical career due to finances so we have that going on and so I please don't outs that we have that fellowship up and running in July and through our consortium of everyone else on this call with our great colleagues at clinic as de salud el pueblo those providing telepsychiatry care and we've already done that to the outreaches of the Eastern Coachella Valley as well we are placing a faculty at the desert AIDS Project and our fellows will rotate there and soon to be our residence we have plans as well with the neuro vitality Center in Bev Greer this provides specialty care for our geriatric population as well - and then we're very excited for sod to be on the call because our partner Acadia healthcare is building a new psychiatric cost in the Coachella Valley at this point for those who needed urgent psychiatric care they either had to leave Riverside County or go to the western part of the county and we're glad to see that we and this is really the foundation for us to begin that training for the four years or our residents to be based there and then of course working with our great partners at Eisenhower health and dr. Eduardo Xavier who's on our faculty and leading the addiction medicine program and the teaching on our great partnership with Hazleton Betty Ford as well to which places us not just a training that we do but blast training that will have world-class training with the University of California behind it with all of our partners on this call spanning a variety of care settings and and that socioeconomic class will not be a barrier to access to care so with that I thank you for your support over these years and that we're able to make this announcement today and our future is very very bright as a team that's that's wonderful I think it's also very important to realize that if you bring one fellow then you can bring residents to train under that fellow and the attending so it's not just one fellow it's the medical students and the residents that come and when you have a residency program that opens the door to research and existence weaker opens the door to funding yes which then opens the door to community outreach and community public health mental health programs that that the residents and the fellows can do so so it not only increases the quality of care it increases the type of positions that we keep in in the desert but it expands in the hundreds the amount of people that the fellow the resident the attendings can serve and with the funding it helps us understand our communities specific issues with mental health so we can address them in a quality manner so I congratulate all of you I think at this point what I'm gonna do is ask a representative from every institution to give a two-minute words of about your participation in this collaboration this partnership and about your institution so I want to start with desert AIDS project dr. Gover or Carol would whoever would like to say a few words thank you so much nice this is such an exciting time for us and we are so thrilled to have this collaboration with dr. McGuire and UCR as we are looking forward to bringing on a psychiatrist in partnership that hopefully will introduce the possibility of more training and VAP can then be one of the many sites for training and as we have discussed many many times over the years it's so important and it's been said many times already this morning we need to grow our own and and this is true for psychiatry as well as for psychology and we're hoping to do a similar clinical internship training program for clinical psychologists in the near future as well so this is a very exciting moment for us and it allows us to provide the services that we know are so important in this community da P has been here for a very very long time and we provide many many different services for the entire community we have a primary care clinic a health care clinic we are a federally qualified community health center so we provide primary care as well as a behavioral health clinic dentistry we have social services and case management we have sex health education we have wellness programs we offer so much to the community and I want to emphasize that it's for the entire community title may be desert AIDS Project and certainly we will always be a special home for the LGBT community and for those living with HIV but we serve everyone the entire community and we want to make sure that the residents here in Coachella Valley know that our services are open to them and that we have a variety of different services and I'll speak about behavioral health and you're doing testing as well yes and we had the tree at the cover triage clinic yes we are offering testing both rapid antibody and the covetous swath actually now Joseph's Squire juice key from Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation which like say a few words absolutely thank you doctor and Congressman Ruiz and it's a pleasure to be here today you've been out to the Betty Ford Center many times over the years and I've seen in Washington DC a number of times and you've always been so supportive when it came to substance use disorder services mental health services and really rallying behind the Coachella Valley so it's an honor to be a part of this this morning dr.

Luiz for this great opportunity to to be here today I'm so glad to meet all of you by the way I'm very happy to to be a part of this program so I've been doing addiction medicine for about eight years and I see the frustration or you know having patients in the emergency room admitted here at Eisenhower and they don't have nowhere to go and I don't know where to refer them to where this fellowship is going to provide an outpatient clinic so the patient can go and have expert advice regarding regarding their problem so I'm goal is to link all this care that we have right now with Arcadia health Odessa th project clinic and bringing the expertise of Hazel's embedded Ford Center foundation for our new treatment of addiction stole goal is to link all these care and we're very happy to screen new physicians that hopefully will stay in the valley to answer the shortage of air for an addiction addiction medicine so thank you for your support I thank you for your support personally so yeah excited that we're starting in July July first would be a big day for us and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your support I will be talking to all of you in the next few weeks oh so thank you again that's wonderful and just wonderful whenever you have fellowship fellow rounds or Grand Rounds now that we're doing a lot of video conferencing I would love to sit in and and rekindle and re exercise the doctor brain and training that I have and really get caught up with some of that medicine I think it'll help fill in some CME credits that I need to keep up with and so you you all are smiling now because you know that that's when every first and third Wednesday at noon great or your Grand Rounds and Journal Club I would love that hey that would fit my CME credit requirements permits which which I'm still doing so so thank you for that offer I self invited myself as so thank you thank you thank you for allowing me to do that next I want to introduce Beverly Greer CEO of neuro vitality center you got on mute yourself I'm really so you're on mute stuff okay all right we're good to go dr. Myers great to see you again thank you for inviting the illustrious absortion to really three mental health or mental health to our area it's such an important issue that we've all seen we are here at the neuro vitality center has been around for a long time there are 14 years handling people was neurological disorders and having the last couple of years expanded our services to handle all forms of health care which includes of course a behavioral help along with medical help and also social everyone agrees you brought up the isolation problems that are depression and of course anger management and all of those things that happened when breakfast it's such an important component and working with dr. McGuire which we have for years now we're finally getting to the point where we are more expanded so that's very exciting to us unfortunately right at the moment our program is it is the best danger in California budget are discussing eliminating the program which is will eliminate care for those Medicare patients who are nursing home eligible but able to home because of our program it's very unfortunate and we're hoping that not only someone in the Senate will understand that not only well particularly in light of what we're doing right now with the very highest people that we have but it's also history not a very good idea because those people then wind up in institutions in very high danger now that she also be ours rather there for them we have converted all of our services not being able to conquer than this very high-risk group we have converted all of our services to virtual right now he's also going on and just down the hall from my office and with a whole group of patients that are all enjoying I think they're doing morning stretch right now I think the HERA exercising and they're also engaging with one another and trying to that kind of days we're doing so they're not suffering from the - an impression and additional roles that are converted when you have a chronic illness I'm glad to be here and we're looking forward in uniform to see our that's wonderful member Lee thank you so much and now from any cause it's alluded webelo dr. ash on big would you like to say a few words sure thank you for this opportunity and and dr. Sperrys as you remember thank you for that we have met you know long time ago but have been associated with the work that you are doing and following it and being proud of you because you are from the cultural Coachella Valley and your commitment to the area it's really been an inspiration that I myself find repeating myself many times so thank you for that Charlie cos the salud is a federally qualified health center established in 1970 so this is number 50 for us our model is of integrated behavioral health and basically what what we've been working on for the past few years is integrating the B health aspect of patient care to the physical health record I think that it is very important that both those challenges to a person's health are recognized and currently and addressed in a appropriate plan also if you are going to affect diabetes hypertension you'd better recognize there's there's another aspect of depression anxiety or any other issue that might be impacting the outcome so that is what we've been developing for the past few years but you see ours help we have been able to address the shortage in our area using telehealth so I really appreciate the willingness and the flexibility that dr. McGuire and his team have for allowed us to avail off and it it's it's it's a work in progress still because clinicians as well as patients have to learn how to utilize this resource doing behavioral health using the telehealth technology so we are really really appreciative of that we have got alliances clinical social workers on staff we've got psychiatrist on staff dr. Vaswani is the medical director for beyond health and he has three he is originally from the LA area but has committed himself to Imperial and Riverside counties and we really appreciate his commitment to our model of patient care and again very very excited to be actually seeing some of you for the first time continuing our work together and going forward thank you that's wonderful I mean you all are an all-star team if if one was to devise the perfect psychiatry neuroscience fellowship in the Coachella Valley with the focus on a ditch I you all are the right partners to have in place that's not to say there are other amazing programs out there and institutions um your collaboration has really gone into where the needs are our greatest as well and and you have to FQHCs as part of your residency fees and you know that my hearts are with community health centers because they're oftentimes the ones that serve the poor and those that lack access to care so why don't we go ahead and get started with some of the questions and I want to first ask dr. McGuire from the UCR School of Medicine one is what what have been some of the most common psychiatric symptoms or disorders that have manifested themselves in during this pandemic and then in addition to that what how will this fellowship address health disparities or the inequities that you see some communities who face the greatest barrier to to care great great great questions you know on the front lines I will tell you as a psychiatrist who treats patients in Riverside and in the Coachella Valley as well too many of our patients are struggling with the burdens of isolation where disorders like depression can be worse they have where family discord can occur it's also been especially I think been difficult for those families who have fewer means where now that our work-life balance is if they still have work has been disrupted because they may have to take care of children at the home and work at the same time so that has put undue stress on many of our clients as well too and I must say unfortunate that unemployment has put a greater stress now for unfortunately many of our our patients the financial stresses there as well too but fortunately you know there is help there is assistance through all our teams that we have here and we're able to reach out I will also say that a barrier that I have seen that we still have to overcome is the telemedicine even though we reach out and that you know I'm still open or my patients can come in but for many of them with the stay at home order we're doing we're doing telehealth but still many of my patients may not have a device with a webcam they may not be able to afford that or they don't afford Wi-Fi we might take that for granted that every home has broadband but for many of our residents that is not a reality still or they can't afford a data plan on their cell phone so we still have unfortunately congressman in and inequity there and what we are doing at UC Riverside is partnering as you said with our FQHC partners as you have which is allows that access to care for those folks who may not have the means of a commercial insurance plan the next that we are doing as well is training and recruiting culturally competent physicians as dr. big is aware and dr. pavani is aware the lead clinician that I have providing care to the clinic as population is dr. Roberto Castaignos who was my own medical student and resident and as faculty with me now spanish-speaking provides that care I look at hiring another Latin X spanish-speaking psychiatrist she's graduating from my program and I'm hopeful she stays with me and then we have a pipeline as well to of students coming up the ranks like her Ortega and others who are in iView this like building a baseball team and I would say my Triple A farm system is very strong and that we are we're doing we're in the playoffs now will be a World Series champion here to address the inequities in our system by decreasing barriers to care from finances or cultural issues and also reaching out to decrease the stigma with increasing health literacy in our vulnerable populations dr. McGuire I'm gonna ask you offline yeah you into this if you don't know now but if you can give me the information so in 2009 I met with a group of seven students from Coachella Valley High School and desert Mirage High School yeah and do he started shadowing me in the emergency department and we expanded the program to bring in other doctors from Eisenhower and and then in a couple years we had 11 institutions we had 70 doctors that volunteered their time to mentor my students we had with initially about 60 60 students now it's over 200 and it's it's now the future physician leaders program housed under the School of Medicine with high school and college students who are in that pipeline to become doctors and serve so my question is gonna be you know are those students going into mental health services great I will look at the data I believe I believe I'm looking that that my pgy for shouldn't be p2i for chief resident is a graduate they're my PG soon to be PG 3 is from there he's a UC art student and what's great I will take a little bit of pride in this - thanks for great help and that I believe that UCR is recruiting and retaining those medical students who are more dedicated to the underserved specialties of our field so last this graduating year they graduate tomorrow actually over of our class of just over 55 I believe 16 are going into psychiatry the high I believe I'm gathering data but I believe that may be the highest percentage of any medical school in the United States I'm looking at that so shows you that we're recruiting those students who are committed to the underserved and what's great we are retaining them as well too and we have to expand our residency more because we don't want to train our students from the Inland Southern California and have to export them to finish their training you want them to stay right here take care of our patients and serve the community for generations to come and thanks to your efforts back in 2009 and getting our medical school started we are reaping the benefits well I'll tell you I'll tell you one thing these are worker kids kids of construction workers waiters and waitresses first-generation to graduate from high school go to college like I was that have a dream to be a doctor and to serve their community so this for all the parents out there who have children or for all the youth that that want to be doctors that want to go into the medical profession they're too great for free overcome to accomplish your goal your dream I'm an example and go to future physician leaders online and put your application in so you can be part of this amazing pipeline program I have a question from the press Shelby Nelson who's from ksq does amazing work the question is we don't know how long tobin 19 relax do you foresee a heightened need for mental health services even if this were defined down and how can this program be a part of that go ahead dr. Joseph square juice key yes Thank You congressman Ruiz the reality as we all know is that substance use and mental health challenges were already at crisis levels prior to the pandemic and now with people sheltered in place they at home orders other pre-existing health issues they're experiencing more anxiety more depression usage of more alcohol and drugs more grief more trauma so we've got this system right now whereby some individuals are able to seek services whether that be in person or virtually but many of them right now are into their addiction at a level that they've never been before so we do expect a surge in individuals needing help of now and in forthcoming months um I do think it's important just as we talked about in building that pipeline in our Valley here if I can add one more thing that I just think is so important and speaks to the services that we need to provide here we've had a children's program for seven to twelve year olds from addicted families right here in the Coachella Valley for many years and those kids come in brought in by Guardians brought in by grandparents brought in by others because a lot of time mom dad others are still drinking and still using and and really struggling during the Cova 19 pandemic and other times a lot of those kids get educated on substance use disorders find their way find their dream and end up in places like medical school like law school like nursing school called the Summer Institute for medical students and I mean like our dream always was to have a kid from the valley you know seven eight nine ten years old that would come and get care here to learn about how it's not their fault that their mom or dad drinks or uses that it's not their fault that there is trauma and anxiety and depression and death and loss and grief and they find their way and so many of those kids have gone on into medical school to come back literally like 15 20 years later into our Valley's first second third fourth year medical students assuring their way into residency and fellowship which i think is the goal for all of us I mean we all have our purpose right we all have our reasons and we're all doing so much at all times but in a time of crisis in a time of need like now I think we're constantly looking for wins like that that help build hope and letting individuals know that yes we are open yes we are here for you and even though you're struggling right now like all of us are drink open 19 let us know whenever you're ready because we'll be here I have a follow-up question to that if you can answer this oftentimes families are also greatly affected by a person's mental illness it could either be through their addictive personality addictive behaviors it could affect them emotionally financially but also individuals that don't have addictions for example people with bipolar mania people with clinical depression uh it really does affect the entire family and family members don't know how to cope they don't know how to help and oftentimes the individual doesn't want that help and they don't know how to get that help and the family member they don't know they can get services to help them cope with a a relative who's not getting services so you know I'll ask you Joseph what do you offer for those family members who need help themselves and who need help convincing their relatives their loved one to go get help and then I'm gonna ask Jill the same question Joseph yes thank you doctor and Congressman Ruiz it it was so interesting in 1982 mrs. Betty Ford had this foresight she wanted to open a treatment facility but she also wanted to make sure families were taken care of and she was criticized at that time people were saying you know get your treatment right first and she said no this is a family disease and we need to make sure we're treating the families so literally from the day we opened our doors here in the valley 38 years ago we've provided a family program every single week and you're right people come into our offices they go to see their primary care provider and they don't typically walk in and say I have a substance use disorder I'm ready for help right they walk in with things like anxiety like depression like bipolar disorder other sort of conditions many of which are brought on by the other person in their life that is drinking and is right now sort of provide a venue provide an opportunity for them to learn about addiction in a family environment setting realize that they're not alone are there other families like that that are going through that similar experience let them know that there are resourced places like Allen are just like community providers different types of clinicians that are out there looking to provide services to them I mean during Kovach 19 we had an on-site family program in a lot of our facilities well the reality is that most people aren't getting on airplanes to come to facilities right now or many of them are staying at home so what we immediately did was pivot to providing a virtual family program which was one of the first things we did I mean months ago now I'm to provide that multiple times weekly so that people all over the world regardless of timezone or wherever they're trying to get services or resources regarding what the family is going through would be able to access that type of service that's wonderful Jim do you have something to add to that well I feel like I'm just echoing what has been said so eloquently but we're doing exactly the same thing at desert AIDS Project months ago we pivoted very very quickly to providing different options for our patients so that they can still choose to come in for face-to-face therapy sessions if that's their preference um but also realizing that many many majority of people currently are wanting to shelter in place and being able to offer my chart virtual visits so Visio video conferencing therapy sessions as well as phone telemedicine and thankfully with all of the loosening of restrictions regarding the telehealth we've been able to do a very quick shift to telehealth both in our medical clinic and in our behavioral health clinic and I just want to emphasize again that it is so important that people know we are here to help them help them deal with what could be a loved ones mental illness which can create a great deal of stress and anxiety help them deal with what's coming up for them around kovat all of the isolation there's so much grief because we need to recognize that all of us are grieving the loss of life as we wants to know known it to be everything has changed so dramatically for us in such a short amount of time and on all of us can benefit from therapy and I think that's a very important message to get out there that therapy can be a gift that we give ourselves in the name of self-care and we need to take advantage of the services that are available and certainly the AAP is welcoming in that way many people know that you have to have an illness practice mental health it is very equivalent to nutrition yes healthy life it is equivalent to physical exercise right illness and to maintain a sense of well-being you need to daily practice good and so daily you have to practice good good behaviors either muscle mass prayers meditation there's there's the happy center in a brain that can be developed to make a person more positive joyful and and that can help maintain a level of good mental health I do I read right now I'm reading the songs and I do my prayers in the Monique morning and that's a very daily activity that keeps me focused on hope on positivity where I draw my strength and I do and with my girls pause and practice mindfulness I shut everything down I look at them and how much joy and happiness they give to me and I pause for that moment and I give them love and I receive their love and that gives me that happiness in my life a question for Beverly what what services do you provide and to who and and what are some challenge what are some some challenges that you're facing right now to provide those services you're gonna have to unmute yourself again what we heard yeah good we read of course and really started with the family is a very important factor with everything that we do our population is basically is is the most people that have suffered chronic doses have strokes that have had issues including mental health issues as well as physical health issues and having to be our basic premise is always need to deal with the person as a whole we echo what you say so much about mental health it's such an important factor along with the physical health that we look at and exercising we exercise mind and spirituality as well it's very important and then of course the other element the really socialization to eliminate that depression and loneliness and isolation people are feeling particularly one of the things that we find to be most effective not sure that that Jill and those behind us as well as the ability to bring families together who are awkward additionally confronting the same types of issues and able to share experiences I'm being able to to really work together to try to find solutions and realize that they're not alone in all of these problems people that are very severely disabled respond so well in groups with other people people that are that are suffering from various forms of mental all those problems really respond well in groups and that's really what what this this environment has brought the greatest challenge I think to all of us is how get that book advantages of bringing people together and recovery and help each other in this type of environment fortunately the technology has improved dramatically from the over the past few years and we're able to use this type of situation we are we we have almost everybody is valiums has access to a cell phone but they're not able to have Wi-Fi or whatever we are providing and tablets that will hook into into telephones and other words it is an additional cost but something that we can't we just have to be able to do to be able to help these people so they're not stuck out there alone and no matter what happens with going forward with the state in the budget you know we've been around for 42 years and we're going to find a way to continue to help these people we just you just we can't in all persons be these people alone and by themselves with no hope that's not something that is part of our community and we're going to continue to find ways to help them the challenges of the technology I think are amazing to see because if all you need to do is bring a group of your people together and watching them all respond to each other and the faces you see on the screen just just to be together and to be happy to be there if it's it's a feeling that you can't you can't even describe it's a wonderful thing thank you my next question is to dr. Xavier and I think this is going to be one of the the most important questions of the evening because for a lot of people they don't understand when they need to go get help it is natural to feel a level of anxiety a level of concern of loneliness when you're asked to stay home you're not connect and you don't have your routines you're not saying the people that you have it's it's that's sort of a that's a natural feeling that people can have and based on their coping mechanisms based on on on how they normally the norm outlook in life and then Alex you're not I mean thank you so the question is at what point is it is it required to seek professional help or to seek assistance in coping with these symptoms so first what are those symptoms and and how do people recognize that within themselves yeah okay thank you Thank You congressman so yeah so first and foremost to answer your question we would advise everyone to not delay seeking help with with substance use problems and issues so we've seen a lot of cases because of these sheltering in place and isolation people try to draw and not and not seek help so we would advise anyone to reach out to their primary care providers to their community advisors to you their self-help groups communities to voice out and um and then to seek help so the symptoms to answer your question regarding if you know there's worsening of symptoms of addiction so we go by you know addiction is defined as a chronic relapsing disease you go by the four C's of addiction so what are these four C's these four C's are you know if they lost control over their addiction lost control with using their substance they continued this by consequences of their use such as you know not fulfilling their their responsibilities as as of with their jobs and as a family member increasing their use is freezing their consumption and rent-free or C's are a very essential or recognition and recognizing destiny of substance use so once they've recognized this not delay in seeking help because of because of this being isolated so and not being available to them they can seek help through the Samsa there's a 1-800 number that they are the nearest providers that they can in their community there's a 100 number on a summons Association of addiction addiction medicine society as a whole number as well or so I think the the foresees can be also applied to other mentors as a way to determine when it's beyond what would be considered normal stressors and when somebody needs to seek professional help the key element that you mentioned in one of those four C's is when these symptoms prohibit somebody from functioning and performing their daily life duties right so so they don't they can't function as a parent they can't function in in the sense of of you know making food in their daily lives they can't function the overwhelming stress prohibits them from maintaining their personal hygiene for some reason they can't shower they can't bathe and and so so they they don't eat because or they've lost enormous amount of weight or they've gained weight or they can't sleep to a point where they're having symptoms of insomnia and others and that affects their ability to function and so that's that's that's a level of of stressor or anxiety where one should say okay I should start calling to get professional help so that there are techniques there are ways to refocus to reset to cope and to get back to a state of normal life and there are some some techniques that can be used today with the stressors that people have we're gonna have a few more questions and then I'm going to ask dr. McGuire to close and then we'll close this session but dr. Bay what are what are some of the illnesses or the stressors that clínicas are experiencing or the patients are experiencing the visit clinicas in the East Valley or throughout the the four communities that you serve so basically as I shared earlier the Armada list of integrating their own health so as it is are we have lots of patients with diabetes and hypertension and other chronic conditions which then the we Haven health component exacerbates so they are both linked together what what we are focusing on is early identification and then intervention and I really really appreciate the full gamut of the participants the panelists that that are here right now but what we try to do is keep them identify them help them or or find resources for them earlier on so that they do not progress and that that is what we are continuing to focus on the early stages of the pandemic them they didn't seem to be anything visible to us other than covert 19 but in the last week or so we move the conversation again look at the whole person it's not only about covet 19 but what else is going on in these for these patients to make sure that the diabetes is getting the care the hypertensives are getting their care in a timely manner the kids are getting vaccinated so again that that has that is our focus I'm sorry Carol would you like to add something Carol would hey am i unmuted yes very good yes I would agree with what the doctor has shared we have a full-service operation here as well and we're just so thrilled to be a part of this consortium you know having worked in this Inland Empire for the last 30 years and seeing the high demand for services and the ability for patients not to find those services locally so critical our collaboration in the training and a future being a future clinical site for the residents and a fellows is just so very exciting for our organization and in particular we're excited to have dr. Jamie woods psychiatrist faculty to be joining our DP behavioral health department probably within the next month so we're very anxious to be a part of this we're looking forward to training the residents I was previously involved with a residency program in the Indian Inland Empire and we know how important it is to train our own and to keep these physicians in our Valley so just exciting to be a part of it and thrilled to have been invited to join thank you thank you dr.

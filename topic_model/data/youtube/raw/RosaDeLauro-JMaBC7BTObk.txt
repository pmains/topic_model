i thank the general woman from new york i yield myself as much time as i may consume the government of the united states of america has been now closed for a full week people are out of work some are even going hungry our economy is poised on the brink of a disastrous default and yet this republican majority continues to play political games with the future of our country and the lives and health of american families the hostage being negotiated today is head start one of the true american success stories unquestionably the most effective early childhood development program ever development ever developed and i've heard so often from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about how unsuccessful a program is and what a terrible program it is and that we ought to cut it for almost 50 years now head start has provided comprehensive child development literacy family service to nearly 30 million preschoolers from low income and working families it now serves nearly 1 million children every year it's an example of how dedicated teachers with the help of a smart fellow federal investment can enrich the lives of our citizens the cornerstone of our efforts to close the achievement gap combat poverty provide all kids with the opportunities to thrive it is another important federal program that republicans are claiming to support today in full defiance of their previous voting record it is as if the majority expects that we have all forgotten the positions they have been promoting for years up to this point we have not forgotten i am the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees head start funding and i have had to continually fight tooth and nail to see this program adequately funded and to protect it from the deep cuts put forward by the majority 2011 the very first bill the majority republican majority passed tried to cut head start by over a billion dollars 218 000 kids would have been cut from the rolls 16 000 classrooms closed 55 000 teachers assistants and staff would have lost their jobs that was the majority's opening offer and they didn't blink an eye parents teachers advocates stood up and said no to these cuts and the majority had to back down instead now instead now what they're doing with the automatic cuts the across the board cuts known as sequestration which was never meant to become law they're using that to do their work for them and because of those cuts this majority has voted to make permanent 57 000 students all across america have already lost access to head start even the children who are are able to remain in head start can expect shortened school days elimination of home visits and teacher layoffs in total 78 000 children have lost access to this early learning since this house majority took office and those sequester cuts will grow worse over time this is a self-inflicted government shutdown head start centers are being forced to close and the longer the majority perpetuates this shutdown the more kids are being denied an opportunity to learn i'm happy to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle embrace the importance of early childhood education you know president obama has called for universal preschool which would make a profound positive difference for children and their families across the country but you know this republican majority turned its back on that proposal walked away from it didn't even consider it let's stop playing games with people's lives their health and our children's future it is little wonder that according to the latest polls a full 70 percent of the country opposes this hostage-taking and want us to get back to work i urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution and i reserve the balance

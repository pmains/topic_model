get a coppersmith and chairman Goodlatte for their leadership on e-verify years ago as is congressman Smith mentioned I made a visit to the southern border and a comment from a border patrol agent about ending job magnet made me think about how we could help employers check the work status of new employees and as a small business owner for a number of years I knew there was no way to verify the documents presented to a new employee were pathetic so I crafted a bill worked with Lamar Smith we roll this into legislation that created you verify and what started as a pilot program with just five states that now as Lamar mentioned has over seven hundred and thirty thousand employers and millions of employees have gone through the system and it's improved immeasurably over the years we all know that American jobs are the primary draw for most immigrants knowing that we must implement laws that ensure that those immigrants who have come to our countries in proper legal process are allowed to work mandatory e-verify which was we started out to do that could get the votes at that time plus it was a new program people were concerned about how it would work but I think those concerns are now set aside we know it does work programs ready to go mandatory and a legal workforce Act will deliver on the promise to ensure that American jobs go to American workers and those authorized to work in the United States you know I want to thank Lamar and chairman Goodlatte for their hard work and let's let's move this bill thank you very much

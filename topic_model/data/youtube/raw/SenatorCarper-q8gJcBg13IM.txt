MR. SCHUMER: MADAM PRESIDENT.  --. MR. CARPER: MADAM PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: I RISE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE NOMINATION OF JEFFREY M. PRIETO. HE WAS REPORTED FAVORABLY FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE 12-8. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED AN INTERESTING LETTER FROM A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF FOUR FORMER E.P.A. GENERAL COUNSELS REPRESENTING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W. BUSH AND BILL CLINTON. THEY WERE BASICALLY CONVEYING THE SAME MESSAGE. THEY SUPPORT THE CONFIRMATION OF JEFF PRIETO TO SERVE AS GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY DAY. WE GET LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM NOMINEES, DIFFERENT PARTIES, DIFFERENT AGENCIES FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT TO HAVE FOUR FORMER E.P.A. GENERAL COUNSELS FROM TWO REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS OF LATE AND TWO DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE NOMINATION OF JEFF PRIETO TO SERVE IN THIS IMPORTANT ROLE, THAT GOT MY ATTENTION, AND I HOPE IT GETS THE TENSION OF ALL OF OUR -- GETS THE ATTENTION OF ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES. THE FOUR WHO WROTE TO US POINT OUT -- THIS IS THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE -- UNIQUELY QUALIFIED FOR POSITION OF GENERAL COUNSEL FOR E.P.A. THIS GO ON TO SAY MR. PRIETO HAS BEEN A LONG-STANDING CHAMPION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR ALL AMERICANS. THE LETTER CONTINUES, QUOTE, HE IS FAIR, HE'S JUST, HE'S ETHICAL. HE WILL MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON FACTS, SCIENCE, AND THE LAW. WE EXPECT HE WILL BE READY TO SERVE ON DAY ONE. MADAM PRESIDENT, THERE'S NO ORDER. MADAM PRESIDENT, THERE'S NO ORDER IN THE SENATE. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATE WILL COME TO O# -- COME TO ORDER. MR. CARPER: I AGREE WITH THEIR SENTIMENTS. HAVING COME TO KNOW MR. PRIETO FOLLOWING HIS NOMINATION BY PRESIDENT BIDEN, I BELIEVE HE WILL BE AN OUTSTANDING E.P.A. ADMINISTRATOR. HE COMES FROM A PROUD FAMILY WITH MILITARY SERVICE. HE HAS THE INTELLECT, TEMPERAMENT TO SERVE IN THIS IMPORTANT ROLE. SIX YEARS AGO THIS BODY SAW FIT TO CONFIRM JEFF PRIETO FOR THE SAME POSITION, GENERAL COUNSEL, AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. WE SHOULD CONFIRM HIM AGAIN TODAY FOR THIS POST. HE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE THEN. HE'S THE RIGHT CHOICE NOW. AND I ENCOURAGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING HIS NOMINATION. WITH

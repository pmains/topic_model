in our country if you work hard and play by the voice you ought to be able to take care of yourself and the people you love that's a fundamental promise of America a promise that should be true for everyone growing up in Oklahoma that promise came through for me and my family after my older brothers joined the military and I was still just a kid my daddy had a heart attack and couldn't work my mom found a minimum-wage job at Sears and that job saved our house and our family my daddy ended up as a janitor but he raised a daughter who got to be a public school teacher a law professor in a senator we got real opportunity to build something working families today face a lot tougher paths and my family did and families of color face a path that is even steeper and rockier a path made even harder by the impact of generations of discrimination I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's Promise works for some families but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster and what I found is terrifying these aren't cracks that families are falling into their traps America's middle class is under attack how did you get here billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice they crippled unions so that no one could stop we're going to turn the bullet loose dismantled the financial rules meant to keep us safe after the Great Depression and cut their own taxes so they paid less than their secretaries and janitors it's time to write the rules for the middle class after Wall Street crashed our economy in 2000 I left the classroom to go to Washington and confront the broken system head-on Elizabeth Warren apparently not afraid to tangle with walseth Warren is heading into the Lions Den and says Warren goes to Washington who do we created America's first consumer watchdog to hold the big banks accountable a woman who has warned of another meltdown if Washington doesn't straighten up I never thought I'd run for not in a million years but when Republican senators tried to sabotage the reforms and run me out of town I went back to Massachusetts and ran against one of them and I [Applause] today corruption is poisoning our democracy one politicians look the other way while big insurance companies deny patients life-saving coverage while banks ripoff consumers and while big oil companies destroy this planet our government's supposed to work for all of us but instead it's become a tool for the wealthy and welcomed the whole scam is propped up by an echo chamber of fear and hate designed to distract us and divide us call you racist people who will do or say anything to hang on to power point the finger at anyone who looks or thinks or praise or loves differently than they do but this dark path doesn't have to be our future we can make our democracy work for all of us we can make our economy work for all of us we can rebuild America's middle class but this time we gotta build it for everyone no matter where you live in America and no matter where your family came from in the world you deserve a past opportunity because no matter what our differences most of us want the same thing to be able to work hard play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love that's the America I'm fighting for and from the very beginning it's been the heart of my campaign for president but the outcome of this election will depend on you in the last year's so many people like you have made this campaign your way to protect the promise of America and here's what we're proving when we organize together when we fight together when we persist together we can win we can and we will

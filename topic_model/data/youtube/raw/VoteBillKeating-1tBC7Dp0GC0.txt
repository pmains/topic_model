well i think all of us know that this isn't a typical labor day celebration this year in 2020 i think we know why with the kovic 19 pandemic that has just affected the world but affected our lives at home but it is a special day labor day to pay tribute to our workers across the country uh and at home and during this pandemic i've had the uh opportunity and the honor to talk with people that are working their way through this at vital pro you know vital professions we selected someone from all three of our regions from the south shore from the south coast from the cape and islands just to give us uh their thoughts about working with their colleagues more professions than the ones we're going to discuss obviously affected we're all affected we're affected if we're on unemployment or affected if our businesses have closed down or if we're furloughed we're affected in our daily lives our families are affected child care is effective i could go on but the issue here is uh to say thank you so we're joined here uh with representatives from the south shore so south coast and cape cod in the islands and from the cape cod in the islands shannon sherman is with us who works for cape cod hospital obviously a front-line profession thank you for joining us shannon thank you uh we're here also uh from the south shore with jackie gilmore who's a social teacher uh and again experiencing things that uh probably you've never experienced before this year in your teaching profession shaping the minds of young people thank you so much jackie for joining us of course thanks and in the south shore i mean south coast rather we have bill sylvia and bill is there obviously a front line uh worker professional who uh can give us some perspective what it's really like uh going into people's homes and reacting trying to do your job saving lives on one front and trying to protect yourself from another so good morning bill good morning congressman thanks for having me so it's labor day uh and and first of all and foremost thank you all for the work you do it's what makes america great it's what going back to walt whitman and i believe it is uh and you know i hear america singing it's what's going on every day in our country making us a country making us different because our country is different the way it approaches work and we've honored workers on this special day of the year for doing that and i want to get right into it if i can uh perhaps i'll start sharing it with you uh what has it been like what for your colleagues for yourself uh you're there every time uh when someone is hurt has an injury is ill when we're visiting with a loved one who's very ill so in one respect that's nothing new for you but this has changed things totally hasn't it um it's actually it's so difficult to put to words i think that um i represent 600 nurses for the cape cod hospital hiring this hospital so um i really tried to listen to my colleagues especially the girls that were on the floors that were being created in like really quickly to try to handle the influx of these patients while the nursing administration was trying to figure out what was the best way to protect them and to actually protect the nurses so there was a lot of stress above and beyond obviously the unknown of you know being worried about um getting sick yourself but i think that because nurses we were primed to like put that aside and focus on the patient so as things started to progress um we my colleagues and i started to get more and more concerned and i think that as part of nurses we handle things a little bit better when we have more information so i focused on trying to help them with the stress by getting them as much information as i could because i'm their connection with nursing administration so um the more information that i got them the better they they could handle the stress but i think we never really had like a full surge down on the cape which we were lucky but the numbers that we saw for a couple weeks really um humbled everyone but i felt as though the nurses after a couple weeks of it really their burnout and their stress levels happened a lot quicker than even they had realized um so i i i would talk to nurses that were you know leaving the hospital and crying in their car and they didn't want to come back to work and this internal struggle of you know doing what we are you know made to do because as nurses it's not just the profession it's a calling but the internal struggle really um was difficult so i had a lot of my colleagues just constantly breaking down [Music] it was it was really difficult it still is but i feel like in that month period everything was so heightened and they felt like they weren't getting the support that they needed which was unfortunate well there was question too with personal protective equipment scarcity there's also you touched on many times the word stress uh it could even be trauma uh with nurses that i've spoken with um and and you're going home you mentioned that it's just not everything you're doing at work that work comes home with you uh can you talk about either your experience or some of your colleagues i mean coming home with that is another added pressure and everything you had to deal with at home um i have an eight-year-old and a seven-year-old so they are aware of my job and we tried to keep them a little out of the loop with some of the specifics of this pandemic just because i didn't want to add the stress but there were a couple times that i would get called in for emergency surgeries because that's the department that i work in and it would be um my husband would have to try to calm them down because they were so nervous about me leaving work so we did a long not personally in my house to like try to mitigate and talk to them through it but it really it was difficult for me every time i would leave to go to work and then you know i have co-workers that have six family members at home or um immune compromised people at home and so we tried to have conversations about how to um try to lessen the stress at that point i don't know if anyone really knew how to do that though yeah you mentioned uh having young people at home which is a great segue into talking to jackie about uh dealing with young children now you've been involved in teaching jackie and how is it to teach remotely all of a sudden and to make these changes it must be a difficult transition for me personally i actually um had a baby in january maternity leave um but i was scheduled to come back to work in april my husband's also a special education teacher and we have a two-year-old so we had a full house of things going on and when i came back in april i think that the biggest concern was that we no one really knew much about the virus so we were getting our groceries delivered like washing them we were just like i have no idea what this is like and i think the problem is too that um families when i came back to work remotely the families i didn't know what they were going through and we were given instructions from desi the department of ed to make sure that that was the priority was the kids mental health and and their physical well-being in their homes and to put academics more to the side and just to check in and make sure families are okay um and i'm i have my family too so it's kind of hard to be both making sure that we're okay but also making sure other people are okay and all virtually it was definitely a challenge wow and child care issues and i have to go back many years to think of my own family when we were balancing things uh just getting a child that alone uh the adjustment on top of it were closed so i had to have them both home with us which is great but it was really a struggle to be able to help all the families virtually too we were a family that needed support and help too and all of our my parents and my husband's parents are all 60 plus and so they're and some of them are at risk so we we couldn't have their help in home either so we were you know trying to do our best and i think and a lot of teachers are in that situation too yeah and bill uh talking about families firefighters uh are their own set of family uh close-knit uh and could you speak to what was going on as this was happening i mean all of a sudden you saw these things happen uh the way they were being predicted to but not to the extent that any of us would believe possible in this country but you and the other workers the firefighters and the people you work with emts police officers that you uh work with when there's a public safety emergency uh you can't take time off because there's an endemic to address these issues so you're going into circumstances uh not knowing whether someone whether there was an infection there if you're putting yourself at risk if you had enough equipment uh can you just tell us what was going through your professional family and your personal family's uh mind has just happened this year absolutely so i mean i don't think anybody uh would have thought this day and age that we would have to deal with anything like this um you know completely unknown and what was going to happen and what was going on um just seeing you know as it progressed and um slowly came towards us you know worrying about what was going to happen how we were going to uh go about things and you know just any first responder or nurses uh teachers and we sign up to help people to teach people to do whatever we can to um to benefit others um and we come to work with the unknown and expect the unknown because the majority of time you don't know what's going on even when you do it you do you do get a call just as shannon um explain information is key um and a lot of times we don't get um right off the bat when things go down and things happen we get calls we don't get all the information so we are going into the unknown um a lot of times it could be a tenement house with you know 30 40 people living in it and who knows who's got what going on who's sick who's not sick who's been around somebody that's sick if we're going into businesses or anything like that it you know um just trying to take care of you know ourselves um uh limiting our exposures um and then also like we said uh family at the station we live together 24 hours a day um and we're around each other constantly whether it's in the truck or in the station so even that social distancing inside the station inside the apparatus wearing ppe and just trying to stay ahead of it like that um our department you know we didn't want to try as much as we could to be proactive um as the virus was approaching instead of reactive so we did come up with a lot of guidelines and protocols to try to keep it that way and we did you know make up decontamination teams um to constantly clean stations apparatus all the other buildings and um vehicles in the city and even offered it to surrounding communities that weren't able to do it and that that extremely helped a lot um you know we also have um you know industrial washers and dryers and residential washers and dryers to clean our gear to clean our work uniforms and that way we don't have to worry about bringing anything home because it's that's that's one of the biggest things you know we we want to take care of ourselves uh brother and sister fight let us take care of the public we don't want to be spreading anything you know um anything that's going on with them and then bringing things home you all have families you know whether it's little ones or grown ones or in-laws or parents living with you um you know it's it's a big challenge and uh just just trying to constantly stay ahead of it and make sure you know um everybody's being taken care of the right way yeah labor day is about uh appreciating everyone's work appreciating the jobs that we do that knit us together as a country that's why it's a national holiday uh canada you think back though and you're all in professions where uh many times you get a lot of criticism from individuals that you're helping and families you're helping on a daily basis but you also get a lot of things that happen in your life where you say oh my god am i glad i chose this profession or you're experiencing something with a colleague that you work with do any of you have a story to share uh with us during this unusual historic uh in a tragic sense period where you saw something in a colleague or someone came up to you and said something or at a moment when you you just said i can't deal with this anymore uh someone came up to you or said something to you that just you'll always remember is there any uh of that in your own experience or through someone you were i think and um and it's happened you know more recently with everything going on and people you know thanking first responders and nurses and school teachers and all that stuff um and it's happened in the past too but it seems like it's more now but just having people come up and say thank you um you know it means a lot to us because it's what we sign up to do we sign up to help people uh in their time of need and whatever they need to do and you know we're not we're not doing any of it for the thank you but it's it's appreciative to show like people are you know um do appreciate you and what you do yeah shannon was just there to help so yeah shannon i know i talk to your a lot of the people in your profession and you or the people you work with they're in a position where they're actually taking the role of a close family member in in an unthinkable way where these people are alone uh in the icu unit and their life and death situations where you have to be the person talking to that family during that period because they're not allowed yet it's um it's it's been very interesting because i feel as though we've always had as nurses or any profession really like um that does um health care you're always used to having a family member there because that's just you know what happens in a hospital there's always a family member um usually right there and if not it's a phone call but um because of obviously the situation we've had to be really proactive trying to identify a person um who is going to be the in-between a support person through a phone call nurses have gotten very um creative with face time and frequent phone calls um because of what we do we're not by a phone so um you know we have patients to take care of we're not on the phone so um we you know really adapted to either having a portable phone on us or just a lot of communication with the physician to be like have you talked to the family member have i talked to family member i mean currently right now in the surgical department that i work in you know i'm doing um i'm helping recover patients that have had surgery a lot of these surgeries are you know they're it's a big thing to have surgery obviously and they have no family member with them in the recovery area so it really takes a an extra we really just have to be cognizant of our interactions with the patient to be above and beyond and then to speak to the person on the phone in a way way that they can understand and be supportive of the patient through the process so it just takes us a moment to like reset and refocus to make sure that we're meeting both of the person's needs over technology that is not something that we're used to doing because it's usually what we do is face-to-face and a lot of hand-holding which is what we love to do so i take a lot of extra time with my patients and you know talk to them and so that they can they see me from this way up but i mean you know just trying to connect with them a little closer and that's what's really important yeah jackie you know i think there's almost an inversion that occurred in your profession in your job where uh you know we just talked to shannon and bill and they're taking the place often of family members in an emergency right i think you can have a lot of parents that have a greater appreciation even for teaching now because uh they're getting a little taste of what you deal with in terms of home learning yeah explain how that's been i think a lot of a lot of parents that might have taken teachers for granted before when they're in the process of being a part of that themselves hands-on that way i think they're going to appreciate teachers a lot more but can you share some of that experience that dealing i noticed that um and i talked to my some of my other colleagues and teacher friends and we were all saying that yes they they get it now because their kids are at home and they are having to be support for them for their learning and it definitely was nice to see i remember in march and april seeing all of the people saying oh my gosh teachers they need so much more than we are able to give them and i did definitely feel appreciated and now now i'm starting to feel a little bit like the parents like okay send them back take them take them and we're just trying to prepare the schools for that but it's definitely still um a concern for me because like shannon and bill were saying about how they're there you know even shannon was just saying holding hands and there's so many teachers that want to reach out and hug the kindergarteners and first graders when they're sad and worried because it's the beginning of school for them but now we can't we have to set up our classrooms for the six foot distancing and we have to make sure they're frequently doing hand washing and little kids having to wear masks it's all so different for them um i do i feel for them uh can you deal two with any one of you can jump in the uncertainty that's around this even today here we are this far into the year there's still great uncertainty uh and in fact with this pandemic we face maybe greater challenges in some respects than we did in the spring the number of cases are increasing dramatically the deaths are piling up and the disruption continues you know uncertainty creates trauma and stress too and it creates stress in the family as well because having a job and honoring people on labor day you're honoring the family of all those people and and certainly we're doing our best uh in may we passed uh a bill that hopefully will work on soon is that's going to deal with many of these issues in a significant way but part of it is you know the uncertainty of the funding from where you work because state and local budgets are facing bankruptcy they're hemorrhaging they're at a crisis stage and the same in the health care industry in that regard so we're working in that but can you just speak to maybe without bearing any confidence with colleagues but you must have discussions with other people who work with you uh in your professions about that uncertainty and the stress level of not knowing what's coming next i think i'll just speak real quick to what's going on because people probably have heard what cape cod healthcare just experienced with the um layoff of 118 of our employees and you know i always work as you know as a mother and professional i only and a mother of an eight-year-old so i always point out missed opportunities to my eight-year-old if you know i'm not going to tell him what he did wrong he's going to figure it out the teacher there i think i think as nurses nurses are natural teachers as well because this is what we do as well but um so i feel like um i can't i can't understand the stress to that level of the administration i just feel as though with the amount of time that we've had to kind of figure out better ways to work i think it was a missed opportunity the hospital needs all of their employees to work well together and we feel the patients feel an immediate effect when a housekeeper or a diagnostic tech or um a kitchen person they lose their job plus it has a negative impact to the actual overall community i mean cape cod healthcare is the largest employer down here and you think like oh it's just 118 jobs but those that has a ripple effect and then it also affects the mentality in our mental health of our the rest of the coworkers in the hospital and i just feel like there could have been i mean if we can put people in space there has to be a better way of thinking outside the box to try to retain those jobs um it i feel so passionately about this and you know the nursing bedside nursing staff wasn't negatively impacted in a sense that they didn't lose their jobs but it impacts us greatly as a community at that hospital and how to care for our patients it's really unfortunate sharon that was such an important point you just made because in our society and that's what we talked about with labor day we are interdependent uh you know this is uh a job chain uh that's there so like your job and your ability to do it uh really also uh is a job of the clinician or who's ever doing the testing who's ever giving you information and able to give you information so you can do your job the right way in a timely fashion and bill you see the same thing you faced some of these issues before the uncertainty but certainly it's it's a really it's stress upon stress right now absolutely um unfortunately when all this when all this was first starting uh back in march um our mayor decided to close a fire company to save some money for the city so uh with that it reduced our response capabilities and increased our workload at the same time um with the unknown of this coming um and now you know we're at this point now where we got the spikes and the numbers are going back up again again there's still the unknown what's happening and as a result of all this now you know there's worries about the economy and money and state and local funding now um our mary is cutting another apparatus from us again and it's you know it's very dangerous um in a a congested city our size um and just with that it it increases our workload and our response capabilities immensely and then talk about stress you know it it puts stress levels through the roof mentally and physically for our members because we're having to do more with less constantly that's why it's been four months now since we passed monies to give a trillion dollars to states and municipalities uh and it's going to go to these frontline jobs that in a lot of the budgets at the local level and the state levels across the whole country they're budgeting as if they're going to get federal assistance and if that's not coming then this we're going to be facing uh tremendous layoffs and stress here because the fiscal year for most of these they run from the middle of the summer there so the front end there's money there but it's not going to be there unless the federal government comes in so hopefully that's going to be addressed it just amazes me that this hasn't been acted on as yet by the senate i don't want to make this political but it's integral to what we're talking about when we're talking about ability of people to do their jobs and to have and be able to really do those meaningful jobs and and jackie i mean in terms of the education every school system is a little different uh so it's if you could just generalize perhaps with resources because all these resources you're shifted from the mobile side uh where you know resources are are being put together on the run so it's it's really a stressful period too yeah and i wanted to interject what you were saying before too with the unknown because schools were shut down in march quickly and we made sure before any spikes now we're having the spikes and schools are being reopened during them so that's my concern especially for people in shannon and billy's positions where we don't know what the spread is going to be like now with all these schools opening back up and i think that it's definitely challenging it's scary teachers need new new materials that we've never been given before we've never had to have any ppe and now we all of a sudden need it for every single teacher every single school and like you were saying with funding where's that all going to be coming from and the other piece that's been challenging is the hvac systems in most schools are not passing and they're the air quality is very poor and a lot of unknown with the air circulation and how the virus can spread within a school based on that even at half capacity so because it hasn't happened yet we don't know but i we trust scientists and we trust um medical professionals that know about the virus so i mean you're right we're in a position some of the schools in my district were they were air quality issues before this ever happened they were they were closing down schools looking at the cost of that one instance i recall very clearly they decided to build a new school because of the cost of doing all these things asbestos was flowing through uh you know ventilation systems and causing problems so this was a problem before and in parts of the country the real problems with the drinking water in our facilities and so this is a another point uh i think that all of you brought forward that's so important and that's the osha or the the the safety standards going to work i mean we've talked about what it's like personally we've talked about the trauma on the family we've talked about how you're dealing with the people yeah usually in all three of your professions uh you know families and the public as a whole but also with all this being said we should be doing everything we could do to make sure the people are working in the safest environment you mentioned the ventilation systems the the disparity in in school ventilation too congressman the kids are going to be in the building not just the teachers and i do feel like we still don't have enough answers about how the kids are going to be affected long term i think we want to make sure that all the people in our building are going to be you know safe and we can't guarantee that yeah so this was a big enough problem before this happened now this is on top of it i don't know bill if you want to comment on you know some of the safety issues you're going into places you don't know early on i was trying to work very hard and with some success and making sure that when you're going into someone's home or uh or a corporation a company or something you knew what you were walking into but still there was that problem early on bill wasn't it yeah absolutely and it still continues to be um you know we're part of the protocols that we change and guidelines um when calls come into dispatch um it's you know a number of questions that have to be asked and found out to try to get us as much information as we can so we know what we're going into but again part of our profession is always expect the unknown because you're not always going to get all the information majority of the time and even if you do usually it could be wrong or it could be a whole nother situation that you even know and sometimes you're just getting sent to a place where you have nothing at all you don't know what you're going into and plus you know you're going from one crisis to another so yeah one of one of your members gets infected uh i mean we are all of us humans are the transmitters we're the people that transmit this so if you get you're going in often to where elderly people are and we're all transmitters so what i'd like to do uh uh you know just as a thought uh before we conclude is perhaps all three of you give a at least take some time uh which i think could really be very meaningful to anyone that watches this to say how important it is that all of us as transmitters as agents transmitting this disease for all of us to to be sure we're doing everything we can to keep everyone else safe by wearing masks washing your hands by keeping the distances uh you know in space sufficient that we're not transmitting these some people have let their guard down some people frankly still don't believe it we're being told by some in power at certain stages this is a hoax can you give us the importance of all of us working together to keep everyone safe absolutely i think sorry the uh so we as everybody can see you know you just look at the numbers and the spikes that have happened um and you know we we're not going to get through this unless we all work together um we have to follow state and local guidelines what's going on wearing your mask if you feel sick you're going to stay at home it's not just about you and your family whoever's at home with you it's about the stranger next to you at the grocery store or you know the guy the person next to you pumping gas you know whether you know it or not whatever is going on with you could affect somebody else at some point with their life or or somebody or or it just creates a domino effect so you just follow guidelines wear your mask stay home if you're sick and that's it you know we're not going to get through this unless we help each other shannon i think you see that firsthand yeah i people need to this goes across the board even for flu season whatever wash your hands just wash your hands there's plenty of purell in the alcohol just wear that wear your mask stay home if you're not feeling good and i really have to say just be respectful especially like when you have the stress of someone coming into the hospital or you have to go into the hospital for a test and so you're meeting all of these almost it looks like a barrier of like people wearing masks in in everything and then you have to go through ask these answer these questions and then there's all these steps when you used to be able to just walk in so just be respectful of the people that are in the hospital environment that we're doing the best that we can in this environment because we're feeling stressed as well just wear your mask be respectful um wash your hands yeah and and jackie you see firsthand everyone wants their child back to school you don't want the learning cycle interrupted you know that as an educator better than than i do uh but if we're going to get there sooner we all have to work all of us to try and get to that stage so it's safer to do that and i would i would definitely say that teachers want to teach we want to teach your kids we want everyone to be safe and healthy whether it's in person or in the classroom or in the classroom or at home we want to teach but i think i mean i want to teach in person nothing can replace that i just i do feel like i want to be safe first that's our priority only yeah i think and i think for parents parents need to be role models for their kids and they need to be able to look up to them and wearing their mask diligently and washing their hands and helping their kids learn how to wash their hands properly and wear their masks and making it positive for them so that they feel encouraged when they do get to come back to school because it's not going to be the same and i just feel like everyone was saying it being kind being respectful you know making sure we're doing this for each other not just for ourselves well it's pretty clear on this labor day 2020 uh i'm talking to three people where a job isn't just a job it's a calling it's a profession but it's a way that in your own lives you're helping other people and that's what we want to honor on labor day the covert 19 pandemic has made this a different one to reflect on but at the end of the day uh we honor all our workers uh everyone we're all part of this great society and we're not going to be a great society unless everyone has the opportunity to work in a meaningful way uh to contribute to each other i guess the message uh this labor day is honor those people who work for us uh in so many different professions on our our own work that we do in our professions every day and realize more than ever we're doing this because we're all in this together and that's what's going to make uh our country and our society and our schools uh our public safety uh frontline people our health care professionals uh put putting them in a position so they can do the job the best way they can thank you for what you do every day thank all your colleagues thanks to the professions that we haven't mentioned that are all integral as we mentioned with shannon we're all part of a chain uh thank you and uh enjoy the rest of the day and thank you for taking part of this holiday weekend to share this and i hope it brings uh a little more insight to everyone in our region uh on the value of everything you do so happy labor day thank you

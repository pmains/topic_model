hi i'm catherine cortez Masto US senator from nevada and i'm here with Carl who handles health care in my office and we are here to talk to you about this administration's rule on junk plans you know there are 1.1 million Nevadans right now who have pre-existing conditions and this administration's rule implementing junk plans would pretty much guarantee that if you have a pre-existing condition and you have one of these plans you will not be covered and so the fight right now is is to ensure that we are stopping and overturning this rule on junk plans but we want to talk to you a little bit more about them Carl what else they're in the jumpings well senator I know these junk plans they don't have to cover many basic services so they'll have to cover maternity care emergency room visits prescription drugs so a lot of these basic things if you were sick you'll be stuck with the bills right those are the essential benefits that are covered in the Affordable Care Act exactly right and so what we have seen is this administration has literally sabotage and continue to sabotage the Affordable Care Act this is one way of doing and creating these junk plans so for that reason Senate Democrats are fighting to overturn this rule and one person in particular senator Tammy Baldwin has put forth this petition a discharge petition to force a rule so that we can overturn this administration's rule on job plans so I am signing this right now and asking for your support make sure you reach out to your Senators and let them know they you do not support these jump plans because they do not cover the essential benefits that are necessary to cover health care in this country so thanks for joining us

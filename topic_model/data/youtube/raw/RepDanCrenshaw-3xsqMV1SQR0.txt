to see that when we just repeat what the left says it makes you guys really really mad why because it's insanity this amendment is common sense and just like all the other previous amendments they expose the hypocrisy and the contradictions that are present on the other side of the aisle we are not going to put up with this anymore if you guys don't like the slogans that are attached to your party then talk to your own people don't get mad at us when we propose common sense amendments that expose the nonsense going on on the left the radicalism that is going on the left was the defund the police movement crime is rising in major cities across america not just a little but exponentially people are literally dying day after day because of democrat policies and only because of democrat policies because it's if it's not defunding the police it's bail reform or whatever else is causing dramatic increases in crime a refusal to acknowledge that it's happening refusal to enforce the law and go after violent criminals because you know social justice and stuff if a city is defunding the police they probably don't need more money for 9-1-1 centers do they and do i need to point out that it doesn't matter if you call 9-1-1 if there's no police on the other end of that because your liberal mayor has defunded them they need to point that out to you people so spare me the outrage on the other side because we're exposing what your side says all the time lots of cities have done this like we've already said 25 have either done it or proposed to do it you say oh well not us we haven't done it your most famous members of congress have the ones controlling your party the squad eljan omar ocasio-cortez corey bush they're all on the record saying when we mean defund the police we mean defund the police this is not a fringe movement this is in your conference and we're just exposing it if that makes you mad too bad don't direct your anger at us direct it at your own people spare me the outrage at us guys please and just vote for this amendment show that there's actually some common sense moderate members of the democrat party just show us that show that you're not controlled by the squad that actually does want to defund the police your anger is misplaced at us that's for sure

the murder of george floyd and the corresponding uh uh protest that we have seen the the interest in reforming policing and really a a time of racial reckoning in our country how do you feel that this issue around this military equipment for police fits into the picture that we're talking about with police reform and black lives matter yeah i think the death of george floyd which was captured um on video and millions of people have watched that eight minutes and 46 seconds of pain and death that accrued to my friend george floyd and and we saw the style of policing that is taking place in urban areas uh or basically in areas where black folks live in america it's a it's a culture of policing that is more of a warrior gladiator style of policing rather than a protector protect and serve um and uh so the death of george floyd crystallized in the minds of the people the very real fact that policing is different in areas where black and brown people live and that this difference causes the deaths at the hands of police officers of just a continuing um parade of uh innocent uh unarmed uh black people black and brown people and people now see that that is the reality and they want it to change and so the militarization of police forces across the country is in keeping with that warrior gladiator style of policing and um and so along with that style of policing so needs to go the weapons of war that are deployed by these police departments and the and you know the defense authorization act 1033 program and its uh successors require that these law enforcement agencies actually place into service the equipment that they get from the federal government within one year of the date of their receipt of it or else they have to turn it back in yes so law enforcement agencies are itching for the opportunity to use this um equipment and so it ends up being used for purposes for which it's not intended and it uh operates against the people that the police are employed to protect and serve so getting rid of this uh 1033 program in so far as it allows for the transfer of military-grade weaponry to state and local law enforcement agencies as well as federal agencies will go a long way towards removing uh this kind of equipment from the streets yes as we're in a period where i hope we're going to reimagine what policing looks like and really do an evaluation of when armed responses are needed um i think that the work that you have been doing around this is so critical because it is uh it is just putting up another barrier and as you said continuing this warrior mentality instead of one of guardian and community leaders and i i hope that this will go a long way to reestablishing community trust i don't know if we can really rebuild that as long as there are tanks rolling down the the small town uh streets of georgia and other places in this country what do you feel are you optimistic about ending this program do you think that this is this is the time where we can do it uh just within three weeks from the death of george floyd the the george floyd justice and policing act was the house democrats response to the uh death of george floyd and um so i appreciate your leadership in in enabling uh the uh the uh stop militarizing law enforcement act to be folded into the george floyd justice and policing act and that act passed uh and even had uh bipartisan support um but unfortunately now the bill sits in the uh on in the cemetery of mcconnell the the grim reaper so much of our other legislation you know i mean so so much is is at stake as we move forward towards uh november 3rd and hopefully we can um we can strengthen our caucus in the house and um create a situation where we have a senate that shares our values and also a president that shares our values and then we'll be able to get so much legislation passed such as the george floyd justice and policing act

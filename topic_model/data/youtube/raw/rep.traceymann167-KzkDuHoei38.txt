mr speaker i'm honored to host this special order during national agriculture month on the strength of american agriculture i'm inspired by the american farmers ranchers and agriculture producers who feed fuel and clothe not only this country but the entire world i grew up on a farm south of quinter kansas that my parents and brothers still operate growing up there meant that i spent thousands of hours on a tractor working in fields and on a horseback doctoring sick cattle in the family feed yard those hours turn into love of country and lessons about the values of hard work creativity flexibility and putting others before ourselves my district the big first of kansas is home to more than sixty thousand farms where farmers ranchers feedlot managers ethanol producers ag lenders and agribusiness owners ensure that america remains the most food secure country in the world as congress becomes increasingly urban the distance from farm to fork has never been greater and since america's national security depends in large part on our food security we need strong voices for agriculture in this congress which is why i'm honored to serve on the house agriculture committee and to host this special order tonight if congress is going to legislate effectively on matters relating to agriculture congress must first understand that agricultural perspectives of america there's something about being in the middle of the country where farmers pray for rain parents drive 30 miles both ways to just take their kids to school and communities shrink and grow with oil and gas prices that gives you a greater perspective outside committee republican leader gt thompson and i just returned from a trip to my district while there we saw an american heartland infused with both the innovative energy that creates new ideas and the love of tradition that that respects tried and true methods we saw the usda national bio and agri facility that will take american agriculture into the future and we met with the family who owns and operates brook river feed yards one of the first feedlots in kansas we also saw oil production ag lending ethanol production wheat innovation and the next generation of leaders in the food and agriculture departments at kansas state university i look forward to celebrating the culmination of national ag month with my colleagues here tonight as we celebrate the force passion and the strength of american agriculture mr picker i want to thank everyone who spoke today for helping congress understand an agriculture perspective as dwight eisenhower who was from my state from my district said farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles from a cornfield today it felt like members who spoke on this floor brought the farm a little closer to capitol hill and for that i thank them congress uses the reauthorization of the farm bill every five years to determine the nature of our support for the men and women who feed fuel and clothe the world america's food security is so important because it determines the strength of our national security we will never be a secure country if we have to rely on other countries to feed ourselves because the tenacity of the american farmer who are the most we are the most food secure country in the world and i will do everything in my power to keep it that way as congress determines how we will support farmers ranchers and agricultural producers in the 2023 farm bill i encourage members to imagine how different their lives would be without healthy american agriculture from the food on our tables to the fuel in our cars to the fibers in our clothing to the roofs over our head agricultures all around us and we tend to take it for granted well it isn't granted it is gifted every day american farmers ranchers and agricultural producers give us the gift of our quality of life in this country our comforts come from the sweat of their brows the least this congress can do is support their efforts wholeheartedly with the strong thoughtful 2023 farm bill and related legislation the view of the future of america depends on it and with that mr speaker i yield back

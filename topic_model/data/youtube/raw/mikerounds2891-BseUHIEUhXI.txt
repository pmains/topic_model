senator mike rounds joins us from south dakota senator good to have you as things stand now uh are are you a no on this stimulus measure as things stand right now i am a no and i think the vast majority of the republicans if not all of the republicans will be a no this is a 1.9 trillion dollar increase in our national debt republicans had offered a reasonable expectation saying we've already got a trillion dollars which has not been spent yet from our december proposal let's talk a little bit about what's in the 1.9 you just heard some of the items that are in there this is not a pandemic relief effort this is a giveaway to a lot of left-wing causes so um they're going to drive a hooker crook it sounds like senator to find a way parliamentary wise that they can build this hike in the minimum wage to 15 into it by presumably making it a tax issue a way for corporations um that are of a significant size to pay at least 15 therein makes it passable in a reconciliation measure it gets a little into the weeds i apologize but but how likely is that to happen to be included in this package when it gets to the senate i i think it will be a real challenge for them to include it because of two things first of all under the the rules that we have it does have to be basically a tax or an expenditure type of direction to a committee but the second piece is we already know that not all of the democrats are on board either and so in a 50 50 divided senate to begin with they can't lose any votes at all and pass this under reconciliation they've got their work cut out for them look they're going to get something done they're going to find a way to get their democrats all together to pass it it's one of the reasons why we talk about every single vote in the united states senate being critical but when you start talking about what we offered we said we wanted it to be targeted and specific this particular proposal is not targeted it is not specific you know um you're one of the more prominent republicans not at cpac why not um look i'm from south dakota when i get a chance to come home i come home i try to get back home every single week i'm sure there's going to be a lot of entertaining speakers down there i think the united states senate is going to be very well represented a lot by people that are looking at moving to a different office i said look i i came here to represent my people here in south dakota i'm going to stay here and i'm going to do my best to work in the united states senate you know senator a lot of the speakers have been bashing fellow republicans a liz cheney's name has come up mitch mcconnell's mitt romney they apparently abandoned reagan's 11th commandment thou shalt not speak ill of fellow republicans on any level does that worry i think whatever civil war people have tried to create within the republican party i think it's time to end it if it was there to begin with you know the principles that bind us together the principles that abraham lincoln talked about the principles that ronald reagan talked about bind us yet and when we start talking about lower taxes about having a competitive economy about keeping our unemployment low about having conservative judges those are things that bind us together along with the vast majority of the american public that's what will bind us together in the 2022 election cycle and as long as we focus on those things that keep us together we're going to be fine we'll bring this party together if we want to beat up on each other then we've got problems i don't think it does anybody any good to be speaking ill of other republicans senator rounds very good seeing you again enjoy your beautiful stay a little coldest time of year but thank you again

primary season is heating up with four key races happening in the South tomorrow but as voters head to the polls to decide this year's candidates Congress has been seeing a decline in presence of military veterans for years with less than 20% of seats being held by vets so why is it important to have veterans at the table here now as a man who is pushing for more veterans to join the political arena and as a congressional candidate in Texas retired Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander Dan Crenshaw thank you for joining us this morning just to start here how's your race going in Texas well it's going really well and the election is tomorrow Tuesday May 22nd and well that's the primary at least of course the the general elections November so what do you think veterans have to offer and why should they be holding these positions well you know as you know we've seen a big decline in the number of veterans that are serving in Congress and that's a shame because I think veterans do have a lot to offer you know we started out in life with one thing in mind and that was public service and that was service without recognition that was humble service and I think that's important that's an important lesson to start off let's start off with the second thing we learned is leadership skills and and there's one lesson in particular and that's taking care of your people if you're bad at every other aspect of leadership if you just know one thing which is that you're supposed to take care of your people then you know I think you've got it you've understand what leadership really is that I think Congress could use a little bit of that kind of lesson you mentioned the decline in veterans holding office let's take a look at some of those numbers right now in the house starting in 1971 look at this steady decline you can see in 1971 it was 72 percent of veterans in the house and then you fast-forward to 2017 18 percent but over that number of years that decline is so steady same situation in the Senate in 1971 it was 78 percent steady decline there and then you can see 20 17 19 percent what do you attribute that loss to it's really hard to say maybe it was you know the the the feeling after Vietnam the feeling of coming home and and frankly and unfortunately not getting the respect that they deserved like they would like we do now I think I think America has had a pretty big turnaround in the way we see veterans and and now you see a lot of oh I fo e4 Afghan Iraq vets coming off the battlefield now and eager to serve again and that's really my story I was looking for a way to serve my community again served my country again and and and make the impact in the biggest way possible and an effective most policy issues that I could and also take my experience from overseas and national security issues the behind the scenes experience that really can't be taught and take that to Congress because I think we need it and I think our president certainly needs it right now as we deal with really difficult issues in the Korean Peninsula in the Middle East with Russia China you need people with experience abroad you need people with experience behind the scenes Lieutenant Commander Dan Crenshaw thank you for your time this morning I will certainly be watching to see what happens tomorrow have a good one no thank you for having me

that those who serve often continue their service even after they get out of the military regardless of the context in your case you're trying to go to congress but it seems like there's something endemic in these individuals that serve that they can't get service out of their blood what say you great question and that's because we get it and we have the honor and the privilege to wake up in this country every single day and put our feet on free solving american soil and breathe free sovereign american air because we've had brave men and women die for it and days like this hit really close to home for me 14 of my west point classmates are no longer with if they were killed in the global war on terror and four more since then have committed suicide i'm going to tell you they didn't die for black people white people are for asian people for hispanic people they died for all americans it is incumbent upon us to figure out to continue to find ways to serve because they are no longer here to serve for themselves that's one of the reasons why i'm running for united states congress and i think the people on this panel get that one thing that stands out from the three of you is that you're all republican why do you think that is why do you think there's that tie-in between you three individuals the military and wanting to run as republicans because if you look at what's happening in our country today it is actually the republican party that believes in the american spirit fire and still believes in the american dream and we want to defend our freedoms not just for us in this generation but for generations to come i mean look i am the direct descendant of a slave and here i am right now running for united states congress in a predominantly white district in houston texas and you know what that happens only in one place in one place in the entire world that's this country the republican party believes in a meritocracy the military believes in the meritocracy and the three people on this panel believe we can continue to do this for the future it doesn't matter what you look like it doesn't matter where you're from if you're a red-blooded american come on board

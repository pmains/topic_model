uh the senator has just traveled to mexico and guatemala where he met with top officials to talk about the crisis and sir you returned on friday exactly one month ahead of the vice president's scheduled trip to to go to that region i understand you say this crisis needs to be fixed now and that it's imperative that the vp sees what's going on firsthand senator hagerty exclusively joins the faulkner focus first of all you're watching this in real time now i have to just get your first person uh reaction to this yeah harris it's great to be on with you and i think what you're seeing what bill just showed in the footage is the urgency of a situation this is the gravest national security crisis that we're facing right now as a nation it has to be dealt with now that's the reason i took the very first trip that's come from the united states senate the first official trip i took it to guatemala and mexico to get to the heart of the problem and to underscore the fact that this is urgent and clearly it needs to be dealt with now you see people's lives at risk right in front of your eyes today senator haggerty when this happens do you then request an audience with someone in the white house how does it work have you talked with the vice president i mean if if perhaps she could see and hear directly from the senate's first official trip through senator bill hagerty could that change things i hope it could change things but it seems the white house is more preoccupied with even what to call this they can't get around to calling it a crisis they can't get around to scheduling a trip to mexico for yet another month i mean this is something that needs to be dealt with immediately if you look at what's happening in my home state harris we've had a dramatic increase in drug overdoses in death drug overdoses the crime element associated with this is enormous sex trafficking happening in my home state of tennessee we're receiving unaccompanied minors into my state the schools are being told they're going to have to deal with them the hospitals are trying to figure out if they have capacity there are more questions unanswered than answered right now that's the reason i made this my first trip is to underscore the fact that the senate does take this seriously we have the power of the person we want to see this addressed right now uh senator did you just say schools because you know that we've got people in this country that kids haven't even gone back in person yet i mean this is this is a is this what people are talking about when they say this is a burden on an already hard situation during a pandemic for america's children absolutely it burdens america's children in the sense the schools will be overloaded burdens our hospital system and think about what it does to the lowest level of our economic structure here those americans in the lowest end of the economic ladder are going to have even more pressure more downward pressure on their wages and more competition from people that are flooding across the border and i can assure you of this i talk with leaders in guatemala and mexico the majority of the reason people that are coming across the border is for economic reasons that's not a reason for asylum they're coming here for a better job a better way of life we're creating a giant help wanted opportunity right now because what we've done is extended unemployment insurance plus up unemployment all the way through september we have employers in my home state of tennessee that can't find people to work that message is being sent loud and clear to folks in central america folks in mexico and as you just learned coming from venezuela it's like a giant help wanted sign and what people do down there this is what the leaders made very clearly to me they listen very carefully to what's coming from america whether it be campaign rhetoric or whether it be executive orders from this white house when they hear a candidate like joe biden say if i win i'm going to treat you better that creates a sense of hope a sense of urgency is created when you hear them talk about 100 days moratorium on any deportations and then the false promises of a 15 minimum wage of 1400 stimulus checks for illegal immigrants a free coveted vaccinations all of this is being marketed by these coyotes the coyotes that you saw on television right there they're creating false hope in these people these people are putting their life savings on the line and they're endangering themselves tremendously more than half of the people that are caught up in this movement are the victims of crime along the way whether it be sex trafficking whether it be involvement in the narcotics trades and by the way the mexican government the guatemalan governments that i talked with they see the cartels getting stronger every day because their revenues are going up these are lawless organizations that are growing by the moment and china is deeply involved with all of them oh that's an interesting uh last point on on china and its involvement i want to go deeper on that just real quickly sure well what's happening is that fentanyl is coming through in increasing numbers chinese cartels are shipping more and more fentanyl and its precursor agents into mexico primarily that's where the drugs are being created that's where they're being shipped and marketed from there into our nation going into the veins of our kids and killing them that's the chinese involvement they're also involved in the drug laundering i understand starting the money laundering for these drugs so the chinese cartels are getting stronger more revenues the mexican cartels are getting stronger and more revenues and the governments of mexico the governments of guatemala and others are suffering as a result they don't want to see crime grow in their own country yet these large crime organizations are thriving right now because of the situation that we created at our border you know all of this brings about the point of those agreements that the former president trump had made with those countries and from what you're saying and and i i've seen interviews with you before and i've been reading what you're bringing this first person account after meeting with these officials is i would think senator why the vice president has to go there and go there now you're getting so much information in person that maybe is hard to gather outside i appreciate your time today and your expertise i look forward to having you back senator bill hagerty of the great

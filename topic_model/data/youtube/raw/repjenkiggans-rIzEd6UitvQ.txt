my dear friend representative Jen kiggins from Virginia too thanks so much and it's a great honor to be here with all of you today and thanks to my colleague Juan for inviting us down here and speaker McCarthy for taking the time I represent Virginia's second congressional district which is the home of some of our nation's service men and women and I ran for congress because I wanted to help restore American strength I see an Administration that's not focused on strength that's focused on weakness and our enemies are watching and I'm worried that our enemies are are not fearing us anymore and that our friends aren't trusting us anymore National Security is very important to me it's important to all of us it's not a Republican or Democrat issue it's an American issue and we're seeing a border right now that is weak that is inviting illegal immigrants to come across and it's putting our families at risk and the stories we've heard today from Mayors and from sheriffs and from border patrol agents you know their families are at risk too these guys put their lives on the line every single day to look out for us and to protect us from a group of people that doesn't care about our families and doesn't care about our safety so as a mom as a mom of four as a Navy veteran my country is important our security is important but our families are so important so we've got to start supporting our border patrol agents this group of freshmen that's here is so focused on finding Solutions that's why we're here today because we actually want to get things done in Congress that's why we ran for office and that's why we're here to learn so thank you so much to all of you who took time today to share our message

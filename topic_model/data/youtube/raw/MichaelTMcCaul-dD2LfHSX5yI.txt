welcome back to the lead the national league now whoever is elected the next president of the united states will inherit the terrorist threat that will not be vanquished before inauguration day next january and one of the most compelling of those terrorist threats we are told is the determination by isis to attack in the u.s within the next year today the secretary of the department of homeland security said that isis is the most prominent terrorist group on the world stage and with six new terror related arrests in the u.s already just this year it could be a matter of time before another successful plot against the homeland joining me now from capitol hill congressman mike mccall he's chairman of the house homeland security committee a republican from texas and out with a new book called failures of imagination the deadliest threats to our homeland and how to thwart them congressman thanks so much for being here thanks jake thanks for having me so the director of national intelligence is saying that isis is determined to attack the united states in 2016 last year of course we saw in chattanooga tennessee san bernardino california you get daily intelligence briefings what type of attacks are officials most worried about i think an active shooter type attack like what we saw in paris i think attack on military installations police officers they send a lot of internet traffic into the united states uh really with two messages one come to syria and join the fight or if you can't do that then attack and kill where you are that that's the one that impacts the homeland in addition to the foreign fighters who have traveled to the region and have come back to the united states is there anything new that officials are doing to combat this threat well what we're trying to do is get the administration not only to come up with a military strategy obviously to deal with isis word exists uh at its root cause but also to deal with this uh phenomenon over social media and on the internet and what can be a counter narrative to that message and what we've seen actually from companies like google uh recently have come out with uh ads that pop up if you type in jihadist websites which is a positive thing twitter has now shut down about 125 000 twitter accounts because that's that's what the isis cyber commanders use to radicalize from within the united states in your book you describe a number of potential terrorist scenarios ones that really concern you in one case you explore what if terrorists hacked the u.s power grid do you ever get concerned that that a book like this might give terrorists more ideas or or is this just you're just going where they're the terrorists are already talking well we did a fictional uh scenario in each chapter to get the interest of the reader but in each chapter we say could this really happen and that's the important educational piece for the american public uh that that they are they've actively either tried to do this or they're actively plotting it and so uh they thought of all these it's an open source document obviously um and what i'm trying to do is educate not only the american people but policy makers as to what the true nature of the threat is and then also importantly what can we do to stop it president obama unveiled his 2017 budget proposal you're very critical on the spending or lack of spending you say on national security what's an area that could use a boost in funding well i think uh obviously fbi and homeland defending the homeland we stopped a lot of bad things 82 isis related arrests more than one per week but i think this countering violent extremism issue is is not being addressed as a priority uh within the administration it's something i've been trying to work with the secretary jay johnson to strengthen up our ability to to counter their ability to use the internet and really prey on young military age males in the united states we can do a far better job than we're doing we don't really have a counter narrative right now and i think we have to be focused on that all right the book failures of imagination congressman mike mccall thanks so much jake thanks for

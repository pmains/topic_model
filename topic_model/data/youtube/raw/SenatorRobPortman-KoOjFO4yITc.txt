come to the floor for the 28th consecutive weeks since the Senate has been in session to once again discuss the war in Ukraine and why it's so important that all of us the United States our allies stand up for Ukraine at this point and provide them the needed military economic and humanitarian humanitarian Aid that they need over the weekend I spoke at the annual holiday lunch of the Cleveland area nationalities movement as my colleague from Ohio knows this was started during the Cold War to advocate for freedom for the former Soviet States the group today includes people whose families came from all over Eastern Central Europe Poland Lithuania lat the Estonia Slovakia of course Ukraine and many other countries all strongly support Ukrainian freedom and the right of Ukraine to chart its own course at the luncheon I talked to some of my friends who were there many of them have family we're friends in Ukraine we talked about some of the hardships that their relatives and their friends in Ukraine are facing today and how as we approach the holiday season here in America we're thinking about Christmas shopping and putting up decorations and um spending time with our family and friends over the holidays they're thinking about something else they're thinking about how they can survive they're thinking about how to stay warm whether they're going to have running water or electricity they're living with fear and uncertainty not knowing when the next next Russian missile might strike the brutal unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine has now turned into an outright attack on civilians and non-combatants this photo is something that we're seeing in communities all over Ukraine this is some civilian infrastructure you can see the the power grid here the power lines um this was a result of a Russian missile strike all over this is happening drones missiles attacking infrastructure killing civilians by the way and forcing people to live in the dark and in the cold as Ukraine's severe winter weather approaches although these merciless Russian attacks are meant to weaken the resolve of ukrainians it's not having that effect actually I've seen this in my recent trips to Ukraine it's actually hardening people's resolve ukrainians know that these are desperate missile attacks to the interior of the country why because Russia is losing on the actual Battlefield as this map shows ukrainians have shown courage and Effectiveness in actually pushing out Russia from all these red areas of Ukraine this is where Russia was after February 24th 50 percent or more of the country has now been liberated by Ukrainian troops we forget about that about 55 percent of Ukraine has now been liberated thanks to the again the resolve and the courage and the military skill of the ukrainians Ukrainian soldiers continue to advance more slowly but continue to advance giving the Russians no time to relax or recover here's where we are today so remember before there was red all over the country of Ukraine this is where the Russians are now this uh the striped red line is the part that Russia invaded back in 2014. and the the red part here is where they invaded on February 24th and are still occupying parts of Ukraine in the East near bakmut which is right here Russian forces and Wagner group Mercenaries who are fighting on behalf of Russia are fighting a war of attrition it's a grinding war of attrition with marginal gains to show for their massive losses in terms of Manpower and equipment in its attempt to capture this town of bakmut Russia has turned what used to be a quaint tree-lined City that I visited back in 2018 into a bloodbath this is what Bak moot looks like today it looks like something you'd see out of a World War One film Ukrainian officials say Moscow is now losing 50 soldiers a day to maintain this slow bruising advance to reach the city's Eastern Gates all of this death and destruction over a city that has marginal strategic Advantage for Russia it appears to observers that Russia is willing to put their soldiers and mercenaries In Harm's Way in Bak moot because it's the only place that Russian forces are genuinely advancing at all and Vladimir Putin is eager even desperate to claim some sort of Victory to try to salvage this failed military campaign that they're on I did go to bakmut back in 2018 it was then called the line of contact I met with Ukrainian troops who were there holding the line including the 54th mechanized Brigade who are still fighting there in that region I saw men willing to die for their country for their freedom for their families so I was not surprised by The Bravery and resolve that the Ukrainian troops have shown since February 24th I was expecting it based on what I'd seen in Bak mood those soldiers I met gave me this flag when I was there it's signed by a number of the soldiers I met and it says at the bottom here glory to Ukraine glory to the heroes Slava Ukraine Slava that's the rallying cry these troops who signed this flag to me I'm told many of them are likely to be dead or injured now because the fighting in Bak moot has been so intense so Godspeed to those troops who are holding the line against this Russian assault tonight as we talk on the floor of the United States Senate the ukrainians are making progress elsewhere you see here in her song this was the City that the Russians took on February 24th it was the only provincial capital that they took the biggest city they took early on they have now abandoned her son and Ukrainian troops have taken Harrison and liberated it and The Liberation has been extraordinary you see people coming out of their homes and hugging the troops and you see the war crimes that the Russians were committing the withdrawal from her song to the west side of the river here has been a great victory for the Ukrainian troops the Relentless counter-offensive is actually working with this situation on the battlefield the military outlook here for Russia looks bleak it's precisely because they are not winning on the battlefield though that they are instead attacking civilian targets these cowardly attacks we've seen all over Ukraine electricity natural gas water knocking out everything they can in order to try to break the will and the resolve of the people of Ukraine this past weekend 1.5 million people were left without power after Russian airstrikes damaged local energy infrastructure in Odessa so 1.5 million people here were without electricity most those people now have electricity again because the ukrainians are moving quickly to try to restore it but then it's bombed again and again across the country according to Ukrainian prime minister schmeichel quote after eight waves of missile attacks on the country all thermal and hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine have been damaged in other words every single power plant coal natural gas hydroelectric they have all been bombed again many have now been repaired again and again and again that the bombings continue last Friday according to the deputy head of President zielinski's Office 68 strikes in the Harrison region occurred 68 strikes across the line here in Ukrainian territory this included a strike on a hospital in Harrison that damaged the children's Ward it included an attack on a morgue in this area in the northeastern part of Ukraine up here near harkive there's also been great progress recently as you see where ukrainians have pushed the Russians toward the toward the east these Russian cross-border attacks on the city of vashank in that area left thousands of people without heat in the midst of winter earlier this week I saw the effects of these missile attacks firsthand the last time I was in Ukraine I visited Kiev about a month ago with my colleague Senator Chris Coons from Delaware we saw the destruction that these missiles are causing in this case it was at a headquarters of Ukraine's utility company we then after that actually had a dinner meeting with parliamentarians from Ukraine at a restaurant where the power had been taken out through these attacks we had to conduct business with flashlights it was incredible later that night to look at the city of key from an office building a modern 21st Century City completely dark thanks to the dated air defense systems that they do have ukrainians have been able to intercept and destroy a lot of these Russian missiles so they're intercepting actually most of them somewhere between 60 and 70 percent probably based on the information I have but enough of them get through to cause this incredible damage to Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and to kill you ukrainians on the ground as these temperatures drop temperature in Keys tonight as we talk here is about 23 degrees Fahrenheit Ukraine isn't just trying to shoot down russian-made missiles and iranian-made drones we know that they're iranian-made drones and these Russian missiles coming in to Ukraine they also have to shoot down ukrainian-made missiles why do I say that because according to Ukraine's Deputy intelligence Chief some of these missiles that Russia has fired recently have actually been missiles that Ukraine voluntarily gave to Russia as part of the 1994 Budapest agreement the so-called Budapest memorandum recall that the Budapest memorandum was a document that was signed by the United States the UK and Russia with Ukraine this was after the fall of the Soviet Union in the agreement all parties including Russia promised to respect the independence and sovereignty and territorial Integrity of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine giving up their nuclear weapons but also providing missiles and strategic bombers to Russia so now these very same missiles and very same bombers are being used by Russia in its ruthless campaign against innocent civilians in Ukraine there can be no clearer display of Russia's contempt for its International obligations and total disregard for the Budapest memorandum Ukraine gave up its weapons in exchange for peace and instead they have War there can be no more urgent or important requests from Ukraine Ukraine today of course in a better air defense system that's what they need more than anything else every day vital infrastructure is being destroyed civilians being killed the news from the Biden Administration yesterday that they now may be thinking seriously about sending Patriot missile systems to Ukraine which is our most advanced anti-missile air defense weapon is very encouraging to me here's the Patriot missile system this one is actually in Poland we have provided this to the Polish government we now need to provide it to the Ukrainian government I've called for this for months as have others and I hope this comes to fruition we need to get these weapons into the hands of the ukrainians quickly before there were more civilian deaths recorded before there was more destruction of key infrastructure if the administration does not do this I fear as winter sets in more and more ukrainians will be forced to leave their communities compounding the humanitarian crisis that's already there as you know there are six and a half million people displaced internally in Ukraine already over seven million people probably close to eight who are outside of Ukraine is displaced individuals in places like Poland throughout the EU even the United States I continue to urge the Bible Administration to take a more assertive approach on Military assistance in general there are about 50 countries helping Ukraine on the military side all the free world is stepping up to help but America leads and we need to provide Ukraine with more of the weapons that Ukraine says they actually need like the Patriot missiles but also they've asked for fourth generation fighter jets like the F-16 or similar European models they're in Europe already we've provided them to European countries but we have to sign off for the European countries or other countries to provide them to Ukraine they want modern main battle tags like the Abrams tank that is made in my home state of Ohio they want more long-range missiles like the attackers missiles that can be fired through these what are called highmars launchers and would give Russian soldiers few places to hide in the illegally occupied territory when I visited the region in March and again in May in August and in November I got to meet a lot of these displaced people in Ukraine and hear their harrowing stories we read a world food U.N site in Kiev in our last trip and there were a lot of refugees there displaced people internally displaced people from Ukraine who were getting the basics just to be able to survive and many of them sat down with us and talked and two women told me one of these harrowing stories it was about a young man who was tortured tortured by his Russian occupiers and this was near the city of harkiv and taken to the main square and tied up on the main Square and then when he wouldn't answer whatever questions they were asking him he was taken down below into a dungeon basically a basement and they found these basement Chambers all over Ukraine where there was occupied territory the young man actually survived miraculously but he was in terrible shape when he came out but his mother didn't survive The Angst and the anxiety and the despair that she felt about her son resulted in her death these women were telling this with tears streaming down their cheeks and of course we were crying too but that's happening all over Ukraine these war crimes Behind Enemy Lines uh in occupied territories revealing every time there's a Liberation it's positive there's a Liberation but then you get this negative which is this is what happened to these people so we really don't know the extent of the atrocities in the war crimes because there's still so much territory that is occupied by Russia anyway these people have seen death and destruction that no person should have to experience some of my constituents in Ohio have been very helpful they know some of these refugees they have personal connections again family or friends and so they have helped and from Northeast Ohio where we have a big Ukrainian community Marta luchineski of the United Ukrainian organizations of Ohio and Andy futay of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America they are presidents of those organizations they've both jumped in with both feet and helped medwish which is a great organization up in Cleveland has provided a lot of medical equipment they've provided everything clothes medicine any kind of help for these refugees they provided armor vests from law enforcement all over Ohio as an example to the territorial Defense Forces so God bless them they're doing what they can to help but unless we intervene with better ways to defend the air there'll be more and more of these displaced people and more and more humanitarian needs so on that front in addition to the possible news about the Patriot missile system from yesterday I was also pleased to hear President Biden and president zielinski spoke over the weekend about the need for increased support for Ukraine on Friday the administration announced another 275 million dollars in military assistance including more ammunition for those High Mars missile launchers we talked about and other systems that will counter Russian and Iranian drones there are dozens of allies who have provided military assistance we're not doing this alone but U.S leadership has been key by the way the 20 heimar's High Mobility artillery rocket systems that are in Ukraine have all survived not a single one has been taken out by the Russians it's amazing and the ukrainians have been quite resourceful to make that happen and thank God we still have those weapons Germany and the UK have also provided some of these weapons and they're making a huge difference on the battlefield the long range and high Precision of these weapons has enabled the ukrainians to strike deep within the occupied territories to be able to disrupt Russian Logistics and command and control centers that's made the big difference that's how hairson was taken was they cut off the supply chain to hear someone to the point that these soldiers these Russian soldiers could not continue to hold the city and continue with their atrocities it's no wonder by the way that highmars are popular in Ukraine in fact when I was there the embassy staff sent out for some takeout food the food came back in a bag it was hamburgers and on the bag was crawled thank you for the high Mars from a restaurant worker I'm also told that highmars is now a popular name for Ukrainian newborns they're naming their children after the weapons provided by this body because they're making a huge difference in Saving Lives in addition to the Patriot missiles we've got to continue to provide ukraines with other air defense systems like the mid-range nasums system that they're starting to provide but also cost effective electronic warfare systems that would enable Ukraine to defend its Skies over the long term those can be very effective against drones as you can imagine you know we've seen this before in 1940 the people of Great Britain suffered under a relentless bombardment from Nazi aircraft remember they tried to bomb London into the Stone Age and at the time many thought well this is going to be the end of Great Britain you can't push back against these Nazis but the Brits were Resolute they were defiant and eventually the Royal Air Force defeated Hitler's Onslaught against innocent civilians and what's called the Battle of Britain and ensured that the country would survive the war and of course the United States got engaged we went on to win that conflict today just as then there's another indiscriminate bombing campaign going on this time in Ukraine against civilians and civilian infrastructure Ukraine is now fighting its own Battle of Britain we've got to be sure we're there with them to provide them what they need to survive their battle I was also pleased to learn this week that the European Union proposed a new round of sanctions if it is agreed to by the member of States I hope it will be this package of sanctions would ban exports of drone engines to Russia and also include other prohibitions that will hopefully stifle Russia's ability to supply its military this is very important my view it should have happened a long time ago but let's do it now let's cut off the ability for Russia to be able to repair and recreate the drones that are getting destroyed by the ukrainians let's be sure that we're not giving the Russians what they need to continue its War Machine Russia's assault by the way is not just limited to bombs and missiles but I'm hearing more and more about mines according to reports Russian forces have now endangered up to 65 000 square miles of Ukrainian territory with landmines the United States is partnering with our Ukrainian allies to demine that area this Aid has come in the form of training and Equipment as well as U.S funded contractors and demining teams so in areas where the mines are on the Ukrainian side of the line we are actively trying to help this is an important step in my view it's kind of the first step toward Ukrainian reconstruction when Russia resorts to these cowardly missile attacks on civilian targets Ukraine has responded in kind with precise strikes on Russian military targets so Russia attacking civilian targets ukrainians responding with targeted attacks on Russian military targets for example explosions have occurred here this is Ukraine this is the occupied area explosions have occurred deep in Russian territory here what are those areas well these are Russian air bases deep inside Russian territory but they are home to the bombers that have been targeting civilian infrastructure and killing Ukrainian civilians with cruise missiles over the past couple of months as the UK Ministry of Defense reported last week these may be and I quote some of the most strategically significant failures of force protection since Russia's invasion of Ukraine end quote over the weekend Ukraine launched a series of highmar strikes on the russian-occupied city of which is here including a strike on Russian military Barracks that reportedly killed a lot of the Wagner mercenaries this is in this area here America has been blessed with big white oceans on our East and to our West and friendly neighbors to our North and our South it's hard for us to grasp what they're going through it's hard for us to grasp what it's like to have a war ravage your Homeland and force you to leave your home Russia's atrocities and clear human rights violations against civilians is one compelling reason why supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do and I hope this week in this chamber we will once again Provide support for Ukraine but another reason is the death and destruction is not likely to end in Ukraine Vladimir Putin is on record as saying the borders of Russia have no end he and his senior officials have also talked about recreating the old Soviet Empire they have said that Ukraine is just the first step I will tell you other countries in Eastern Europe get that and they're understandably quite nervous that's why they've stepped up big time to help Ukraine that's why they've increased their own military spending that's why they've expanded their military cooperation with the United States think of Poland Slovakia Romania Hungary Lithuania Latvia Estonia they're all doing that Finland and Sweden certainly understand how dangerous Russia has become which is why they have now decided they're going to join NATO after years of neutrality Finland and Sweden in my view the only way to get Vladimir Putin to back off and to negotiate an end to this ruthless and senseless war is to continue to demonstrate Unity among free Nations to tighten the sanctions on the Russian economy and to continue to help Ukraine win on the battlefield that's how this thing ends through success U.S leadership and assistance is key to that strategy I'm not advocating a blank check by the way I hope nobody is I believe there needs to be accountability for the assistance that we provide and there is there's accountability on the state aid there's accountability on the humanitarian aid and there's accountability on the military aid I've seen it in action in meeting with 101st Airborne in Poland how they have end use monitoring of the equipment we're sending the ukrainians themselves want to have transparency they understand how important that is that's why they have Deloitte Cincinnati or a a American accounting firm involved in monitoring and providing reports that's why we're running our assistance through the World Bank where they're auditing and Reporting back to us that's important to do but the alternative to helping Ukraine to me is unthinkable what would have happened if the United States had said we're not going to help here and the rest of the world have said well if the Americans aren't going to step forward and provide some leadership we're not going to either I first of all it's clear to all of us this country would be occupied by Russia Today and even if Russia didn't go ahead and move into all these other countries they say they're going to move into that Ukraine is just the first step and they want to recreate the Empire or the Soviet Union even if it was just Ukraine and they stopped at the Ukrainian borders suddenly you'd have three NATO countries that have a border with Russia who do not now and really a fourth because all Poland has is a very small out Outpost of Russia here so you'd suddenly have NATO countries United States and Article 5 is committed to protecting with aggressive Russia on its border we would be mobilizing thousands of Hoops we would have massive amounts of weapons at the borders of these NATO allies at a tremendous cost to the United States taxpayer is that a better alternative than helping give Ukraine the tools they need to be able to do their own fighting which has been successful up to now more successful than anyone could have imagined finally I would say allowing an authoritarian regime to take over an ally and a democracy with impunity that sounds exactly the wrong message to the rest of the world at a time we can least afford to have that happen think about China I am potential military assault in Taiwan think about our Ally Israel as they continue to face threats from Iran and others in the Middle East both our adversaries and our allies are watching to see if the United States and our allies will help maintain that post-world War II World Order or whether it's each country for itself and if it's each country for itself because we aren't helping in Ukraine the militarization around the world increases dramatically as do the nuclear weapons Ukraine just wants to live in peace with its neighbors including Russia but when attacked by Russian missiles and drones Ukraine has fought to ensure that the flame of Freedom here is not going to go out from visits I can say with certainly that they will never give up and we must not give up on them the Ukrainian people tasted Freedom when they embarked on their own revolution of dignity as they call it back in 2014 they threw off a russian-backed corrupt government and instead embraced the West the European Union the United States of America Freedom democracy free markets Ukraine chose to stand with us with Europe United States and other free Nations the SE is not the time for the United States and its allies to stand down so for my current colleagues and the Senators just elected I urge you let's continue our support for Ukraine in this worthy cause of protecting freedom thank you not yield the floor

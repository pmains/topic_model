so today's speech in south carolina comes after the president's whopper of a news conference yesterday one of the many important moments that happened included this exchange between the president and journalist april ryan about the congressional black caucus listen are you going to include the cbc mr president in your conversations with your your urban agenda your inner city agenda as well as am i going to include are you going to include the congressional black caucus and the congressional well i would i tell you what do you want to set up the meeting do you want to set up the meeting no no no are they friends of yours set up i know some of them but i'm sure let's go set up a meeting i would love to meet with the black caucus i think it's great the congressional black office i think it's great after that the congressional black caucus actually tweeted this message to the president we sent you a letter on january 19th but you never wrote back sad hours later the cbc did say that the white house has reached out and reached out in an appropriate manner that's the way they put it to request a meeting joining me now is democratic congressman from new jersey a member of the congressional black caucus donald payne jr congressman thanks so much for the time well thank you for having me you had a pretty strong reaction to that press conference moment why well you know it uh just was dumbfounding to watch what transpired yesterday at that press conference a member of the press uh asking a a a routine question of an organization that has been around in the congress for over 40 years and the president even not really sure he understood who miss ryan was talking about and she had to you know clarify that was the congressional black caucus when everyone referenced us as the cbc and he wasn't sure and to ask her to set up the meeting as if she's some conduit between the congressional black caucus and the president the administration uh was uh absurd absurd is it is this something you take issue of the president's non-traditional style or do you think this is something more a non-traditional style i think it's in in ignorance of of where uh who the player in this town and um having to deal with the congress i mean you know he's been continuing to write executive orders and it appears that's how he's going to function as president but at some point in time he's going to have to deal with the members of congress and the congressional black caucus is 40 members 49 members strong in the democratic caucus so we are a large we are a quarter of the democratic caucus so we have an influence on policy in this nation and for him not to even have an idea or clue of who that organized organization is is where i come on the side of absurdity so it looks like a meeting is now in the works in some way what is the singular most important thing that you want to be addressed in the meeting with president trump when he meets with the caucus well it's interesting that you know we sent a a letter on january 19th to the president um formal means and um you know no response at all uh whereas president obama within the first month of um his presidency sat down with the cbc and so you know as you showed uh prior to us starting we had to tweet the president in order to get a response so you know our letter talked about this program he has for the inner cities and african americans in this country and our letter uh talks about how we think that we might be able to help him in a progressive way do something that is positive in the african community since many of us represent um those areas very much looking forward to hearing how that how that meeting goes when that meeting is and what happens in the aftermath congressman donald payne thank you so much for your time thank you for having me

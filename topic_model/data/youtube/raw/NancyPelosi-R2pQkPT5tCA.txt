here we are about to leave for the holy season of Easter and Passover it reminds me of the Gospel of Matthew which possible as Matthew says for where your treasure is there your heart will be also this budget is a statement as to where our treasure is and where our hearts are for the American people a budget as our distinguished ranking member said must be a statement of our national values what is important to us as a nation should be reflected in our spending priorities in our treasure but you be the judge I want to say to the American people but the speaker will not allow me to address the American people so their representatives here is it a statement of your national values of our country to give a two-hundred-thousand-dollar tax break to people making over a million dollars a year at the expense of a cutting crew increasing taxes of two thousand dollars for the middle classes at a statement of our values I don't think is a statement of our values in order to finance the special interest of privilege that is in the Republican budget is the statement of your values to cut over 170,000 children from head start is that a statement of our values children learning parents earning opportunity fairness is it a statement of your values to support a budget that says three and a half million chip in our country disadvantaged children and economically disadvantaged areas will have cuts in the budget of title one is that a statement of our values in order to give tax breaks to big oil is it a statement of our values to say to aspiring family some of the first in their families to be able to go to college that we're going to cut over half a million maybe over 600,000 kids from head start is that a statement of values to say to over half a million young people you will not have opportunity to have higher education instead we're going to give that same amount of money to Big Oil for tax incentives for them to drill is that a statement of our values I don't think so I don't think so so where is their treasure and where is their heart the treasure in this Republican budget is what just is what our ranking member said is with a special interest and the wealthiest people in our country it is a trickle-down approach that has never worked it's worked for the rich it's work for the special interest and their supporters but it has not worked for the great middle class do we need any more evidence of it not working that the same warmed-over policies that existed in the Bush era that took us to the Great Recession a Great Recession where we met a right before the election and September of 2008 with a sec the chairman of the Fed said to us if we do not act immediately we will not have an economy by Monday this is a Thursday night that's where these policies took us at the end of the Bush years and we're still digging out of that recession and instead of having a budget that lifts us up to create jobs to create growth to invest in science and education to keep America number one they call their budget a pastor press star it is a road to recession it always has been and that is what it is now and that is what it is now so at least we have a few minutes to discuss our value system where our treasure is with the richest and the special interest or with a great middle class and those who aspire to it and therefore where our heart is in terms of budget priorities in this budget and this is an important budget some people want to dismiss it as a joke because it's so outrageous it's deadly serious it isn't funny at all because of the impact that it has in the lives of America's families our children our seniors voucher izing Medicare removing the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors is that a statement of our values to say to our seniors you are on your own you are on your own I don't think so so if our heart is with the middle class we will put our treasure there and investments in education and job creation investments in science not just clothes again I started with the Bible science if it research gives us an almost biblical power to cure where there is scientific opportunity we almost have a moral responsibility certainly a moral offer of imperative to invest in it to improve health to improve the quality of health in our country to make sure that everybody has access to it but don't worry about the access to it because our investments our investments in basic scientific research are seriously impaired by this budget it does violence to any concept of science that that keeps innovation making America number one advancing innovation investments in science and technology undermining investment we protect our environment so our children can breathe clean air and drink clean water about how we protect our America by investments in science and technology to do so and and the intelligence to to avoid conflicts to avoid and and the investments in job creation that science will will enable us to do so if you believe in knowledge if you would believe in fact if you believe in the middle class you must reject the Republican budget you must reject the Republican budget what the Republican leadership is asking members to do is something that I don't know that they share that value certainly Republicans across the country do not Republicans across the country support education investments in science and the rest any poll will show you that and just one other thing if you really want to reduce the deficit one of the fastest ways you can do it is to have a budget that does as ours does include comprehensive immigration reform which reduces reduces the deficit by nine hundred million dollars 900 with Abby billion dollars according to the Congressional Budget Office so by reason of treasure by reason of heart by reason of values by reason of ethics by reason of honoring our responsibilities of to the American people a good strong no on the Ryan Republican budget it's a path to ruin it is not a path to prosperity mr. Van Hollen's budget is a budget about growth about investment about keeping America number one about strengthening the middle class which is the backbone of our democracy thank you all vote no on this earth you

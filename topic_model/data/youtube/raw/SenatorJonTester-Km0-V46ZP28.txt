you talked in your opening statement about the national treasure that our public lands are and you said that toady or Teddy Roosevelt was you were Teddy Roosevelt Republican you said that before I've already say it before I appreciate it Teddy Roosevelt was one of the people that I really looked up to what has made Teddy Roosevelt an icon is his ability to come into an area that was almost all wild and realized that it wouldn't always be that way unless he did things like set up parks and and and so that vision is what really I think sets Teddy Roosevelt apart from just about any other president that served when it comes to our public lands which brings me to the land water conservation fund the fund that has been fully funded twice since 1978 when it was first set up at nine hundred million dollars off of offshore oil your budget puts in 8.1 million and from the questions that senator danes had just asked your statement to him was is you didn't want to bring more land in to the public lands domain because there's a maintenance problem did I miss hear you on that or is that correct is that why we're at eight point 1 million the land water conservation act removes the the proposed budget removes new acquisition does not remove properties that would come in to conservation easements but it does prioritize what we have you know what upfront as you know the budget is a proposal and this is where the two branches come together I got you and and discuss priorities yeah and I've always worked with the on on land water conservation and I appreciate that mr. secretary and we the chairwoman talked about Tara Sweeney taro Sweeney yesterday here's the problem the problem is is that we all come from different parts of the world public lands is a Western thing truly is and for people to really understand here how important this is we've got to have an advocate in the administration that's you to be able to say you know what 8.1 when it should be fun at night or main because I know in your heart that's where you think it should be funded and don't let me put that in your heart unless it really is in your heart but we've got to have a person that stands up and says oh come on now so did is 8.1 let's just be honest I mean what was the justification for that are there no projects nationwide or there you know because because the truth is as easy Co systems aren't going to be around in 10 or 20 years take Roosevelt they were gonna be around in 10 or 20 years when he when he toured the country but now they're not and we're seeing lands being sold and checkerboards being taken away off a decade so I just want to get your opinion because it's really important that Secretary of Interior understands it it's not all on us some of it is good portions on you know and I agree it takes working together on it and I've been an advocate of a land Water Conservation Fund I'm also an advocate is we need to address or eleven point seven billion dollar backlog in our parks and then our 1.2 billion our billion dollars in our wildlife produce and over the way parks and and even though in the West we think that all the public land is out west it's really not we have great public land battlefields you on the East Coast that also need to be maintained so the priority this budget is infrastructure repair backlog so that bring and bring a discussion between the two groups that brings me to my next question and that is that the revenue for rebuilding the national parks is not going to be taxpayer dollars it's going to come off of all energy projects similar to lwc f LW CF is funded at a penton's eight million when it should be 900 million why should we think that this proposal is going to be any different if it's going to be similar to lwc f well the proposal which is bipartisan was also a recommendation from numerous commission studies I gotcha and it also expands it and the idea is this it is a sound and prudent policy it's fun if it's done and LW CF is a sound and prudent policy to to take off shore drilling revenues and put 900 million towards this project in 1978 dollars and they're not near near as much now as they were in 78 and we're funding it I don't know one percent of what it should be and this is why there's two branches of government and why I'm committed to work with you on it good appreciate that now I want to talk about rural water projects is this an issue the senator Dane's also brought up and he said 50 million dollars for Blackfeet water settlement to take into impact use his numbers we've got project in north-central Montana we got a project in northeastern Montana when I was first elected to the state legislature in 1998 these were a hundred million dollar projects total now they're north of three hundred million dollar projects total FY 17 there was eighty four point six million which wasn't near enough in that thing in FY 18 there's 120 million which isn't near enough your proposal is thirty three point nine black feets going to require 50 in and of itself each year moving forward we've got north central water project that's 75 percent unfinished that's going to get just under four million dollars how can this budget be we're talking water infrastructure we're talking about living up to our trust responsibilities we're talking about making sure that these projects get built in my grandkids lifetime because at this rate they're not how do we justify this kind of a budget figure so what happened and why are we here this was the great promise to the Bureau of Reclamation now as the government would come in make significant investment because the local ranchers and farmers could not did not have the ability and then over time the water districts would pay those projects off and the title the wind would be transferred the problem is Bureau of Reclamation rarely transferred those titles so we're in the process of transferring I think well over 300 of these titles to free up maintenance money so we can maintain our obligations and this didn't happen overnight and this wasn't the last administration this has been decades you're right but this is the lowest number we've seen that I've seen in ten and a half eleven eleven and a half years that I've been here it's the lowest number and these are Indian water settlements they're not irrigation projects of this is trust responsibility to the other communities get an opportunity to take advantage this you bet they do and it's good because it's good for rural America these projects will never be built there isn't enough money in this budget to take care of operations and maintenance much less putting pipe in the ground and the budget does include about a hundred and seventy three million dollars for any in compacts understand yeah the obligations far exceed that and we also have to remove our overhead and our legacy projects and transfer those titles that will be significant to put more money into places where where it's needed rather than to continue to march on and not transfer this beneath titles thank you for being here these projects won't get done unless there's a real money in them it's just not transferring all that stuff not gonna happen unless there's money in the accounts whether it's El WCF whether it's Native American Water settlements I didn't even get into manpower those are big issues thank you for service thank you sir Thank You senator tester senator capital

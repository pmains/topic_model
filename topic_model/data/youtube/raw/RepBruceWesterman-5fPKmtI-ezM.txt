without objection the gentleman is recognized for one minute madam Speaker I rise today to celebrate our nation's parks this July marks the 34th annual Park and Recreation month a celebration highlighting the incredible opportunities and benefits that Park and Recreation agencies provide to their communities I like many are Kansans grew up enjoying everything that the natural state has to offer from hiking and hunting in its forests to swimming fishing and boating on its crystal-clear lakes and rivers outdoor recreation is an essential part of life for the families of my state some of my favorite memories of life were made outside in the beautiful outdoors of Arkansas and I'm blessed to still be making similar memories today our Park and Recreation agencies are important part of our history and offer much to the quality of our future Theodore Roosevelt once said it is an incalculable added pleasure to anyone's sum of happiness if he or she grows to know even slightly and imperfectly how to read and enjoy the wonder book of nature as a forester and lifelong lover of nature the wonder book of nature has always been fascinating to me and I hope to motivate people to get out and enjoy the natural beauty around them in the words of the fictional sitcom character Leslie Knope America is awesome I encourage everyone to go outside with friends and family to enjoy all the awesomeness our parks have to offer I yield back

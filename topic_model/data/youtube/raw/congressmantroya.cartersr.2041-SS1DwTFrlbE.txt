MR. CARTER: MADAM CHAIR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. LAST YEAR, HURRICANE IDA SWEPT THROUGH MY STATE LEAVING IT IN ITS WAKE A SHAKING, SHOCKING, TERRIBLE PATH OF DESTRUCTION. THIS BODY SAW THE DEVASTATION OF THIS STORM AND SAW FIT TO MAKE IMMEDIATE DOWN PAYMENTS SO THAT RECOVERY COULD BEGIN IN LOUISIANA AS WE ASSESSED THE INCREDIBLE DAMAGE. IMPLIED IN THAT DOWN PAYMENT WAS A COMMITMENT TO COME BACK AND TO DO MORE WHEN LOUISIANA DETERMINED ITS ACTUAL NEED. MY STATE, AND MANY PEOPLE, ARE HERE ASKING THIS BODY TO KEEP ITS COMMITMENT. DISASTER KNOWS NO BOUNDARY. IT CAN AND WILL HIT ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS UNEXPECTEDLY. I PROMISE TO BE WITH YOU WHEN IT DOES. TODAY, I NEED THIS BODY TO STAND WITH ME AND PASS ADDITIONAL HURRICANE RELIEF FUNDING SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA CAN FULLY RECOVERER. I URGE T

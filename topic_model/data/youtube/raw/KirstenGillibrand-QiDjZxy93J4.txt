how are you going to expand access to sexual and reproductive health care including abortion to ensure people like me and my clients have access to care no matter what thank you for sharing your story thank you for sharing your truth with all of us I think your story is one that's shared by millions of people around this country and for poor women for black women for marginalized women I think this attack on their freedoms undermines their humanity and their ability to have that understanding that they have basic human rights and that they have a constitutional protection because no legislature in any one of these states which are mostly white men mostly older men they cannot know a minute of your experience not a minute of your experience as a mother not a minute of your experience as someone has to make that decision not a minute experience that you were this close to putting your life in your own hands throwing yourself down the stairs could mean death for all those friends and and patients of yours who are saying I'm gonna drink turpentine it could mean death women are desperate and we deserve constitutional protections it's why I will lead on repealing Hyde it's why I will make sure poor marginalized and black women have the same reproductive freedoms as any person it's why I will not allow male legislators around this country to make those life-and-death decisions for you and I it is why I will make sure that I will guarantee reproductive freedom for every woman every transgender woman and and every non-conforming individual who needs these basic human civil rights [Applause]

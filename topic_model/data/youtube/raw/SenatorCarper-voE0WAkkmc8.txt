it wasn't that long ago i think people uh felt that trains were a relic of the past maybe the the last century and not so relevant in the 21st century that's beginning to change rather dramatically uh ridership at amtrak is up this year by roughly 15 revenues that amtrak were up by over 15 uh this this year and i think there are a number of factors that are contributing to one is obviously the cost of gasoline another is people are tired of being stuck in traffic driving there's congestion on our highways there's congestion in our airports and and the other problem i think we're concerned that uh our earth is getting warmer and we know that the exhaust from our cars trucks and vans and from our airplanes contribute a lot to that so a whole host of reasons that people are starting to take the train i call it the civilized way to travel the other thing in terms of fuel efficiency can move a freight a ton of freight from washington dc to boston massachusetts with one gallon of diesel fuel pretty amazing one gallon of diesel fuel so that's in a day and age when gas is what 360 a buck that's pretty good well there are over 500 train stations passenger train stations across the country out of all those railroad stations the one that's the 11th busiest is is wilmington it's the station just celebrated its 100th anniversary we're going to kick off this summer a major uh facelift for the train station outside and inside it's going to take a couple of years to do it and we'll have a beautiful beautiful train station as a result the train station is really kind of the hub of the riverfront our revitalization in the city of wilmington as it turns out other cities down richmond not long ago they have a brand new train station the train stations are becoming a center for urban redevelopment it's exciting they're beautiful it's exciting to see this happen

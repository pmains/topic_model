senator to lay this out for folks at home the chinese about 300 acres of farmland land near grand forks it uh happens to be 12 miles from the grand forks air base the land will ostensibly be used to build a 700 million dollar corn milling plant but that air base is a center for intelligence that's where they operate a lot of the global hawk drones from are you concerned here about either espionage or interference i am john and thank you for doing a very good job and thorough job of explaining the situation i am worried about it because china has proven themselves to be both capable and more than willing to steal intellectual property to intercept data they're very good at it and um grand forks is not only an important isr base it's a it's a reconnaissance wing as you said flies a global hawk we recently cut the ribbon on a new satellite ground station for low earth orbiting satellites that will soon be providing communications in the in the sky and and the future of the grad forest air force base is that the global hawks will will eventually be traded out for the next generation of isr flying vehicle unmanned aerial systems so it's a very important base but even in addition to that on the farm side we see china continually buying up more and more of the u.s food supply chain now we grow a lot more food than we consume we're happy to sell it to hungry people around the world we're very good at that but when the supply chain becomes more captive not only to foreign ownership but to foreign adversaries like china who have demonstrated that they're that they're not to be trusted with supply chains i mean we just went through a pandemic that exposed a lot of that i'm just not very comfortable with with the the chinese communist party for so much of our lives because food supply energy supply pharmaceutical supplies those are all that's all part of national security well i mean you have to kind of sit back and go well wait china's a major buyer of just about everything right i mean you think about almost every commodity on the planet and china's a buyer and a lot they buy a lot of the resources that we provide right here farmland is interesting obviously because it would give them access to key spaces here in the united states there's bipartisan concern about this obviously as you well know senator mark warner your democratic colleague is saying the senate intelligence committee has been loudly sounding the alarm about counter intelligence threat posed by the prc we should be seriously concerned he said about chinese investment in locations close to sensitive sites such as military bases around the united states what are next steps if you think this is such a concern how do you stop it well there's a few ways but you know a lot of this came to light when senators rubio hoeven and i requested that the accipheus review cyphus being the committee on foreign investment in the united states so we sent a letter to the committee's chairman which is of course janet yellen that the secretary of the interior or secretary of treasury is the chair of the committee it's made up of about 14 cabinet and white house officials and in a lot of the intelligence and and uh law enforcement security agencies and so they'll do a review they'll identify major concerns minor concerns maybe there's no concern my guess is there are lots of them and then that that will help inform local uh developers and local officials and if that shows enough concerns that there might be more specific risks they can further review it look for risk factors and then ultimately if there are risks that aren't being mitigated or can't be mitigated and the president feels strongly enough he can actually through that that same cipheous process he can actually unwind the transaction i personally don't believe that will be necessary i'm fairly confident that there will be a lot of concerns raised by intelligence and defense and security uh forces and that those will be heard at the local level one thing this community of grand forks did a wonderful job of putting in guard rails and clawback sandra you know you're a business reporter you understand how um you know communities have to protect themselves from from the type of predatory investing that china has proven to be very good at they've protected themselves and their assets very well so i'm confident this will all turn out well and at the end we'll have a unified uh community that supports the final decision so senator kramer you and your republican colleagues in the senate have got a lot of concerns about this as does senator warner but north dakota's republican governor says what's the problem here he says this is going to be good for north dakota doug burgum said quote with fufung in grand forks it will be north dakota not china that reaps the benefit of the jobs facilities economic activity and tax revenue associated with processing the corn what do you say to him well if china doesn't benefit from an investment in north dakota why would they make an investment in north dakota would be my first question obviously china benefits from this and when you see that what they do with their money in terms of economic dominance in terms of upgrading their own military they they as you know are excellent at technology transfer forcing of intellectual property theft and with that they've advanced their own hypersonic missile systems and and other high-tech defenses so china benefits from it now you can both benefit there's no question the governor's absolutely right about that but the china of today has turned out to be a very nefarious china i think rather than than inviting them into our backyard we had to have a more more of a strategic decoupling of our relationship with china work closer with our allies and and western uh nations and other asian nations to share our values rather than having a partner so close to us that we can't trust uh senator really appreciate you joining us on that all of that something that might not be on a lot of folks radar but it is happening and you are raising the flag of red flag about it thank you very much strategic decoupling sounds like a gwyneth paltrow marriage

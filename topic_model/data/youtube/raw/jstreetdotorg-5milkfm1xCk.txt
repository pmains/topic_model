I think we're in friendly territory thank you very much and let me and let me provide greetings to all of you from around the United States from Europe and especially those who have come from Israel and Palestine welcome and it is an honor to be with you today I also want to give a special greeting to many of the students who and as I travel around the country I have to say that when we talk about the future of the United States I am very confident given the young people that I have seen their energy and their idealism is going to make this country become what it must become thank your young people and I want to thank you for inviting me to address your conference today and for the courage that you have shown in tackling some enormous ly contentious issues now more than ever we need organizations like J Street who are prepared to break with failed policies of the past which have led us into a world of increased militarism hatred and never-ending Wars too often our foreign policy debate here in Washington is dominated by those whose answer is to drop more bombs as we saw in Syria a few days ago rather than engage in the hard work of diplomacy and negotiation and I want you to think about this but after 17 years of war in Afghanistan after 15 years of war in Iraq after years of growing hostility and armed conflict between Israel and the Palestinians after growing tensions between Sunni and Shia forces throughout the entire region after the expenditure of trillions of dollars and massive loss of life and displacement it is clear that we need a new direction in attempting to bring priests stability and justice to the Middle East and I applaud applaud J Street for the important role that they are playing in that process my friends the issues that we are dealing with are enormous ly complicated nobody I know has any simple or magical answers to them and real solutions will require a great deal of hard work but what I do know is that the United States of America our great country should lead the world with a foreign policy which emphasizes the need to bring nations together which focuses on diplomacy and international cooperation rather than a foreign policy that is committed to the use of military force [Applause] and let me also say this as someone who believes absolutely and unequivocally in Israel's right to exist and to exist in peace and security as someone who as a young man lived in Israel for a number of months and is very proud of his Jewish heritage as someone who is deeply concerned about the global rise of anti-semitism and all forms of racism we must say loudly and clearly that to oppose the reactionary policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu does not make us anti Israel [Applause] I would like to stress today that one of the places where a new turn tour diplomacy and cooperation is desperately needed is Gaza after being blockaded for over a decade the situation in Gaza is now a humanitarian disaster a 2012 UN report predicted that if current trends continued Gaza would become unlivable a follow-up report last year said that day might have already come according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem quote the coastal aquifer which Gaza relies on as its primary salt water source has been polluted by over pumping and wastewater contamination as a result 96 percent of the water pumped from the aquifer and supplied for domestic use in Gaza is unsafe to drink end of quote according to Oxfam this water pollution is among the factors causing a dramatic increase in kidney problems among causes residents according to the World Bank nearly 80 percent of Gaza residents receive some form of humanitarian aid unemployment is over 40 percent among the young people it is even higher nearly 60 percent and let me repeat that youth unemployment in Gaza today is nearly 60 percent it is hard for me to imagine how peace and stability will come to an area where so many young people have given up hope for a decent future this is an issue we must address [Applause] earlier this year Israeli security officials warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza increases the chance of incidents at the border fence turning deadly Israeli security officials also believe conditions in Gaza could worsen to the point of a total collapse of order in that territory leading to all-out confrontation between and among various factions within Gaza and with Israel that is what happens when people are desperate and have no options there is much blame to go around for the horrific conditions in Gaza Hamas due to its ongoing repression corruption and insistence on pursuing a violent struggle against Israel bears significant responsibility whether the generating situation Israel is to blame as well [Applause] while Israel withdrew its forces from within Gaza in 2005 its continuing control of Gaza Zaire sea and northern southern and eastern borders and it's restrictions on the freedom of movement of people and legitimate goods and equipment in and out of Gaza have made the humanitarian crisis there even worse Egypt and the Palestinian Authority have also contributed to this problem as has the United States now as all of us know over the past weeks there have been a series of large demonstrations by the Palestinian people in Gaza tens of thousands of people have demonstrated near the fence dividing Gaza from Israel to protest against the blockade against the occupation and for the right to return to their former homes inside Israel Israeli forces were commanded to respond by opening fire on the crowd with a combination of live ammunition and rubber-coated bullets over the past several weeks over 30 Palestinians have been killed including a journalist who was clearly identified and well over a thousand demonstrators have been injured though the overwhelming majority of these protesters were nonviolent we know that some of them were not and when Israeli soldiers are in danger we can all agree that they have a right to defend themselves [Applause] but I don't think that any objective person can disagree that Israel has massively overreacted to these demonstrations [Applause] as a New York Times editorial put it last week and I quote the right of Palestinians to demonstrate peacefully should not be controversial journalists have a right to work and people have a right to demonstrate peacefully and to assume and this is the New York Times and to assume that responsible authorities will ensure that they can do so without being shot end of quote I support a statement last week from several of my colleagues in the House of Representatives calling on Palestinians to protest peacefully and on Israel to fully comply with international law and exercise the utmost restraint in their use of deadly force [Applause] I understand that the Netanyahu government is trying to make this all about Hamas in order to deal Ajith Oh mais any opposition to the blockade and the occupation the presence of Hamas members among a crowd of tens of thousands does not justify the level of violence we saw and frankly it is amazing to me than anyone would find that point of view controversial I have condemned Hamas as use of terrorist violence and will continue to do so but that violence cannot excuse shooting of unarmed protesters and it cannot excuse trapping almost two million people inside of Gaza [Applause] in my view the United States must play a more aggressive and even-handed role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all and if the white house is unable to do that Congress must take the lead and let me make a point now that is much too rarely made because what we're talking about is something that is extremely complicated and the blame goes all over this world but what we should also be focusing on is that while we rightfully criticize the Netanyahu government for its obstructionism and for its unwillingness to seriously negotiate with Palestinians we must also demand that the incredibly wealthy regional States and kingdoms in the area play a new and much more positive role in helping to rebuild Gaza and bring stability to the region [Applause] now we don't talk we don't talk about this a lot but I read a story the other day about the crown prince of Saudi Arabia he was as you know just in the United States for visit and you might have seen one of the 50 different TV and newspaper interviews that he did well in any case as I understand it the Crown Prince recently purchased a $500 million yacht 500 million-dollar yacht because he thought it it looked nice well I'm sure that it did look nice and I am sure that the 300 million dollar mansion that he owns the wealthiest most expensive mansion in the world that also looks nice but what I say to the crown prince and the other multi billionaire leaders in the region stop just talking about the poverty and misery in Gaza do something about it [Applause] I read I read the other day that the Saudi King pledged 50 million dollars to Unruh which is the UN agency that works with Palestinian refugees and 50 million dollars is not a small sum of money but let us not forget that that is 10% of what the crowd parents paid for his yacht [Applause] the problem of Gaza clearly is only one part of the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and here I am very concerned about the policy of the Trump administration regarding the two-state solution I know that this week my friends in Israel will observe your Memorial Day the remembrance of those who have fallen in defense of the State of Israel and we honor those who have flown my friends I believe that the best way to honor the memories of those who have died in defense of our countries is to strive for a future of peace [Applause] when I look at the Middle East I see our ally Israel making enormous technological advances with the capacity to serve as an engine of innovation and prosperity for the entire region that is what the future must be yet they are unable to achieve this today because of the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians and I see a Palestinian people crushed underneath a military occupation now in its fiftieth year creating a daily reality of pain humiliation and resentment ending that occupation and enabling the Palestinians to have independence and self-determination in a sovereign economically viable state of their own is in the interest of the United States Israel the Palestinians and the entire region [Applause] unfortunately Prime Minister Netanyahu and his allies seemed to be preparing for a very different future a future in which Israel controls the entire territory between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River in perpetuity and the Palestinians are best provided limited autonomy within a disconnected series of Canton's the settlements continue to grow slowly diminishing the chances for any peaceful resolution but building more settlements will not bring peace demolishing Palestinians homes and villages will not bring peace [Applause] well last year is some of you may know I wrote a letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu although a long with nine of my Senate colleagues protesting the deeply inhumane policy of demolishing Palestinian villages and I want to take this opportunity to thank J Street for your support on this issue [Applause] frankly I wish Donald Trump was as committed as you are to the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East but to say the least that does not appear to be the case and that is an understatement even though he claims to want to make the ultimate deal that deal is now further away than it has ever been and Trust in the United States as an honest and even-handed broker is almost non-existent and one of the main reasons for that is president Trump's extremely unwise decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel [Applause] everybody knew that at some point the United States was going to make this recognition but the idea was that we would do it at the end of a process in a way that recognized the importance of Jerusalem to all people to Jews to Christians Muslims and the Palestinian people instead by recognizing only its importance to Israel president Trump has severely undermined the peace process friends let me also say that I am very concerned that the Trump administration still has not stated its support for this to state solution as a goal because if we do not have a two-state solution what will we have if Palestinians and the occupied territories ought to be denied self-determination in a state of their own will they receive full citizenship and equal rights in a single state these are very serious questions with significant implications for the United States broader regional partnerships and goals for our interests in our values we should not ever downplay the political challenges of reaching a solution they are very very difficult but if we have faith in the future if we are prepared to work hard if we are prepared to go to the negotiating table they are doable we can accomplish that goal [Applause] the truth is that the parameters of a solution are well known they are based in international law they are based in multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and they are supported by an overwhelming international consensus to States negotiated based on the 1967 lines with the gruesome as the capital of both states my friends before I end I'd like to take a moment to touch upon some new and emerging challenges our societies are now facing not just in Israel or the United States but all over the world as I think we are all aware the last several years have seen very troubling political developments and that is the rise of intolerant authoritarian political movements and governments which are attacking the very foundations of democratic rule these movements have drawn strength from the fact that at a time of increased globalization climate change exploding technology growth in a Lagasse kleptocracy and corruption massive levels of income and wealth inequality and millions of immigrants fleeing war-torn regions more and more people all over the world have come to see their governments as ineffective and not delivering for them or their children and in the midst of all of that we have leaders like President Trump and many others who are willing to exploit these frustrations for their own political and economic ends [Applause] instead of bringing us together to resolve these difficult global crises these demagogues attempt to try and divide us up by the color of our skin by the country we came from by our gender or our religion or our sexual orientation and I say to President Trump and to other leaders around the world who are using that political strategy in this country we have struggled for too many years against all forms of discrimination against African Americans against Jews against Latinos against Italians against Irish against the gay community we have struggled too long and have come too far we are not going back to bigotry and discrimination [Applause] as history has reminded us time and time again the antidote to hatred division and resentment is to bring people together around a shared vision of equality and prosperity of creating governments that work for all people not just the few the brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us in so many areas and no area for this planet is more important in terms of trying to create peaceful resolutions than is the cauldron of the Middle East so I just want to thank J Street and I want to thank all of you for having the courage to get involved in this issue and while today we look around us with deep concern I am absolutely convinced that the future will belong to those of us who believe in peace and injustice not those who believe in bigotry and hatred thank you all very much [Applause]

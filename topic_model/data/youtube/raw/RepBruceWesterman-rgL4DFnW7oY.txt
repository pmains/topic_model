Thank You member of our committee mr. Westerman for any thoughts he may have Thank You chairwoman Napolitano and thank you all for being here today this subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on Regional watershed programs and water bodies in areas that are part of EPA's national estuary program estuaries are unique and highly productive waters are important to the ecological and economic basis of our nation fisheries wildlife recreation and tourism are heavily dependent on healthy Estrin systems for example the Lake Pontchartrain basin in Louisiana is home to 22 essential habitats and his fisheries provide much of the seafood harvested along the Gulf Coast yet despite their value most estuaries in the United States have experienced stress from physical alteration and pollution often resulting from development and rapid population growth in coastal areas EPA's estuary program identifies nationally significant estuaries that are threatened by pollution land development and overuse and provides grants that support development of management plans to protect and restore them this program is designed to resolve issues at the watershed level integrate science into the decision-making process foster collaborative problem-solving and involve the public unlike many other EPA and state programs that rely on conventional top-down regulatory measures to achieve environmental goals the estuary program uses a framework that focuses on stakeholder involvement and interaction and tailoring solutions for problems that are specific to that region this approach helps achieve protection and restoration goals we need to be sure that the individual estuary programs continue to effectively implement their management plans for protecting and restoring estuaries we also need to be careful not to add new layers or programming bureaucracy on any of the programs that could divert valuable resources away from actually implementing their plans I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses today and learning about the progress that's being made in these estuaries and watersheds and I back

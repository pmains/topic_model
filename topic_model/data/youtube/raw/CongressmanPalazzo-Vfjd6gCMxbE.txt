WHO'S LONG BEEN A CHAMPION OF  THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE   PROGRAM, MR. PALAZZO.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO  MINUTES. MR. PALAZZO: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I'D LIKE TO THANK MADAM    CHAIRWOMAN FOR THE TIME. WE ARE ONE WEEK AWAY FROM JULY   31.  THAT'S SEVEN DAYS. THAT MEANS THE DEADLINE TO   RE-AUTHORIZE THE NATIONAL FLOOD  INSURANCE PROGRAM IS NEARING   VERY FAST. I'D LIKE TO THANK MR. MACARTHUR  FOR UNDERSTANDING THE  IMPORTANCE OF AVOIDING A LAPSE   IN THE NFIP PROGRAM AND FOR  INTRODUCING LEGISLATION THAT   WILL CONTINUE COVERAGE FOR   MILLIONS OF POLICYHOLDERS. WE KNOW FLOODING ALWAYS HAS  BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE   THE MOST COSTLY NATURAL  PHENOMENON HUMANITY FACES. I SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT TO  EXTEND THE NATIONAL FLOOD  INSURANCE PROGRAM THROUGH THE  END OF THE 2018 HURRICANE  SEASON AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES  TO DO THE SAME.  POLICYHOLDERS THAT RELY ON THE   PROGRAM TO ENSURE THEIR --   INSURE THEIR HOMES FROM  FLOODING SHOULD NOT BE CAUGHT  IN LIMBO WHILE CONGRESS WORKS  ON COMING TOGETHER IN A  BIPARTISAN MATTER TO   RE-AUTHORIZE THE PROGRAM.  WHILE I, ALONG WITH MANY OF MY   COLLEAGUES, SUPPORT REFORMING  THE PROGRAM, THE TIME TO ENACT   BIPARTISAN REFORMS IS GONE JUST  FOR NOW. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE  ACTION.  IF THE NFIP LAPSES,  POLICYHOLDERS WILL NOT HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO RENEW THEIR   POLICIES AND TENS OF THOUSANDS   OF HOME SALE CLOSINGS WILL BE  NELLTIVELY IMPACTED BY A LAPSE.  WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF  HURRICANE SEASON, AND A  DISRUPTION IN THE PROGRAM WILL   BE DETRIMENTAL TO MANY IN THE  UNITED STATES. IT'S OUR DUTY TO ENSURE FLOOD  INSURANCE REMAINS AFFORDABLE   AND AVAILABLE FOR OUR  CONSTITUENTS.  SINCE 1968, THIS PROGRAM HAS   HELPED PEOPLE SINCE FLOODING.  THE NFIP HAS SAVED THE   GOVERNMENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE ARE PROVIDING OUR   CONSTITUENTS THE CERTAINTY BY  SUPPORTING THIS BILL, AND I  URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME  IN VOTING TO EXTEND THE NFIP   THROUGH THE END OF THE 2018  HURRICANE SEASON.  I YIELD BACK.

mr. president I want to talk about the health care bill the health care issue and talk a bit about how we can find a solution and then what the solution should look like for the last two days as a member of the Armed Services Committee I have been in our markup and in that markup we considered somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 to 300 amendments of those 250 amendments approximately 210 of them were either we're compromised were worked out agreement was worked out between the proponents of the amendments and those who had reservations and they were either withdrawn or became part of the bill by unanimous consent of the 25 or 30 that were left for votes however we had good debate the members talked about their point of view the people who opposed them gave their points of view we had a vigorous discussion and debate and then we voted and the important thing for me and I'm pretty sure I'm right about this I kept a mental note as we went through our votes I don't believe there was a single party line vote in the Armed Services Committee on any amendment the votes were sometimes more Republicans more Democrats but there wasn't a single party line vote in other words the process worked as it was intended to work as it should work and as it can work so I have a radical suggestion for those who are seeking a solution to this health care issue and that is submit a bill and put it before the requisite committees have hearings have debates have information get information from around the country from experts from people that know about the topic and that's how we make good laws a bill that doesn't go through any of that process that's concocted in secret and sprung on the Congress at the last minute almost by definition won't be a good bill bad process bad bill and that's what we had happen in this case so I think this is a time we're going to into a recess at the end of this week let's take a deep breath and instead of trying to tinker around and attract a few extra votes and find something that will barely pass by the skin of its teeth let's step back and submit this issue to the Finance Committee and the a GLP committee and try to work through to find a real solution involving both parties involving all of the wisdom that's been accumulated in this country over on this incredibly complex and difficult and incredibly important issue we don't have to try to do it in the dark let's do it in the light of day let's have open hearings and considerations and votes and amendments and discussion and debate and then as our system is designed we can come to a good result now let's talk about the bill that's currently before us I guess it's before us it hasn't really been submitted to any of the committees but I'm told it's going to come to the floor it was going to be this week now it's going to be the week I guess after the recess at least that's what we were told yesterday and why is this a bad bill now I've been watching some of the commentary on this bill and there's a lot of discussion about the Congressional Budget Office analysis is it corrected they use the right baseline are they good at projecting how many people are going to sign up for health care and all of those kinds of questions and people are questioning the Congressional Budget Office I happen to think they tend to be a pretty nonpartisan straightforward good scientific and quantitative analysts of these kinds of issues and they've issued their report 22 million people lose their health care 22 million people this is about people it's not about ideology it's about real people now there's a really easy way to cut through all of the questions about whether they analyze the property and who properly and who's going to and who's going to win and that is to look at a simple chart that's on I think the third page of the Congressional Budget Office analysis and this is really all you need to know about this bill Medicaid loses seven hundred and seventy two billion dollars over the next ten years and the tax credit and selective coverage provisions that's the ACA loses four hundred billion it's one point one trillion dollars out of the health system you cannot take 1.1 trillion dollars out of the health system and not hurt people you can't do it we don't have to argue about how many here and what age and all of that kind of thing we're talking about a massive cut to the support that's enabling American people to get health care in Maine if you cut all these numbers back the near as I can tell it's about four hundred to five hundred million dollars a year I was the governor of Maine four to five hundred million dollars a year is huge and people talk about well we're going to cut Medicaid back we're going to trim the growth rate we're going to lower the way it's calculated and make it a per capita cap and all of these things and we're going to give the states flexibility the magic word flexibility as if flexibility enables you to somehow conjure up a trillion dollars what you're really giving the states is the flexibility to decide between the elderly and the disabled or children that's what this is all about there is another option by the way the states can always raise taxes to make up for this difference and that's one of the most frustrating things to me again as a former governor we're talking about this reduces the federal deficit by three hundred thirty billion dollars over ten years yes because you've shifted a billion almost a billion dollars a trillion dollars to the states that's nice work if you can get it that's making that's balancing the federal budget look better why don't we just let the states pay for the air force that's you know that's a federal expenditure shift back to the states that will help us with our budget deficit but it's a fake balancing of the budget because you're shifty simply shifting the cost over to somebody else another level of government the shorthand for that is shift and shad and that's what we're talking about either the state government is going to be shafted because they're going to have to raise taxes or the people who are going to lose the support are going to be shafted and we're talking about real people and let me talk about Medicaid for bit Medicaid is sometimes characterized and I've even heard some of my colleagues use Medicaid and welfare in the same breath as if Medicaid is a welfare program it's not it's a critically necessary support for healthcare for people who need it many of whom are not welfare people as we would discuss we would denote them not welfare recipients they're getting a lifeline of true lifeline is actually keeping them alive in Maine 70 percent of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid nationwide the number is 62% so when you talk about Medicaid and cutting Medicaid you're talking about at many in the nursing home you're not talking about some welfare recipient that's ripping off the system you're talking about your relatives who are in nursing homes seventy percent of the people in nursing homes are being supported by Medicaid in Maine we call it named care so you can't shrink this amount of money and think that it's not going to have impacts on people and that's why this bill is is so pernicious now here's what the bill is all about a half a trillion dollar tax cut the top 2% of wage earners in America let's be clear what's going on here there's an equation have a trillion dollars of tax cut more than half a trillion dollars of cuts to benefits money to the wealthy health care away from those who need it that's that's the equation that's what this bill is all about this isn't the health care bill this is a tax cut bill dressed up like a healthcare bill and it's also an ideological bill because people don't like Medicaid here's the problem our health care system is the most expensive in the world we pay the most per capita for health care as anyone on the planet by far well just about twice as much as most other countries if you do the math and you take the annual health care bill and divide it by the number of people in America you get about eighty seven hundred dollars a year per person that's what we spend on health care so make that a family of four that's thirty five thousand dollars a year that's what healthcare costs us and by the way that's the real problem when we're talking about Medicaid and Medicare and anthem and the private insurance and all of those things we're really talking about who pays the deeper issue is how much we're paying and the problem is and the reason we need Medicaid and the reason we need Medicare and the reason we need the Affordable Care Act is American people can't afford it without help it's as simple as that they can't afford it they have to have that the government has to provide some support if it doesn't it would break every family in America we have to have the support and right now in the private sector it's breaking our companies who are trying dutifully to keep up with the increase of costs and Medicaid in the health care and don't fall for this idea that somehow the Affordable Care Act because all the increases I remember again hearken back to when I was a governor of Maine in the late 90s early 2000s health care costs were going up 6 8% a year that was 10 years before the Affordable Care Act went into place the the private the individual market for health insurance was already on a drastic upward climb so to blame it somehow on the Affordable Care Act just doesn't wash in terms of the history so the problem is the bigger the deep problem as I say is the overall cost of health care we've got to start talking about that issue that's a separate issue from what we're talking about here as to who pays we have to talk about different kinds of delivery systems we have to talk about a huge increase in preventive care we have to talk about helping people to stay out of the hospital to stay out of the medical system the cheapest medical procedure of all is the one you don't have to perform and so many of our diseases our chronic diseases like diabetes are based upon the choices that people are making and their lack of adequate care early in the disease so that's a separate discussion and I think that's one that we really have to look at however this debate is resolved in the next few weeks or few days we've got to talk about the deeper issue of the overall cost if we don't get a handle on that then all of this other stuff is just is it's going to be it's not going to solve the problem because the deeper issue is the enormous cost that we pay in this country almost twice as much as anybody in the world anybody else in the world per capita and you can say well we have the best health care in the world yes we do for the people who can afford it but for millions of people who can't afford it who have either no or skimpy care it's not the best health care system in the world and there are no statistical indicators that tell us that we're doing really well on things like longevity prenatal care infant mortality we're way down we're like 17th 20th you'd think if we were spending the most money in the world we ought to have really great results and we don't so that's something we got to talk about the cost of pharmaceuticals the cost of drugs is higher here than anywhere else in the world and why is that that's a problem that we have to discuss I had a teletón Hall Monday night with sponsored by the AARP of Maine at the peak they tell me that there were 10,000 people on that call and I took answer I took questions and the questions from seniors in Maine were full of concern fear may be due strong a word although in several cases it wasn't but really deep concern about what will be the effect of this on me on my mother on people who are depending upon Medicaid for their care one lady called who pays $8,000 a month for her chemotherapy drugs if it weren't for her support under the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid she said on the phone I'd be dead that's what we're talking about here we're talking about real people and then the final sort of general point I want to make before I talk about some of the people who are going to be affected by this is that I hear sometimes the proponent of saying the free market is going to solve this problem the free market is miraculous it can solve all problems I'm a huge believer in the free market I'm a thoroughgoing capitalist I started a business I ran a business I understand about the free market the problem is health care is not a free market if you go to buy a car that's a free market you can go online you can compare you can test drive you can find the prices at the Ford dealers that are in your neighborhood you can do all of those things that's a free market you don't have that in health care number one you don't know the price you call your local hospital say what will it cost me to get my knee replaced nobody can tell you you don't know the price number two it's very hard to compare products you can do it if you really dig in word-of-mouth who's the good doctor who isn't number three you don't say what you want the provider tells you what you need imagine going into a car dealer and the car dealer says I'm going to tell you I think you need this Mercedes over here I think that's what you need and by the way you pay for it and our system is set up that providers are paid for delivering a service not keeping you well they get paid by procedures fee for service not for keeping you well there's no money in prevention we have to change that we have to change that now let me talk about people and these are some people that I've talked about before and I just wanted to sort of go through them you know who this is this is a main lobstermen this is a guy who his name is david Osgood the ACA gave them a chance to get insurance it gave him an opportunity to get insurance where it was practically impossible before he said it's given them some comfort some some reassurance he said we'll be okay that's a main way we'll be okay this is one of the most independent toughest professions there is in this country but he's not part of a big corporation he doesn't have somebody to pay part of his health care he's got to make it work and the ACA gave him an opportunity that he didn't have before to give some confidence to his to his family and to his life there about 75,000 people by the way in Maine just like him who under the ACA got coverage many of them for the first time and those are the calls we're getting from my office Jonathan Edwards and Shrove and and this is a this is sort of a funny story tells you what Maine is like I know Jen's mother I used to I used to work with Jen's mother in the in the early 80s Maine is a big small town with very long roads we all know each other and it just happens that here we are 25 years later and I've become acquainted with Jen she and her husband are farmers they're small farmers in coastal Maine she thinks it's irresponsible to go without health insurance especially when you have a family but it was so expensive they could do it they couldn't acquire health insurance in the individual market again because they're not a member of a big corporation the ACA gave them access to assurance to insurance for the first time to real insurance to insurance that would really cover what they needed not skinny insurance skinny insurance that only covers certain things and doesn't cover other things that is gives you the illusion of coverage until you go to make a claim Jonathan Edwards and Jen stroke farmers in Brooklyn Maine that's the real Brooklyn by the way Brooklyn Maine forget about that place in New York this is Brooklyn with an L I am farmers in Maine the ACA gave an opportunity to get insurance for the first time for their family Cora and Jim banks from Portland raised four boys this is amazing raise four boys every single one was an Eagle Scout that's amazing I mean it to be an Eagle Scout is a real achievement this in this day and age Cora worked at her home she developed Alzheimer's in her late 50s tragically there's that's a tragic disease tragic disease and when Jim could no longer care for her safely at home she went to a nursing home and Medicaid helped her be their Medicaid helped her be their start taking away Medicaid what becomes of Cora what becomes of Jim he took care of her as long as he could if she has to go home if she has to leave that home that's that's a tragedy for her and for her family again as I mentioned before 70 percent of the residents of nursing homes and man are on Medicaid that's the kind of difference that it makes in real life here's Dan Humphrey Dan Humphrey is a young man with autism who volunteers a local soup kitchen delivers meals on wheels in Lewiston Maine he depends on a Medicaid Waiver to support his independent living if it weren't for Medicaid Daniel would be in an institution or he'd be with his parents they couldn't work because he would need care 24 hours a day he does need care and support 24 hours a day under Medicaid he's able to lead a real life and feel good about it you can tell he's a great guy look at his smile Medicaid is a lifeline and I talked about Dan two or three weeks ago and since then I've had an outpouring of people across the country and especially in Maine who have children or relatives or friends with disabilities and what this is meant for them and how terrifying it is that anybody wants to take three quarters of a trillion dollars out of Medicaid which is providing an opportunity for Daniel to lead a decent life why would anybody want to do that I don't get it I don't get it of course it can be made more efficient of course the ACA can be made more efficient but not three-quarters of a billion dollars more efficient that's a huge amount 450 million dollars a year in man Daniel waited eight years under the current program for the services that he gets now and if we put in caps and block grants that sounds good in Washington we're going to put in caps caps mean Daniel may not get services next year or the year after or another guy like Daniel in Peoria or Philadelphia or San Francisco that's a tragedy these are real people we're not talking ideology here we're talking real people and here's Lydia whooping done she lives near where I live she just graduated from Mount Ararat high school and tops I'm two of my boys graduated from Mount Ararat she even has a job she was offered after years of volunteering everything she has achieved has been the accomplished by help with dedicated teachers her family and therapists almost exclusively funded through special education in the public schools and Medicaid and Medicaid and by the way having a child with disabilities has nothing to do with your income it has nothing to do you could be high income low income middle income it has to do with the luck of the draw it has to do with bad fortune and it could hit anybody so again this idea that Medicaid is some kind of welfare program it's just not true it's not true so mr. president reason I'm here is because of these people the reason I'm here is to stand up for these people because they can't be here to do that do it themselves we can do better the failure to get the votes to vote on this bill this week gives us all a chance to take a deep breath to step back and say sure there are things wrong with the Affordable Care Act there are things we can debate there are things we can argue about we can have amendments we can do what we did in the Armed Services Committee over the last two days and have a real discussion and debate I know it's possible because I sat there and saw it happen it can be done and we can do it here let's take a week not to try to browbeat and push and then sent and make special deals to try to get fifty one votes or fifty votes and then the Vice President breaks the tie it goes to the house they don't even look at it they'll pass it and then we're embarked on a path that is going to really hurt the American people we've got to have help health care is too expensive and regular people in this country can't afford it we've got to have help and this is the place where people are looking to find that help let's try to work together I'm certainly willing to work with anybody who listen but if they're starting from a premise of gutting Medicaid and giving somebody else a huge tax cut that doesn't work let's talk about the real problem you want to talk about health care let's talk about it let's talk about how we can lower the cost of health care how we can lower the cost of deductibles how we can lower premiums how we can provide new options to people in their health insurance system but let's just not talk about what we're going to do that's going to have such tragic results on individuals and families and on the fabric of our society mr. president I believe we can do better I believe we can do better and we have an opportunity to do so it's sort of dropped into our laps this week we've got ten days to work on this to think about it to try to come up with a solution or at least begin the process of a solution there's no deadline here of next week but let's begin the process as I begin I have this radical idea of referring these bills to committees here in the Senate have hearings get expert opinion listen to the country listen to the hospital Association who says this is a terrible bill the American medical association who says this bill violates the basic principle of the medical profession first do no harm this bill will do harm there is no group that I've heard of that's for it only people that have an agenda to cut Medicaid because they don't like federal support or people who have an agenda to change the Affordable Care Act because it has Obama's name on it that's not a good enough reason to strike at the heart of our people our communities and our societies one final point I've been talking about people let me talk about jobs in Maine in eight of our 16 counties the hospital is the largest employer I talked to a hospital director an hour ago they are desperate about what's going on down here because it is going to really make it difficult for them to survive and serve their communities the rural hospitals especially I've met with them across Maine in Farmington and bridged in Skowhegan Lincoln you have maybe heard of those towns because they're small towns in Maine but they have a hospital that's the heart of the community and the biggest employer in the community and they all told me the same thing this idea this bill this approach is going to kill them it's going to cause them to at least shrink their services or clothes and in Maine because we're a rural state with far-flung communities that means people are going to be a long way from available care an hour two hours and that's a tragedy for our communities in terms of economic development in terms of jobs but mostly as I keep saying because of people people say why are you so passionate about this angus is because this is what the people Maine sent me to do they sent me down here to help not hurt them they sent me down here to speak for them not stifle their voices they sent me down here to do the right thing to do the ethical thing to protect them when nobody else will that's why I'm here mr. president and I believe that this Senate this Congress this government can do better and I hope that we will

president Trump urging Republicans to stay united ahead of a senate vote to block it Senator Ron Johnson Republican chair of the Homeland Security Committee how you doin sir and good morning to you I'm seeing as many as 15 Republican senators might vote against the president on this measure they're making the case go ahead and take away the emergency declaration you got a pile of six billion dollars which is more than you wanted originally for the wall you think he's gonna take that deal and back down off of that senator I think there are other reasons why he wants the emergency powers and you know prior congresses have given any president this authority to actor and their net national emergency activist presence may be expanding it but he has Authority and Congress has also given him the discretion in these appropriation bills so I think he's definitely you know operating within his legal bounds and from my standpoint what I hope the Republican Senate does is not give Nancy Pelosi ball control the United States Senate but we should come up with their own piece of legislation that basically states what our position is we so Republicans in the Senate support building the wall we want to secure our border we support the President on that and the extent that if we don't like the fact that prior Congress's have given him this Authority or any president authority under the national emergency act let's change that act Mike Lee's gonna have a bill that I'm co-sponsoring today that does just that so that's the the more appropriate way of doing this as opposed to voting for Nancy Pelosi's resolution that doesn't make any sense United States Senate you're working against the clock on that you know there has to be a vote in this resolution based on law I think this this is pretty this is a pretty simple bill we just come up with our own piece of legislation we can change the national emergency act to to return some of this power back to Congress and we can also appropriate the funds in that same piece of legislation now is anything going to become law no Nancy Pelosi is resolution will become law ours probably won't but a piece of legislation we would pass would be the better piece of legislation okay interesting here's the president from yesterday's got a message for Democrats and Republicans in Congress I think that really it's a very dangerous thing for people to be voting against border security for anybody including Republicans I really think that Republicans that vote against border security in the wall I think you know I've been okay at predicting things I think they put themselves at great jeopardy check that clearly from Hanoi last week here's the tweet from the president now more recent Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent they are voting on desperately needed border security in the wall our country is being invaded with drugs human traffickers and criminals of all shapes and sizes that's what this vote is all about stay united easier said than done well it is a political vote we already know that Nancy Pelosi does not have the votes to override a veto so it's a moot point so from my standpoint we should support the president we do have a crisis of the border in 2014 President Obama said is a humanitarian crisis when 120,000 unaccompanied children and people coming in as families across the border illegally in were apprehended last year 145 thousand people came in illegally under those same categories in five months bill 159,000 unaccompanied children and family members have come to this country illegally this is a growing crisis it's not going away 159 thousand and five months versus 120,000 in a year when President Obama called it a humanitarian crisis it is a crisis it is an emergency and Democrats have their heads so far in the sand when they say this is manufactured this is a real crisis it's beyond anything we've seen in the past these are individuals that are coming here exploiting our laws and they are staying unlike what was happening earlier in the in the few decades and the 2001 of those Mexican economic migrants that we could return immediately their sometimes be apprehended multiple times so Democrats are comparing apples to oranges this is a crisis it is an emergency he's concerned about the unity so we'll see whether or not it happens sir thank you for your time appreciate it Ron Johnson the Reverend from Wisconsin Thank You Sandra

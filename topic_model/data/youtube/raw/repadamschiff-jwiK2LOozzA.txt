beginning joining us now is democratic congressman adam schiff of california he's chairman of the house intelligence committee he's a member of the january 6th select committee and served as the lead impeachment manager for the first impeachment trial of donald trump thank you very much for joining us tonight as this important hearing approaches and we're seeing in the secret service story that your committee is still developing evidence that you didn't know was coming your way even as recently as a week ago what is the what is next in your investigation of the secret service text messages well we did receive thousands of documents from them this week but as you point out these did not include the text messages at the heart of our interest those that were sent between secret service agents on january 5th and 6th and the announcement that the secret service made when this first came delayed when the inspector general of the department of homeland security first made us aware that these records may have disappeared i i think was very misleading uh in saying that no records relevant to our inquiry were destroyed uh but acknowledging that records were destroyed well if they were destroyed how do they know they were not pertinent text messages uh it appears and you know we're still looking at this and it's early in our investigation into the matter but it appears that the agents were basically left to themselves to decide whether to preserve what they had on their phones or not to preserve it whether it was relevant or not relevant and to ask interested parties without any kind of oversight to do that is i think at a minimum negligent uh and maybe more than that we do hope to find out whether any of these messages may be retrieved technologically but we should also be able to figure out uh just how many messages were sent or received between agents and then we'll get a sense of the scope of what was destroyed and i think that will help guide us into asking particular questions of agents about what they were texting about and what was destroyed and why it was destroyed uh according to the secret service owned description of what it insists on calling a routine technological update they left it to individual members of the secret service to decide what on their phones should be preserved uh as this update was coming uh that leaves the question of what did james murray do he had one of those phones at least one of those secret service phones did he personally save anything on his secret service phone or did he actually participate in effect in deleting everything from his secret service phone is that worthy of its own specific subpoena to james murray for his phone records and for his testimony you know i would uh certainly hope and expect that the records we've already requested of the secret service would pertain to anyone on duty that day you know all the way up to the director that may have um text messages emails other communications in a variety of different formats uh that are responsive to our subpoenas so we should get that information we'll obviously be looking for any records that are missing uh any records uh uh that would tell us that something is being withheld we're gonna scrutinize this very carefully particularly after uh you know this gross disparity between what we're hearing from secret service and what we're hearing from the inspector general i'm confident lawrence will get to the bottom of what happened less confident will ever see those text messages tragically i i'm going to assume or guess that on in thursday night's hearing we won't be hearing very much about this this suggests that your committee will have to have more public hearings in the fall concerning the secret service texts and possibly more material you know i think it's all of our sense that uh this will be uh you know the end of the first set of hearings but we do not believe this will be the end of hearings new people to continue to come forward new issues like this involving the secret service also continue to make themselves apparent and merit further investigation how many of those issues will warrant their own hearings it's too early for us to say but none of us feel that this is over by any means i am and at the same time we want to in the fall present our recommendations about protecting the country going forward i think that is worthy of uh hearings as well so there is more to come but i think what you'll see on thursday will be significant in and of itself congressman adam schiff thank you very much for leading off our discussion tonight really appreciate it

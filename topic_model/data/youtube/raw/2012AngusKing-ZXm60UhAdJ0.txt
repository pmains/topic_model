let's talk for a minute about social media rounds Alan do you have a lot of thoughts about this yeah we've created a Facebook page for the campaign and I got to tell you it's vent it's an amazing it's an amazing political phenomenon we've now we're closing in on 20,000 likes or fans on our Facebook page and for me what I've seen and of course when I ran before it didn't exist it it's interesting politically for a couple of reasons one is you can interact with people it's like going door-to-door but you don't have to walk between the houses you know you can interact I spend an hour or so a night Mary would if she were here would say it was two hours at night just chatting with people you know people write in and ask a question and answer them and there's a connection made it's not as good as in person but it's still a real connection that's number one number two it allows you as a candidate to present yourself in a more human way than just as a guy behind a podium in a suit a final reason is that it's it's a personal endorsement if you think about it when you let's say you're going to buy a car and you watch all the TV ads you see an ad for Toyota and an ad for Honda and Edward Chevy and an ad for ford and you know that's information that you think about but then if you sit down at lunchtime and a guy sitting next to you says i just bought a Chevy Silverado and it's the best truck I ever bought that's going to have more weight than those ads on TV and facebook gives you that ability to have a kind of personal endorsement it's a way of communicating directly with people without necessarily having a filter

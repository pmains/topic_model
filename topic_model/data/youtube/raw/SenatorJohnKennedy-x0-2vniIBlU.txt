thank you mr president i want to talk mr president for a few minutes about nuclear energy uh president biden of course as we both are aware is called climate change a quote existential threat he says it is quote the one number one issue facing humanity today secretary kerry who as we know is president biden's climate envoy has said that climate change is a quote life and death issue president biden's national climate advisor the honorable gina mccarthy believes that saving the environment is quote the fight of our lifetimes but mr president if you ask many members of congress not all of them i don't want to paint with too broad a brush but if you ask many members of congress what they think the solution to our environmental issues is they will probably respond to renewable energy but if we're really worried about the climate and i know we all are we all want clean air we all want bright water i suggest that we also embrace nuclear energy nuclear energy is not only safe but it is clean and frankly it can produce more power than renewables nuclear energy mr president as you know creates little or no carbon emissions let me say that again a lot of people don't rise nuclear energy creates little or no carbon emissions it also creates very little waste an extraordinarily small amount of waste all the nuclear waste that america's commercial nuclear industry has ever produced ever in the history of ever can fit into a single football field to a depth of fewer than 10 yards now you compare that with solar panels for example solar panels create 300 times more toxic waste than nuclear plants in order to yield the same exact amount of energy or compare the waste from nuclear power production with wind turbine blades wood turbine blades are very hard to recycle mr president and they usually end up in landfills these facts are underreported but the fact is that solar and wind power do have their own harmful impacts on our environment there is no free lunch mr president as you know and you don't get one now there are pros and cons of everything um solar and wind can't hold a candle to nuclear power when it comes to efficiency that's just a fact it takes more than 3 million solar panels or more than 430 wind turbines to produce the same amount of energy as the average nuclear plant let me say that again three million solar panels 430 wind turbines to produce the same amount of energy as the average nuclear power plant and these do these numbers do not take into account that solar panel panels as we know are useless when the sun doesn't shine and wind turbines are nothing more than expensive paperweights when the wind doesn't blow also underreported in my judgment mr president is how safe nuclear energy is despite what some people may think homer simpson does not run america's nuclear power plants the industry is constantly evolving to make nuclear power plants safer to make them more efficient in fact we've all read a lot about small modular reactors that's i'll just use that as an example there these small modular reactors are part of a very promising new generation of advanced reactors that can automatically automatically prevent overheating and frankly they produce even less nuclear waste now mr president i want to be clear i still believe in fossil fuels i'm an all of the above energy advocate but leading that pack is is fossil fuels america's economy is largest in all of human history and it can't run with that oil and gas lousy aliens know this and most americans know this the people of louisiana serve our country pretty well by contributing to our energy independence and i'm very proud of that last year louisiana supplied nine percent nine percent of america's marketed gas and louisianians understand as do i think most americans that giving up on fossil fuels would not only destroy jobs it would ruin the economy but i want america to use every advantage that it has i want i want america to use every energy tool with its disposable and that's why nuclear energy i see nuclear energy as supporting oil and gas not replacing it i'm going to be clear about that as supporting oil and gas not replacing um since nucle nuclear energy holds such promise and it does mr president uh i'm hoping that that my my democratic friends in congress and my republican friends in congress because i see this as a bipartisan issue will lend their full throated support to nuclear energy i'm not saying that renewal renewables don't have their proper place in america's energy policy they certainly do i'm not saying we should get rid of them i'm certainly not but we need to acknowledge that renewables have limitations they have limitations that nuclear energy does not there are disadvantages to renewables as i said there's no free lunch and you don't get one now now that that for some of some people that's that's a a lesson that needs to be repeated um i i take note um i say this gently but the democratic party platform for example calls for installing 500 million solar panels 500 million solar panels and 60 000 wind turbines over the next five years this will occupy a lot more land and actually create create less energy than building new nuclear reactors that's a fact some small modular nuclear reactors are roughly twice the length of the average school bus twice the length of an average school bus wind farms on the other hand can eat up more than 19 square miles that's about half the size of disney world half the size of disney world compared to twice the length of the average school bus if we succeed in blanketing our land with solar panels and wind farms it's going to create more waste occupy more green space and ultimately weaken our economy again i'm not saying no to solar and wind i'm not at all i'm saying yes to explore the possibilities of nuclear energy president biden as we know has a two trillion dollar infrastructure plan and and i think if nothing else his infrastructure plan establishes the bad administration's priorities his plan does call for 61 billion dollars in initiatives that includes investments in advanced nuclear technology i'm not sure i agree on the amount but i i i like the concept and i find that to be prudent but it also asks for three times that amount 174 billion dollars to support electric vehicles electric cars i suggest that um i suggest that nuclear energy has more of a place and energy future and it's something that we we ought to talk about other spending bonanzas in president biden's plan include a 213 billion dollar investment to give 2 million buildings a green new deal makeover and 100 billion dollars to make our schools greener these are not going to have a more meaningful impact on our environment than exploring nuclear energy they're just not i know mr president that nuclear energy sounds too good to be true and i i don't want to oversimplify the circums the uh the circumstances nuclear energy um has its drawbacks uh but but nuclear energy is powerful uh nuclear energy is safe nuclear energy is clean and by building up our nuclear power capabilities the united states can create more jobs the united states can strengthen its economy and the united states can ensure its place as a world leader on energy and we can do all that without reducing or we can do all that while reducing carbon emissions i hope my colleagues will come to embrace nuclear energy as the efficient green energy source that it is and that the united states congress can work with the white house to improve america's standing as an energy juggernaut thank you mr president i yield the floor

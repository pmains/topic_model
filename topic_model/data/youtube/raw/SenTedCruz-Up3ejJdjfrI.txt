joining us on the line to discuss the new anti-semitism that the Democratic Party seems to be okay with is Senator Ted Cruz of Texas senator Cruz welcome to ben shapiro show man it's always good to be with you thanks for having me you bet so senator Cruz let's start with this you are doing something that I think congressional Republicans should have done a while ago which is you're introducing a bill to condemn anti-semitism you're doing that in the Senate is it going to come up for a vote what's the actual content of the bill well I hope that it comes up for a vote we circulated it to every Senate office this past week it says it's a straightforward bill condemning anti-semitism and and and this was prompted number one by the repeated anti-semitic comments we've seen from these new fresh freshmen Congress women but but number two by the ridiculous paroxysms that that House Democrats went into when they were unable to vote out a resolution condemning anti-semitism because the sad reality is too many in their party have giving it given in to the extremes the left-wing anti-israel bias the embrace of BDS and and so instead they watered it down into a general resolution disclaiming bigotry of any kind and they listed every group they could find in it the resolution I've introduced is straightforward it defines anti-semitism as a unique form of prejudice that targeted at the Jews it identifies the tax on Jewish loyalty as a form of anti-semitism with a long history going going all the way back to the protocols of the Elders of Zion it identifies attacks on Jews livelihood as a form of anti-semitism from land prohibition in the Middle Ages to Nazi destruction of Jewish businesses to the contemporary BDS movement and it describes the history of American anti-semitism and it's one of the reasons why it is so clear to be unequivocal my hope is the Senate will do what the house was not able to do and just take it up and clearly and unequivocally condemn anti-semitism now senator Cruz does that does the bill itself mention by name anybody in the Congress or is it a general just condemnation of anti-semitism so it does not mention any individual member of Congress and I just didn't think it was appropriate for the Senate to do that it actually part of the reason it doesn't do that is my hope is to get it passed and and so but what it does do is it condemns specifically that the comments that the kinds of comments the the assertions of dual loyalty that the tweet that was sent about it's all about the Benjamins which which I think may well have been the most offensive of all of these comments it's so it targets those kinds of aspersions without identifying a member of Congress by name okay so with that said have you received any Democratic support have Democratic senators reacted to your proposal so we have not yet but we just circulated it this past week and the Senate in recess everyone is back in their states right now and and so what we have right now 10 Senate offices that have asked to be co-sponsors but but all of them are Republicans so far we'll wait and see I am not certain we will vote on it I want to have a vote on it and Mitch McConnell has said he plans to schedule it for a vote so I'm hopeful that every senator have to make a choice where do you stand and I think for some Senate Democrats that may be a difficult choice but my hope is that they do the right thing I'd like to see this passed 100 and nothing but the Democrats will have to make a decision that they're willing to be unequivocal condemning semitism for that to happen and senator Cruz it is fascinating to watch as the Democratic Party pulls further and further away from Israel they say this has nothing to do with an implicit endorsement of anti-semitism even though they've been watering down their principles on behalf of Ilhan Omar and Rasheeda Talib in the house we now know that at least six Democratic presidential contenders have pulled out of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference which is this huge event that happens every year it's basically just a giant gathering of pro-israel people historically everybody from every side of the political aisle including folks like President Obama have spoken at AIPAC regularly even when President Obama was pushing what I thought was an awful anti-israel Rondo he was invited to and spoke at AIPAC what do you make of the Democrats pulling out of AIPAC one after another like this it's one of the saddest and most troubling legacies of the Obama presidency it is that there used to be for many years a bipartisan agreement and support for Israel and for America's alliance with Israel when Obama negotiated and pushed forward the Iranian nuclear deal that that I think was was devastating to send billions of dollars to the Ayatollah a theocratic zealot who pledges death to Israel and death to America well what happened was congressional Democrats the the Obama White House teed up a choice between either stand with the Obama White House or stand with Israel and virtually every congressional Democrat chose partisan democratic politics over Israel that legacy continues to reverberate today and it's really a very unfortunate development I hope we can find congressional Democrats get their voice back and be willing to stand together in support of the nation of Israel and so senator Cruz the same Democrats who are suggesting that Ilhan Omar is in fact not anti-semitic or refuted to Lieber not anti-semitic those same people are suggesting that President Trump is anti-semitic despite the fact that today or yesterday the President of the United States declared that the United States position on the Golan Heights is that it is sovereign Israeli territory what is your take on the president's announcement about Israel's control of the Golan Heights well I think the president's announcement about the Golan Heights is incredibly important it is something that I had been urging him to do for many months I introduced a resolution in December of last year for Congress to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel and then earlier this year I introduced legislation to mandate that we've been working hand-in-hand with the White House with the National Security Council with the administration urging the President to do what he just did yesterday I think it is a recognition of reality the Golan Heights are unquestionably part of Israel today but but it is also a recognition of America's interest nobody in their right mind would want to see the Golan Heights go back to Syria would want to see the Golan Heights controlled by Iran or Russia and and this statement this recognition I think is vitally important it's my hope by the way that not only does the Senate vote on my resolution condemning anti-semitism but I also hope the Senate will take up and vote into law the legislation that I've introduced formally recognizing the Golan Heights apart as part of Israel to put into the United States code what the president has recognized as as the chief executive now senator Cruz I want to ask you quickly about about betta / Ã¸x abate / obviously you ran against him and i specifically want to ask you about your opinion now of the media treatment of betta work it's been kind of astonishing to watch so for a year they built up betta o'rourke as this incredible charismatic politician when he was running against you then he loses and now he's running for the presidency and he's too white and non intersectional and they've decided that he's actually an empty vessel who has no actual policy positions that he's kind of a weirdo and they've discovered all of his old writings suddenly what do you feel about the media's sudden switch in time when it comes to beta O'Rourke well look i think the media have have revealed their true colors for everyone to see they were obvious to begin with but but when beta was running against me the media was in love with this man i mean they they wrote the profiles they wrote of him read more like like fan fiction in the rolling stone of like teenagers enamored with it with a movie star every every reporter when writing a profile the obligatory adjective was kennedy app i think they actually had a macro on their computer that just typed it automatically for them and they would just I I mean it it was writing and coverage that one rarely sees and nothing he could do nothing wrong there was no criticism you want an interesting visual comparison of media bias take every negative article written about beta or ork in the last two years prior to the November election the stack I'd be surprised if it's even a half inch tall if you stacked it up in paper take every negative article that has been written since he'd started entering the presidential campaign and it's a stack my guess is it's over a foot tall why because now you have Bernie Sanders and Carla Harris and you have the other Democrats sticking knives in him and now suddenly the press will cover that criticism of him because he's running against other Democrats and look one of the more stunning examples his Reuters Reuters allegedly holds itself out as a fair and objective journalistic outlet Reuters has now admitted that a Reuters reporter had evidence that that bado had been part of this underground hacking collective and that he may well have committed a series of felonies including stealing phone service which which the the Reuters is laid out of over a certain volume as a felony with prison time they had this in 2017 they interviewed beta O'Rourke the Reuters reporter in 2017 over a year ago where he admitted to this and they cut a deal with him they said I'll tell you what we won't publish any of it until after November 2018 after the the Senate election because and they didn't say this but this is obvious because they wanted the Democrat to win he was running against me so of course they're not going to say anything negative now all of these you know bizarre fiction pieces he wrote as a kid all of this has come out because Reuters sat on it for over a year as essentially an income campaign contribution to the beta O'Rourke for Senate campaign it's pretty astonishing but senator Cruz at least you can take comfort in knowing that after you defeated him in his Senate race he went to New Mexico and literally ate dirt that's a thing that actually happened that's not a Washington Post so who's in the Washington Post profile of himself I mean I guess that's some comfort to you well Ben even beyond that not only did did he eat dirt he apparently brought the dirt back to his family to feed his family dirt now how exactly do you show up to your kids they hey guess what I brought for dinner I mean that's a little out there even for a socialist well at least your rides a skateboard that's the important thing senator Cruz thanks so much for joining the ben shapiro show really appreciate the time

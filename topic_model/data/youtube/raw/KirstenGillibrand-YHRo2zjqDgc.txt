my name is Tanya as a Panza Johnson Walker and I work at a New York transgender advocacy group if I had no role models I had no one to support me to say hey you could do this it was a very lonely existence I had to fight by myself to survive you know this life in the back of my mind my father always said that I would change I figured that if I went into the military that I would come out a heterosexual man with the wife and kids and that I wouldn't be you know that I wouldn't transition so I fought not to be trans or transition by going into the military transgender people have been here since the beginning of time we've been fighting in wars we've been serving this country when Senator Gillibrand spoke out against the trans military band you know I felt like finally you know someone is on our side that really supports and it's fighting for transgender people she's one of the ones that's really out front she's not afraid she's bold and she's there in our corner

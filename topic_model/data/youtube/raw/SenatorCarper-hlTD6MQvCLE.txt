I think the president's le not a thoughtful and a comprehensive strategy that I support if all we do is send more troops Marines or army more trainers more helicopters more equipment that in and of itself is not sufficient that's important there's not the that's not what's needed to really turn the tide here and to drive the Taliban ad and to make sure al Qaeda doesn't come come back we need to also help the Afghans diversify their economy get them off with a poppy tray to have them grow the stuff that they used to go when they fed themselves weeds and apples and cotton in all kinds of stuff we wouldn't they have a potentially vibrant mining and mineral industry there help them develop it they have three times more oil and gas reserves was none communication as though your two ago help them to develop that and also we should be not on just training their their army and their a police but also doing what we did in Iraq very successfully where we helped to tribal leaders to prepare their own tribes in an effort against in Iraq against the certainty insurgents but in Afghanistan tribal used to rally against the Taliban and they will they're already starting to do it when I was over in the Afghanistan def I can mail at a congressional delegation there was asked by reporter leaving they said what is our exit strategy for for Afghanistan i said i think the exit strategy is the strategy the president laid out in actually last spring in which is really more fully developing today this shouldn't be just us this should be about a strain preparing the Afghans to preparing for their own defense to provide for their own security people to govern themselves it's not just us it's it's the our NATO allies Ram think about 30,000 troops over there right now they're going to add to that we have countries like Japan that are not there have troops in Afghanistan but their little bankrolling the police force is there helping to train the these forces so there's plenty of work for other nations to do and helping us and one of the things that the administration has been working to do is to rally the support of our NATO allies in other countries around the world so that they will see the danger in al-qaeda raising its head again spreading its tentacles and making sure that that doesn't happen I realize there's some people say well what if what strategic value is is Afghanistan to us or to anybody anybody else so it turns out there was in Afghanistan that al-qaeda planned in mastermind at the attacks of 911 killed thousands of Americans destroyed a lot of lives a lot of businesses and lives of a lot of families this is war I think we should have been fighting all along we got distracted in Iraq we have right across the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan as an effort by Taliban to take over the government of pakistan pakistan has not a lot of people but without a lot of nuclear weapons the idea of having those nuclear weapons falling against the taliban it's not what we not in our interest or anybody than a sanity one wants to see happen so what we have is a potential for a fencer movement here were personally Taliban out of Afghanistan I into the mountains got the over Pakistan encouraged by our actions in Afghanistan pushing the Taliban together sore by a pencil movement almost and pushing them all in to the mountains and going after and destroying their infrastructure their ability to do damage and as we do that go after al-qaeda at the same time so that al-qaeda is denied a safe is a part with which to plan more more action it'll kill more people not just in America but but around the world and their terrorist operations be cheap I didn't doing nothing it's going to be a whole lot more expensive we allow Taliban to reemerge provide a safe harbor for al-qaeda if the Taliban are able to exert their influence throughout Pakistan and unstable to stabilize that country maybe even get their hands on nuclear weapons that's going to a huge problem that will wish I never had Kurt we're fortunate fortunate and since as well the president's proposed some further commitment of resources both military and civilian to an Afghanistan we're seeing a drawdown a significant draw down from about 170,000 troops in Iraq Yuriko about 120,000 today we expect by next August to be down to about 50,000 troops in Iraq and within a year so after that the most part to be out of out of out of Iraq so that's a period of about 21 once we expect to build modern 20,000 troops in Iraq to about close to zero and we expect to grow our presence in in Afghanistan in terms of troops and advisers from about 65,000 troops or so to almost a hundred thousand will still be way under work or we were in Iraq and idea the other thing I think is important here in Afghanistan my time that I spent here it's real clear that the Afghan people don't like the Taliban they despise the Taliban Taliban create a lot of hardship a lot of suffering pain for for that country they don't have my data enjoy popular support and what they want to do is just a feel like safe from the Metallica and we're going to prod try to provide them that that safety and security prepare them to be able to run their own affairs and defend themselves and as they do that then we pull out

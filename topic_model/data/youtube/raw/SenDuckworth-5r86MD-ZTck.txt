Martinez the road to zero coalition led by the National Safety Council and in partnership with Nitsa FMCSA and over nine hundred other members is laying out strategies to end road raid deaths by 2050 yes or no are you both still 100% committed to eliminating roadway deaths by 2050 as a goal we continue to partner with that very important group they come up with innovative strategies and the combined power of the partners are where I think a lot of the innovations will come that did get us to the zero goal Thank You mr. Martinez that remains our goal one death is one too many thank you and I'm still miss King an it says policy that every child on every school bus should a three-point safe beat a seatbelt we under so it is our policy that everybody should be safe on our roads as Martinez said administrator Martinez one death is one too many yes Thank You administrator victorious you know Senator Durbin and I have been working with Amtrak Canadian national and I dot the Illinois Department of Transportation to address signal activation issues known as short shunting on a rail corridor in Illinois that impacts Amtrak's on-time performance while all stakeholders are working in good faith most observers agree that more active and direct involvement by Fr a is necessary to identify a permanent long-term solution because different people have different explanations as to why I do think F Ras involvement heightened increase involvement is really going to be vital to us moving forward on this well you direct your staff to play a more active role in these discussions yes senator they're already actively involved in when it came to my knowledge last year I was highly surprised about how long the tale is on this over five years yeah and it's frustrating I speak personally about that I've been on those trains and well it's very frustrating when you're on the thing of it is okay something that should be resolved okay needs to be resolved and at this juncture didn't my my outlook is taken on a life of soap opera yeah and you only have to study things so much finally you got to do something I think your leadership frac leadership is gonna be really critical on that so perhaps you could commit to asking your staff to double down and let's get this resolved yes ma'am Thank You mr. zebra the president's executive order 13 7 71 requires federal agencies to eliminate two regulations for every new regulation that's created can you guarantee that this executive order has not delayed the implementation of critical safety related regulations at d-o-t senator yes I can I think we in the department are very proud of our record in fact of deregulation and of the deregulation actions that we've taken our actions at save money as well as either do not adversely affect or actually promote more safety so just I mean one out of dozens of examples FAS rotorcraft pilot compartment view we eliminated a requirement to save more than 525 million dollars for the operators and yet actually makes it easier for them to achieve safety standards well so are you saying that no safety regulation has been delayed in implementation because you're looking for two other regulations to eliminate first that is true to my knowledge if if I find out otherwise I will get back to you thank you and mrs. a but senator Perdue and I included a requirement in last year's FAA reauthorization act for a usdot to report to Congress within nine months on the benefits of expanding the TIFIA program to include certain airport projects reauthorization passed more than eight months ago do you expect the report to be completed on time and will you commit to delivering copies to my office and to Senator Purdue's office when it's finalized in reverse order senator yes we will commit to delivering copies of the report both to you to Senator Purdue to any other member of Congress was interested in seeing that the we are currently working on the draft of the report so I cannot commit that we will exactly meet the deadline but if we miss it we won't miss it by much thank you I'm overtime mr. chairman I do have more questions by members of time I will submit them for written response thank you senator Dodd

Mr. Speaker,
I rise today in support of the Children’s Health Insurance Program that so many of our
vulnerable young people depend on for health coverage. Across the country, eight million kids use
CHIP – more than 300,000 in Illinois alone. But their coverage, and consequently their
health and future, are now in jeopardy because this House has failed to reauthorize the program
for the first time in 20 years. Yesterday marked 100 days since authorization
lapsed. Before the New Year, Congress temporarily
extended limited funding, but the Center for Medicare Services is already warning that
some states won’t have the funding to make it through the month of January. It’s beyond shameful that this House can
pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for those with the most security, but not see
its way to provide health insurance for children most in need. This is a vital program, this is a popular
program, and this is a program that traditionally enjoys bipartisan support. There is no reason to continue to extend the
uncertainty. I urge my colleagues to act and reauthorize
CHIP as soon as possible to offer much needed stability to the families depending on this
coverage.

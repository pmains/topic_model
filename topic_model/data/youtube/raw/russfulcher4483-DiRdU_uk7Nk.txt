hello i'm governor butch otter thank you for your interest in learning more about our efforts to develop innovative sustainable and market-based solutions to change the health care in idaho for the better we think the congress has overstepped their authority there's there's no grounding anywhere in the constitution for the congress to take this kind of action and so uh the bill that i signed yesterday is being replicated all over the united states and if you get a critical mass of say uh 36 37 states then you got a constitutional mass and we're going to go forward with it what do you mean by constitutional mass i mean in 36 states even if the 36 states passed laws which are still you know can't be uh can't be can't be passed in federal court they're still well i do disagree with the policy and the process by which it's forced uh onto the population of idaho uh we got a million five hundred and roughly forty five thousand citizens here uh that each and every one of them now are going to come under that mandate by the federal government i think we ought to be able to accept or reject and every citizen ought to have the power to accept or reject and the congress has assumed that power and i think it's wrong no matter how how hard you look in article 1 section 8 the commerce clause no matter where you look in the constitution it's hard to find any power that the congress can exert in order to get us to buy a product but the the story's not over with yet judge i would tell you that we still have a lot of fronts that we're trying to fight this on obviously the congressional front by defunding uh obamacare we're going to continue with our lawsuit which we won or at least got a judge judge vincent down in florida in our favor to declare that it was unconstitutional and because it lacked severability that if any one part of that law was found unconstitutional the entire law is thrown out as being unconstitutional i'm wayne hoffman executive director of the idaho freedom foundation what do idahoans think about obamacare and should idaho start implementing obamacare doing a state health insurance exchange or expanding medicaid as the president wants us to do we try to find out the answer to that question now next legislative session lawmakers are going to be asked to create a state health insurance exchange but what do idahoans think about that not very much they're pretty well opposed to obamacare and the state health insurance exchange 64 of idahoans want a free market solution to health care problems they don't want obamacare they don't want a state health insurance exchange only 18 percent of idaho and said let's go ahead and create a state health insurance exchange and 14 had no opinion a new way to buy insurance on our own will be popping up everywhere they're called health insurance marketplaces though they may have a fancier name than that in your state not all governors are on board to set up these marketplaces but the feds will open their own in those states and so you probably won't notice much of a difference all we're really doing is we're using the federal system to validate our idaho search engine each state is just using their own name for it so i had a meet uh i had a conference uh video conference with all the state directors of all the marketplaces and i'm talking to the director in kentucky and idaho and you know in kentucky it's called like kentucky connect and in idaho it's called the you know idaho health care exchange and yeah there's a story that came out of kentucky where some folks were signing people up uh at a county fair somewhere and some guy goes up and he starts looking at the rates and decides he's going to sign up and he turns to his friend and said this is a great deal this is a lot better than obamacare right which is which is fine this is the voluntary implementation of the affordable care act with all due respect the good center for 32 we are right now or very soon to be voting on the affordable care act and don't take my word on it take a look at page four of the bill belongs a health carrier or health benefit plan or standalone dental plan meets all requirements of applicable law senators applicable law is the affordable care act we have nothing to gain we have much to lose the senator votes now i'm gonna close with this one last statement folks you deserve to hear from your governor this is the fourth event of this type in the last seven days where i'm standing up here for the most part by myself and i know there's some supporters of him here and that's wonderful i encourage you to encourage him to engage you deserve to hear from him not just you

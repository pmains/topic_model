gone with some barrier Loudermilk joins me now Carlson you were at the Congressional FTX hearing on Tuesday why do you think Sam bankman freed was arrested before he could testify before that committee that's a very interesting question uh Stuart and I asked that question really the night before the timing of this is unbelievable and uh you know uh the conspiracy theory side of me says that possibly uh somebody did not want him testifying to Congress to say some things that they didn't want out and not to tie directly but one of the questions I have about regulation is they were in exchange exchanges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission where was the SEC through all this did they just turn to Blind Eye because they're too interested in pushing ESG rules on other corporations that that our the our SEC did not have authority over FTX because it was headquartered and it was an exchange in the Bahamas that may be why the SEC has been until now has been absent here but do you ever expect to hear him testify um that I don't know I I am assuming that he has we know he's lawyered up his his number of lawyers has probably expanded and I'm sure they're telling them don't say anything to anyone we do need to talk to him because the last thing we want is a rush to regulation because what happens with the federal government here if we rush to regulation we don't put enough guardrails Around The Regulators I mean look at what's happening right now individuals in the United States are being subjected to their financial transactions more than 600 throughout the year being reported to the federal government why because they're afraid of money laundering supposedly it's really because the IRS wants to tax more and more people but unless you put guardrails around the regulator then it's going to end up the consumer is the one that's going to get hurt we do need regulation but we need to make sure it's the right regulation you got it good now do we have any idea where all these billions went in fact we do not and that's one of the reasons why we need to hear from Mr freed now uh Mr Ray who's currently running the operation uh there at FTX he answered a lot of good questions but the problem is he doesn't know because of the lack of record-keeping that they had he said they were running this multi-billion dollar company on QuickBooks I use QuickBooks in my small business so there's a lot of information that he still needs to uncover but he does say there's indication of a lot of co-mingling of funds and uh some pretty potential criminal activity that had gone on thanks for your contribution today Congressman great to hear from you and keep pressing for us please thank you very much thank you Merry Christmas Merry Christmas sir thank you

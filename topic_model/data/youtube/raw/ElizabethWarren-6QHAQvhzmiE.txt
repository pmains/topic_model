starbucks is very afraid of what happens when workers come together there's definitely a lot at stake they've threatened to take away some of our benefits which is very funny considering one of the reasons why we are unionizing is to make sure they can't do that they're currently spending millions of dollars in legal and consultation fees in order to combat this this movement the union busting tactics that starbucks workers have come up against they're just plain ugly remember how corporate america spent a whole lot of time during the pandemic publicly praising essential workers you gotta wonder if they were just making this stuff up to try to make themselves look good if starbucks was really serious about supporting essential workers they would come to the bargaining table right now in good faith a win for these workers would be a win for working people everywhere i'm in this fight all the way

spring in Senator Roger wicker of Mississippi he's the top Republican on the Senate armed services committee Senator good to see you you wrote last week quote the United States was the arsenal of democracy during the second world war if we fulfill that role again we will show XI and Putin that there are very real limits to what their partnership can achieve unquote do you think Biden is on track to fulfilling that role with his recent trip to Europe well let me say I I applaud the president for going to Europe they were great words now they they do need to be followed up with action and you know we've complained um over the last 12 months about foot dragging Appropriations have been made we've urged them uh to give weapons uh more quicker and better and uh and and so I hope once the president gets back his order to the Pentagon is let's give all the ammunition they need the long-range missiles the air support uh the things that uh that zielinski needs to actually win this spring offensive so yes you've been critical of what you say is the unnecessary slow walking of the aid to Ukraine are you having active discussions with other lawmakers about pushing Biden to San zelinski for example the F-16 fighter jets he so desperately wants I think we should do that and you know there's always an excuse uh you know they're used to Flying bigs over there and there will be a training Gap well we've had a lot of time for training and and uh if there's more training that needs to be done we need to start it this afternoon and and make sure that we can get them what they need to win this offensive uh in the spring that one thing I'm concerned that the American people don't realize is Vladimir Putin has failed miserably in this late winter offensive uh he he may have gained a meter or two in a in a small town but it has not succeeded and is not likely to succeed what it has done is um it is result in a huge not uh not not just casualty rate but mortality rate yeah most of the problems they've had have been actually fatalities among these prisoners and these grips who are not ready to fight and no matter what China gives them they will never be ready to fight a war like this a source on the hill tells us that you led a meeting last week with Rank and file Republicans to try to cement support and educate some of them even on on Ukraine Aid and the oversight of those billions of dollars The Source went on to say that you sent members quote a whole chart explaining the breakdown of U.S assistance versus Europe European assistance do you think you changed any minds or solidified any support well listen I I think there is strong support among the Republican conference I'd say 90 support um for giving Ukraine the the tools it needs to win the war we're not asking our our troops to go over there and fight they're doing the the dirty work and we're we're helping the West provide some uh equipment uh I had questions about our share of the burden at our at our uh Tuesday lunch and also you know what what the other allies are doing and uh and what percentage of of our GDP we're spending on that so the next day I um I complied and and supplied them with chapter and verse and I think it was very helpful and you know I think the American people uh I think they want uh Ukraine to win they don't want us to get into uh a long uh War of Attrition where we're making our allies eyes fight with one hand tied behind their backs and so the truth of the matter Jake is the president has the authority for 10 times more Weaponry than he promised uh this week in Europe and and what we wish he would do is is is take the Congressional authorization and show that we want Ukraine to be in this to win this and so and frankly uh she is the president of the Communist president of China is watching this right if we're worried about what might happen in the Western Pacific with communist China we ought to be mindful that they are watching for U.S and Western resolve in Ukraine so what do you make of the Pentagon spokesperson's threat this afternoon that there will be consequences if China does provide lethal military aid to Russia in its assault on Ukraine I don't know what they mean by that but the consequences should be that we're we're going to give the long-range missiles to Ukraine regardless of what China does and and we're going to show that that we have the resolve to to follow through on the strong and and welcome words that that the the American president uh delivered in Europe Republican senator Roger wicker of Mississippi top Republican on the Senate armed services committee thank you so much sir appreciate it thank you Jake

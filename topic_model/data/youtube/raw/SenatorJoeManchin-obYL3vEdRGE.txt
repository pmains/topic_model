thank you mr chairman and thank all of you for being here today and i want to say in the past two years i've spent a good deal of time in front of this committee discussing the horrific murders of the veterans that took place at the clarksburg va and i think you all know about that i'm proud to work colleagues all of you mr chairman and and all of you have done in helping us fix the specific problems in clarksburg va that led to those murders and helped prevent them anywhere else in the country i've worked to pass legislation to install security cameras fix shortcomings and staff training and accountability standards and give the va uh office inspector general the authority it needs to conduct the investigations um there are these are all important steps but i think there's so much more that we need to do and i've got two pieces of legislation which i think would help you all be able to do the job that you need to do and i think we spoke to that again so i want to thank the chairman and ranking member and the committee for helping improve the quality of service that our veterans receive the one mr wilbur that you know we're talking about was it's a sobering look at the issues that the va and your office investigates on a daily basis the issues you spoke of with hiring practices and quality of care in north carolina mississippi sound eerily similar to those we experienced in west virginia unfortunately that confirms my fears that failures led to the veterans being murdered in west virginia are indicative of systematic va failures everywhere so i i would ask uh chairman tester i'll be working on scheduling a va patient safety oversight hearing in the very near future i would ask if you would help us set that up if we could because there's some things i think that can be brought to light that would help us very much as far as getting into the crux of what our problems would be we have a piece of legislation that allows you all to subpoena which i believe that you all have asked for or felt it would be very helpful in getting to the crux tell you what happened in clarksburg when it came time to really get into it we couldn't get the person who had basically taken either retirement or ran for the hills literally in west virginia you run for the hills and we can't find you but anyway they was gone had no way of bringing them back so if you would comment on that mr wilbur on how that might be of help to you yes sir and thanks i'd like to express my condolences once again for the families in clarksburg to the veterans and their loved ones um uh yes as you described is what what occurred when we were conducting our healthcare inspection following our criminal investigation in clarksburg a key individual who was responsible for uh both um uh sort of the the um review of the credentials that was a risk manager i believe that does every hospital have a risk manager um i i couldn't i don't i wouldn't want to answer that question sir i think it is an important role for each hospital but i don't want to say that okay that does have one that was the risk manager we were trying to get to testify and and i believe the person was gone and that and that person left during the course of the investigation and so yes testimonial subpoena authority would be important to our ability to then reach out to someone like that serve them with the subpoena require them to to talk to us and again and this is an advance of our oversight of va so this wouldn't be about this isn't a criminal investigation of that person this isn't about putting that person in jail this is about getting critical information from that person so that we understand what happened we understand the root causes of the problem that occurred in clarksburg and can allow us to make recommendations to the department on how to how to fix it senator tester you and senator bozeman both on that bill and i want to thank you for that but uh and also i have one more um ms ogilvy uh if you will i introduce senate bill 2687 strengthening the oversight for veterans act of 2021 again with chairman tester and bozeman to give the uh authority to subpoena and on that there so my question would be what more can we do to hold to hold these employees responsible for failures that happen at the va so that the veterans can build the trust back to the va's that we need is there more that we can be done we're trying to get the information but is there something more that we can do to give you all the ability and the power that you need and to prevent this from ever happening let me ask y'all follow up on another question on that so i can give you two for one we're continuing to pay our retirement benefits to employees like those in clarksburg i can't believe that they're getting full benefits and these are people we know committed horrific horrific crimes but it couldn't be proven i guess and but we know that but is there any thing we can do uh that would prevent that from happening so i would honestly defer to oig for for his comments but i i do agree that um the subpoena power and the the ability to to hold people accountable and be able to get the witnesses that we need to be to follow through on um you know the investigation that we're doing is something that uh is is of critical importance so i you know um that's that's all i would say from my perspective but i'm not sure if um mr wilber wants i know my town's running up ms wilbur if you have any comments to that i appreciate it well with respect to the benefits for individuals who have left va um if if those individuals have been convicted of a crime um uh then the ability for the va to reduce their benefits um i i do understand it exists but for those individuals like if you mean somebody like the risk manager who left who left va employ that person has gone without any uh disciplinary action against them um and now that they're out of uh federal service let me ask you this hypothetically if we if we'd have been able to subpoena that person and bring them back and found out their elective duty that they did not they weren't overseeing they weren't monitoring or watching and they could have maybe prevented that if we could have proven that and shown that in the subpoena power that we would that you would have now would that be able to reverse the retirement and pensions no sir i don't believe it would oh boy senator rounds

speaker I'd like to yield three minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey my friend mr. bill Pasquale gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for three minutes Thank You mr. speaker I have the greatest respect for sincerely good doctor I think he's a reasonable man a good person but when you're explaining you're losing I rise in strong opposition to this legislation after we learned last year about the inexcusable way the IRS evaluated applications for tax-exempt status because that's what is at the heart of this issue I was hopeful that we could have a bipartisan response after all it was not only conservative groups as you've heard that had their application singled out solely because some words like tea party quote unquote no one's denying that progressive groups were inappropriately filtered as well my Democratic colleagues and I were equally outraged by this behavior we put it on the record but those hopes faded quickly when it became apparent that my colleagues on the other side weren't actually interested investigating this wrongdoing and fixing the problem this bill is just the latest example how instead they are only concerned with scoring cheap political points where I'm from in Paterson New Jersey we would call this pyrrhic sophistry that's what we would call it empty arguments deceitful that's what that means the examples the Republican leader pointed out could be under section 527 but if you're under 527 do you need to disclose where the money came from so you choose not to be under section 527 of the tax code you'd rather be in another section and what is that other section you are not taxed look and you don't have to disclose who gave you the money what is this Russia China you heard the numbers we're talking about billions of dollars billions of dollars the difference they'd have to disclose the orig where the money came from no evidence of any retribution has been found yet on either within either political party so this is really a witch hunt unfortunately for the American people it is the integrity of our electoral process here that's on trial the fact is that the Supreme Court's rulings have legalized a torrent of hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate spending that has infected our elections we ask again today join us in correcting that decision by the Supreme Court it is it has infected our legal process this will 30 seconds the gentleman is the only two additional 30 seconds one of the most egregious newly legal big spenders are organizations operating as 501 C 4 exempt tax-exempt groups they could easily be under section 527 we created a special section in tax code precisely for tax-exempt political groups no they don't want to go under those groups because if they go on to those groups then I got to tell us who is contributing to them now who's falling home this is absolute chicken during these regulations aren't some wild lied down the rabbit hole conspiracy theory to prosecute the president the gentleman is recognized for one nummies one more minute they are simply about preserving congressional intent and providing clear rules of the road for tax-exempt groups in the IRS about what exactly is political activity so they know what is permissible under the law this isn't about free speech this isn't about being a tea party or a progressive spending all the money you want to say whatever you want by about any election just don't be expect to be able to do so while calling yourself a tax exempt social welfare group we're paying more taxes because these people are getting away with it that's the bottom line and you I know dr. are totally against that because you were not really in the final analysis prefer that some groups are better than others those particularly who don't tell us who donated to the group thank you and I yield back

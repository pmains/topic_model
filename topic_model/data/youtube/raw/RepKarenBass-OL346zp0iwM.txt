[Music] well i've entered a few years but i realized that the past years that i had entered i didn't enter something that was very personal or meaningful to me as i've grown in my art i've realized it's just very important to share your life story and your personal stuff with others because they can relate and it's it's really important to be vulnerable and others can connect with you and it's just really special the piece that i entered in this competition is called my backpack and it's inspired by my life experiences and experience with parental divorce and how that shaped my experiences in school specifically with my backpack and it just has always felt like i carry my life around because it's really heavy full of my personal items my clothes books my favorite things and it's just always been like a physical burden and an emotional burden as well but i just wanted to share that with others [Music] i think it's just meaningful and important to create art that's personal to you and share that with others and especially like at a younger age because it's more of a brave thing to do and like i don't see it too often and i think there should be more of that this is so amazing i never could have imagined that i would have been here today i'm so surprised but it's like it's such an honor and i just want to say thank you so much to representative karen bass you

I want to ask two questions one is on the liver allocation policy senator Moran and I sent you a letter on January 21st urging that you step in to present to prevent what we thought was a short-sighted and ill-thought-out policy roughly 40% of the country will have a will be harmed by the new process which goes from a regional allocation to a nationwide allocation we've already seen the secretary increased cost per transplant increased waste in what was already a complex system and organs that were discarded because people had to travel to for to get the organs to bring back to the recipient even the federal judge in the litigation referred to what would be a regional bias here the government contractor on this effort provides no information the Committee on how the decision was made they overruled experts in their own liver and intestine committee now they want to continue to have all the evidence in the litigation under seal so my question to you is one what made you determine after our January letter that you couldn't do anything and to are you willing to do something to work to get the evidence and the what supposedly should have been available to this outside contractor to make that evidence public so chairman I share your concerns and frustrations and HHS has actually requested opt and to reconsider their decision to ensure a full consideration of the comments that they received from Kansas and Missouri as you know HHS does not make decisions on organ allocation policy the organ procurement Transplant Network is responsible for organ allocation policy and while we're charged with oversight of OPTN those decisions by statute are delegated to the OPTN and I do not have the ability to change those decisions we continue to look for authorities that might do that and we certainly look forward to working with you if there were ledge slative proposals that might give me authority but those have actually been walled off from the secretary of course the number one thing we can do is increase the number of livers available and that's why we're working to reform our organ procurement policies and our oversight policies and practices regarding the organ procurement organizations in the country so that we can dramatically increase the number of organs available in this country but I'm happy to keep working you with on this liver issue but my degrees of freedom are limited quite frankly by Congress in my ability to influence the OPTN well let's continue to see if we can't find ways to help you have more ability in that oversight process to have oversight

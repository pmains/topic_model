marks the fourth sailor link to the aircraft carrier to take their own life within a year after three Sailors were found last April and this also comes after four apparent suicides linked to the Mid-Atlantic Regional maintenance center also known as marmac in Norfolk and we've learned about that late last year news 3's Zach dalheimer joins us in the studio Zach you spoke with military family members and local leaders what are they telling you tonight well Kurt you just heard from a Navy Widow and the licensed therapist I talked with tonight she says that this is more than a wake-up call mental health is an outspoken issue with the Sailor suicides from this past year and while Washington lawmakers have added more support elected leaders say this recent death is sparking more drive towards a solution it feels like I'm losing a part of my family Dr Sarah Williams is reacting to the most recent sailor assigned to the USS George Washington who died by Suicide I think that we are at the extent of what our previous resources are and it's time for a very conscious change and game plan this sailor is the fourth linked to the ship to take their own life in roughly a year the news about the the most recent death by Suicide just was a real gut punch Wednesday Senator Tim Kaine spoke about this following a visit to marmac and Norfolk two weeks ago to speak with Sailors about mental health after four apparent suicides linked to the center late last year every situation is different so you you have to be humble in generalizing but what strikes me about the George Washington scenarios and the marmic scenarios is that we're we're dealing with a group of sailors who have trained for a particular Mission um but they're actually they're carrying out activities that were sort of not what they trained for and what they went into the Navy for and Kane has said the 2023 National Defense bill passed by the Senate will help provide service members with access to Mental Health Services he also says there are issues that could be specific to Hampton Roads wait times to get a mental health appointment at Portsmouth Naval Hospital the the challenges with the med board process again meanwhile congresswoman Jen kiggins is also weighing in on this latest suicide this is a is unfortunately an ongoing problem that we're seeing she says she's working on legislation to ensure Mental Health Resources for service members we talk about availability accessibility for mental health care you know do we have the providers that are needed she's also looking forward to serving on a congressional task force addressing recruitment retention and quality of life we can do it so much better than what we're doing and I can't wait to ask some hard questions Williams believes action from both Kane and kiggins is a good first step and is hopeful for changes it's beyond just necessary at this point I think we have definitely gone beyond on any resource that we currently have there needs to be a complete overhaul of what's currently in place now kiggins says that task force is set to start in June and could involve many visits to different bases however specifics for that are still being fine-tuned at this time as for Senator Kane he says there's plans to have Navy leaders meet with the Senate armed services committee Zach dahlheimer News 3.

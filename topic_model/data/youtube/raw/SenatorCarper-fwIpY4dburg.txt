the three key ingredients in a stimulus package are one it has to be timely need to do it sooner rather than later the idea of passing something six seven eight months from now when the recession hopefully will be over doesn't make much sense second to targeted to those people that are going to take the money and spend and put it back into the economy the idea of sending money to people just going to save it it's all well and good that they save money but it doesn't help the economy very much the third piece it's got to be temporary this is not something we want to continue forever because it just blows up the deficit even more so we want to make sure there's a limited duration I think the I'm pleased to see that the house representatives in the administration have come together on a package I could quarrel in with parts of it but I'm just glad that they've been able to agree on something it that I think does no harm and may do some some good what will probably want to tweak a little bit in the Senate but I think the goal is to do something through the Senate through the house to the president by the middle of February's ironically eight years ago when Governor George Bush was running for president he gave his speech in Saginaw Michigan in October of 2000 he said elect me president and we'll go to work on carbon dioxide emissions which sure major greenhouse gas leads to global warming and he got to be President he changed his mind and decided not to get involved and it's a little bit like a day late and a dollar short now he's got a year to go my hope is we can still get something done that will reduce harmful emissions reduce this threat that is posed to our planet do so without costing consumers an arm and a leg and putting our economy in a tailspin we're going to have to hustle to to do that and the Senate is already moving legislation that I've worked on a lot and my hope is that we can get something done we'll see our troops done a great job done everything we've asked them to to do the folks who haven't done a great job or the Iraqi government we've been waiting now for about two or three years for them to figure out how to share oil wealth for them to figure out how to share power for them to give a role for the old bath as party people Saddam's political arm give them a chance to come back and be involved in this government we've been waiting for two or three years for them to have provincial elections and the provinces around the country we're still waiting and frankly saw the Iraqi people what we need is for the Iraqi government to do its job we're not going to be in that country forever we can't afford it it's not fair it's not reasonable for us to be there forever and the they had this calm this period of calm the Iraqis need to work things out among themselves and our prez it along with the rest of us but especially the president in this administration need to hammer that home with the Iraqis every single day

mr sillys thank you mr chairman and want to thank you for holding today's hearing each of us has felt the renewed freedom and we enjoy seeing the smiles of our friends and neighbors again this past week as mass mandates have been dropped masks are flying off the faces of americans faster than liberals in washington spend a trillion dollars that is a great thing to see those of us on the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis have a duty and a responsibility to help educate our colleagues our constituents the media and leaders in education and business about how we got here we have had a spirited debate about the effectiveness of lockdowns let's set that aside for today and god willing leave that debate in the rear view mirror where history will ultimately pass their judgment but every one of us on this subcommittee should look our colleagues in the eye and say that there is bipartisan agreement on this subcommittee that it was the vaccine that ended this pandemic so how did we get to this point where america created the fastest vaccine in human history and produced manufactured and distributed enough vaccine to give a shot to every american who wants one the story begins over 30 years ago when the u.s trade representative began negotiating international trade agreements in earnest on a bipartisan basis for three decades ustr made protections of u.s intellectual property a cornerstone of those agreements trade agreements have proved controversial from time to time but what has never been controversial was that if american ingenuity can flourish and is protected that america can compete and win and over that period american pharmaceutical companies led the world in both research and development and the introduction of new life-saving drugs about 25 years ago after republicans took back the majority for the first time since 1955 congress decided to make a major push on biomedical research the republican congress worked within president bill clinton to double the size of the national institute of health during the administration of george w bush the republican congress made yet another major investment in nih with strong bipartisan support during the bush administration the federal government began to take seriously the threat of bioterrorism and pandemic response the executive branch began working with emergent on producing anthrax and smallpox vaccines it takes time and expertise and partnerships to have the infrastructure in place to respond effectively when h1n1 hit during the obama biden administration america was not ready white house chief of staff ron klein actually acknowledged as much saying that we just got lucky well hoping to get lucky is not a smart strategy but we did keep at it we invested in barta the executive branch's relationship with emergent continued throughout the obama years and they continued to develop expertise and infrastructure on some highly sophisticated manufacturing techniques and technologies president bush launched pepfar a public-private partnership to save africa from the aids epidemic a key pillar in that was working with u.s pharmaceutical companies on developing key drugs and protecting their intellectual property and then came fred upton and diana degette and their bipartisan leadership on the 21st century cures act that was one of my proudest efforts during my tenure as majority whip to see that bill signed into law we doubled nih yet again and just as importantly we established the emergency use authorization process upon which this vaccine would be approved a provision that by the way is saving millions of lives in january 2020 china lied to the world and the lies of the communist party of china caused covet 19 to spread throughout the globe igniting the worst pandemic we've seen in a hundred years what we can say now as far as finding a vaccine and a way out of the pandemic is that america led the world president trump's operation warp speed built on 30 years of smart policy was focused on protecting ip investing in biomedical research and investing in public-private partnerships on critical manufacturing infrastructure president trump's leadership on operation warp speed was critical importantly ows leveraged work going back over two administrations republican and democrat to partner with companies like emergent to begin the manufacturing process before the vaccines were even approved that decision proved to be a game changer it is why we could get so many shots in the arms of americans so quickly after getting the emergency use authorization mr chairman president bush at president biden has now put at risk a key pillar of this strategy the protection of united states intellectual property you've seen president biden talking about actually giving away america's intellectual property this is something that would be a cave into the special interests in washington uh some progressives who don't believe that america should be the ones who own our own intellectual property for years republicans and democrats alike were criticizing china's theft of american intellectual property today you've got the biden administration talking about giving away our intellectual property to china for nothing how outrageous would that be imagine where we are because of american ingenuity which is now at risk stripping innovators of their constitutionally protected patents will undermine that very innovation it will weaken our international competitiveness and only help communist china the country that spread this pandemic it would force the american developers of covet 19 vaccines and therapeutics to relinquish their intellectual property rights to these medicines but it will likely take manufacturers years to build the facilities if we give this intellectual property away which we strongly urge the biden administration not to do but if that were to happen it's not like tomorrow they just start making those vaccines that are being made in america what's being made in america is using american infrastructure that was built over years and in fact over multiple administrations republican and democrat that ability does not exist today in china if we give away the technology we lose the technology but china would not be able to safely and effectively mass produce those drugs for years so make no mistake this is not about helping the world get coveted vaccines quicker it's about undermining american ingenuity and intellectual property today's hearing underscores that critical point the federal government has worked with emergent over democrat and republican administrations on complicated sensitive biomedical manufacturing infrastructure and yet the majority feels they need to undermine confidence in the drugs that they produce does anyone believe that handing over us intellectual property to a startup in a far less developed country is going to quickly yield actual safe and effective shots in the arm of course it will not president biden is destroying 30 years of successful bipartisan policy and for what his plan won't even work why don't we protect american intellectual property contract with us manufacturers and help distribute the vaccine to countries who are in need it is a quicker and a smarter strategy there would be more shots given and we wouldn't have to kneecap our future pandemic responses to do it instead of putting shots in arms the biden administration is putting us ip in china's hands that is insane with that mr chairman i yield two minutes to the gentlelady from iowa

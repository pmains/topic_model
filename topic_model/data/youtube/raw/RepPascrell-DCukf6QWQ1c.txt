after three minutes Thank You mr. speaker and thank you mr. ranking member Thank You mr. chairman I'm not going to vote for this piece of legislation not even close everyone talks about how we must maintain the roads if you listened over the last 45 minutes all of these infrastructure issues are in bad shape terrible shape we know the problem so long speeches about this and the problem don't make much sense here's my question to every member of this body what are you prepared to do make believe you're doing something hide under the desk in your office how much money have we used mr. speaker from the general fund to bail out transportation and the percentage of general funds increases each budget that we're using so think without a clear source of long-term funding our state's cannot plan the future in fact many states are not putting money into their trust fund my own state the state of New Jersey I guess the money's going to fall out of the sky so two months four months seven months it's all a joke ensuring the solvency of the trust fund is not only a key component of many our transportation challenges it's our job the ways to the Ways and Means Committee has not even had one hearing mr. ranking member mr. chairman how many states have put themselves in the same position as the federal government I understand that some members already planning another short-term extension in July because he said now we're ready to have a long-term solution where you're already planning for another short-term in July fact we're moving towards the omnibus bill where we'll put everything together it'll be likes to trade transportation lollipops put them all in there put it all in here and then we'll vote on it and have some of our members vote against motherhood so that they'll be on the block a year from this November look let me suggest something novel for this group let's spend the next eight weeks resuscitating a system where users of the system paid to maintain and grow the system international tax can be a part of the solution it's not nearly enough money mr. president mr. Congress a group of us presented a bipartisan plan Republicans and Democrats the fund the federal highway trust fund through Democratic presidents Republican presidents through democratic houses in Republican houses we've always been able to come to a resolution on this until the last three or four years why why is this can have one more minute a half a minute well I'd yield the gentleman an additional minute thank you telezart nice traditional Thank You mr. speaker look neither party has the wherewithal to deal with the problem I believe our model must receive serious consideration as the clock counts down on the trust funds expiration our legislation has the support of both business and labor I'm done with extensions and I plan to vote no today and I ask my colleagues to show support for a long-term bill and co-sponsored the Renee see pasquale plan because we can't don't change something we'll be right back here in July talking to each other thank you very much mr. speaker tellin Pennsylvania you reserve gentleman reserves gentleman

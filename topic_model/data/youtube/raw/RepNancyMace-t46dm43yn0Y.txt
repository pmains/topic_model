and with that i'm going to turn things over to the gentlelady from south carolina one of our new members to talk about d.c statehood and our concerns about that bill so i'm going to turn things over to nancy mays and i want i want to thank congressman cheney and congressman scalise for their leadership on these issues today um i never thought in the first hundred days that more damage could be done in 100 days by this administration than in four years the democrats have taken a very sharp left turn to a place i never thought possible this quick after january we heard a lot about unity and it's been nothing but division it's been a hundred percent partisanship and it's been a grab for more power and i can tell you today i don't believe that most of the american people want to see this power grab by members by any member of congress on either side of the aisle and so when you look at hr 1 right now there's a you know this is totally unconstitutional the right of elections and how they are facilitated how they are authorized to be completed are that's the power of the state not the power of the federal government if you look at iowa too they tried to steal a a legally certified election in iowa with congressman marionette miller meeks the american people voted they voted illegally and it was legally certified we're seeing it now with d.c statehood dc wouldn't even qualify as a singular congressional district and here they are they want the power and the authority of being an entire state in the united states and they want that power we're seeing it with packing the supreme court going from 9 to 13 or attempt to do that and they want to change the system like i literally have a front row seat to the dismantling of our constitution and our freedoms and seeing more power gained by the federal government and less for the american people and that's why i'm here today to fight back against that and i thank you for your time this morning thank you

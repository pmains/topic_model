thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you members of the committee ranking member slaughter for your leadership and your dedication to bringing legislation and it all happens here I just by saying hello to mr. camp chairman camp outside and sending my prayers to him such a fine lovely person as we have we've extended that I'm fine relief and so I hope that this passage of this legislation will contribute to that piece i was listening attentively both when i was in the room and when I was not in the room but hearing on TV jaron distinguished chairman said the cameras in the room to some of the questions and observations that were being made by members and by our distinguished chairman mr. camp and ranking member mr. Levin and I thought you know we're sitting at this table and around this time across our country people are sitting at their kitchen tables having dinner finishing dinner and part of what they will be talking about is how they are going to make ends meet how do middle-income families in our country address the uncertainty that they see in our economy and as I listen to mrs. Fox congresswoman Fox's questions about growth and I heard the Chairman say that growth was so important I think it is important to both back to some of the history that mrs. Fox asked about although mr. Levin and that is to say that in 1993 we passed of an economic bill that did I'll increase taxes we needed revenue and we needed growth and we needed to reduce our deficit and that is exactly what happened so there was an occasion where increase in taxes created an atmosphere where the private sector where most of these jobs are created could create over 20 million jobs and take the deficit down to a place where was on a trajectory of five point six trillion dollars be in surplus which quickly was turned around under new president president bush with Bush tax cuts and other things like the Medicare prescription drug bill and two unpaid-for Wars but just starting with the tax cut which turned that around to a five and a half trillion dollar trajectory to deficit an 11 trillion dollar swing mr. Hoyer knows these facts and figures better than anybody 11 trillion dollar swings unheard of in our country and so I reference it here because you asked mrs. box but also because you're asking us to go right back to where how we got in this fix in the first place tax cuts at the high end which do not create jobs which increase the deficit and on top of it took us to a brink of recession as well deep recession as well as a meltdown of our financial institutions that lack of revenue that sprang from the financial institution meltdown contributed to the deficit as well so that's where the deficit came from tax cuts for the wealthy give away on a Medicare prescription drug bill two unpaid-for Wars meltdown the financial services industry therefore reduction in revenues coming in to the Treasury some disagreement on what what supervision should have been there or not but I don't think there's any disagreement as mr. McGovern said and the fact that we all think middle-income Americans should have a tax cut those making 200 up to 250 thousand dollars a year should get a tax cut if we just pass what we agree on and that's what people to understand why can't you just do what you agree on and then continue the conversation on the rest 250,000 now what does that do 250 between 250 and above you save if you go down this the president is proposing you save a trillion dollars a trillion dollars or you borrow a trillion dollars in the Chinese and others in order to fund that debt but let's get back to that kitchen table what does that mean to me if I'm a middle-income person in our country or a senior a person trying to put put family through school the uncertainty has to their their job their income their their that whether they're going to be able to send their kids to college where they've been hold on to their home the value of their pensions it had it means everything because the uncertainty that is out there for the economy brings uncertainty to that kitchen table kitchen table and in order to create to reduce the deficit I believe you do have to have growth so we want to watch our investments carefully so they produce jobs help create jobs help the private sector great jobs also that brings revenue to the Treasury now at two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year the money that is in the pocket now of the middle income people is money that they will spend they will spend that money they will inject demand into the economy and it will create jobs jobs for them jobs for them but also does is takes a trillion dollars that we don't have to go further into debt by giving tax cuts to high-end and don't have to borrow as I say or China and other lenders adding to the deficit so it's hard to explain to anybody why we can't okay you agree on this we also agree we have to have instant he's been singing this tune forever that we have to have tax fairness and tax simplification we have to address the tax code and that is bipartisan is nonpartisan really but does the right thing for our country I'm going to yield to him the moment I keep referencing him because he's been such a champion on fiscal soundness fair taxes and fairness as you mentioned this room that's an issue for our country it is the theme of America the most enduring theme the American dream and that's predicated on fairness and taking responsibility for each other for one generation to the next so come before the committee to respectfully request your consideration of the alternatives that mr. chairman ranking member 11 presented earlier which said here's a place where we are all in agreement we all agree there has to be a middle income tax cut whatever else we have we can continue that conversation later but do not hold middle income tax cut hostage for giving tax cuts the high end not good jobs increase the deficit and continue injecting uncertainty into the economy which is not a healthy thing for the economy for businesses and for Memphis working families it's a it's a bill that the CBO says ninety-seven percent of small business won't be affected by it I think even Mr Speaker Boehner has concede at that point this is about most small businesses in our country when people come up with that as they and we can't give middle income tax people something because the petrels of the world which we defined as a small business for some reason or other won't get a text but but in any event let's do what we all agree on let's give them their own class families of break I just want to show you one chart and then I'm going to you up to mr. for the the difference between our two bills are as follows bit give the middle income tax cut to those making a middle income tax cuts those making up to 250,000 under the GOP plan people making over a million dollars a year after all if you made a million dollars a year you would get a hundred and sixty thousand dollars an average you and your friends we get on average of a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year in a tax break under the Republican plan and in order to help pay for that middle-income families would on an average have to pay thousand dollars more so not only are we borrowing to cover this we're taking from the middle class to give this tax cut at the high end it's just not fair and so I urge your consideration of what mr. Levin came in and spoke for which is but the president is proposal but is there thank you that creates a very model back my time thank you very much for that missing

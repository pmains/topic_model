chairman I of course want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their bipartisan approach to be able to pass the pact act and uh your work in doing in the implementation and the emphasizing of how important it is to our veterans um what I want to talk about today uh Dr Ella Hall you had mentioned are the veterans at the center of what we do is the first question I want to address uh talk time and I'd like an administrative definition of what talk time means and that question would be for Mr Jacobson Mr bursler it has come to my attention that the VBA for the national call centers has imposed performance standards called Talk time which measures the amount of time legal administrative specialists are on the phone to answer veterans questions while this measure is averaged out it doesn't make expectations it doesn't make exceptions for calls that may require special attention including first notice of death calls if an older veteran has difficulty communicating or if a veteran has complex or several questions if an Las fails this metrics what which can be as little as 8 minutes and 30 seconds the ls the Las can be disciplined which can potentially lead to their termination this focus on call time decentivizes las's from asking follow-up questions to Veterans or or mentioning other benefits and programs the veteran may be eligible for and for the fear of the call going too long my question is uh I had a experience with this as a Township Trustee or the first point of contact is the VA if we're limiting the amount of time to be able to connect with that veteran we will create future challenges and so ultimately what I'm asking is if the reputation and the outcomes in connecting with the veteran is so vitally important with first point of contact why are we limiting the amount of time for those individuals to be inducted into world-class Health Care Congressman thank you very much for that question I agree that veteran experience is critical it's why for the first time ever we're going to start measuring veteran experience as part of the disability compensation process we actively do it and many of our health care domains we haven't done it for disability compensation we we measure success based on timeliness and quality but I think veteran experiences is equally important and to your point it's a determining Factor as to whether or not a veteran wants to continue to pursue the benefits he or she may have earned or to follow up and enroll and pursue VA health care because how do you define talk time administratively so the talk time is about eight minutes is my understanding I need to follow up and get you a a response for the record into the exceptions I thought that there were some carve outs but I need to go back and make sure I don't misspeak and so I'd like to follow up I agree we need to make sure that the call center agents who are off in the front lines have the ability to speak with the veteran or family member who's calling seeking information in a manner that addresses their questions or concerns we also have to manage that with an appropriate balance learning from industry standards so that we can manage our workload and we don't have too many individuals waiting how will you measure veterans quality of care well on the healthcare side there are multiple tools specifically on these calls on on these calls I think what we're looking at is we have what is called V signals um and we have V signals uh V signals let me turn to Mr burstler to speak to the the tools we have at our disposal yes sir it's called veteran signals it's our survey platform that actually monitors and asks veterans after they contact the National contact center or my one what's the participation rate with that fairly significant uh you know I can get you the specific data points but it depends on whether that's the national contact center or 1-800 myva 411 411 which is the single front door and for these types of cases that do take longer to speak with a veteran that has special needs has special needs or special accommodations I would recommend 1-800 myva 411 they push nine they'll get to the hotline right those individuals those contact center representatives are specially trained to handle these types of veterans cases and they can spend as long as they need to and then connect them with the administration or the staff office they can execute their average speed to answer is the lowest across the Enterprise so the point of the question is to emphasize that we do not want to punish individuals who are taking time to care to ask the proper questions so that veterans who were the first point of contact who served our nation aren't being rushed through the process we have to be aware of the fact that that is a deterrent and not something that attracts people and when you create obstacles and you speed through those processes people will be less inclined and then you'll ruin the reputation of a program that is designed to be able to create Quality Health Care so what I'm asking you to do is to pay special attention to that when you do not limit time for individuals to have connectivity to the program that we are implementing for world-class health care I'm asking you to explore avenues that allow those conversations to continue at a desperate moment why someone's calling in Congressman if it's okay I'd like to follow up and talk about this with you and your staff in more detail and how we balance the talk time the time to First Response the dropped call rate and manage the overall experience because I think this is a really important issue I know it's one we're actively hiring for our call center agents they are incredibly important uh staff members on our team they're also often uh promoted to VSR positions as they seek career growth and so we constantly have to backfill and I know that there are multiple elements that influence how we manage this and I'd like to talk with you a little bit more and make sure that I address your concerns in detail and I know I've gone over but the fact of the matter is if one veteran feels a disconnection they'll go back to the vsos and you'll ruin the reputation of this program and you'll have less participants this is something that has to be addressed thank you

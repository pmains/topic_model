but first of all don't you say a special thanks to Senator corker not not just for what he said on here about the issues that we face an path forward but the nice words he said about his friend from de Lorean they're just a pleasure to serve with you and thank you thank you for introducing the concept of kalat town hall meetings to because we do a lot of those in color and I learned that from you mr. arrived mr. president uh president has been likening the the squabble is going on here to it like a family squabble and between a husband and a wife and he says what husbands our wives usually do is they figure out what their differences are they find some middle ground some compromise and they work them out one of things I love to do is I want to go up and down my stay I talked to people who have been married sometimes a long time and I'm sure this happens with the presiding officer people had 50 years 60 years 70 years and I always like to ask my well what is the key to being married 50 or 60 or 70 years and I got some really funny answer some great answers as well I'm sure you do too but one of my favorite answers was a couple of separates the two seas said to season I said well what is that and they said that communicate and compromise that's really communicate and compromise where's a little theme going on here with the former governor of Virginia Senator Warner former mayor of Chattanooga senator corker and a former governor of delaware and i just want to come continue with that theme somebody said to me I go home at night is presiding officer knows tudela would usually take the train go home at night come back the next morning and this morning I was walking on the platform to catch my train come down here at seven-fifteen and one person said to me I said y'all are acting like a state legislature down there in the Senate and I said no that's not the way we acted in Dover Delaware you know in Delaware and when I was governor for those eight years we had a Democratic Senate like we have here we had a Republican House like we have here we had a Democratic governor for those eight years yet we managed to it to work out our differences to communicate in to compromise and to be able to balance our budget eight years in a row cut taxes seven out of those eight years grad tens of thousands of jobs in a little state like Delaware which is no mean feat and to get ourselves a triple-a credit rating for the first time in history of the state that's why you can do when you communicate and you compromise in good faith this is at the end of each negotiations and I think largely taken in good good faith bye-bye good part you have a lot of respect certainly for our own leader leaders and a lot of respect to healthy respect for the speaker over the house with whom I serve area very briefly I think he's an honorable person and guy tries to do what's right but this is I think the president said that I've heard this from pretty good sources president said last night to the speaker's of the house will take your number will agree on the the spending cuts we may may think it's a little too much focus on domestic discretionary spending not enough on defense not really anything on the entitlements and as I understand nothing on the revenue side so it's not a balanced package but but we'll take your number and this is ended up not so much a debate or discussion over how much we're going to further reduce spinning in in this fiscal year the the discussion is things that that we I think we address already here in this body this week on whether or not the Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed to comply with the Clean Air Act is ordered by the Supreme Court to reduce pollution or are we going to try to hand their tie their hands and in some kind of special as a writer attaching a rider to what should be a continuing resolution to fund the government we already had went four times four bites out of the Apple here this week and none of the amendments to tie the hands of EPA and your ability to enforce the Clean Air Act none of those amendments pass and so now what we're trying to do with our friends and I think the other body is to somehow put in the legislation is with a rider language it would fly in the face of what we already decided here the second thing is former governor realize I was real active in the National Governors Association one of the things that I worked on hard and George Voinovich when he was a governor from Ohio we worked real hard on on legislation that they said we don't like federal mandates that we as states don't like to have federal mandates to say you got to spend money on something or you can't spend money on something or you can't you got to raise your revenues in this way your God Raisman in that way we didn't never like that McClure Congress actually passed bill clinton signed legislation on unfunded mandates i said you really can't do that and we don't do it nearly as much as we used to but part of the dust up here on one of the riders to tell the District of Columbia what the candor cannot do with their money not with federal money but what they can or can't do with their money mr. violation as far as I'm concerned of of the unfunded mandate the law that exists it certainly in spirit is not in in truth the other thing is one of the issues that we appear to be divided on is is the wedding spent federal money should be used for for family planning I think we all agree here that we ought to have worked toward having fewer abortions I think almost everybody agrees that we'd like to have fewer abortions well one of the ways to make sure we have more abortions it's actually reduce the money that set aside for family planning it's just counterintuitive you want fewer abortions well cut funding for a family plan that makes no sense to me no sense to me and I hope that we'll walk away from from making that bad decision the again to echo the comments of our friends from from Virginia and Tennessee you just preceded me the this is a this is a speed bump ahead of us and you know we're talking about how to come up with our four or five or six billion dollars in savings for for the rest of this fiscal year how about when it's we're looking for four trillion dollars of savings over the next ten years that's the tough negotiation and it all has to be on the table just can't be discretionary spending on the domestic side we can eliminate it entirely we still have a big budget deficit I defense has to be on the table so smart ways we're spending last year 400 2 billion dollars major weapon systems cost overruns 402 billion that's up from 42 billion ten years ago a defense has to be on the table the entire must have to be on the table it's a big part of our spending revenues have to be on the table we've been given I think a very good road map for it not a perfect road map but a good road map with their work by the deficit commission chaired co-chaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson my hope is it will adhere that last thing i want to say mr. it mr. president coming down on a train today i read the business section of it was in new york times there's actually some pretty encouraging stuff in there one of the things i reported on we just got the retail sales and numbers for for last month most people most analysts thought they'd be down there on is that a auto dealership is last weekend in the milford delaware and we're talking about car sales and they're not flat there up there up by by a good deal not just at that dealership but but throughout the my statement about the nation you're like about two years ago we're selling nine million cars trucks and vans a year last year up to 11 million this year we'll probably up to 13 million and credits available again and things moving in the right the right direction every Thursday is a leader knows that we we got a number from the bottom of Labor its new unemployment filings and how many people have filed a claim for a new claim for unemployment we get every week every Thursday and if you go back to the end of two thousand eight the I think the top number is about 11 week 660,000 violence people filing for unemployment new claims the end of 2008 for yesterday for the last week we're down to about 380 390,000 and when the number gives that low we seed new jobs being created we saw a jobs number 4 March new jobs 220 I think thousand two hundred twenty thousand private-sector jobs being created we're going the right way we're going to the right way finally and the idea the economy the economic recovery is beginning and we need to strengthen it one of the worst ways to undermine and one of the best ways to underline in one of the worst ways we could do is to add to uncertainly add one picked of unpredictability I'm not sure who said this but one of my colleagues before maybe is John instant over here said this before but but one of the things that businesses need want the markets need and want certainty predictability and one of the reasons why big companies are sitting on the sidelines a bunch of them still and not hiring people even though they're sitting on a lot of cash is because of unpredictability what are we going to do on a budget not just the short term run up but what we going to do about the big deal for a 10-year plans or three or four or five trillion dollars in savings what are we going to do about health care what's the Supreme Court going to do one with respect to health care they're going to somehow throw it out are we going to be able to fix it and make it even better what are we going to do about energy policy what are we going to do about tax policy what are we going to do about transportation probably all those uncertainties and we need to resolve them and we can begin to resolve at least a budgetary uncertainty here by agreeing on a reasonable spending reduction plan for the balance of this fiscal year to a go to work on the much tougher problem and that is how to take four trillion dollars out of our debt in the the years to come last thing I want to say a couple of us been working on this in Homeland Security government affairs committee what we're beginning to do is to use our committee in our committees jurisdiction to look into every nook and cranny of federal government to ask this question how do we get better results for less money how do we get better results for less money in domestic spending how do we get better results for less money and defense spending how do we get better results for less money in entitlement programs how do we and frankly with the the tax expenditures as well how do we get better results I call it getting rid of a call show spendthrift and replacing it with a culture of rift and above and beyond all the other stuff we need to do that as well because everything I do I know I can do better I think the same is true of all of us we can all everything we do we can do better the same is true of federal programs and the question we have to ask as we looked at every one every nook and cranny of the federal government is to ask this question can we get better results for less money or at least better results for the same amount of money or not much more money and for a lot of them the answer is yes we can and for us the challenges to do that with that having been said I yield back my time I see my friend from Nevada is over he's anxious to to agree with everything I've said and I welcome that thank you

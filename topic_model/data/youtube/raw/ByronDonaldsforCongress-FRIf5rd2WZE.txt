I'm everything the fake news media tells you doesn't exist a strong Trump supporting gun owning liberty-loving pro-life politically incorrect blackmail I'm Byron Dunn's I'm running for Congress Florida State Representative byron Donald's releasing that campaign video yesterday announcing his bid for US Congress he is the latest Republican running to replace retiring Florida representative Francis Rooney who is conservative state congressman Byron Donald joins us now good morning to you thank you so much for being here morning Anjali thanks for having loved the ad it was it tell us about you I'm frigidly from Brooklyn New York grew up here poor me and my mom you know she was really dedicated to my future and so education was strong for her so I went to college in Tallahassee Florida Bono's and also Florida State University's where I graduated from I live in Naples been there since 2003 I raised three kids with my wife Erika and I've been a finance a financial adviser and a banker in the community for 16 years why do you want to run for Congress because frankly we need a conservative that you can believe in in Congress the key thing in our area number one is that immigration is massively important to us we want to make sure that we actually fix our borders they'll actually have an immigration system that works for all people trying to come to America the right way and it also protects American citizenship which is which is vital in the lives of all Americans but even bigger than that we have to have people who are gonna stand firm on conservative principles a standard for the United States Constitution I've been a constitutionalist ever been I've ever since I've been in politics the last ten years and so for me it's important to go to Washington to fight for the Constitution and also begin the work of expanding the Republican Party because we have to have new voices new faces people were going to help expand our tent stand for the President and not only win in 2020 but in the years beyond if you look at the statistics african-americans generally are Democrats especially New Yorkers you're originally from Brooklyn and Naples is conservative how did you become a conservative self discovery I didn't really care about politics as a kid I wasn't in studi body government I didn't come up in a political family it was actually through the financial collapse in 2008 through my career where I actually did my own research did my own affection reading John Locke and Montesquieu reading about Magna Carta and actually the foundations of our United States Constitution why America is that that beacon on the hill that shining city on a hill like President Reagan talked about and so through all that self-discovery I realized that I'm actually a conservative and if you actually talk to a lot of black voters away from politics they whole conservative leanings if you talk to Hispanic voters away from politics they whole conservative leanings but the number one thing I always find when I engage with them in discuss with them is do they feel they have a home in a Republican Party and so one of the reasons why I'm running is a stand for the Constitution absolutely and a fight for the people of Southwest Florida but it's also to expand our tent and expand our base and show them that conservatism is a home for all Americans no matter where you come from no matter how you grew up no guns are important to you you want to hold the Constitution and you say that God saved you and not government absolutely we wish you all the best thank you so much for coming up I know you're not gonna get to see your mom do you want to say a message to your mom mom I love you and for everybody at home then go to Byron Donald back home would love to have your support okay great she did a great job with you Byron thank you god bless you

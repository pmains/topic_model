another part of our history that's very closely relates to this madam price is going to be something that I'll be part of this afternoon later we over on the house side where a congressman David trone of Maryland and I along with Senator Durbin and Congressman clay from st. Louis and congressman Wagner from st. Louis we're sending a letter to the Baseball Hall of Fame telling the Baseball Hall of Fame that they need to include Curt Flood in the Baseball Hall of Fame now Curt Flood was a great player and just on his playing skills alone should be part of the Baseball Hall of Fame he played most almost his entire career with the Cardinals seven consecutive years that included two World Series pennants in 1964 and 1967 he won seven gold Gloves in that 10 years designated in that seven years rather the the best centerfielder in the National League I remember that team well we were Cardinal fans at my house and in the late fifties early sixties you didn't have very many sports on TV but we written to listen to every Cardinal game that we could hear on the radio I remember on the my mom and dad were dairy farmers I remember being out hauling hay at night and whoever was driving the truck should have been almost deaf because the radio if there was a Cardinals game going on would be as loud as it could possibly be so those of us out tossing the bales on the hay truck could hear what the Kier the Cardinals game I also remember and I checked myself yesterday be sure I was was was accurate but on that Curt Flood team at 1964 team it was Bill White at first base who Lee and Harvey air at second base dick grote shortstop ken Boyer at third base Tim McCarver catching most of the time and always if Bob Gibson was Pete it was pitching and in the outfield it was Lou Brock great Lou Brock Curt Flood in center field and Mike Shanin in right field Mike Shanin by the way still announces on the radio and occasionally on television the Cardinals games but it was a great team and Curt Flood was an important part of that team and frankly he should be in the Hall of Fame just because of that two World Series most valuable the the best centerfielder in baseball at least in the National League seven years straight but in 1969 the Cardinals decided they were going to trade Curt Flood to the Phillies now I don't think Curt Flood had anything necessarily against the Phillies but he didn't want to be traded against his will and so he wrote a letter to the Commissioner of baseball and in that letter he said after 12 years in the major leagues I do not feel that I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes that began the challenge to the reserve clause in baseball and may be particularly significant here in Black History Month that a african-american player was the one that challenged the reserve clause but the reserve clause in baseball you would play for your team's owner as long as you wanted to play unless your team's owner decided you would play for someone else and then you'd play for that person as long as they wanted you to play unless you decided you didn't want to play baseball anymore so it was Curt Flood who challenged that he lost a Supreme Court case a 5-4 loss in the Supreme Court but it didn't take too many years before not only was the reserve clause reversed but Curt Flood was recognized in federal legislation this single page letter filed as part of the 1970 case there's a copy of that letter at the Hall of famous Cooperstown if there's a copy of Curt Clyde's letter in the Hall of Fame Curt Flood should be in the Hall of Fame and I hope those looking back at what's called the golden years of baseball that look at players who didn't get into the Hall of Fame we'll take our advice look at Curt Flood look at the difference he has made for players playing the game today and put him in the whole thing

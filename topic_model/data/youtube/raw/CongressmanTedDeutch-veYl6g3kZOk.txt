speaking of members of Congress when we bring on Ted Deutsch he is the member of Congress that represents this part of Broward County congressman Ted George so congressman what have you learned since what more new information do you think you have that you can share well I'm not thanks for having me first of all I'm not I'm not sure what the latest information is that you have we know that that this is just just the the worst it's the worst day and in Parkland describe Parkland for our viewers that don't know Broward County don't know what's don't know the western part of brower's or Dade yeah this is I it's just a beautiful it's an idyllic community Chuck this is a it's a wonderful community Douglass High School is one of the best high schools in the state of Florida I visit often I was there just a few weeks ago talking to students the kids are remarkable the teachers are dedicated and committed the parents are involved in the schools this is I mean if you if you had to describe just a perfect place to live and raise a family this would be it and and yet here we are talking about a fool a school another school shooting right in the midst of all of this this is this is one of those moments where when you watch the footage of kids running out of the school with their hands up and police and first responders going in with their guns to try to secure the school and you think boy we've seen these images just so regularly you realize that indeed this can happen everywhere but the fact is it shouldn't have to happen in your own community for you could care about it it does seem as if that that's when people focus on it when it touches them and and I get we all get that what do you that mean look as you know Sandy Hook is about as true as it gets in one of these things the Las Vegas shooting the worst massacre we've ever seen and it didn't seem to budge Congress at all there didn't even seem to be a desire to even start a commission to think about solutions right look I've been I've devoted an enormous amount of my time here in Congress trying to do something to stem the tide of gun violence but let lets me here's a suggestion Chuck instead of letting this devolve into the typical political discussion with people tweeting at me telling me now is not the time to have conversations about about gun safety and other sayings stop trying to interfere with the Second Amendment my Second Amendment rights and others saying it's about mental health issues why aren't we talking about that let's talk about all of it and let's do it in a way that's not political let's forget about commissions first of all do you think that's possible anymore to do anything that doesn't get politicized look I I can't believe that that Congress hasn't done anything since Sandy Hook I can't believe it but the fact is for every one has an excuse but everyone also acknowledges that days like today are awful and this is a terrible terrible day it is so grim and the story the people that I talk to the families that I've spoken with back in the district to sheriff the superintendent the mayor this is as bad as it gets so I agree let's not politicize it but let's let's sit down and have the conversation if you think it's about mental health then let's figure out how to address that if you think that there are steps that we can take common-sense measures that won't interfere with any one second member rights then let's talk about that but by all means let's just not let this go I mean we're gonna have a moment of silence because that's what we do here that's what we do and we're gonna and we all the time but at this point we've got to would follow up with something no one should feel it shouldn't take every member of Congress to feel the way that I feel right now for us to commit ourselves to do something about this it's not political so these are these are some of the best kids in the country and what they went through today is unspeakable and it's awful and we've got to do something about it congressman I want to end it there because I think I can't imagine you have an any other better answer than that that was that was I think it touched I would hope that touched a lot of people no matter their politics anyway congressman Joyce thanks for coming on good luck with these families and we'll check in

now i'd like to invite senator menendez up to say a few words senator well thank you good morning everyone let me start off by thanking the governor for his leadership i have worked with various governors and some have created highways of opportunity and others have created roadblocks to the future and this one creates highways of opportunity so governor thank you for your leadership it's important that we are here today and we always are thrilled to have the first lady as another voice in support of these issues mr secretary we are thrilled to welcome you to new jersey when your nomination was up for confirmation uh this is the first thing i talked to you about you were clear-eyed about the importance of it and i asked you for a commitment and you've kept your word so thank you mr secretary for what you're doing i appreciate all of the elected officials here i want to all politics is local so mayor santos thank you for hosting us today we appreciate you very much and craig guy who's representing the county executive of hudson county here thank you craig for joining us of course uh all of those distinguished leaders in our transportation both nationally state and local who are here as well for the sake of time i won't recognize them all again but they are extraordinary to work with and this day has been a long time coming for years inc has been spilled speeches have been delivered and legislation has been passed reiterating the need to replace the portal bridge over the years this critical piece of infrastructure has evolved from a transit marvel into a transit nightmare it's old punctuation point it's old it's limiting and it's unreliable one out of every seven times it fails to lock back into place after opening for ships to pass and when that happens a crew of maintenance workers as the secretary said take out their sledgehammers and try to bring it back into position in the 21st century we simply cannot have infrastructure that requires the equivalent of banging on the tv to make it work again infrastructure that even when it works slows down hundreds of trains each day because of speed restrictions simply put the portal bridge is a choke point on the busiest stretch of rail in america it is a choke point on the future and we deserve better today we turn the page when the new portal bridge opens it will be fixed in place and high enough for marine traffic to pass below unimpeded it will spare hundreds of thousands of passengers each day for malfunctions and delays for travelers it will mean less time stuck on the train and more time with their families and loved ones more productivity at work and at their final destinations and for our region it will help us double rail capacity between newark and manhattan as part of the broader gateway program and for our communities this project is directly tied to more jobs higher wages and greater productivity it's an essential part of our plan to remake the northeast corridor which benefits our state and the entire country maximizing the impact of a region that contributes 3.7 trillion dollars to the national gross domestic product 20 percent of gdp that's why when administrator fernandez was before our committee on banking that has jurisdiction over transit i said to her this is a project of national significance and today we make that case and that's why i call gateway a project of national significance and we won't stop until we get those two new trans-hudson tunnels to make sure that we can move people effectively now this project has been a long battle i started on this project when i was still in the house of representatives when i came to the senate working with the late frank lautenberg we got the largest federal commitment to a mass transit project at that time in history the ark tunnel unfortunately we had someone who didn't have the vision that governor murphy has and basically it went poof gave it away gave it away the incredible work that went at that time and so we had to start all over again so i'm proud to have as my colleague senator booker has worked with me side by side since he came to the senate to make this happen and an incredible house delegation you know we rejoice in a lot of things and there's a lot of credit but we wouldn't be here today but for the votes of the members of the house of representatives the united states senate in the largest infrastructure project since eisenhower created the national highway system back in 2015 we celebrated preliminary construction thanks to a 16 million tiger grant that we convinced the then secretary that made a lot of sense to invest in new jersey last january after years of political delays this project should have already been on its way but because of years of political delays under the previous administration we didn't get moving but last january we secured 766 million to the fta's capital investment grants program a few months later we passed that landmark bipartisan infrastructure law which helps this project access federal funds when it needs them and as your united states senators it's our job and our duty but i'd be remiss if i didn't acknowledge that this was a team effort folks here represent the unique partnership between state and federal officials the d.o.t and transit agencies alike it's a partnership that recognizes that an all hands on deck endeavor one that will not only replace the portal bridge but also build brand new hudson river tunnels and complete the entire gateway program happens i'll end with this the secretary budages has spoken eloquently about the importance of transportation saying that travel is synonymous with growth adventure and love so much so that he even proposed to his now husband at an airport terminal in o'hare in the daily drum beat of our lives as public officials we often lose sight of the bigger picture this is more than rail and metal and steel this is about much more than that it's about people getting to work and being productive it's about someone who needs chemotherapy going to one of the incredible hospitals along the northeast corridor it's about a mom or dad getting home it from work in time to make a child's recital or a little league game it's about spending more time with family and less in traffic it's about breathing cleaner air it's about quality of life the bridge behind me has faithfully served for over a hundred years carrying millions and millions of travelers from everyday commuters or tourists seeing new york for the first time it has opened countless time to let ships go through and be part of that great supply chain it has witnessed unimaginable change and transformation the question now remains what stories will be written once the new bridge is complete what will the next hundred years the next portal north bridge give us one thing is for certain when it opens it will no doubt be synonymous with growth adventure and love thank you all [Applause]

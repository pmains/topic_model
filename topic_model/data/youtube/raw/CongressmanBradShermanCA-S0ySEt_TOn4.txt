congressman brad Sherman he's with us today yes he represents much of the San Fernando Valley he is also on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs welcome congressman so as you heard there as the Iraqi army moves into Fallujah over the weekend Donald Trump came out with his plan to defeat Isis and it involves taking over the oil fields getting control of the oil and what do you think about his plan this is memorial day we owe it to our men and women in uniform to have a foreign policy that steady that make that makes sense and that minimizes casualties the oil fields that Isis controls are far from any ocean they're of moderate importance and for us to hold them would involve casualties inconsistent with what we owe our men and women in uniform I don't think he has a serious plan to to seize Isis oil and of course that oil belongs to the Iraqis and to the Syrians were where it's located you're not doing that without troops on the ground you would have to have troops on the ground to defend the oil troops on the ground to take the oil and troops around the world to deal with the blowback of seizing the oil I don't think it's a serious I mean as an entertainment device perhaps but you know when you think of the people who have died protecting our freedom you need to have a serious policy one that treats Isis as a problem but does not expose us to thousands of additional casualties so you saw the report there it looks like they will be successful in taking over fallujah the big concern also is what happens afterwards in that region and also the trust you have for the people who live in Fallujah many of them are Sunni we have Shias that are coming into the area back by Iranian forces how do you what kind of land is there in place for what takes place after Fallujah is a recovered the fickle loyalties of the Sunni tribes are critical here you can't just take and hold Fallujah with Shiite forces and certainly not Iranian forces so they're going to have to be able to win over sufficient Sunni tribes to to occupy the area and this is just Fallujah the city under Isis control is mosel and that will be sometime next year or even the year after as we head into an election you know we're hearing candidates plans now you have Bernie Sanders who says we should absolutely not have troops on the ground to defeat Isis but you have both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump with plans to broaden our approach in the Middle East and to to increase forces there to defeat Isis do you think that either of their plans have any merit at this point i think that the commitment of ground forces has to be either zero or very limited but we can change the rules of engagement for our air campaign right now how does Isis get money it trucks the oil and tankers to Turkey in the black market and sells it we don't hit those tankers we can see a whole convoy of tankers we don't hit them on the theory that the drivers might be civilians oh that means like where have one arm behind our back yes I mean think of what we did during World War Two to occupied France and other occupied allies of the United States we hit the strategic targets especially from a morality standpoint you can say well you didn't endanger several civilians and I'm not sure they're civilians are working for Isis but several civilians but if you let Isis hold onto mosel for an extra week because you let them get that money and you let them have that power how many people died in Mosul how many family were raped how many were beheaded how many were whipped to me the moral thing is to contract Isis as control as quickly as possible and if people want to work as Isis truck drivers they should that's their risk when I asked you about the election here we are used to just brew into town last night so you're here with a week until voters go to the polls here for the primary Hillary Clinton sort of stepping things up here in California she has five more rallies now planned for this area the polls are tightening did you expect your Hillary supporter did you expect and you said you also friends with Bernie Sanders news expect that the race would tighten this closely this close to the to the primary yes I did I'm I'm a strong Hillary Clinton supporter but I'm a good friend of Bernie Sanders he and I served on the Financial Services Committee and in fact the the bill that is probably central to his candidacy is the bill to break up the big banks that's the Sanders Sherman bill that he and I have worked on for the last six years so I think a lot of her Hillary Clinton makes a better candidate for president I think she brings the experience necessary to run our foreign policy particularly on memorial day when you think of how do you protect the country that others died protecting and at the same time not expose us to turn unnecessary casualties I think she's the best person to assume that role oh sorry I have to ask you this because you know she has come out although her and Trump seemed to think that we do need forces to defeat Isis over in the Middle East she has come out strongly against his rhetoric saying that it is dangerous rhetoric and that he's basically helping recruitment for Isis in the language that he uses and you know over the weekend Michael Hayden the former CIA and NSA director basically agree with her would you say that rhetoric here is is almost as dangerous the number one goal of Isis is to convince the Muslim world that there is a clash of civilizations and that all Muslims have to be on one side namely the ISIS side their goal is to take themselves from an extremist small group until to the govern force of a Muslim world at war with with us and the best way eight that is with allies in the Muslim world when you declare that you won't let King Abdullah of Jordan visit the United States unless he changes his religion when you declare that even our fighting men and women abroad cannot come back to the United States if they're Muslim and that was his original position Trump's position he's walked it back a little bit since then but when you exclude foreign leaders when you exclude not only US citizens but a fighting men and women then you're playing right indices his hands you're saying we are at war not with a few extremists but with all of Islam all right congressman you want you to stick around for just a second we actually have some social media coming in from your constituents some of our viewers there have some questions for you we'll begin with drew in LA asking you please ask if we will hire new and more ice and customs Border Patrol officers and increase funding for them really big story this past week with all the long lines at all of our various for your ports and yeah and also just the border at the Border Patrol it's two issues one is TSA we've got long lines at airports we need to hire more people to check and we've got to explore new technologies and the other is our orders Border Patrol I think the idea of building a wall along the entire length of the border is is absurd when you look at the topography when you look at the canyons there are certain areas where that's completely unnecessary and useless what about more officers as he was talking about a lot o we you know it's Trump has tried to create this image that only he is for a secure border the fact is Democrats in Congress including Hillary Clinton and myself have voted to substantially increase the Border Patrol and with it with additional officers and I I think that we need to do that and what we've seen is a very substantial decline in illegal immigration from Mexico into the United States part of that is a better economy in Mexico part of that and and the evening can't do with these things we want to get one more in because I actually have this question as well sports Mays media wants to know would you cite legislation prohibiting door-to-door solicitation and advertising in order to stop burglaries in LA because apparently Beverly Hills has that legislation I did not know that that's got to be a local matter there are places in this country where people don't even lock their doors right and you cannot have one rule for Beverly Hills and also apply it to rural Kansas that being said I've had volunteers go door to door for me and the only thing they stole was votes from my opponent oh there you go all right Congress bedrooms thank you for you see you thank you so much for your time here always good to have you in town a day full of parades picnics trips to the beach obviously we often forget about what Memorial Day really is all about well Phil Schumann introduces us to one veteran whose emotional story captures the meaning of Memorial Day with patriotic parades coast to coast most of us will no doubt take at least a moment to think

the political class told us there was no way you could run a campaign based on the Constitution and proposing big bold conservative solutions and our town halls and they didn't bet on us because they didn't know you you're really interested in passing on the meaning of America to the next generation you told us that you want a United Republican Party that is about the American promise for every race for every region for every generation you told us that you're sick of political games because the dreams of our kids and grandkids are not games you want bigger ideas to tackle the big problems that we face you still believe in the Nebraska way and the American creed because it wasn't just the hope and the promise of yesterday but it's the hope and promised of our kids for tomorrow and what we found is that people across our state believe the same things we believe around our breakfast table we're sick of the false choices the silly claim that if you love your neighbor the only way you can express it is by supporting ever-expanding federal programs oddly I was attacked in this campaign for having talked to Democrats before well tell you what we're going to keep talking to Democrats we're going to do it a lot more because we want to win them to the right side of the fight for as Nebraskans and as the inheritors of American exceptionalism and yes this is an exceptional nation we believe that we have before us tomorrow's that are more thrilling than the glories of our yesterday thank you again for all your support you

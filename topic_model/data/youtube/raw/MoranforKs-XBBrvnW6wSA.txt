we want to make certain that good things occur here on behalf of candidates here in Sedgwick County across the state and around the country and that just takes people who care about our country and one step further even though they care we now need people to step forward roll up their sleeves and go to work to help candidates get elected individuals who know their neighbors who communicate with their friends at church classmates parents at school the best way that we have the opportunity to convince people whether someone they should whether they should vote for someone or not is the purple relationship to we all develop some people Tip O'Neill said that all politics is local and there is a lot of truth to that but in my view all politics is personal and what we need are all of you and your friends and neighbors who decide to personally engage in support of candidates they believe in that would be beneficial to the cause and from my perspective in Washington DC as a as United States Senator my job my civic responsibility is no different than any other citizen in this country and that's to make certain that the freedoms and liberties there we are guaranteed to have thanks to our Constitution are preserved and protected for not only ourselves but for another generation of Americans and to make certain that the American dream the opportunity for these young kids to grow up and have a bright future to pursue the things in their lives that bring meaning and success to them but the American Dream is alive and welcome home and so while I want us to have a lot of fun in every campaign across the state we will have fun on victory night the ultimate goal is to make certain that our country our state and our nation is well government and the future generations have been bent us of our our nation's founding fathers views thanks to our elected officials thanks for all of you to support all of us thank you for Rob and I my wife and I for the opportunity you've given us to try to make a difference on behalf of Kansans in the nation's capital I got bless each and every one

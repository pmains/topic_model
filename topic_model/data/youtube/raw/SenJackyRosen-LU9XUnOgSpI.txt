as we said before since 1997 this summit this summit's been a forum for bringing together leaders across state lines to develop solutions real solutions to protect this beloved treasure and this year's summit theme is protecting lake tahoe's future and i hope today's summit will be a chance to reflect on the progress we've made to restore the tahoe basin over the last two decades since the lake tahoe restoration act to discuss current challenges surrounding communities face and to find ways to preserve lake tahoe for generations to come as we all know lake tahoe is a critical part of our region's environment and ecosystem it has incredible cultural significance as you've heard for so many and it also plays a key role in our economic success people come to nevada and california from all over the country and the world to enjoy lake tahoe to revel in seeing one of the world's most beautiful and clearest clearest bodies of water and in fact over 15 million visitors come here each year for the outdoor recreational opportunities like skiing biking hiking water sports kayaking you name it maybe just walking along and breathing in the fresh air and as a result lake tahoe brings in 5 billion dollars actually over five billion dollars to the economy and supports hundreds and hundreds of local jobs so by investing in these efforts to protect lake tahoe we're also investing in the people who live here we're investing in the people who work here we're investing in supporting the small business owners here and in nevada uh many of you know we we have a saying it's our state motto i'm sure many here could probably sing the song but hope means nevada home means nevada and lake tahoe is part of our nevada home and we have to keep it safe and protected so that our children and our grandchildren have the same opportunity to enjoy it many years to come and as one of nevada's u.s senators i'm fighting to do that in congress we're fighting to do that in congress and i'm proud to have have helped introduce legislation last year alongside senators cortez masto feinstein and padilla to re-authorize the lake tahoe restoration act this landmark law which is set to expire in two years is one of the strongest protections that lake tahoe has it prioritizes funding for forest health and hazardous fuels reduction watershed restoration environmental improvement programs and invases invasive species management right here in lake tahoe so we're working to make sure that these various programs remain active and they remain plentiful it's why we've secured over 29 million dollars in the most recent bipartisan government funding package to continue to implement the lake tahoe restoration act and additionally the bipartisan infrastructure law which i helped write and pass which many of the members of congress today help to shape and pass as well is also providing an additional 17 million dollars in funding for the restoration of lake tahoe again through the lake tahoe restoration act but it's not all that our new infrastructure plan is doing for lake tahoe the bipartisan infrastructure law also providing much needed funds to repair and to upgrade our roads and trails leading to this area bringing people here it's going to make it more easily accessible for everyone the bipartisan infrastructure law takes important steps to strengthen and protect the tahoe community against the dangers of natural disasters like wildfires and drought which threaten the lake which threaten all of us and we've seen year after year wildfires again in the drought severely severely impacting their region and if we don't take proactive steps to address them the consequences are just too high to bear climate change and hotter temperatures directly connected to wildfires and the lack of water availability in the area and the longer we fail to address climate change the more dangerous the more costly the more it hurts ourselves our families our communities and our kids the impact again so great so i support the bold efforts to tackle the climate crisis including legislation that supports our long-term goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions and protect our public lands [Applause] it's why just recently we passed the water resources development act in the senate which includes funding specifically to help lake tahoe basin the whole ecosystem and it funds water infrastructure projects across so many communities it's why we recent recently passed the inflation reduction act investing 370 billion dollars in climate action clean energy jobs which will help cut the u.s carbon emissions by over 40 percent by 2030 it also includes four billion dollars in funding to combat drought in western states like ours california all throughout the west extreme drought four billion dollars in funding i'm going to look at the chiefs and i see i know people from first responders are out there but the other dangerous threat to this lake i'm sure each one of them can get up here and talk about it is wildfires and i don't have to tell anybody here how dangerous these threats are for our safety for our communities for our future for our friends our neighbors the air we breathe for for all of it again i i thank you and your teams for running in to the fire and doing everything you can but it is the reason for you and your firefighters and your families and all of us here and so many that aren't that we have to continue to find and implement solutions to prevent and mitigate and mitigate the effects of wildfires because as of august 11th of this year over 40 000 fires they're putting nearly six million acres of the united states at risk it's a lot of communities and so it's why i've been pushing to make sure we take action to detect these fires through earlier through technology like satellites and in partnership with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa i'm pleased to report that the bipartisan wildfire preparedness legislation that advanced out of committee and toward the senate floor now includes my amendments to do just that and i've worked to push forward legislation that would allow us to declare federal smoke emergencies so that we can able federal agencies to take swift and immediate action to help communities during times of crisis we know how horrific it is when we can't see the sun and we can't see the sky we know it up here in northern nevada everyone and we have to do things to protect ourselves and our communities as quickly as we can and so our tahoe community you're preparing every day to address the threats that wildfires pose including through the washoe tribe's new sawmill which will help to process dead and dying dry brush and wood that would otherwise fuel these fires but we can't combat these fires without supporting the men and women again who risked their lives to protect us all are heroic firefighters it's why senators cortez masto feinstein padilla and i all made sure we all made sure that the bipartisan infrastructure law provided 600 million dollars to increase compensate compensation for our federal wildland firefighters those hot shot firefighters that run in it's why i'm leading the effort along with the rest of the delegation tahoe delegation the senate all of us to increase retention for these incredible forest service staff i see some of you sprinkled all around and all of our public land managers to be sure that they can be here to do the incredible work that they do day in and day out to make this a safe wonderful experience protecting it and for everyone because across the board protecting lake tahoe's future it requires dedicated people in place to act and we have to support that dedication and so i was glad to be joined again by senators cortes masto feinstein and padilla in urging the biden administration to re-establish the lake tahoe basin federal advisory committee this committee had expired in 2017. it served as a national model for how engaged citizens those public-private partnerships how they can collaborate with federal state tribal local partners to establish consensus on issues to take care of their communities and that kind of collaboration is part of what makes this a success and it's the crux of why today's summit is so vital so today we're bringing together lawmakers local leaders the next generation of stewards of the land you're going to see us give some awards to some of our our youngest helpers of keeping the environment protected everyone has a passion for the land and the commitment to protecting its future and for our part the leaders of nevada and california will continue working tirelessly to ensure that our state's national treasure our shared state's national treasure well it just remains protected and accessible to everyone because that's what the summit is all about

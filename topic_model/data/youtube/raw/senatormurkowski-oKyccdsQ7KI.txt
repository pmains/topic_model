senator murkowski thank you chairman Durbin to ranking member Graham to members of the committee it is it is good to be here today to testify about this era resolution a resolution that Senator Cardin and I have introduced for three congresses now three congresses we have introduced this same language to put before colleagues here I want to thank Senator Cardin for his leadership in advocating for equal rights for women year over year over year and I really am glad that we're able to get before the committee here today at least since I've been working on this issue I think there's been a surprising lack of attention by by the Senate on this in fact as I talk to so many people they say well we thought that the Equal Rights Amendment had already been adopted they actually believe that we've taken care of I'm going to speak quickly on our resolutions contents and some of the process issues but I'd like to spend most of my time talking about why the resolution is important and why the Equal Rights Amendment is still needed I think you Mr chairman have outlined much of the process here and Senator Cardin has spoken to to the very the very clear and I think um uh very very direct uh language that is included within the Equal Rights Amendment it is not convoluted it is not vague it is very clear that what we're talking about is advocating equal rights for women under the law SJ res 4 removes the deadline for ratification by the states it clears the hurdle for the archivist to publish and certify the era it also affirms that the era has been ratified by three-fourths of the states after Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the amendment back in 2020 and I know that there is debate about the authority of Congress to remove that deadline it's been noted by Senator Graham whether or not that the era has been ratified by the 38 States given later rescission by by five of them what we're trying to do with this resolution some may say is is a little novel but what we're trying to say here is what has happened in the states should not die here in the Senate the fact is there's no law there's no Supreme Court president that says that our resolution is somehow unconstitutional or something that can't Congress cannot do so putting aside all that I I do look forward to to what the committee will will hear in this next panel about these issues but I would like to just give a few statistics in terms of why I think the Equal Rights Amendment is still needed why it is not redundant according to the 2020 census women are about half 50.5 percent of the U.S population compare this to the makeup the Senate 25 of us 25 percent of us are women as Senator Hyde Smith has noted that's a record number a record 128 women are serving in the house but this is still only 29 of the chambers total I don't think we're there yet I'm not satisfied with that this committee you've been very active in processing judicial nominations so just look at the nominations for the federal bench 38 percent of active district court judges or women 66 of 170 active Circuit Court judges are women that's 39 percent so we're making some progress we're making some progress that's good is it good enough shouldn't be good enough in the private sector only about 10 percent of Fortune 500 companies have women CEOs and this is the first time in history a double-digit number has been reached notably and significantly in 2021 women earned about 82 cents for every dollar men earned certainly less than that in many states peeling back the layers of the onion the gender pay Gap was even greater for full-time female managers who earned an estimated 70 cents for 77 cents for every dollar earned by full-time male managers and we know we know that things have improved over the years but we still have a long ways to go when it comes to achieving equality for women and I think that we need the Equal Rights Amendment to get there I'm very proud of the fact that in Alaska we've ratified the era in 1972 the same year that it passed the house and the Senate and was signed by President Carter a few months later alaskans amended the state constitution to prohibit discrimination based on sex Mr chairman women should have equal treatment to men under the law and Congress should do all that it can to ensure that the era is finally made part of the Constitution I think it's long overdue Senator Graham has mentioned that he's looking forward to the debate here to to have a discussion about the potential effect of this resolution I would suggest to you that the potential effect of this resolution is in is to ensure equal treatment under the law for women in this country thank you [Applause]

Bonamici for five minutes thank you to the chair and thank you to all the witnesses for being here I represent a district in Northwest Oregon and I know at home in the Northwest but also across the country and around the globe people are demanding comprehensive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the climate crisis it's it's such a critical issue and to meaningfully do that to reduce emissions we need to accelerate our transition adjust transition to a hundred percent clean energy economy and that is going to take robust investments in EERE and even as mr. Reardon your testimony pointed out over the last 12 years the investments in EERE 20 billion dollars has yielded a net economic benefit of 230 billion dollars so going back to mr. Carson's point about these are good investments and that's why we need to be making them mr. Krishnaswamy we appreciate the NRDC s continued efforts to provide oversight and transparency on the do E's attempts to sideline congressional intent in allocating the EERE and arpa-e funds in in your testimony you noted that EERE ended fiscal year 2019 with about 4% of the offices funds unallocated and 18% unspent and arpa-e ended with 48 to 68 percent of its funds unallocated and up to 91% unspent how do these carryover amounts compared to previous administrations and how has the delayed distribution of those funds affected our nation's capabilities to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a clean energy economy when we look at at the return we get on those investments what what is that man to to our energy future Thank You congresswoman I'd know two points the first is that when we looked back at this the at this analysis we went back several years into the prior administration and we found that consistently both EERE and arpa-e were putting out the announcements of funding opportunities later in the year and actually awarding the the choosing the selections also later in the year or after the fiscal year ended so especially over the last two years our PE and EERE were behind where we were under the prior administration and to your broader question the second point is is really that we know that these programs as has been stated several times are really beneficial in terms of the return on taxpayer investment to the public we also know that they've already made a dent in in the climate challenge and that they need to be much much larger to actually match the scale the climate crisis so any delays in getting those money that money to to researchers and businesses or preventing preventing it from getting to the public is really a delay in those benefits from reaching people and a delay in combating this urgent climate crisis absolutely and I'll note I just I came prior to this hearing this morning we had a hearing and the Select Committee on the climate crisis we were talking about the health effects of of the climate crisis and and former EPA Administrator McCarthy was there we were talking about the social cause of carbon and the health care costs that are also so important to consider so it see it's it's we need to consider all those aspects as well so I wanted to also ask again mr. Krishnaswamy and mr. Reardon I share your concerns that given the significant backlog of unobligated funds with within EERE the department has not hired more staff to help process more foa's since the federal hiring freeze was lifted so in your opinion what what's delaying the department mr. GAE you might want to weigh in on this as well what's delaying the department in hiring more staff and as we look to the President's budget proposal next week how will the administration respond to the 2020 report language that about the department reaching a staffing level of 650 ft ease this year thank you I would note that you know we don't know exactly what has changed within the hiring process at do we or or what is causing each individual hold up in in announcing positions or filling the positions but we do see the trends in the data which show that the the number of staff have decreased and particularly with increasing budgets so really I think it's really important to understand and identify what those holdups are what has changed in the process of hiring and encourage you to work with goe to to determine that identify it and change it so that so that er you can hire faster and thank you have a little bit of time left mr. Reardon mr. and dr. gay yeah I'd be happy to jump in there I have no idea what is what's causing the holdup clearly there is one clearly the EERE is far too understaffed the point that I think I would add two other things I've already said is that you know we've talked about not having a blank check to these companies that have that are receiving these grant funds one way to make certain that we are not in fact giving a blank check is to ensure that we have enough staff to be out there tracking and providing the absolutely necessary oversight that the American people deserve and the light turned red but doctor gave very briefly do you have a couple of words - yes this is about delegation of authority that being able to delegate the responsibility and hold people accountable during the course of the past several years the hurdle has raised rather than a state where it was or been lowered in order to have the authority to carry out the hiring thank you I yield back

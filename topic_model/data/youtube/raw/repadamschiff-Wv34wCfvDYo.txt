all right we're going to go back now to our top story and one of our top guests that being california congressman adam schiff we have now cleared up a bit of the technical difficulties as we give you the evidence the proof that he was there with the speaker of the house and president zielinski just a bit earlier in keeve welcome sir i'm awful glad you're here i know it's your first visit since uh visiting ukraine specifically keeve and i want to ask you about that because uh keeve was attacked with rockets shortly before that trip so did you feel safe during the ukraine part of your trip uh you know we felt safe as we could under the circumstances we had very good security around us uh naturally they don't want us discussing any of the details of that but uh it was really i think an important opportunity to speak directly with president zelinski as well as show support uh by having the speaker of the united states uh congress as well as a delegation of chairs of important committees uh come to eve to meet with them discuss how the war was proceeding and what more we could do to help what did you sir hear from president zielinski what did you learn uh was it anything you feel you had not heard before uh certainly there were a lot of things that we discussed that i had not heard before in terms of needs that ukraine has what we might do to further help i was particularly interested in his insights in terms of how the intelligence cooperation is going since uh that's uh the committee i chair but uh we also discussed the weapons ukraine i think that the top of the ukraine list is multiple rocket launch systems which i think would be quite devastating in this new phase of the war that we're entering that ukraine is entering which uh it's less close uh ambushes by ukrainian forces against the russians and more firing each other with long-range artillery so we brought back and indeed we just got off the phone the speaker and our delegation with president biden to relay what we had heard from president zielinski and other observations can you give us president biden's reaction to the call what he said in a general term if not specifically well you know we conveyed to him the gratitude that was shared with us by president zielinski and then we went to went into a number of the specifics that we discussed about the weapons that are needed about uh how we can strengthen our intelligence cooperation about the the desperate uh food shortages that are being caused by russia's mining of uh the ports of odessa and elsewhere preventing food shipments from getting out to the rest of the world uh so we discussed these things president uh he's on the way i believe to uh walter mondale's funeral and so we we had to cut off the conversation as he was about to land absolutely we know that he's going to be in minneapolis i believe that funeral starts in a couple of hours let me just ask you on a somewhat personal note it has not been lost really on the world the way that president zielenski has been able to maneuver this beyond horrific experience over the last two plus months and the lead up to it the stresses and the pressures and yet he seems to be this constant rudder i'm curious your takeaway from him the level of either admiration respect uh wondering how in the world he gets it done um he has risen to such a level in the mind's eye of so many uh based on on the way he's performed it's interesting to ask that question because we were all to a person uh in our delegation marveling uh at him this was somebody who was a comedic actor up until becoming president of ukraine uh and diddy on his show he played the military situation of the humanitarian needs of his people he has such uh confidence and protects that confidence he fired not only all ukrainians but people all around the world started us yeah pretty remarkable let me ask you about your sense of any realistic diplomatic prospects i mean clearly it takes two to negotiate anything vladimir putin has not publicly indicated any serious interest in negotiations has anything changed that you're aware of i think as war crimes have been discovered that have been committed by the russians it has really pushed ukrainians away from the negotiations people have to negotiate with people uh butchering civilians conduct so it's hard to see a plan negotiate soon uh right now uh herb uh will focus providing the materials train uh so that when that time comes the negotiation they're negotiating from a position of strength we want a victory by ukraine here we won't be able to make this kind of uh unprovoked war on any of its ever again that is certainly our object here yeah what did president zielenski say about the prospect of negotiation you know it really didn't uh come up that i can recall because again i think they're they're so focused on making sure they meet the military economic needs the russians from my perspective have not been negotiating seriously or in good faith given the war crimes they're committing ukraine is not really i think eager to sit down at the negotiating table with them either earlier this week as you know defense secretary austin said this about our goals with russia here's the quote we want to see russia weaken to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading ukraine does america think it is beneficial to keep this war going if it weakens russia i mean how do you interpret those comments by the defense secretary well look i i think we all want the war to end but we want the war to end with the ukraine three and we also want to make sure that russia age in this kind of aggression and so i certainly favor keeping those things on russia increasing those things can't rebuild its military and threaten its neighbors again um but uh you know the priority is to end this war and and the loss of life and so uh we we're obviously working very closely with train mindful of the so that's really foremost uh well you know the president has asked congress to pass an additional 33 billion dollars in assistance for ukraine so if congress passes it that brings the total u.s spending in ukraine thus far to nearly 50 billion dollars how much money is america willing to spend to support ukraine is there a limit should there be and let me just say we may have gotten the answer listening to the house speaker in the statement that she made and you were standing right there with her when she said here's the quote the commitment is to be there until the fight is done so is that the answer i think that's the answer uh we'll be there to support you uh as long as our support and and in the day the reason why is we have a very strong self-interest here in addition to wanting to support the ukraine our ally uh the reality is that uh if russia gets away with this um there's no reason to believe it will stop with ukraine it may invade other of its neighbors including nato allies but which would bring us very directly uh into a war with russia ourselves so it is i think very much in our interest uh to support ukraine as long as ukraine needs that support and as well to help ukraine uh the nude russia of the ability to make this kind of war in the future so um you know i think the american people demonstrated um enormous support for what ukraine is doing and for at the images coming back to what russians are doing uh in butchering pavilion so we will be there standing shoulder to shoulder until ukraine is victorious and expelling these invaders last question to you sir what do you believe ukrainian victory over russia looks like i think forcing russia out of reclaiming it the territorial integrity and regard its own destiny if ukraine wants to join the european union range should be able to join the european union ukraine wants to think join nato nato and nato is wanting it to be able to do that as well it should have the right of self-determination like any other nation and uh and here i think it's very much a fight between freedom the freedom to choose your governance and direction as a nation and oppression and tyranny which is what's represented by putin's russia and so where we are in that fight i i do have one question that comes to mind on the heels of that and that is what will justice look like for russia how much should it have to pay if these allegations of war crimes genocide horrific atrocities are proven to be intentional at their hands i i think pressure should be made to pay reparations and restitution people like putin should be held responsible as war criminal uh brought up before international tribunals because what they're doing is just butchering people there are hundreds of ukrainians that are dying every day sometimes even more than that ukraine posed no threat to russia this was completely unnecessary unprovoked war but it's a student trying to make himself into another peter the great uh the world has to respond forcefully those congressman adam schiff safe travels my friend thank you for being so generous with your time while you're on this uh voyage back home

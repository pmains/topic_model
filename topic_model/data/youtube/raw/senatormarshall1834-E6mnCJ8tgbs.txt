now i'm without question here to fight for those who truly need the help we want to make sure that those that are still hurting get the help that they need but i'm also called to protect the future of this country to protect the future of my children and my grandchildren and what i don't want to see happen is to punish hard-working kansans who we feel like we're trying that we are being forced to bail out blue states who overreacted and totally shut down their economies and shut down their schools but there's still lots of bad news radical democrats still want to bail out mismanaged states at the expense of hard-working taxpayers with dollars that are being distributed in an unfair manner for instance my home state of kansas is getting shorted 400 million dollars so we're doing taking 400 million dollars from kansas and giving it to some other state

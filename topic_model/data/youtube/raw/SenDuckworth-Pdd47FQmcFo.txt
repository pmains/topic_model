Thank You mr. chairman and a Thank You general for being here I also want to recognize that your command swords a major is here so major that for thank you for all of your years of work as well on behalf of our nation general I want to go back to you there's a theme that you've talked about a lot in terms of relationship building and setting the groundwork with our partners beforehand and in the region and the like and I I you and I touched a little bit on some of the programs that exist that allow us to do that to build these habitual relationships I know that the ranking member talked about I met programs I'd like to touch on the state partnership for peace programs you know this is a program where when I was serving from the time I was a second lieutenant I had a partner nation in Illinois's case Poland that we trained and worked with and so I grew up in the military along with my polish counterpart from being you know young second lieutenants all the way up through our command time and not develop the relationship and and an understanding of how that work do you can you speak a little bit about I'm the different types of US funded military exchange programs that you see implemented in the CENTCOM region and talk about the values of those programs to come contributing to our warfighting capabilities thank you and senator let me just start then talk about the state Partnership Program this is an excellent program we have four or five states that are partnering with countries across our region and in almost every case these are deeply valued programs by our partners in the region and I believe by the states that orchestrate them we get a lot of benefit out of that not just in the countries in the region but by again by people from those countries coming back to America to participate in exercises to build the relationships back here and I think this is an extraordinary program its long-term its enduring and I think it serves us particularly well you've already talked about the impact of I met this is an extraordinarily important program I won't I won't belabor that I also think that the the the program of exercises that we continue to orchestrate across the across the region are extraordinarily in terms of building interoperability in terms of building readiness and in terms of building reliability in our partners and as we have kind of continued to move forward I think this will be again continuing investments that will we'll want to make for example with Egypt we have restarted the Brightstar exercise but we've but we've changed it more to deal with the contemporary threats that that we are dealing with and that that Egypt is dealing with and in the Terrorism realm as opposed to perhaps the sweeping tank battles of the past that's not what we're doing so I think we through our exercise programs we have the ability to make these very specific to the needs of the of the region and and in addressing I would add one final program that I think is extraordinarily valuable and it is our our combined maritime force where we invite different partners in the region some from outside of the region to come in and participate as part of our combined maritime forces operating in the Gulf and in the waters of the region these are extraordinarily extraordinarily important and and we see countries like Pakistan who step forward provide significant resources in this and provide leadership to these to these organizations and this allows us to make sure that we live we share the burden we leverage the capabilities that everybody brings and it adds to a much more collective approach to security in the region so those are just four key programs of probably several others that that could be discussed as well thank you general um that last point um speaks a little bit to my logistical officer heart when I look at a map of the CENTCOM region I can't help but wonder how your j4 is able to transport people equipment supplies throughout the theater especially in light of great power competition and in the changing environment as it is I you know it becomes even more salient when I think about the potential for Iran ian's to close the Strait of Hormuz and restrict movement in the Arabian Gulf going back to the exercises that you just mentioned do you regularly exercise against this threat and confident are you that our logistical supply chain would not be gravely impact it should conflict with the Iranians escalate in the region certainly we we do I mean one of the principal concerns we have is the mining of the Straits and the impact of that would happen so we do regularly exercise mining exercises and counter mining exercises in the maritime environment here we have a big exercise plan later later this fall with a number of different countries that will come in but this is certainly something that that we are focused on you're you you are really hitting on the on the resiliency of our logistics networks in the region and i and i'm and i and i do think that our command are components out there and our partners have really have really begun to address this certainly you're familiar with the northern distribution network that kind of goes up to the central asian states that has been important for us we continue to exercise that it certainly does have some influence from russia in that it's it is it is a more difficult network to orchestrate but it is not impossible and we do continue to move materials across that across that area across the arabian peninsula we have what we refer to as the trans arabian network that links a variety of ports and cities and airports not only in the arabian gulf but down in the gulf of oman and over to the Red Sea that gives us extreme resiliency in terms of how we can move material men forces into the into the region to respond to capability so we're very much focused on that and in fact as we look at implementing the national defense strategy and what that might mean for CENTCOM our focus on these logistic networks and our ability to have agreements basing and other things in here I think even become more important than they already have and and we have tried to to prioritize that and we will continue to do that as we move forward thank you vitally important indeed Thank You mr. chairman

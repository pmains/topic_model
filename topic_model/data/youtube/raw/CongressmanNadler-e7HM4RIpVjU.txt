the local New York I'm Chris Hayes with me this morning I have congressman jerry nadler Democratic New York Susie Kim of the Washington Post David Kay Johnson author of the fine print how big companies use plain English to rob you blind and veronique derision of george mason university we are talking about the deal that was struck between Congress congressional Republicans congressional Democrats of the present united states to avert the so-called fiscal cliff and we pick through i think the some of the fine the fine print if you will of the deal but i want to talk about what this sets up next because i think the big criticism from Democrats and liberal observers wasn't necessarily what was in this deal but the fact that because there's no debt ceiling raised in it and because it pushes the sequester two months ahead of time that you've now set up yet another you know countdown clock cable news crisis basically where we're going to head rush long to this this deadline and that the republicans are going to have much more leverage here because they're once again threatening not to raise the debt ceiling unless they get spending cuts and i guess my question to you congressman other is you you have a proposal it's not yours it actually emanated and this probably will make people a little worried about it it emanated from a comment or a blog but it is but but it is a but it is i think pretty sound actually explain your proposal the proposal that's out there that you are now advocate you put in context first yes the republicans have suddenly invented this notion that we bargain about the raising the debt ceiling and if you have to reduce spending to justify or in order to get their votes for increasing the debt ceiling president says he won't negotiate and nothing's quite right what they really saying is by not raising the debt ceiling we're not going to pay the bills that we voted to incur yep we're going to permit the country to default in cause economic chaos and destroy the economy that's essentially what they're saying and they're saying we're going to blackmail everybody in the country by saying will destroy the economy if you don't do what we want namely cut spending to in certain amounts absolutely illegitimate it's like a it's like an old gangster movie we someone says a nice economy you got that pity Richard happened to blow up if you don't pay me protection money that's what they're saying it should not be indulged now there are two ways of simply saying we're not going to talk about it one is to say that on this section for the 14th amendment which says the full the Full Faith and Credit the United States will not be questioned that insofar as the as a debt ceiling statute prohibits you from prevents you from paying the bills that it's unconstitutional and should be disregarded president for some reason the said he won't he won't do that I've seen very good constitutional arguments on both sides of that question it's never been tested in court we should but the argument air who can even test it actually it sort of a fascinate us but the ability the other question is that there is a way it sounds strange but it's not it's no more strange and certainly no more certainly a lot more justifiable than blackmailing the whole country by threatening the economy and that is that the Treasury has the authority under specific statutory authority to issue platinum coins in any denomination denomination type of time from time to time in any time the Treasury secretary wants to it in any denomination wants to do it so what you do is you take a platinum coin you put John Boehner spaced on the face on it you you meant it you say it's a trillion-dollar coin you put it you give it to the Federal Reserve Federal Reserve can then it can then you deposit it in the UN the Treasury's account in the federal concern you fill out a little deposit slip right at the teller window and then and then and then the Treasury can pay its bills now you're not increasing borrowing you're not borrowing anything right you're not having inflation because you're not spending more money you're still spending the amount of money that Congress voted right then right so there is no downside to it now is it a legal trick yes it gets around the legal trick and the blackmail of the debt ceiling if there are any Hollywood agents watching I am working on a trillion-dollar coin heist film to be super awesome which is about the trip from the the men to the deposit of the fabric father so you see by my email address the point is it's a legal way of taking the black males of away from from whoever wants to use it and and and then you can have an intelligent or a proper debate on your level of spending in taxation this is this i mean i think i think it's a fun idea to think about you think about Obama you know handing if you don't want to do Boehner you could put central flux face on it and giving you two to two Republicans I mean the question is and you have various legal scholars bring this up is that you know there could be a lot of litigation around whether this was actually the intent of the law you know you could say that that actually this was there so that we could issue commemorative coins say with Bruce Springsteen's face on it right um and not in order of statutory interpretation a general of statutory interpretation when you have very specific language and since you may do this it doesn't matter the reason for it as expressed evening this is the thing if it does launch a lot of litigation and challenges that could be a really really messy situation I mean we're dealing with the question of whether our country is going to default or not so I mean the right but I follow me but but but to the congressman's point i mean i think that to me the idea behind the trillion-dollar coin is a that default and going through the defaulting on the debt is messy right like I mean this but people should know what that means right when we say we're not gonna go through the debt ceiling right there is a huge list of creditors out there if you printed out everyone the US owes money to right and I mean you would fill this room grand right social security yeah and literally what we are saying is some of you aren't going to get paid no there's no snow one specifying who is not going to get paid or a water them out so maybe you just go through and you say you know what red state seniors you guys get a hundred percent blue state seniors you got fifty percent or Democrats in Congress you get fifty percent of your salary and Republicans you I mean literally all of that is now open once you say we're not just going to pay the people that we owe money but technically the full thing would mean not paying the interest on your debt right and so that's is not we're gonna reason or not right now no but no it's not just necessarily the interest right the point is there's a lump sum of money you got to pay out you gotta recycle that debt as it comes to because we're doing very important most of the borrowing we're doing out these super low interest rates its two-year deck right so we're highly vulnerable to an increase in separate by the way my class at Syracuse University Law School we're going to examine this very question at the point the point of what you just said is very important if you default on your debt your interest rates are going to go hugely upward and you get 0 a lot more months that's right but I think that the reason that is going to increase usually that you saw this resurgence in in the popularity sort of all over Twitter about this platinum coin idea and bloggers other folks have taken up is that I think there is this this feeling that this shouldn't this debate should not be happening yes that is a strong feeling that we should this should not be a question and and and this and here's here's my feeling on this that one of the one of the disturbing trends of congressional behavior in last five years throughout well in the 112 particularly is exploiting the gap between norms and rules which is to say the Republicans get very good at this kind of arbitrage in which things are technically doable under the rules but just haven't been done before and to me the trillion-dollar coin is a kind of equal and opposite response which is to say it's in the rules go read the statute will go put it on the website you can literally the Treasury comment' the coin now everybody says well that's that's ridiculous it hasn't been done before it's not in the norms but the point is that the Republicans have their tremendous power exploited the gap between this two and the other thing I would say is it when it comes to monetary policy extraordinary times have produced some monetary improvisation in the past the greenback's of Abraham Lincoln delinking gold which FDR did which jet conservative economists it was one of the things that brought us out of the great depression right so there are moments in which you have to do sort of thing to say bird is into the Great Depression they look kind of silly by if I can second that I mean I totally agree to do Susie that you know this in practice could be a total disaster but more importantly this is evidence of how dysfunctional this we've become I'm this I'm that you get no argument here no we're we don't have a congress who's actually interested in addressing the real problem i have a repeal excuse me we have a republican party that is willing to use blackmail and destroy the economy in order to get their way of sugar government and that's not certainly defending the Republicans who are not destined reality but the things like we're not we're paying we were spending way more than we collect in Texas and this is going to continue going forward we know that it is you that is not and this is a gimmick to continue not addressing this question I mean like increasing the debt ceiling without having an actual conversation I agree that this is not you know crises are not the best way to actually get to solid reforms that being said that's under my procedure yeah the problem is like the idea that we can just give a blank stake check to the to the government I mean right now the death is like over six you don't have it I got a reply this about four major areas of what you just said maybe five number one our deficit has been reduced as a percentage of gdp from 10.1 percent to 7.1 percent in the last three years the largest reduction as percentage of GDP i think it is on its way three yeah its way to three number two the reason the deficit is so large is very simple we have a depression on our hands a recession quote what you will that means tax revenues plymouth we and things like unemployment insurance and food stamps go up get the recession out of the way get on a plane back down to five percent our deficit goes way down by about forty percent it's not the world over spending our spending as percent of gdp is not up its down in fact a little shorter mess yes right in the long term you have to do with medical yes that's the really we're talking about short-term few years and and and and and and the fact is you can have a debate you can disagree that i'm saying they can have a debate over whether the deficit to larger whether we ought to spend more or less attacks more or less or whatever but not at the point of a gun by threatening to destroy the economy i want to thank congressman jerry nadler democrat of new york for joining us

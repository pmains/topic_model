I thank the chairman and I think miss Maloney for her tremendous work in this regard on a list of financing on money-laundering on this piece of legislation and the work she's done to fight human trafficking which is a very much a part of this legislation and expose criminals who make money from exploitation last year we worked together on an online sex trafficking bill that is cutting edge last 20 years probably the most significant thing to shut down websites and illicit sites that facilitate and sell our women and children into sex slavery we also pressed the Department of Justice to shut down backpage.com which has evaded responsibility for human trafficking for many many years and I was inspired that after the closure of backpage.com HSBC Bank took action and collected information on potential traffickers who may have been using their accounts to exploit victims but I was horrified that even after backpage.com was seized and its owners face federal indictment that backpage.com was able to maintain its LLC status in good standing in Delaware it's clear to me that Congress must do more to expose traffickers who are laundering money through shell companies and inviting criminal liabilities last year I hosted a hearing to examine how financial institutions monitor accounts and identify trafficking we learned from one witness New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance that law enforcement needs more tools better to follow the money and he said I quote traffickers employee sophisticated techniques to move money rapidly and conceal it efficiently moving beyond traditional methods such as wire transfers traffickers also commonly launder money by opening multiple business accounts at different banks as well as transferring checks and cash between accounts to cover their tracks in many cases he said tens of thousands of dollars have already been moved before investigators even have a chance to review bank records Polaris other groups have explained how America is one of the easiest countries in the world in which to hide who actually owns and benefits from a business as part of the reason why massage parlor trafficking is so difficult to prosecute criminally we need transparency in the law to make clear the connections between trafficking venues and aid investigations or there I want to thank congresswoman Maloney I believe that FinCEN and Treasury should provide more information here I look forward to our ongoing conversation in this I believe the FinCEN has a record of maintaining privacy and is an appropriate agency to houses information I support this legislation I support mrs. Melones work to get this done and bring it to the floor and pass it into law and I appreciate her accommodation to the ranking member for him to receive and this committee to receive more information from Treasury and from FinCEN I appreciate her efforts and I look forward to us getting this done I yield back and thank the gentlelady the chairman for the time

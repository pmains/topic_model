madam chair and um administrator thank you for being here today also thank you for your career before this new career in the united states coast guard um being the 26th vice commandant is no no small task and so i know you've got the executive experience to lead tsa but again thank you for your service to our to your nation twice now so thank you tsa is undergoing significant changes to the pre-check enrollment process as you know the tsa pre-check program is among the most popular federal programs under dhs however i have concerns with how this transition is being carried out specifically we have concerns about the privacy of the traveling public are dhs and tsa committed to ensuring that passenger data and information will not be commercialized and be sold or handled by third parties outside of pre-check enrollment contract holders and is dhs also able to put clear privacy protections in place yes sir uh thank you first uh for your comments and then for the question on on our trusted traveler programs um they have been very very successful both tsa pre-check and customs and border protection global entry program if you're in either program you get the pre-check insignia on your boarding pass paper or electronic that gives you pre-check privileges when you go through screening we are seeing pre-check enrollments return already to pre-pandemic levels so people have already started to come back into the enrollment process um to to enroll in tsa pre-check um we we take very care very high care for all the personally identifiable information that a passenger provides and we have criteria for all of our enrollment providers to ensure that not only do they protect the information when they when they store it within their own systems but when they're transmitting that information across we use the highest protocols to be able to ensure that that data is protected tsa pre-check and global entry are hugely valuable programs for us they increase security effectiveness they increase security efficiency and you know as i'm sure almost all of us on this call are we are already trusted traveler members um that that is a significant passenger convenience factor as well yes sir i appreciate that can you can you i don't know if you answered my my primary part of my question is tsa or dhs are y'all going to sell or commercialize this the information that you collect on travelers sure no tsa and dhs do not sell or commercialize the data but we do have uh new tsa enrollment providers doing uh to an ota agreement that should come online uh sometime in the next several months and uh and they have the opportunity to bundle the tsa precheck service with other offerings they they may offer but it's a passenger's choice to go to those additional vendors which are very important for us because we want to increase the network across the country where passengers can readily get tsa pre-check enrollment and renewal um so you know they're able to bundle uh that information but it's only with the passengers acknowledgement that the information they provide will be used for that purpose and and privacy protections are in place to protect the traveler's data yes sir absolutely all right next question according to the september 2021 credential authentication technology procurement and deployment report to congress tsa has deployed cat units to 119 airports what is tsa's plan to expand the deployment and operation of cat systems to all checkpoint screening lanes across the 430 federalized airports sure our plan is to do just that is to deploy the cat technology across every single airport within our system the cat technology is a significant security enhancement not only does it electronically validate the credential that's offered but the newest version of cat technology does a one-to-one match uh with a camera and and matches what the camera sees with the passenger standing in front of the camera and the credentials image digitized so it's significantly effective there the additional part of the cat 2 procurement is that it is connected to our secure flight database which is the database that we use to vet all passengers and assess a risk status to passengers so it lets us readily identify who is a pre-check passenger who is a standalone passenger uh who is the passenger that may need additional screening and that's done uh in near real time i think it's critically important that this capability be at every single airport in the system because in our system if you come into one airport you're essentially in the entire system so i'd appreciate the continued strong support of this committee for the cap program all right thank you madam chair i yield back

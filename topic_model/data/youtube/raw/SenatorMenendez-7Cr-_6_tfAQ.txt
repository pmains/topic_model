senate foreign relations committee will come to order before i deliver my opening remarks on this hearing let me take a moment to acknowledge the senseless massacre at rob elementary school in uvalde texas an overwhelmingly latino community once again we're faced with the heartache and despair of witnessing a mass shooting that takes the lives of children who like any other child in america went to school to learn not to be executed let's be clear every mass shooting is the result of a policy failure guns especially assault weapons equipped with high-capacity magazines don't belong in our communities and in no circumstances through those who seek to do harm with such weapons have greater rights than the nation's children to whom we have a precious obligation to protect and while our thoughts and prayers are with each one of the families that are grieving this unimaginable loss we must go beyond thoughts and prayers and take action every day that goes by without common sense gun reform is a setback in our ability to promote american virtue and values to the rest of the world i have three granddaughters one is in elementary school now in a kindergarten she goes through active shooter drills what are we waiting for there must be some common ground under which we can ultimately come together to prevent these senseless acts of violence

Thank You mr. chair I call up Cortes Master lemon seventy for a vote this amendment would reinstate the CFPB's arbitration rulemaking which was recently in validated with a congressional review act vote it's a straightforward amendment it reinstates the forced arbitration rulemaking that the CFPB adopted with an exemption for depositories with less than ten billion in assets when and when some of my colleagues with the help of Vice President pence on a razor-thin margin struck down the CFPB's rule in October they claimed and I was listening it was about helping community banks and credit unions in fact the White House in their press statement upon striking down the rule claimed they were standing up for community banks and credit unions this amendment gives this committee the chance to make things right and to leave 98 percent of banks and credit unions in this country unaffected it makes sense since community financial institutions are less inclined to use forced arbitration clauses anyways this way we can focus on the real need for a rule to give consumers their day in court we all know why the underlying rule is needed and we've sat through the hearings take the case of Wells Fargo 3.5 million fake accounts and credit products opened in Nevada alone the bank created one hundred and twenty one thousand unauthorized accounts and as recently as September of this year Wells Fargo was trying to force consumers out of court and into a secret arbitration system even on the accounts borrowers never wanted in the first place and then there's Equifax the credit bureau whose lack security practices led to the breach of 1.3 million Nevadans most sensitive personal information that subjects them to identity theft and quite frankly for the rest of their lives trying to clear their good name at first Equifax tried to force consumers to accept an arbitration clause just to protect their identity in the wake of the data breach only after an unprecedented public outcry did the company reverse that course and even still Equifax continues to use a forced arbitration clause and some of the products it offers in the short time since Equifax breach was disclosed my office has received more than four dozen constituent letters expression expressing outrage and seeking justice over this unprecedented scandal and I know my colleagues have received the same constituent calls if this bill is about ensuring consumer protection there's no better chance to do then that by passing this amendment the CFPB's rule has the support of a diverse coalition of more than 300 organization organizations representing civil rights consumer student service member and faith groups this is important for consumers back home in Reno Nevada the American Legion had their National Convention in August and at that convention they adopted a resolution supporting the consumer Bureau rule saying it is quote extremely unfair to bar service members veterans and other consumers from joining together to enforce statutory and constitutional protections in court in addition to a broad range of groups representing the interests of consumers eleven separate legal experts from the University of Nevada Las Vegas wrote to Congress to endorse the benefits of the CFPB rule finally like myself we have former AG's here on this committee we all know that access to justice is essential and that private enforcement of contract contracts enhances law enforcement sibility to target schemes and frauds you don't have to be former attorney general don't have to be a former prosecutor or even an attorney to know that you're right and you should have a choice to a court access to a court should never be taken away from anyone any consumer and this amendment is about giving some meaningful relief to consumers if this amendment were adopted it would substantially and meaningfully help service members students and seniors and I ask for my colleagues support thank you senator senator around if I could I recognize that this amendment would amend title 3 to add a new section that would restore the CFPB's final arbitration agreements rule and it would also exempt banks and credit unions with less than ten billion dollars in total assets from CFPB's final arbitration agreements rule but Congress and the president have already spoken on the issue of pre-dispute arbitration agreements by repealing the CFPB's flawed rule prohibiting pre-dispute class action waivers and arbitration agreements this last October the CFPB simply failed to demonstrate that consumers would have fared better under its arbitration rule for that reason I would respectfully ask the committee for a no vote Thank You mr. chairman there further debate may respond I appreciate my colleagues comments but if Congress has already responded and this White House has responded if that were true then why are we looking to roll back the regulations on dodd-frank because Congress has already spoken so I would ask that if we really want consumer relief and we're really fighting for consumers here this is common sense it's what I heard my colleagues say when they opposed this it exempts out those credit unions and those community banks and it really makes sense why take away an individual's choice to the courtroom thank you

thank you madam chair and ranking member for holding this today to discuss proposals to reform the US Internal Revenue Service administration of our tax system as tax day approaches Americans are being reminded why filing taxes is a dreaded experience especially in the case of seniors whose retirement finances are simple yet require a very complicated filing process my bill HR 2721 the seniors Tax Simplification Act of 2017 would allow for easier tax form completion for senior tax payers the IRS currently prohibits individuals over 65 years old from filing the one-page 1040ez form even if they have a simple return and choose not to itemize deductions it really doesn't make sense specifically the easy form does not include lines for Social Security or other retirement benefits as well as interest in capital gains on investments the seniors Tax Simplification Act 2017 will direct the Internal Revenue Service to create a new basic easy-to-read form called 1040 SR for senior taxpayers earning Social Security retirement benefits interest and capital gains while extending the common sense convenience the 1040ez form the seniors Tax Simplification Act of 2017 has recently been endorsed by the American Association of Retired Persons and the 60-plus Association I'd like to ask unanimous consent to include in the record a January 24th letter of support from AARP in a January 9th letter of support from the 60-plus Association for the seniors Tax Simplification Act for 2017 thank you again I thank you for the opportunity to testify today the seniors Tax Simplification Act is a simple solution common-sense which would provide a measure of relief for our senior citizens who deserve a tax filing option that is fair and simpler than under current law I know you all want to do something for our seniors too I look forward to working with the committee to modernize our tax administration policies thank you again and I yield back

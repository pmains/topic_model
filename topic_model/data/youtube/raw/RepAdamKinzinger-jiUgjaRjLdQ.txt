here the congressman from illinois is with us right now congressman uh you've been standing there listening to this conversation be curious to hear your take about where we are and how we got here in the republican party yeah i mean look it's it was for me it was really fascinating to listen to because the name american psychosis by the way is perfect for kind of this moment we're in it's hard for me to look back you know as somebody's been in the in this job for 12 years i can look back probably 15 and give insight from there you know the stuff prior i have to lean on historians what i've seen is just members of congress because that's who i'm around but i'd say more generically republican leaders that just for some reason somewhere it all became about power and it all became about fear and donald trump brought heaps of fear into the republican party for like a year or two people thought maybe we could take down donald trump when he kept surviving this fear came through of like we have to do everything he wants because he is invulnerable he very well may be invulnerable but there are a lot of people that with that fear sold out their soul because they didn't want to be kicked out of the tribe so there's it's a very intriguing discussion and i'm just sitting here shaking my head like yeah amen that's true you know what's so bizarre for me adam is seeing how what is conservative has been redefined you know i i always you know i just stopped fighting it a long time ago but you know i had a lifetime 95 96 acu rating conservative rating one of the tops in a very conservative class of 1994. liz cheney i think has a lifetime 95 96 conservative rating uh you know people will have discussions start discussions about illegal immigration and they'll go well yeah i'm against that if you cross the border and the first thing you do is illegal you should be arrested and you should send back home why are you talking that way i thought you were a lib you know or if they talk about defunding the cops no i actually i think cops need to be supported a lot more we need to reform policing we need to take the bad cops out but we need more cops we need more money and that will help the most disadvantaged americans uh that are facing you just go down the list i'm a conservative you're a conservative list cheney's a conservative on all the issues but what's shocking to me is again the very people who said i'll vote for you because you're a conservative and you believe in a one two three four they don't talk about that anymore it's are you for the failed reality tv show host the guy who lost the white house the senate and the house for republicans are you for the failed reality tv host and nothing else matters it's bizarre oh you're 100 right it's interesting so i get elected in 2010 the number of people that came up to me and they'd put their shoulder around me and go like you know adam don't go washington you be an independent you do what you think is right now are the ones like adam i can't believe you're doing what you think is right and you're all independent of the republican party it's interesting because also in 2010 there are all those people that would say like i'm not a republican i'm a conservative before i'm a republican are now the people that i'm saying like to them i'm actually a conservative before i'm a republican because our party has gone crazy it is amazing to watch when you came here the holier than now and you know these people the holier than now folks that get elected to congress that preach to you constantly about the constitution what's in it what isn't in it how this little nuance does abide by it or doesn't abide by it we all believe in the constitution they're the same people that have sold out their values because the donald trump said to do so they're the same people that now consider conservatism to be that fealty to donald trump and by the way to my democratic friends i get it you know sometimes you sit around you expect different of us and then where you find out we're conservative or moderate you're disappointed look we have all got to come together because if you truly believe democracy is a threat if you truly believe that then we need an uncomfortable alliance if you don't believe it i got it but then quit pretending like you do i'm telling you democracy is a threat and we need uncomfortable alliances in congress well yeah i'm sorry will yeah it you know it's it's we're past the point really where we we get hung up on ideology i told you where i stand uh willie i'm talking to willie now where i stand willie on illegal immigration i was always more conservative on illegal immigration than the mainstream of the republican party the chamber of commerce and the wall street journal editorial page right uh and some people may be uncomfortable with that okay i get it that's right i think there's chaos at the southern border i think it's out of control i think we need all right so you may disagree with me we still have something bigger to worry about and that is madisonian democracy we've got to fight for it we've got to defend it politically with ideas and we can't back down i i just couldn't agree anymore with what the congressman said let's have those uncomfortable alliances and save this republican and we could go back to debating about illegal immigration and cops and everything else down the road yeah the congressman and this committee the select committee's work gets at that of course at the foundations of our democracy and congressman we've got some nbc news reporting this morning that you all will have your next hearing on september 28th uh two weeks from tomorrow if my math is right can you confirm that i don't know what i can confirm right now if the committee's announced whatever they announce uh you know i'll confirm um we have pretty long meetings today as we're kind of setting down our agenda for the rest of september for the rest of the year that's why we're in dc a little bit early but we're gonna again do what i think we did very effectively in earlier in the summer is bring the american people the truth we have to begin to pivot to writing this report and really look i mean i it's always tough when you're dealing with people that are unwilling to talk to a committee like we've had doj hasn't prosecuted some of these folks okay that's their decision but there is a point at which when it comes to the criminality that's not our role doj has i think a pretty fulsome investigation going two months ago i had no clue what was going on um and that's going to be where this baton so to speak is handed to not by us we may have a criminal referral i think that's likely but with their investigation from here out and uh look we've got to hold people to account if the if the rule of law says you can attempt a coup as long as you fail and you won't be held responsible that is way more dangerous for this country than some you know fear of short-term violence or riots in the street on that question of the doj and its investigation nbc news has confirmed about 40 subpoenas were issued over the past week to people associated with former president trump according to the new york times which first reported that news former trump adviser dan scavino among those subpoenaed his attorney did not comment to us a lawyer to former new york city police commissioner bernard carrick confirmed to nbc that carrick was among those subpoenaed carrick reportedly was hired by trump's legal team to investigate fraud in the 2020 election according to his lawyer carrick initially had offered to grant an interview voluntarily a source tells nbc news former trump adviser boris epstein was one of two people to have their phones seized epstein has been tied to the scheme to replace biden electors with fake trump electors so that's sort of the parallel investigation congress and what doj is looking at what more is ahead of you on that committee what might you be sharing with the public in that hearing whatever it is in a couple of weeks and then as you prepare the report how much more is left for you well let me just first off say when you say names like boris epstein and like dan scavino we've been dealing with on the committee a little bit he refused to come in it just i get chills because i think back to like that actually used to be uh in in office that used to be like people running the government as i still can't believe it sometimes but look for the committee i don't want to you know i've ruined the surprise in a couple weeks i think what we're going to talk about a lot more is we may go into some more depths on some stuff more of an overview some areas of course we haven't talked about you think about it this way so when we talk about the report and in the future and my last hearing we did on thursday which was the 187 minutes of trump in the white house uh doing literally nothing actively for the first time in his adult life resisting peer pressure to actually do something by the way like the only time otherwise he just reacts to whatever people tell him i could have probably had a hearing for seven hours with information on that we had to keep it to an hour and a half so you'll see a lot more depth a lot more evidence on these various areas and uh so yeah i think it's going to be again must-watch tv not from an entertainment perspective but from if you care about the united states of american government perspective congressman catty here when you go back to your district whether it's on the on the broader issue of where the republican party has got to or on the specific issue of january the 6th it seems that there are very few minds that are open to being persuaded one way or another um i i spent the summer traveling around the country and trying to talk to people about january the 6th and 2020 election and it's almost impossible for somebody who has made up their mind say on the election being stolen to to to find any argument with them that might open a crack to them revisiting that opinion so when you go back to your district and you speak to your constituents about these issues do you find there is occasionally something that can work something that can produce a conversation where somebody is open to listening to facts and having their mind changed or does it never happen it's rare i mean look let's be honest and you know i think our hearings actually there are a lot of republicans i've heard of kind of just anecdotally that you know i was a die hard trumper now i've seen what he was doing i can't stand him so you have some of those anecdotally but you can see reflected in the numbers the party for instance still loves donald trump and i think it's two things i think to admit that donald trump is as corrupt as he is means that you have to as an individual that supported him admit that you supported somebody who was corrupt and it is hard for people to get to that point without blaming themselves and i say to them it's not your fault you've been lied to and abused by your leaders that have lied to you repeatedly it's okay to change your mind we all change our mind but the other thing is i'm more convinced that people fear more than death they fear being kicked out of a tribe because being excluded being lonely and now in our life everything is in a political sphere where you go to eat dinner is now a political sphere what tv show you watch everything is a political thing now including sports teams so if you fear getting kicked out of your tribe that's worse than being killed i can tell you somebody's been kicked out of my tribe it's not fun but you just have to be willing to do it and it's actually makes feel a lot better to look in the mirror if you are congressman kinsger jonathan lemire i actually want to pull together a couple of threads we just talked about including this idea here of your time in congress coming to an end when the hearings do resume in a few weeks uh congressman liz cheney also chanelle elaine duck having lost her primary sizedly this summer because she like you stood up to donald trump there aren't going to be many congress men or women left in the republican party who defied him those who voted to impeach him are all all but gone uh how concerned are you now though as as the calendar turns to january whether the republicans are in the majority or not in the house about where the your colleagues the republicans in the house where that's taking the country i think we're in a really bad spot i mean look i'll say about liz you know people always in their life dream about this opportunity to kind of stand up alone in a crowd and do the right thing and only a few people actually get that chance and what i've noticed is that even fewer that get that chance have the courage to do it it's one thing to read something in a history book and be like yeah winston churchill or whatever um it's another thing to be able to act like that she has acted like that my party nobody in power right now with maybe some rare exception actually believes the election was stolen they don't they're lying because they can raise money from it or they fear their constituents otherwise i think the people come in in january there's going to be a significant class of people that actually believe the election was stolen and that's a fearful thing to me i have no respect for somebody that tells me hey i know it's all you know bs but i gotta do this to get reelected what i fear is those that come here and truly believe you know adam kinzinger is part of the soros big government you know new world order machine and i was part of stealing this election they're going to be in congress in january that frightens me republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois thanks so much as always we appreciate

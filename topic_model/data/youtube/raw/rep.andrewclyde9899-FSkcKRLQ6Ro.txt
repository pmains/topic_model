Congressman um the gop's got to do some soul searching ahead of 2024. um house Speaker Newt Gingrich I thought he he summarized the situation well claiming that Republicans are focused on campaigns Democrats are focused on elections the difference is profound Republicans must change what do you make of that well it's a very very interesting statement by Newt I have a lot of respect for Newt you know he's got great political wisdom so I think uh you know there's some there's a lot of Truth in that I'm very disappointed in the outcome obviously um but uh you know it is what it is it just goes to show you the importance of the Republican majority in the house you know we are going to be the last line of defense against the big government socialism of the Biden Administration and their March toward green new deal policies yeah sir Brian Kemp had no issue winning his race in your state defeating Stacy Abrams by 300 000 votes but then you know we're talking about Herschel Walker's loss um what do you make of that and do you think that this makes Georgia a purple state no I don't think George is a purple State at all you know I'm very very proud of my district The Ninth District that led the way in voting a republican but uh I think what you see is a tremendous amount of money poured into the state uh and when the when the Democrats cannot win on policy because this campaign there wasn't a lot about policy on it it was about character assassination and the Democrats uh were successful in uh in that Avenue right there and I think that was the big change in Georgia was character assassination of our great Conservative candidate Herschel Walker yeah it wasn't a uh and this just put sort of a final exclamation point on what was not a great midterm cycle for the GOP after all of these polls and you were on with us before the midterms and we were talking about how you know maybe not a red tsunami but it looked like at one point we had guests saying that the Senate could be 54 maybe 55 in the Republicans favor I do think it will shift in 2024 a lot more vulnerable Democrats in the Senate at least are on the ballot into 24 but between now and then as a party what do you need to do to make sure this doesn't happen again well you're certainly right about the senate in 2024 the numbers are on our side but for the more Democrats that are up for re-election as opposed to Republicans but we in the house need to stay unified against the Biden Administration and fight for conservative values you know when we show the people that we will hold the line on conservative values we win and I think the economy will be better for it the American people will be better for it and I think that puts us on the right track to success in 2024 especially in the Senate because we need the Senate yeah absolutely sir I want to Pivot now to to the Border uh the the news of border patrol agents dying just a father of two we we've reported how 14 border patrol agents have committed suicide President Biden in Arizona but didn't go to the Border um Politico has an article that says GOP Senators tune out house impeachment calls so obviously you know there's they want to some want to impeach mayorkas um what do you think this means means that GOP senators are basically tuning out this this message as we talk about the Border crisis well I'll tell you that the Border crisis is a 100 percent a self-inflicted wound by the Biden Administration I think he's fully responsible for all the lawlessness at the border and that means the drugs the the thousands upon thousands of pounds of fentanyl coming in the hundred thousand plus American citizens that have died because of drug overdoses uh you know this is all a self-inflicted wound by the blind Administration and he is 100 accountable for it and the murders the suicides the depression it is in completely mismanaged and you know a complete failure of leadership by President Biden it's inexcusable it's unacceptable which is why we certainly need to change a myorcus definitely needs to be impeached I told him that myself does that happen in January sir does it happen in January well I sure hope so you know I certainly would be happy to lead the way um a sign of things to come and I saw this as a positive sign uh but there was some reporting yesterday that indicated that Congress will rescind the covid-19 vaccine mandate for military service members um possibly as part of the defense authorization act which I believe could be voted on as early as tomorrow that could be delayed is that something that House Republicans are working with house Democrats on right now well I'll tell you the National Defense authorization act in that bill you do have a vaccine mandate revocation but the problem is it only goes half the way there needs to be a restoration of those service members who have been ejected from the military because of the vaccine mandate it has done tremendous damage to our recruiting to our morale uh you know to our our fighting forces to our Readiness and so those members you know the easiest way to get that radius back is to bring back the already trained members that the vaccine mandate uh you know threw out of the service and this NDA does not do that so it doesn't go as far as it should go yeah

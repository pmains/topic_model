to get your take Buddy Carter on on congress's role here because we've seen some serious Reckless spending which has taken us to 40-year highs on inflation can you do anything about this at this point now that we're faced with a 31.5 trillion dollar debt we can do something about it and we are going to do something about it keep in mind if you look back on the reductions on that have taken place in spending since 1985 there have been 11 reductions in spending all of them had to do with the negotiations on the debt limit now is the time for us in the Republican party and we are going to do this now's the time for us to demand that we stop this spending it is causing this inflation that's causing this economy to to tank like it is not tank but to to struggle like it is and yeah and you know it's it's extremely important that we take this seriously this debt limit yep well let me ask you because in order to take it seriously you have to have a budget right do you all have a budget in Congress we are working on a budget right now we've got um and Jody Harrington our budget chairman is doing a great job getting us organized we want to get back to regular order we want to have a budget keep in mind now the president has not submitted his budget yet we need that budget in order to get the figures that are are in it yeah you know we don't have to pay any attention to it in the sense that we don't have to follow it but it includes important information that is necessary for us to be able to do our work that's why we need the president to stay on time yeah we're expecting that budget uh what in March or April he has promised he has promised us it would be in March and certainly okay and of course it's late now as it is yeah I know that Andy poster let me get your take on where buddy Carter what about that and and your reaction to these numbers which obviously has a uh has triggered a big reaction for investors well first of all to the point about savings increasing I agree with the other panel members I think it's a result of worry I think as a result of people becoming concerned about the future the the very near future and I think they are saving because they are trying to get prepared you know that this this past Valentine's Day was the first time that I ever had to give my wife a choice between a dozen roses or a dozen eggs I mean I couldn't afford both and it's it's the economy is the economy has gotten that bad and and people are really hurting out there you know when I'm out in the district people are telling me and now we hear about uh kids moving back home and and and not moving out anymore I mean this is this is really a point of concern but to the deficit in particular the CBO report that recently came out I mean that has raised all kind of concerns with us on the budget committee because we see we see that as being one of the greatest if not the greatest challenges that we face in this country in years to come uh buddy just between a dozen roses and a dozen eggs I mean really I know eggs are up 70 percent year over year but I'm hoping that was a joke buddy Carter I mean it was Valentine's Day she got roses come come on give me a break Congressman all right look Lou bastities you got to explain it really gets ugly when you start to uh understand the impact on debt because I believe we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in interest rates but interest rate payments half a trillion dollars in infants in interest payments alone right much more than what we spend on defense much more than what we spend on some discretionary uh spending so I mean I want you to react to this sound bite from Maya McGinnis Maya McGinnis was on with me yesterday and she as you know is the head of the committee for a responsible budget here's my McGinnis and what she said right now watch do we have that sound bite over 10 years 10 trillion plus we will spend more than 10 trillion dollars on interest payments just a few years ago when interest rates were low you had all sorts of economists clamoring saying borrow more borrow more it's so cheap it's almost free but it also means that when interest rates go up we are so much more vulnerable because we're carrying a much higher debt load which is the situation we have now uh Congressman can we afford that 10 trillion dollars in interest payments wow and that's in the in the coming decade by the way no we cannot afford that and and the CBO score that came out just recently the CBO report that came out recently it led us to believe that that's why the debt limit is so vitally important because really that's the only time that people pay attention to our national debt is when we hit the debt ceiling and that's why it's extremely important if you look at at since 1985 we've had 11 different reforms and and restrictions if you will on spending all of them as a result of the negotiations on the debt ceiling and we have people who are saying we need to do away with the debt ceiling because we're always going to pay our debt yes we are going to pay our debt but we don't need to do away with the debt ceiling it's the only time we pay attention to it and we certainly are paying the piper now she is exactly right low interest rates that's okay but when the interest rates go up now we're going to be paying more in interest on our debt that we will be in spending on defense the number one responsibility of the federal government should provide for the safety of our homeland and now we're spending more on debt on the interest on debt than we are on defense yeah that is a lot of money uh get you all uh to tell me what you think is important in the coming week or couple of weeks what the catalysts could be for the economy and markets so buddy Carter let me kick this off with you what are the priorities in your committees give us some catalysts that we can look forward to I know the debt Showdown is going to be major and that's probably going to happen in June but what other bills or hearings are you geared up for in the coming weeks well on the Energy and Commerce Committee of course we continue to to address the Medicaid Medicare which is a big part of our of our non-discretionary spending and and certainly we we've taken that off the table we're not talking about Cuts but we are talking about reforms how can we make it better and and certainly that is one of the initiatives one of our goals in the Energy and Commerce Committee on the budget Committee of course as you mentioned what we're concerned with is a debt ceiling and the negotiations and to stop the spending and also the tax structure that that you know I propose to fair tax which is a fair simple solution to to taxation we need to be thinking about Big Ideas like this to to address our tax situation and address our tax structure right great great points for Congressman your final thoughts here on on what the future uh looks like in terms of the Republicans running things are you going to be able to get anything done uh with this slim majority I think we will uh you know you only have to look at recent history to see that divided government has worked well when you think about Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan when you think about uh Bill Clinton and and Newt Gingrich I mean they were able to get some things done if this Administration is willing to work with us we can get some things done we can get this economy back on track but it's going to take the unleashing of American energy that is one thing that is going to help us grow out of this yeah it's a great point that you make unfortunately I don't know that your colleagues on the left are on board right there you know you have a hearing at the border and they boycotted it is that giving you any indication of whether or not you're going to be able to get some uh some bipartisanship going well it's not a good sign you're right but uh and you look I'm the eternal optimist and and and we are working together with with some on the other side of the aisle about prescription drug price and reform yeah that's true so there are areas that that we are working together on all right we will leave it there guys it's been a great panel great show we so appreciate everybody's time Congressman buddy Carter Andy puzder Tomas Phillipson Anton schutz Lou bassination or casoni have a great weekend everybody

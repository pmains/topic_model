well this could I tell you stories about how some of our students or schools business is struggling in rural parts of our states we could alternate stories for lack of access to the Internet and I would ask of you mr. Rosen Horsley if you would having said that what is the Commission you still talked about this a little bit already but what is the Commission doing to ensure that internet is accessible to all communities and that 5g deployment is not another technological advancement that leaves the world communities even further behind yeah Thank You senator such an important question we need to do more we've got a digital divide in this country it's real we've got 12 million kids who can't even do their homework because they don't have internet access there in every state come over not working but then they need to be done their homework we want them to be able to access the internet and do their schoolwork and it's just a window into this challenge we have we got to fix it I think we would start with better mapping I know that senator Peters has a bill just on this subject right now FCC maps will highly overstate where broadband is and is not in this country go to every rural community they'll tell you they don't have service and yet if you look at the FCC map we found one subscriber in a census block and we decided that it's available throughout that's wrong we're never going to know where to devote our scarce federal resources if we don't first get our maps right I'm using a review of aside from grants what are the support can government agencies provide to help advance Internet access I think that by refocusing now on mid band spectrum we could make a meaningful difference in the deployment of 5g it propagates further and requires fewer towers it's more economic to deploy in rural communities and if we want rural America at a c5g I think we have to focus on that sooner rather than later

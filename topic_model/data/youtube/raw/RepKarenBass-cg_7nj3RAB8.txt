the president's clear message to the new Democratic House Majority even before they're really getting started get off my back so where do things stand right now joining me right now is a Democratic congresswoman from California Karen bass she sits on the House Judiciary Committee congressman thank you for being here thanks for having me on when you heard that last night from president Trump did you take that as some kind of a threat well no I don't take it as a threat I just take it as another example of him still not understanding how the democratic process worked so he said it just doesn't work this way no actually it does there are three co-equal branches of government and one of our primary responsibilities in the House of Representatives and in the Senate is to provide oversight over the administration this is the new reality that he is going to have to get used to so I hope that somebody sits him down and explains the democratic process maybe put it put another way the president might be saying that if the Democratic House Majority spends bulk of their time and committee resources I'm looking into him and his administration with investigations then they're not gonna be doing then they're not gonna have time doing anything else do you hear about that well I think that's exactly not true we are going to do our responsibility you see the thing is and one of the reasons why he's confused is because for the last two years there has been no oversight over this administration at all so he's going to have to get used to that reality but I can guarantee you that the Democratic majority has a very robust proactive positive agenda that we are going to fight for over these next few years so he's going to see that we can walk and chew gum at the same time we're all watching and says that will play out I'm speaking of walking and chewing up at the same time your committee has oversight over the Justice Department of course the acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's testifying before a committee on Friday the chairman Jerry Nadler he's also he's already said that he's having a subpoena drafted though in case Whitaker doesn't show up or claims executive privilege to avoid answering some questions I do wonder congressman why draft the subpoena ahead of time do you've an indication he's not gonna answer your questions well I think that we have to be prepared for that because you know it's not really clear because the administration doesn't quite understand the role of the House of Representatives it's not clear whether they are going to comply you do know that secretary Nielsen said she was not going to come before the House Homeland Security Committee and the Chairman Bennie Thompson had to prepare a subpoena now before he enacted that subpoena she did agree to testify so I think it's absolutely right that we need to prepare subpoenas because we don't know whether this administration plans to cooperate hopefully they will understand the co-equal branches of government before too long and they will realize that it's their obligation to comply when they're called before the house I mean let's say he shows up you have he still has the subpoena drafted I mean do you do you see a scenario where the chairman like hands Whitaker a subpoena in the middle of a hearing no I don't mean I think if Whitaker comes I mean for goodness sake I would hope that he comes with the intention of being compliant I don't know whether the Chairman would hand him a subpoena right there at the hearing but you know what if that's what he needs to do to get them to understand that they need to comply with the way our government operates then so be it what what do you most want to hear from the acting Attorney General or what is your big question right now well I think the main thing is whether or not he is going to try to block the Muller report because we don't know whether or not that report will become available before a new Attorney General is sworn in so I think that's one thing and then also for him to be accountable for all of the statements that he's made basically saying that a president cannot and should not be held accountable so we need to know okay that's what you said on on CNN but now that you're in this position where do you stand how confident are you right now that the Moller report will be made public well you know what I don't know the question will be whether or not this administration tries to block it from becoming public I can't imagine that Muller wouldn't want it to become public but we will see we will see if the administration tries to block it and then via standoff between the two but I think at the end of the day it will become public it's absolutely critical that it become public the whole country has been waiting over the last two years what is going on and the idea that he would complete the investigation and then it would be squashed I think there would be a terrible backlash in the country it would be very unhealthy from even from the perspective of a Republican Senator Chuck Grassley his point is American taxpayer pay for this investigation they should see what comes out of it he's an aide with you on that um you were also the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus yum you've called for the Virginia governor to resign over a racist photo and his reaction to it quite frankly the Senate governor this is Virginia politics is a mess right now because lieutenant governor he is now facing a sexual assault allegation that he is vehemently denied the woman Vanessa Tyson she's working now with the same firm that represented Christine Blasi Ford ruin she took on Brett Kavanaugh and I looked back and back then your campaign put out a statement saying I believe you and I'm with you - Christine Blasi Ford should this woman be heard now absolutely she should be I don't believe in a double standard at all I first of all think that the governor should step down that's a separate issue if the lieutenant governor were to assume the governor's position and I don't know what the process is in Virginia but I think she absolutely should be heard whatever process is appropriate in Virginia should be followed maybe he wouldn't be able to take the seat maybe it would have to go to the Attorney General I don't know what the specific situation is but I do not believe in a double standard and I do believe that everybody should be held accountable congresswoman thank you so much for being here I appreciate your time thank you

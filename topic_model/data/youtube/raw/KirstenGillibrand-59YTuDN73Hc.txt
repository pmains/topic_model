my faith is really important to me so I think anyone should be able to have faith whether they are ultra conservative or ultra liberal and if you're coming it from a Christian perspective I would say the gospel really doesn't leave anybody out because you know are you feeding the poor are you helping the sick are you visiting the incarcerated do you believe in helping the least among us do you believe in the golden rule do you treat others the way you want to be treated I would argue that Democrats are often better on those issues than Republicans so there's no reason why you can't be a person of faith in any political party have you ever felt that being a person of faith and being a Democrat has that ever felt strange to you or odd or that it doesn't fit because people so often hear about religion as being something that goes with conservatives in the Republican Party no no I I defined by myself by my faith it centers me it's something that is one of the reasons why I'm running for president

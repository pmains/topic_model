200 million abdomen as mr. Lofgren ladies from California five minutes well thank you very much mr. chairman and dr. chu it's good to see you as well you know in 1995 when I was a brand new member of the House of Representatives there was a very conservative Republican congressman from the east bay congressman bill Baker I'm sure you remember a bill and he recruited me and other people into an effort to pursue the National Ignition facility at the Lawrence Livermore Lab and even though bill is no longer a member of Congress that bipartisan support for the project has continued to this very day and as you know the project the National Ignition facility has a key role to play in terms of our stewardship and it is the lead effort in in inertial confinement fusion are you aware dr. chu that if you look at the nnsa a budget rules that will be applied the bottom line for nif is that if this budget remains as it is they will essentially have to close and mothball next year no I don't believe that's true certainly we do not want that to happen they have its construction has been complete they're entering over the last year in turn into a very exciting tushar today experimental stage and we're looking forward to the when they can actually prove that you can get what we call ignition that more energy is going to come out then went in well if I can dr. Holdren was here a couple of weeks ago I asked in the same question he was honest to say he didn't know and he called me back afterwards to follow up and he agreed that defunding and mothballing of the experiment after we spent over four billion dollars on the capital equipment and to get to where we are would not be a smart thing to do I called out I mean the the labs are not allowed to call us and law Bobby but they do have to answer us when we call out there and I was told that the net result would be mothballing an F if this budget is is retained by the lab and and so I'm looking at eater which is you know we're ten percent of that effort and it's a long ways away if ever from getting so we're proposing to increase their budget by 45 million at the same time we're going to shut down nif and hundreds of science and scientists will be laid off while we're sending money to this international effort that may never get started how could that be how can that be a smart decision well first let me my my knowledge of what's happening with the new program it's as you pointed out this is a very important part of our nnsa budget it enables us to more deeply understand the physics we need to understand going forward it for our nuclear security and so I know of no plans i'm not sure the best of my knowledge and we can get back to you on this the funding is adequate for an if to continue because we need that facility it's just been constructed if i know that i was at the at the opening as were you right and under no circumstance to mothball a facility that's working and just been constructed well if I may mr. Chairman I i believe obviously i wouldn't have raised this if I hadn't been led to believe that that is in fact the case so what I like to do if I may is follow up with you if necessary we'll do a bipartisan effort to defund the eater contribution and redirected to the to this effort if we need to and I've already been talking to my friends on the other side of the aisle I think we'd have a bipartisan effort if we have to do that but perhaps we can pursue this further off calendar I wanted to do a quick question on the Advanced Computing there is a reduction of four point six percent in the high-performance computing and network facilities subprogram and I'm not sure how that's going to work can you explain the impact on the whole program from that reduction um what we're doing there's been a growth phase we think high-performance computing is one of the keys to what the department does because high-performance computing enables industry to actually skip not work for line cycles very much absolutely important we're laying plans to go to the next step of the for example the very high-performance computer at Oak Ridge Jaguar computer will go from probably several petaflop swear it is today to perhaps as much as 20 pedo flops in the meantime we're laying plans to go to exascale because we think the simulation high-performance computing as is being shown repeatedly can help us industry avoid design engineering I get all of that the question though is what is the impact of the proposed decrease the four point six percent decrease is not not a problem and also is the XO scale proposal put forward by the Berkeley Lab is that funded in this budget the exascale I think the exascale is being developed it in the Department of Energy we haven't made any determination about where it's going to go and indeed we're working with industry because we think the exits as we improve the the petaflop scale computers we have in the apartment energy we're also looking and getting positive feedback from industry to actually partner with industry to to develop radically new technologies for this next I wonder mr. i know my time is up but if we could just ask dr. chu what the impact of the fourteen percent of four point six percent decrease would be which was my original question we very much we can get back to you in the details if the Chairman will allow me just 20 seconds on eater I don't know how could keep you from it well yes sure we make that I went men and a half over luckily my dad just wanted to respond to point out there you're entitled okay thank you to testify that the eater project over eighty percent of the funds will be spent in the United States and contracts in companies national laboratories in the United States and it is an international obligation we have and so and we don't see it actually in conflict with nif well I've supported either in the past but its premise on a robust scientific effort here in the United States and if the information I have is correct that we would be mothball and if I could no longer support you know increasing our funding to eater and it is decades away from beginning operations so you know there are plenty of scientists who've told me without regard to the budget that they no longer have confidence that the project is even going to succeed because of the political support and the budget problems but that's a separate question I think that you the chairman for letting me have a little more time

committee will now move to s-92 regulations from the executive in need of uh scrutiny act of 2019 more commonly known as the the reigns act senator paul's been championing this would you like to speak to your bill yes thank you for several years we've introduced the reins act to try to fix a problem that we see in the legislative functioning we often write bills around here and then we often say that an unelected bureaucracy will finish writing the bill so we had a health care bill not too long ago a major health care bill that had 1500 references to the secretary of health shall decide at a later date and then the rules are written essentially the legislation is written by unelected bureaucrats what our legislation would do is to say that any major rules rules that are estimated to cost the economy over 100 million dollars would have to come back and be voted on and i think these are significant these are often more significant rules than even any of the legislation we face in an entire year but we never vote on them we have no idea what happens and then we have no idea of the consequences of this just in the last year we had 87 major rules estimated to cost the economy 27 billion dollars and yet these are written by people that have no uh accountability to the electorate so our bill would basically bring those regulations back and have them voted on by congress and i would recommend a yes vote on this great piece of legislation thanks paul is any other member wish to discuss the bill or introduce an amendment let me just say i'm a big supporter of the reigns act it i do not understand why congress would willingly give away this kind of authority this just makes all the sense in the world so i'm going to definitely support it a roll call vote has been requested on this so the clerk will call the roll senator hi senator paul senator lankford senator romney senator scott aye senator enzi senator holly aye senator peters no senator carper senator hassan [Music] senator harris center cinema no by proxy senator rosen senator johnson aye mr chairman on the vote of those president the yeas are eight the nays are five on the vote by proxy and for the record only the yeas are zero the nays are one on this vote the yeas are eight the nays are five and the motion is agreed to and the reigns act was reported favorably

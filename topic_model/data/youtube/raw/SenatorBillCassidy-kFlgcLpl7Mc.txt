Senator Bill Cassidy republican from the great state of Louisiana joins me now Mr Senator the governor of New York Kathy hokel well she still wants to ban gas stoves and gas heating equipment in just a couple of years is this a war on natural gas it's a war on natural gas but it's also a war on the consumer New York pays about nine to ten percent more for their electricity cost already and the governor of New York wonders why people leave New York as soon as they retire they're on social they move to a state with a lower cost of living because of the high cost of living in New York she's about to make that nine percent even higher it's bad for consumers it's a way to meddle in their lives and it accomplishes almost nothing they want us all to convert to electric stoves and electric heating where's all the extra electricity going to come from well I think New York is thinking that it's going to come from offshore wind but the cost basis of offshore wind is going to be far more expensive than that which would come from your uh nuclear your your nuclear say your your your natural gas powered uh plant and so they're going to replace the energy from natural gas with much more expensive offshore wind it's going to drive up their cost even more than their nine percent higher now and people living in New York will once more wonder why they are Mr Senator we've just heard about the second tranche of classified documents found at present Biden's house in Wilmington Delaware the president just gave a press conference on the economy but then walked away from questions surrounding the documents is this a big political storm or a tempest in a teapot I think it's a big political storm what's good for goose is good for Gander if former president Trump should not have them there and he shouldn't have had them there then former Vice President Biden should not have had them there either now it may just be we've got a lousy system for making sure that folks don't cart away nuclear secrets but whatever it is there's a responsibility for the former vice president to to know that and then to get them back frankly the vice president or now the president President Biden um there's kind of one more example of how things could be a heck of a lot better if you paid a little bit more attention we just don't know who had access to these documents or what's in the documents or what subjects they deal with we need to know all of this to assess the importance of it surely if it's a big deal for former president Trump to have these and I think it was it's a really big deal for former Vice President Biden to have these as well and needs to be equally investigated not only is it important for National Security it's also important for a sense of fair play Mr Senator thanks very much for joining us on such short notice about a developing story but it's always appreciated thank you sir

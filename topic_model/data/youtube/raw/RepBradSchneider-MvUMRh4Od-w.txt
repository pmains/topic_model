Mr. Speaker,
I rise today for our nation’s communities saddled with stranded nuclear waste stockpiles
because the federal government has failed to meet its obligation to find a permanent
repository. My constituents in Zion understand this all
too well. After its nuclear plant closed in 1998, two
million pounds of spent nuclear fuel remain. Literally sitting on the shores of Lake Michigan,
the more than 50 concrete casks severely affects the quality of life of the residents of Zion. It deters economic investment, depresses home
values, drives up property taxes, and stretches the city’s already thin budget. So today, I am proud to reintroduce the STRANDED
Act to at last provide some compensation for these affected communities. Zion is not alone. Across the country, there are more than a
dozen communities with nuclear plants at various stages of decommissioning, with more to come. I am grateful for the support and leadership
of Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and
Water Development Chairwoman Marcy Kaptur in reintroducing this bill.. Together, we are fighting to make the federal
government do right for communities like Zion. I urge my colleagues to join us.

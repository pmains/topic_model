well thank you I'm very glad I came this has been an interesting hearing now I'm going to ask you a question pay close attention I always do I know you do a question and the purpose of the Patriot Act and the FISA Court and the National Security Administration is to make sure that we're aware of terrorist activity and disrupting plots against our interest abroad in at home is that true I would agree with that the purpose of the Patriot Act is not to allow the executive branch to gather political intelligence on the judicial branch or the legislative branch do you agree with that I would agree with that so this is like killing innocent people in a cafe I know exactly what you're trying to say there is no lawful authority in the law of war or in any other statute to drone somebody who's done nothing wrong anywhere do you agree with that yes I agree with it we're trying to capture and kill people who we believe present a national security threat to our nation right also true and one thing we're trying to do in this Patriot Act is to find out about terrorist organizations and individual terrorists who they may be talking to again I hope America people appreciate we're at war because I sure as hell do hope the American people appreciate that the way you protect the homeland as you try to find out what the enemy is up to I'm a verizon customer it doesn't bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number because what they're trying to do is find out what terrorist groups we know about individuals and who the hell are calling and if my number pops up on some terrorist phone I'm confident that the FISA Court is not going to allow my phone calls to be monitored by my government unless you and others can prove to them that I'm up to terrorist activity through a probable cause standard so I may come out differently than my colleagues on this this was created by the Congress and if we made mistakes and we gotten outside the lane we're going to get back inside the lane but the consequence is taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic so you keep up what you're doing and if you've gone outside the lane you fix it President Bush started at President Obama's continuing it we need it from my point of view now under the law of war there are three branches of government what branch of government is in charge of actually implementing and executing the war the executive branch so we don't have 535 commanders in chief we have one right that's true okay can you tell me any other time in any other war where our judiciary took over the decision of who to target who the enemy was and whether or not use lethal force from the executive branch I'm not aware of that we obviously operate within a league within legal parameters but within those legal parameters it is generally I will I will be astonished for America during this war to turn over from the commander-in-chief the ability to use lethal force to a bunch of unelected judges who have absolutely no expertise and no background as to who the enemy is and whether or not we should use lethal force I think the worst possible thing we could do is to take away from this commander in chief and any other commander chief the power to determine who the enemy is in a time of war and what kind of force to use and give it to a bunch of judges that would be the ultimate criminalization of the war I support you for having transparency and for making a hard call but you have from my point of view been more than reasonable when it comes to the drone program and to an American citizen if you side with the enemy and we go through a laborious process to determine if you have we will kill you or capture you the best way to avoid that is not help al Qaeda Anwar Awlaki was an American citizen in Yemen any doubt in your mind he was helping al Qaeda none and if you look at that letter that I sent we laid out exactly why I he was a target that he was an appropriate target and there are other American citizens we know who have associated with al-qaeda when terms of spokesman is that correct that is correct if we find him kill him or capturing don't go to the court and you don't need my permission to do it because it's your job it's the executive branch job finally you she asked a very good question would this administration use Guantanamo Bay in the future to housing law of war capture I think the president has been pretty clear it is not our intention to add any additional prisoners okay so it goes back to her question a jail can't be a ship under the Geneva Convention that is not a viable option so we're a nation without a jail and the reason we put the guy on the ship was got no place to put him and this is going to catch up with us mr. attorney general this nation has lost the ability to gather intelligence because we don't have a prison to put people and if we don't correct that we're going to lose valuable intelligence in this last question do you agree with me that the people we've had it get mo for years that the intelligence we've gathered humanely through the law for interrogation has made this country safer and was one of the big reasons we got bin Laden well I think that you know one of the reasons we got or one of the many reasons we got Osama bin Laden was the intelligence we gather from a variety of rajagiriya made that one of the treasure troves of intelligence regarding the war and war on terrorists come from people at Gitmo well at this point you have some people who have been there for ten and eleven years eight years and the very intelligence value is close to zero well some people may be but the war is changing what I'm trying to say is there's no doubt in my mind that we didn't torture our way to getting bin Laden we put the puzzle together and the big pieces of the puzzle where people where to get my last question sequestration what is it doing to your ability to protect us as a nation we are struggling really to keep our resources at a level where we can do our job since january of 2011 i put a a hiring freeze in place he lost 2,400 p we've lost about 600 prosecutors through the help of this when you say lost what does that mean did they quit not I don't mean to interrupt you sir but could you be clear what you invited people who have left the department of justice and who have not been replaced so we are a smaller Department of Justice than we were before I instituted the the hiring freeze if we do not get assistance in 2014 the furloughs that we were able to avoid because of your assistance your assistance of ranking member shellby those are furloughs that we would have to institute and you will have FBI agents were not on the streets prosecutors were not in the courts and you're going to see I guess would be that whoever the Attorney General is a year two years from now you're going to see reduced numbers with regard to prosecutions and I think that will be a function of this sequestration that we are trying to we're trying to deal with and we've tried to deal with again with with with your help I have such a great committee

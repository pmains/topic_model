Thank You mr. chairman beginning with I know general Dunford you're a you're a reader and going back to the to the Chairman's statements at the beginning of this hearing about the relationship between the military and civilian officials I commend to you although I suspect you have already read a dereliction of duty by your colleague general McMaster a stunning analysis of what not to do in terms of the relationship between civilian and military officials you nodded I assume that means you know the you know the book etc I have read it and I think an additional one I would add to your list it's a little bit longer Barbara took man's march of folly which takes us from Troy to Vietnam again talking about relationships and how these mistakes are made which brings me to Korea I have a queasy feeling that we're in 1914 stumbling towards Sarajevo and what worries me is not an instantaneous nuclear confrontation but an accidental escalation based upon the rhetoric that's going back and forth the Foreign Minister of North Korea yesterday characterized our president's comments as a declaration of war and he said therefore as a since the United States has declared war on our country we will have every right to make countermeasures including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not in the airspace border of our country that's what worries me is a misinterpretation misunderstanding and an event a shooting down of a bomber a strike on a on a ship that leads to a countermeasure that leads to a countermeasure and the end result is if King Kim June on heals his regime is under attack then the unthinkable happens make me even either feel better or worse about where we are at sooner I will make you feel better I can tell you that I personally the secretary defense in a mohair asst looking at all of our posture and in managing risk on a day to day basis informed by the need to avoid the risk of miscalculation the recent operations that we conducted I can assure you that even I was on the road we probably secretary math and I probably personally invested several hours each in in reviewing those to manage those and without going into classified information here to look at all of our capabilities look at all their capabilities look at timing look at the probabilities what worries me about is misunderstanding a misinterpretation what we view as an exercise they may view as an imminent threat senator what I guess what I'm suggesting to you is that where we conduct these exercises were informed by the North Korean posture at a given point in time or informed by the need to avoid miscalculation in an intervertebral we do not have military-to-military communications with North Korea right now turning the North Korea questioned slightly you testified earlier and all the intelligence community agrees that Kim jong-un's primary motivation is regime's survival therefore it seems to me that statements that suggest regime change or regime destruction only solidify his determination to develop and maintain nuclear weapons would you agree sir I have been very careful that at the military level to make no statements that would exacerbate the current crisis and and I certainly won't comment on things that are senior political leadership have said but I certainly can tell you inside the military we've made no statements when we've had a conscious decision not to make any such statements to ensure that the lead right now as Secretary Tillison in the message that being delivered is primarily being delivered by the State Department but you do agree that the primary motivation for the development of the nuclear weapons is a kind of insurance policy for regime survival is that not the case that'd be my assessment senator fine thank you what would be the practicality of a pre-emptive nuclear strike or pre-emptive military strike on North Korea in terms of the military effect would it there's some feeling I hear somebody talked about a preemptive strike the other day not in not in the administration but but on this in this body that would not be a short easy action would it not sir all right you bring up a good point and in part of the advice that I've provided the data is when we do something we shouldn't assume at that point that we can control escalation so we need to we need to think about this in terms of what might happen as well as what we would want to happen and part of the problem is those artillery that arranged across the North Korean border within the soul which is about as far as from here to Fairfax County that's right the greater Seoul area which has 25 million people 250,000 Americans on any given day it would be in Seoul would certainly be threatened by the rockets and the missiles along the border so a military there the idea of a so-called surgical strike to bring back a term from 40 years ago is really not valid in this situation it would it would not be this is not something that would be easy to take out for example the nuclear capability of the North Koreans no it's right saying I mean well we could do things that from our perspective it could be less than a full execution of an Operations plan we need to be informed by the potential risks to the greatest Seoul area no matter what we do on the peninsula I think that's fair Thank You general thank you mister
